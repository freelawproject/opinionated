At issue was ownership of a commodity created in this state for the electric power industry by the BPU: Renewable Energy Certificates (\u201cRECs\u201d). One Renewable Energy Certificate represents the environmental benefits or attributes of one megawatt-hour of generated renewable energy. In essence, renewable electric energy is energy derived, not from fossil fuels, but from, for example, the heat of the sun, or the movement of wind or water, or from the incineration of solid waste. Once issued, a Renewable Energy Certificate may be bought and sold in a public market or may be used by an electric utility to help satisfy its regulatory obligation to purchase increasing amounts of renewable energy each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The BPU decided to introduce the concept of Renewable Energy Certificates into New Jersey\u2019s electric power regulatory system to increase reliance on renewable energy in general, but its decision in this case was limited in scope: it only applies to ownership of these certificates for long-term contracts for the sale and purchase of renewable energy made before the BPU created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the certificates in this state. Those contracts did not anticipate and consequently do not mention the certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The BPU assigned initial ownership of the certificates in that limited contractual context to New Jersey\u2019s four electric utilities, the largest of which are respondents Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Company and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Company. Each contract is between an electric utility as a renewable energy purchaser and a company that produces renewable energy. Wheelabrator Falls, Inc., and the other appellants are all renewable energy producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Most electricity in New Jersey is produced by companies other than appellants and is purchased by the utilities in annual auctions conducted pursuant to regulations issued by the BPU. The BPU\u2019s decision in this case does not control ownership of the certificates in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The issue of initial ownership of Renewable Energy Certificates for existing contracts that did not anticipate their creation has arisen in at least nine other states. Each state has ruled as the BPU did here; namely, that as applied to existing contracts for the sale of power to utilities by renewable energy producers, the certificates are the property of the purchasing utility rather than the producer. Edward A. Holt et al., <em>Who Owns Renewable Energy Certificates? An Exploration of Policy Options and Practice, </em>at xiv (Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Appellants claim ownership of the Renewable Energy Certificates and argue that the BPU\u2019s decision violates a federal statute, a state statute, and is arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The Rate Counsel, Department of the Public Advocate, supports the BPU\u2019s decision as a fair resolution of the conflicting interests with the ultimate and just beneficiaries being the retail purchasers of electricity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In recent years, partially as a result of federal action, New Jersey, like other state governments, substantially altered the electric power industry by separating the production of electricity from its delivery at retail. The Legislature chose that course to reduce the cost of electricity and to increase the industry\u2019s use of renewable energy. The method chosen had two basic elements: creating a competitive market for the production of electricity and requiring the utilities to increase annually their purchases of renewable energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Before 1999, the electric utilities located in New Jersey were vertically-integrated monopolies, producing virtually all of the electricity they distributed, and charges for all services were \u201cbundled\u201d and billed at a single price. <em>In re PSE &amp; G Co. \u2019s Rate Unbundling, Stranded Costs and Restructuring Filings, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>65, 83, 748 A.2d 1161 (App.Div.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>377, 771 A.2d 1163 (2001), hereinafter referred to as <em>\u201cPSE &amp; G.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Change began in 1978, when Congress enacted the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, <em>Pub.L. No. </em>95-617, 92 <em>Stat. </em>3117 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 16 U.S.C.A.) (\u201cPURPA\u201d), to increase competition in the production of electricity and reliance on renewable energy. <em>FERC v. Mississippi, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>742, 745-46, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2126, 72 L.Ed.2d 532, 538 (1982). To that end, regulations issued pursuant to PURPA require electric utilities to purchase energy offered by \u201cQualified Facilities.\u201d 18 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 292.303(a)(2006). Both cogeneration and small power production facilities are considered Qualified Facilities under PURPA. 16 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 796(17), (18). \u201cA \u2018cogeneration facility\u2019 is one that produces both electric energy and steam or some other form of useful energy, such as heat.\u201d <em>FERC v. Mississippi, supra, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>at 750, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2132, 72 L.Ed.2d at 541 n. 11 (citing 16 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 796(18)(A)). \u201cA \u2018small power production facility\u2019 is one that has a production capacity of no more than 80 megawatts and uses biomass, waste, or renewable resources (such as wind, water, or solar energy) to produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>electric power.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing 16 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 796(17)(A)). Appellants are small power production facilities that process waste. Under PURPA, the rates for the electric power generated by the Qualified Facilities must be reasonable for the ultimate consumers, fair to the Qualified Facilities, but not in excess of what the utility\u2019s cost would otherwise have been if it generated the power itself or purchased it from another source. 18 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 292.304(a) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Between 1986 and 1992, the BPU, in accordance with the PURPA mandate, approved the long-term contracts at issue. Although the contracts were not included in the record, we were advised at argument that they will expire in about nine years. In each instance, the purchaser is one of the four utilities and the seller is a non-utility generator or \u201cNUG\u201d that produces renewable energy. All of the appellants are NUGs that produce renewable energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">These were not ordinary commercial agreements. The BPU\u2019s decision states that the rate of compensation it insisted on was higher than the market rate, \u201chighly favorable to\u201d these NUGs, and \u201ctook into account the environmental attributes of the power being sold____\u201d The decision also noted that these long-term contracts provided \u201cgreater revenues during the initial years\u201d to enhance the ability of these NUGs to get financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">In the period between 1985 and the late 1990s, \u201cNew Jersey consumers were paying about 50% above the national average for electricity.\u201d <em>PSE &amp; G, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 84, 748 A.2d 1161. Although there were other causes, one factor was the \u201cexpensive power purchase agreements with the nonutility generators (NUGs).\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">In 1999, the Legislature enacted the Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-49 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cEDECA\u201d), which established the framework for restructuring the electric power industry. The history leading up to enactment of this statute and a more detailed description of its provisions than is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>needed for this opinion is available in <em>PSE &amp; G, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 84-90, 748 A.2d 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The EDECA required the utilities to sell their power generation plants either to affiliates or entirely separate third parties and limited their function to the transmission and delivery of electricity at retail. <em>Id. </em>at 89-90, 748 A.2d 1161. Although customer billing would continue to be administered by the utilities, they had to \u201cunbundle\u201d their rates, separately identifying charges for generation, distribution, and transmission. <em>Id. </em>at 89, 748 A.2d 1161. And retail customers were to be given incentives to purchase renewable power. <em>Id. </em>at 89-90, 748 A.2d 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">One of the EDECA\u2019s critical provisions directed the BPU to adopt Renewable Portfolio Standards, which, in essence, required utilities to annually increase their reliance on renewable energy. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3 \u2014 87(d). The Legislature also instructed the BPU to create a \u201crenewable energy trading program\u201d to help the industry satisfy the requirement for increased use of renewable electric power. N.J.S.A 48:3-87(d)(2). The complex regulations implementing the statute are set forth in <em>N.J.AC. </em>14:8-1.1 to 14:8-2.12. Under those regulations, Renewable Energy Certificates can be used to assist in meeting the renewable energy requirements set forth in the Renewable Portfolio Standards. <em>N.J.AC. </em>14:8-2.8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We were advised at argument that Renewable Energy Certificates are now being issued and traded in New Jersey. They have substantial value. For example, at argument one of the appellant\u2019s attorneys represented, without contradiction, that if the BPU had assigned the certificates to the Qualified Facilities, his company\u2019s annual income would increase by over $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Appellants argue that the BPU decision violates section 210(e) of PURPA, 16 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 824a-3(e), by modifying their long-term contracts with the utilities. Respondents concede that the BPU may not modify contracts entered into pursuant to PURPA, as the court held in <em>Freehold Cogeneration Associates v. Board of Regu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>latory Commissioners of the State of New Jersey, </em>44 F.3d 1178 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>815, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>68, 133 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>29 (1995). But they assert that the <em>Freehold </em>case is distinguishable and that here no contract was modified. We agree with respondents on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In <em>Freehold, </em>which involved a long-term contract like those involved in this case, the BPU\u2019s predecessor directed the parties to re-negotiate a decrease in the charges allowed by the contract or to agree on a buy-out based on such a decrease. <em>Id. </em>at 1183. Plaintiff refused and sued in federal court, arguing that the state regulatory agency had exceeded its power. <em>Ibid. </em>As noted, the court agreed, holding that PURPA prevents a state from \u201creconsideration of its prior approval\u201d of a power purchase agreement involving a Qualified Facility. <em>Id. </em>at 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Appellants concede that the BPU\u2019s decision leaves untouched their income under the long-term contracts. Nonetheless, they claim that assignment of the certificates to the utilities is a contract modification because it adds value to the electric power the utilities are receiving. Of course, as respondents admit, the decision does increase the value of the electricity received by the utilities from appellants, but the increase results, not from modification of the contracts, but from a regulatory decision designed to meet the legislative goal of \u201credue[ing] the aggregate energy rates currently paid by all New Jersey consumers.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-50(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The record fully substantiates the BPU\u2019s assertion, which appellants do not deny, that when it approved the contracts at issue, the BPU required the utilities to pay and allowed appellants to receive substantially more than the mere value of the electricity, and that it did so specifically because the electricity was produced with renewable resources. Even though the appellants may have believed their contracts were only about providing electricity, clearly the BPU approved the contracts for the specific purpose of encouraging alternative energy development from renewable resources. And, as the BPU concluded, assignment of the Renewa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ble Energy Certificates to appellants necessarily would have meant that retail consumers would have had to pay more for electricity. This result would be unfair to retail consumers, who have already paid for appellants\u2019 electricity, and is entirely inconsistent with the governing state legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Appellants also contend that the BPU\u2019s decision conflicts with a ruling issued by the agency charged with administering PURPA, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d). But the FERC decision, <em>In re American Ref-Fuel Co., </em>105 <em>F.E.R.C. </em>\u00b6 61,004 (2003), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>107 <em>F.E.R.C. </em>1161,016 (2004), <em>petition for review dismissed sub nom. Xcel Energy Services, Inc. v. FERC, </em>407 F.3d 1242, 1244 (D.C.Cir.2005), clearly supports the- BPU by recognizing that Renewable Energy Certificates are state creations that exist entirely outside of PURPA. Thus, in paragraph 23 and 24 of its original decision, FERC concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">23. [Renewable Energy Certificates] RECs are relatively recent creations of the States. Seven States have adopted Renewable Portfolio Standards that use unbundled RECs. What is relevant here is that the RECs are created by the States. They exist outside the confines of PURPA. PURPA thus does not address the ownership of RECs. And the contracts for sales of QF [Qualified Facilities] capacity and energy, entered into pursuant to PURPA, likewise do not control the ownership of the RECs (absent an express provision in the contract). <em>States, in creating RECS, have the power to determine who owns the REC in the initial instance, and how they may be sold or traded it is not an issue controlled by PURPA</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\"><em>[In re American Ref-Fuel Co., supra, </em>105 <em>F.E.R.C. </em>\u00b661,004 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">24. We thus grant Petitioners\u2019 petition for a declaratory order, to the extent that they ask the Commission to declare that <em>contracts for the sale of QF capacity and energy entered into pursuant to PURPA do not convey RECs to the purchasing utility (absent an express provision in a contract to the </em>contrary). While a state may decide that a sale of power at wholesale automatically transfers ownership of the state-created RECS, that requirement must find its authority in state law, not PURPA</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\"><em>[Ibid </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Although the underlined language in paragraph 24 might be construed as helpful to appellants, the balance of that paragraph and the whole of paragraph 23 clearly support the BPU\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>In short, according to FERC, states decide who owns the REC in the initial instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Appellants next argue that the BPU\u2019s decision violates PURPA by discriminating against renewable energy Qualified Facilities in favor of cogeneration Qualified Facilities. PURPA does provide that electricity purchases \u201cshall not discriminate against qualifying cogenerators or qualifying small power producers.\u201d 16 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 824a-3(b)(2); see <em>also </em>18 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 292.304(a)(1) (2006). A eogenerator produces both electricity and valuable thermal energy, and can sell both separately, but that was so before the creation of Renewable Energy Certificates. Furthermore, a cogenerator does not receive the certificates under the BPU\u2019s program. Thus, there is no basis for appellants\u2019 claim that the program discriminates against them in favor of the cogenerators. If the certificates had never been created, the same dichotomy would exist as between cogenerators and renewable energy producers; namely, cogenerators would have the advantage of obtaining additional income from their thermal energy. Therefore, the BPU was not arbitrary in failing to decide that its program discriminates against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">We will touch briefly on the remaining arguments. Appellants contend that the BPU\u2019s decision violates the EDECA\u2019s direction that \u201c[njothing in this act shall be construed to alter [existing] non-utility generator power purchase contracts____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:3-61(k). We reject that argument for the same reasons we rejected the similar argument under PURPA. Although we agree with appellants\u2019 argument respecting the legal effect of certain affidavits they submitted annually in relation to their long-term contracts, our agreement with their argument does not affect the result. The BPU viewed the affidavits as conceding that the renewable attributes of appellants\u2019 electricity belonged to the utilities. But the affidavits do not say that, which is hardly surprising since Renewable Energy Certificates did not then exist. Although the finding is unsupportable, we will not discuss the issue since the BPU\u2019s decision is adequately based on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>considerations discussed above and further detailed in the decision itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Finally, we reject as without sufficient merit to warrant discussion, <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E), the argument of appellant Pollution Control Financing Authority of Camden County that the BPU\u2019s decision is unfair to it and to the taxpayers of New Jersey because Pollution Control\u2019s tipping fees have dropped substantially as a result of the federal court\u2019s decision in <em>Atlantic Coast Demolition &amp; Recycling, Inc. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, </em>112 F.3d 652 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, 522 U.S. </em>966, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>412, 139 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>316 (1997), <em>amended by </em>135 F.3d 891 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u201cThe Legislature has endowed the BPU with broad power to regulate public utilities ... [and] considerable discretion in exercising those powers.\u201d <em>In re Elizabethtown Water Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>440, 449, 527 A.2d 354 (1987). In reviewing the BPU\u2019s decision, our scope of review is quite limited, particularly in a ease such as this where the judgment exercised by the agency relies heavily on the agency\u2019s expertise. <em>In re PSE &amp; G Co.\u2019s Rate Unbundling, Stranded Cost and Restructuring Filings, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>377, 384, 771 A.2d 1163 (2001). The decision may \u201cnot be disturbed unless we find a lack of \u2018reasonable support in the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co., 85 N.J. </em>520, 527, 428 A.2d 498 (1981)(quoting <em>In re New Jersey Power &amp; Light Co., </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>498, 509, 89 A.2d 26 (1952)). In this case, the BPU exercised its judgment after a thorough discussion of the evidence and with careful consideration of appellants\u2019 arguments. Since the BPU\u2019s decision violates neither federal nor state law and is not arbitrary or capricious, we are required to uphold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-10\">This source is available at eetd.lbl.gov/ea/emp/reports/59965.pdf.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
