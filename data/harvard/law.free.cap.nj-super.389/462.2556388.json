Following receipt of this warning, defendants agreed to settle the case for a substantial amount of money. Shortly thereafter, defendants moved to vacate the settlement on the ground that their agreement had been coerced by the threat of criminal prosecution. Although the trial court expressed the opinion that its warning had enabled plaintiff to extract a settlement that exceeded what could have been obtained from a jury verdict, the court nevertheless ruled that defendants\u2019 agreement to the settlement had not been coerced. We conclude that the trial court erred in interrupting the primary defendant\u2019s cross-examination to warn him that continuation of his testimony could result in the court referring the matter to the appropriate prosecuting authority. We also conclude that the trial court took too restrictive a view of the issue of voluntariness in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>denying defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the settlement. Therefore, we reverse the denial and remand to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Defendant William Hecksteden was employed by plaintiff All Modes Transport as its chief operating officer under an employment contract that required him to devote his entire working time and best efforts to the performance of the duties of his employment. After Hecksteden resigned, All Modes brought this action alleging that Hecksteden during the course of his employment by All Modes had secretly formed and operated defendant Vendor Management Integrity (VMI), which conducted a business that competed with All Modes. All Modes asserted claims against Hecksteden for breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy. All Modes\u2019 complaint also named VMI and Hecksteden\u2019s wife Deborah, who allegedly participated with him in operating VMI, as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">At a settlement conference, All Modes\u2019 counsel advised the court and Hecksteden\u2019s counsel that he planned to cross-examine Hecksteden with documentary evidence that would show Hecksteden had claimed deductions on his tax returns for VMI business expenses that were identical to expenses for which he had received reimbursement from All Modes. All Modes\u2019 counsel showed Hecksteden\u2019s counsel the documents he planned to use in this cross-examination and told him \u201chis client was taking an enormous risk\u201d in failing to settle. However, no settlement was reached before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">After All Modes completed its case, Hecksteden testified for the defense. On cross-examination, All Modes\u2019 counsel began questioning Hecksteden about the expense vouchers he had submitted to All Modes and the expenses he had claimed as deductions on his tax returns in connection with VMI\u2019s business operations, to show that All Modes had reimbursed Hecksteden for the same expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Shortly after the beginning of this cross-examination, the trial court declared a recess and asked to see counsel in chambers. In a letter submitted to this court pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:5 \u2014 1(b), the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>court explained the reason for declaring this recess and what occurred in chambers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">At the beginning of the cross-examination of defendant William Hecksteden, the court noticed a stack of papers approximately 12 to 20 inches high on plaintiffs counsel table. In using the first one or two of those documents on cross-examination of defendant William Hecksteden, plaintiffs counsel made it apparent that Mr. Hecksteden had received reimbursement for approximately $1,800 worth of expenses from his employer and had deducted those same expenses on the tax return of his \"side company\u201d [VMI] as business expenses. Sensing that the remaining foot of documents related to further and similar transgressions, the court asked counsel to confer in chambers and gave the jury a break.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">In chambers, the court told counsel that it did not consider the testimony already rendered as substantial enough to warrant a <em>Sheridan[</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>letter. The court did indicate, however, that counsel should confer and that if the remaining documents and further testimony were to reveal similar, and more material transgressions, counsel should be aware that the court was going to write the Sheridan letter: if defendants\u2019 counsel was assured that further testimony would not so reveal, he could proceed on that basis. If, however, the former scenario was to be the operative scenario, the court suggested that counsel attempt to settle the matter, indicating to them that there was not a single doubt in the court\u2019s mind that a <em>Sheridan </em>letter would follow if material violations of federal or state tax law were testified to by Mr. Hecksteden. Plaintiffs counsel had in his briefcase a copy of the <em>Sheridan </em>case, which he gave to defense counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">The court told counsel to discuss the case for ten minutes and advise as to where they were heading. Counsel had been out of the courtroom for approximately 45 minutes, according to the bench report, when they informed chambers that they had settled the matter and they wished to put it on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The settlement agreed to during the recess required Hecksteden to pay All Modes $600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The trial court asked Hecksteden the standard set of questions regarding the voluntariness of his agreement to the settlement. The agreement was subsequently memorialized by a written stipulation of settlement signed by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Several weeks after execution of this stipulation, defendants filed a motion to vacate the settlement. In support of this motion, Hecksteden submitted a certification alleging that his counsel had reported during the in-chambers settlement conference that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Judge was concerned that if I proceeded with the trial she would be obligated to contact the federal authorities to investigate me,\u201d and that it was his \u201cunderstanding any such investigation could have criminal implications.\u201d Hecksteden also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">My attorney explained the Judge stated that \u201cIf I said three more sentences she would be obligated to contact the federal authorities!.]\u201d I was then placed in an untenable position where I could not explain how my accountant prepared my return and also could not defend myself without the Judge contacting the federal authorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Hecksteden further alleged that the court only granted a \u201cten minute recess to discuss possible settlement,\u201d and that he was not able to contact his accountant or a criminal attorney during this brief period to discuss the consequences of the court referring the matter for a tax fraud investigation. Hecksteden did speak to a tax attorney during the recess, who advised him that <em>\u201cif </em>there were irregularities ... there certainly could be civil and criminal implications.\u201d Based on these circumstances, Hecksteden claimed that he had agreed to the settlement \u201cunder extreme duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aj\">After Hecksteden failed to pay the $600,000 within the time provided under the stipulation, All Modes filed a cross-motion to enforce the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">At oral argument on the cross-motions, the trial court expressed the opinion that plaintiff \u201creally had the defendants over a barrel[,]\u201d after the court advised counsel that the continuation of Hecksteden\u2019s cross-examination might require the court to report evidence of income tax fraud to the appropriate authorities, and as a result, plaintiffs were able to \u201cextraet[ <em>] ... a </em>settlement that they never would have been able to get by means of a jury verdict.\u201d Nevertheless, the trial court concluded that defendants could not vacate the settlement on the ground that Hecksteden was coerced into the settlement by the threat of the court referring the matter for a tax fraud investigation. The court indicated that it would vacate the settlement only if Hecksteden could show that he did not enter into the settlement \u201cknowingly\u201d because he had misconceived the risk that he could be prosecuted for tax fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The trial court explained the rationale for this ruling in the letter submitted to this court pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:5 \u2014 1(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">[T]he court determined to give the defendants an opportunity to demonstrate that they had not entered into the settlement knowing and voluntarily because they had not had sufficient time to contact their tax accountant, who could have confirmed that they were without fault, an allegation made by the defendants on the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">... [I]n order for a contact with their tax accountant to have made any difference, the tax accountant would have had to certify that any expenses that had been reimbursed by the employer and deducted as expenses for the \u201cside company\u201d [VMI] were discounted off of the \u201cside company\u201d tax return in a subsequent IRS audit, because they had been listed erroneously. Were that to have been the case, defendants would not have committed tax fraud because reimbursed expenses would not, in the end, have been deducted knowingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Based on this view, the court scheduled a hearing to determine whether Hecksteden\u2019s agreement to enter into the settlement was \u201cunknowing\u201d and, therefore, \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Hecksteden and his wife Deborah testified at this hearing. However, they were unable to present testimony by their tax accountant to support Hecksteden\u2019s claim that he had not committed tax fraud. The trial court concluded that in the absence of such testimony, defendants were not entitled to an order vacating the settlement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">[T]he end result was that, had a new trial been granted, defendant Hecksteden\u2019s cross-examination would inevitably have revealed under oath the same tax problem that prompted the recess of the original trial. There was thus nothing that the tax accountant knew that Mr. Hecksteden did not know; and the settlement was entered into knowingly and voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">After the denial of defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the settlement, All Modes filed a motion for an award of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs that it had incurred in opposing the motion. The trial court concluded that \u201cthere was no reason in law or equity for [defendants\u2019] pursuit of the motion to vacate the settlement^]\u201d Accordingly, the court awarded All Modes $78,500 for the attorney\u2019s fees and costs it had incurred in opposing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">On appeal, defendants argue that the trial court erred in denying their motion to vacate the settlement. Defendants also argue that even if Hecksteden knowingly and voluntarily consented to the settlement, it is not binding upon his wife Deborah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>because she did not consent and Hecksteden did not have authority to agree to the settlement on her behalf. In addition, defendants argue that the court erred in awarding All Modes attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We conclude that the trial court erred in interrupting Hecksteden\u2019s cross-examination to warn him, through counsel, that the court would be compelled to refer the matter to the appropriate prosecuting authorities if the continuation of his cross-examination revealed substantial evidence of tax fraud and suggesting that the parties give further consideration to settlement. We also conclude that the court took too restrictive a view of the issue of voluntariness in ruling that defendants would be entitled to vacate the settlement only if they could show Hecksteden did not understand the facts relevant to his exposure to prosecution for tax fraud. Therefore, we reverse the denial of defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the settlement and remand to the trial court for reconsideration of the issue of voluntariness. This disposition makes it unnecessary to consider whether Hecksteden\u2019s consent to the settlement was binding upon his wife. We reverse the award of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs All Modes incurred in opposing defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">It is the public policy of this State to encourage the settlement of litigation. <em>Ziegelheim v. Apollo, 128 N.J. 250, 263, </em>607 A.2d 1298 (1992). Moreover, \u201c[c]ourts play an important role in effecting settlement.\u201d <em>Peskin v. Peskin, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 275, 638 A.2d 849 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>165, 644 A.2d 613 (1994). \u201cHowever, that role must always be exercised appropriately and with full recognition that the court must remain fair and impartial[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, \u201ccourts should never work to coerce or compel a litigant to make a settlement.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In particular, \u201c[c]ourts should not use the threat of sanctions to force the settlement of a case.\u201d Id. at 276, 638 A.2d 849. And \u201c[i]f a settlement agreement is achieved through coercion, ... undue pressure, or unseemly conduct,\u201d a court may set it aside. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The record does not indicate that the trial court\u2019s purpose in interrupting Hecksteden\u2019s cross-examination to warn him that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>his testimony revealed substantial evidence of tax fraud, the court would refer the matter to the appropriate prosecuting authorities, was to coerce him to settle the case. Instead, the court apparently conceived that it had an obligation to warn Hecksteden of the possible penal consequences of his anticipated testimony. However, even if the court\u2019s purpose in issuing this warning was to protect Hecksteden from self-incrimination, the determination whether the settlement was coerced does not turn on the court\u2019s purpose in issuing the warning but rather its effect on defendants\u2019 decision to enter into the settlement. <em>See id. </em>at 278, 638 A.2d 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s apparent view that it had an obligation to warn Hecksteden that continuation of his cross-examination could result in him incriminating himself was mistaken. A trial court has no obligation to warn even a potential witness who is not represented by counsel that his or her testimony may be self-incriminating. <em>See State v. Feaster, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>235, 250-52, 877 A.2d 229 (2005); <em>State v. Jamison, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>363, 374-77, 316 A.2d 439 (1974); <em>State v. Vassos, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>585, 588-94, 568 A.2d 583 (App.Div.1990). Instead, the proper judicial course \u201cordinarily will be to leave the matter of suspicion of criminality attendant upon the actions of the prospective witness ... for such attention <em>at the conclusion of the case </em>as [may be] warranted.\u201d <em>Feaster, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 252, 877 A.2d 229 (quoting <em>Jamison, supra, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 376, 316 A.2d 439).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In a criminal case, the court generally may assume that the prosecutor will undertake the responsibility of determining whether it is appropriate to initiate criminal proceedings against a witness. <em>See ibid. </em>In a civil case, however, the prosecutor is not a participant in the trial, and therefore, the trial court must undertake the responsibility of determining whether a witness\u2019s testimony should be referred to the appropriate prosecuting authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">It is even clearer in this case than in a case involving a non-party witness who is not represented by counsel that the trial court had no obligation to interrupt Hecksteden\u2019s cross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>tion to warn him that his testimony could be self-incriminating. Hecksteden was represented by counsel. It was the responsibility of Hecksteden\u2019s counsel, not the trial court, to advise Hecksteden concerning his legal rights and potential liabilities, including the possibility his testimony could be self-incriminating and that the court or another party would refer that testimony to the attention of the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Attorney. In fact, as the trial court was aware, Hecksteden\u2019s counsel had discussed the risk of such a referral with him before the trial began.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The trial court\u2019s error in interrupting Hecksteden\u2019s cross-examination to warn him that it could refer any self-incriminating testimony to the appropriate prosecuting authorities was compounded by the juxtaposition of this warning with the suggestion that the parties give further consideration to settlement. Whatever the court\u2019s purpose may have been in giving this warning, the court\u2019s statement that Hecksteden\u2019s testimony up to that point had not been \u201csubstantial enough\u201d to warrant a criminal referral but that the court would make such a referral if his \u201cfurther testimony were to reveal similar, and more material transgressions,\u201d had to have exerted substantial pressure upon Hecksteden to settle the case in order to avoid criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\"><em>Rule of Professional Conduct </em>3.4(g) provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not present, participate in presenting, or threaten to present criminal charges to obtain an improper advantage in a civil matter.\u201d Therefore, if All Modes\u2019 counsel had told defendants\u2019 counsel that he would refer Hecksteden\u2019s trial testimony to the appropriate prosecuting authority unless defendants acceded to All Modes\u2019 settlement demand, such a threat would have violated this Rule. Although the trial court\u2019s warning to Hecksteden did not violate any ethical rule, it gave All Modes the same opportunity \u201cto obtain an improper advantage in a civil matter\u201d from a \u201cthreatt ] to present criminal charges\u201d that it would have obtained if its own attorney had made the threat. In fact, such a threat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>may be even more coercive when the trial court is the source.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Although the trial court indicated that its warning to Hecksteden enabled All Modes to extract \u201ca settlement that [it] never would have been able to get by means of a jury verdict[,]\u201d the court concluded that this circumstance was not a sufficient ground for setting aside the settlement. Consequently, even though the court ordered a hearing on defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the settlement, it indicated that the only issue on which evidence could be presented was whether Hecksteden\u2019s tax accountant would have been able, if he had been available at the time of the settlement, to assure Hecksteden that the deductions on his tax returns were proper and therefore he would not be exposed to prosecution for tax fraud if the trial continued. In that event, in the court\u2019s view, Hecksteden\u2019s agreement to the settlement would not have been \u201cknowing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In thus limiting the evidence that could be presented in support of defendants\u2019 motion, the trial court took too restrictive a view of the issue of voluntariness. The issue before the court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>not whether Heeksteden was guilty of or faced a substantial risk of prosecution for tax fraud. Instead, the issue should have been whether Heeksteden entered into the settlement agreement under duress because he feared that a continuation of the trial would result in the trial court referring his testimony to the appropriate prosecuting authority. The court\u2019s apparent view that Hecksteden committed tax fraud did not provide a basis for rejecting his claim that his consent to the settlement was coerced. To the contrary, it is reasonable to conclude that the court\u2019s warning to Heeksteden would have been even more coercive if Heeksteden knew he was guilty of tax fraud. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 176 cmt. c (1981) (noting that \u201c[t]he guilt or innocence of the person whose prosecution is threatened is immaterial in determining whether the threat is improper, although it may be easier to show that the threat actually induced assent in the case of guilt\u201d). Therefore, the case must be remanded to the trial court to determine, based on a complete evidentiary record, whether defendants\u2019 consent to the settlement was coerced by the court\u2019s warning that continuation of Hecksteden\u2019s cross-examination could result in a referral to the appropriate prosecuting authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Because we reverse the order denying defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the settlement agreement, we also reverse the order awarding All Modes the attorney\u2019s fees and costs it incurred in opposing the motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the orders denying defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the settlement and awarding All Modes counsel fees and costs and remand to the trial court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-11\"> <em>Sheridan v. Sheridan, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 563-66, 589 A.2d 1067 (Ch.Div. 1990) (holding that judges have duty to report intentional misrepresentation of income to the appropriate authorities).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-6\"> We have no occasion in deciding this appeal to consider the circumstances under which a trial court should refer possible criminality revealed by trial testimony to the prosecutor. We only hold that a court has no obligation to interrupt a party's testimony to issue a warning that it may be self-incriminating and that a court should not inform a party that his or her testimony may be referred to the prosecutor if the case is not settled. We note, however, that advisory opinions issued by judicial ethics committees in other jurisdictions indicate that the determination whether to refer incriminating testimony to the prosecutor is committed to the trial court's sound discretion, which should be exercised in light of the nature of the alleged crime, the quality of the evidence and other relevant circumstances. <em>See, e.g., </em>Arizona Judicial Ethics Comm., Op. 15 (1992); Maryland Judicial Ethics Comm., Advisory Op. 07 (2004); New York Advisory Comm. on Judicial Ethics, Joint Op. 85, 103 (1988); <em>see generally, </em>Cynthia Gray, <em>A Judge's Obligation to Report Criminal Activity, </em>18 No. 3 <em>Jud.
