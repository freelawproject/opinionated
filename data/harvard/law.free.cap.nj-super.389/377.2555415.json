Specifically, we must decide whether a municipal zoning board of adjustment should apply the same standards of review for density variances, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d(5), as it does for use variances, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55d-70d(l); <em>Medici v. BPR Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>1, 526 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>109 (1987). Because we conclude the same review standards should not be employed, we reverse and remand this matter to the Rahway Board of Adjustment (the Board) for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Plaintiffs, William and Deborah Grubbs, own property located at 1709 Lawrence Street, in Rahway (the property). The property measures 90.5 feet by 152.07 feet and consists of 14,117 square feet. Pursuant to the Rahway Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance), it is located in an R-2 zone that permits single-family dwellings. Minimum lot sizes of fifty by one hundred feet and minimum area sizes of 5000 square feet are required in the R-2 zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Plaintiffs submitted an application for development, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-3, that sought permission to subdivide their single, existing conforming lot into three new non-conforming lots and to construct two new one-family homes on two of the new lots, maintaining the existing one-family home on the third. The application also sought variances from the zone\u2019s front yard setback, side yard setback, and parking requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Lenore Slothower,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rahway\u2019s Administrative Officer, deemed the application complete and determined plaintiffs required a density variance pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d(5). She referred the matter to the Board. A public hearing on the application was held on April 12,2005 and by a vote of three to three with one abstention, the Board denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">In a memorializing resolution approved May 23, the Board found the following facts and reached the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">FINDINGS OF FACT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">1. The Zoning Board of Adjustment has jurisdiction to act upon the Application, with a majority vote required for approval of all matters with the exception of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u201cuse\u201d variance under the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d for which five affirmative votes are required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">CONCLUSIONS AND DETERMINATIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">1. In order to obtain a use variance, an Applicant is required to prove the existence of \u201cspecial reasons\u201d for the variance, and those \u201cspecial reasons\u201d must be reasons which promote the general purposes of zoning as express in N.J.S.A 40:55D-2. <em>See Medici v. BPR Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>1 [526 A.2d 109] (1987). <em>For applications that do not inherently serve the public good, such as this application, an Applicant must demonstrate by credible evidence that special reasons exist because the proposed site is particularly suited for the proposed </em>use____Alternatively, an applicant may establish the existence of \u201cspecial reasons\u201d by demonstrating proof of undue hardship, that is, that the property at issue cannot reasonably be developed with a conforming use____In addition, an applicant for a use variance must satisfy the so-called negative criteria, that is an Applicant must establish that a grant of the variance would not impair the intent and purpose of the Zone Plan and Zoning Ordinances of the City. In a residential project such as the Applicant\u2019s proposed subdivision, the Applicant need not meet the enhanced quality of proof demanded of commercial uses by <em>Medici v. BPR Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>1 [526 A.2d 109] (1987).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-13\">2. The Applicant requires a use variance because the proposed development exceeds the density permitted in the zone. In the past, the Board has been asked to extend the more relaxed standards of review imposed in floor area ratio cases (see, e.g., <em>Coventry Square Inc. v. Westwood Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>285 [650 A.2d 340] (1994) and <em>Randolph Town Center v. Twp. Of Randolph, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412 [735 A.2d 1166] (App.Div.1999)) to \u201cdensity\u201d cases, and it has declined to do so. No reported case has extended the <em>Randolph </em>standard to a density ease, and it is not the Board\u2019s prerogative to extend the law, only to apply it. Thus, the appropriate standard of review is the non-commercial <em>Medici </em>standard articulated above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-14\">(emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">The balance of the Board\u2019s resolution adequately stated its conclusions with respect to the evidence presented at the hearing and its application of the above standards to that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-16\">Plaintiffs appealed to the Law Division. In a written opinion, the trial judge vacated the Board\u2019s denial of the application, concluded that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the matter, and remanded the application to the Rahway Planning Board. The judge reasoned that the Ordinance required minor subdivision approval when the application sought to create two lots; the creation of any greater number of lots required major subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>approval under the Ordinance. He noted that pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d(5), the Board had jurisdiction over any density variance except for \u201clots resulting from a minor subdivision.\u201d He acknowledged that this exception did not apply because the application sought major subdivision approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Nonetheless, he continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">[T]here is no logic for a municipality that wishes to control density to require that a use, or (d), variance is in order because a subdivision for three lots is involved, but not required to subdivide a lot into two lots, even though there would still be in either case an intensification of use or an increase in density of the pre-divided lot in question. Once a subdivision, whether major or minor, is involved in the development of the lot, the density of that lot becomes meaningless and the size rather than the density of the proposed lots becomes paramount. What is then regulated ... is the size of each of the proposed lots as related to ... numerous bulk requirements____[T]he intensity of the use of the subject lot, without the proposed subdivision, for two proposed one-family dwellings and one existing one-family dwelling, where presumably more people would reside and thereby intensify the use of the land, is not at issue____ \u201c[Djensity restrictions affect only the number of individual residential units that may be constructed on a tract of land.\u201d <em>Commercial Realty v. First Atlantic, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>546 [585 A.2d 928] (1991). Simply stated, a density or \u201cnumber\u201d of units per gross area issue is not relevant herein for either the whole lot or the three proposed lots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">The judge concluded that since the application implicated the review of bulk variances under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70c ancillary to the subdivision, the matter was appropriately under the Planning Board\u2019s jurisdiction. The Rahway Board of Adjustment now appeals that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">We begin our review of the trial court\u2019s decision by recognizing the standards that guide our consideration. \u201cWhen reviewing the decision of a trial court that has reviewed municipal action, we are bound by the same standards as was the trial court.\u201d <em>Fallone Prop. L.L.C. v. Bethlehem Twp. Plan. Bd., </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 561, 849 A.2d 1117 (App.Div.2004). Because of its \u201cpeculiar knowledge of local conditions,\u201d the Board\u2019s factual findings are entitled to substantial deference and are presumed to be valid. <em>Burbridge v. Mine Hill Twp., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>376, 385, 568 A.2d 527 (1990) (quoting <em>Medici, </em>supra 107 <em>N.J. </em>at 23, 526 A.2d 109); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>see also Kramer v. Bd. of Adjustment, Sea Girt, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>268, 296, 212 A.2d 153 (1965). The Board\u2019s conclusions of law are subject to de novo review. <em>Wyzykowski v. Rizas, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>509, 518, 626 A.2d 406 (1993); <em>Adams v. DelMonte, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>572, 583, 707 A.2d 1061 (App.Div.1998). However, \u201calthough we construe the governing ordinance de novo, we recognize the board\u2019s knowledge of local circumstances and accord deference to its interpretation.\u201d <em>Fallone Prop., supra, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 562, 849 A.2d 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-1 to \u2014 129, each municipality may define what constitutes a minor or major subdivision. \u201cThe statutory grant from the State of the municipal power to zone and to control the subdivision of property is now provided by the MLUL.\u201d <em>Pizzo Mantin Group v. Twp. of Randolph, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>216, 223, 645 A.2d 89 (1994). \u201c \u2018Minor subdivision\u2019 means a subdivision of land for the creation of a number of lots specifically permitted by ordinance as a minor subdivision----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-5. \u201cMajor\u201d subdivision \u201cmeans any subdivision not classified as a minor subdivision.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Initially, we note that the MLUL leaves to the municipality\u2019s discretion the decision of whether to allow for minor subdivisions at all. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-40a; <em>and see </em>Cox, <em>New Jersey Zoning and Land Use Administration </em>\u00a7 16-2.1 at 382 (2006). The MLUL permits each municipality to draw the line of demarcation that serves to define the two types of subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Thereafter, the MLUL establishes different procedures for approval of either a minor or major subdivision. It permits a municipality to adopt an ordinance that waives the requirements of notice and public hearing for minor subdivision applications. <em>See N.J.SA </em>40:55D-12a and 40:55D-47. Conversely, the MLUL dictates a more complicated review by the appropriate board for major subdivision approval, requiring notice and a public hearing, as well as a two-stage approval process. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-38 (mandatory requirements for subdivision ordinances); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-39 to \u2014 40 (discretionary contents for subdivision ordinances). Indeed, the entire legislative scheme permits a mu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>nicipality to expedite approval of applications for minor subdivisions. \u201c[M]inor subdivision approval creates a short cut. Thus, minor subdivisions can be dealt with quickly.\u201d Cox, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 16-2.1 at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In concluding that the Ordinance\u2019s definition of minor and major subdivision applications was not \u201clogical,\u201d the trial judge did not appropriately consider this legislative scheme. Although plaintiffs\u2019 application exceeded the limit for a minor subdivision by only one lot, Rahway\u2019s exercise of discretion in determining the definitional line between major and minor subdivisions was appropriate under the express provisions of the MLUL.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">However, it was the trial judge\u2019s decision that the application did not require a density variance at all that led to his vacation of the Board\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 request. \u201cDensity\u201d is defined by the MLUL as \u201cthe permitted number of dwelling units per gross area of land to be developed.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-4. The board of adjustment has sole jurisdiction over applications that seek a variance from a zone\u2019s density restrictions. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70; <em>see also Commercial Realty v. First Atlantic, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>546, 562, 585 A.2d 928 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d, a board of adjustment may,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">[G]rant a variance to allow departure from regulations ... to permit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">(1) a use or principal structure in a district restricted against such use or principal structure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">(5) an increase in the permitted density as defined in [N.J.S.A 40:55D-4], except as applied to the required lot area for a lot or lots for detached one or two dwelling unit buildings, which ... lot or lots resulting from a minor subdivision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">Since plaintiffs\u2019 application created lots that were not the result of a minor subdivision, this exception to the Board\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over density variances did not apply. Nonetheless, the trial judge reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-12\">It cannot be overemphasized that there is no request by the plaintiffs to have three dwelling units on its [sic] 14,117 square foot property, but to have one dwelling unit on each of the three proposed lots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>However, from our review of the record, we conclude that the application indeed sought the placement of three dwelling units on the 14,117 square feet of plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The MLUL defines an \u201capplication for development\u201d as \u201cthe application form and all accompanying documents required by ordinance for approval of a subdivision plat, site plan ... [or] zoning variance.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-3. Plaintiffs\u2019 application sought subdivision and variance approvals that affected all of the property because, at the least, all three proposed lots were nonconforming and the location of the planned structures required other dimensional variances.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The Ordinance did not adopt a specific definition of density per unit of land to be developed. However, by implication, Rahway determined that each single-family unit required 5000 square feet of area. It is not impermissible for a municipality to define its density restrictions in this indirect fashion. <em>See, </em>Cox, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7-7.2 at 216. The interrelationship between permitted minimum lot size and density requirements may be illustrated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">[W]here the minimum lot area in a single family residential district is fixed at one-half acre, the density cumulative is thus two dwelling units per acre. An application for a major subdivision which would result in construction of more than two dwelling units per acre would require an application to the zoning board of adjustment [for a density variance]. If the lots in a proposed subdivision all meet the minimum lot sizes required by the ordinance, the \u201cdensity\u201d is consistent with the minimum lot size requirements and therefore no density variance is required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeg\"><em>[Id. </em>at 215.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\"><em>See also Green Meadows v. Plan. Bd. of Montville, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 24, 746 A.2d 1009 (App.Div.2000) (where the applicable zoning ordinance deals with density by prescribing lot sizes, a density variance is not required if all of the proposed lots exceed the applicable minimum lot size).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Applying these standards to the facts before us, we conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 application required a density variance pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d(5). The application sought development of a tract of land that was approximately 14,117 square feet, and, pursuant to the Ordinance, the permitted density for such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>area was approximately 2.8 dwelling units, not three as proposed. A density variance was necessary because under the Ordinance, the \u201cgross area of land to be developed\u201d did not permit \u201cthe number of dwelling units\u201d plaintiffs sought to construct on that land. Under the MLUL, the Board had sole jurisdiction over the application. This requires reversal of the trial judge\u2019s order referring the application to the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">We nevertheless are compelled to remand the matter to the Board because we believe it applied the wrong standards of review in denying plaintiffs\u2019 application. In its resolution of denial, the Board cited the holdings in <em>Coventry Square, Inc. v. Westwood Bd. of Adjustment, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>285, 650 A.2d 340 (1994) and <em>Randolph Town Ctr. Assocs., L.P. v. Twp. of Randolph, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 735 A.2d 1166 (App.Div.1999), characterizing both as providing for \u201cmore relaxed standards of review\u201d of variance requests in floor area ratio (FAR) cases. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d(4). However, the Board declined to extend these \u201crelaxed standards\u201d to the review of plaintiffs\u2019 density variance request.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">In <em>Coventry Square, </em>supra, 138 <em>N.J. </em>at 287, 650 A.2d 340, the Court considered the appropriate standard of review of a request for a conditional use variance pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d(3). Because a conditional use by definition is not a prohibited use in the zone, the Court concluded \u201cthe stringent special reasons standards for a commercial-use variance ... summarized in <em>Medici </em>\u201d did not apply. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">In <em>Medici, </em>the Court established the appropriate standard of review for a commercial use variance request made pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d(l). <em>Medici, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 3-4, 526 A.2d 109. In granting such an application, the zoning board of adjustment must find</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">that the use promotes the general welfare because the proposed site is particularly suitable for the proposed use ... that the grant of a use variance is not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the master plan and zoning ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>... [and that] the variance \u201cwill not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 4, 526 A.2d 109 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-70d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The Court further required that these criteria must be proven by \u201can enhanced quality of proof.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">In <em>Coventry Square, </em>however, the Court determined that the \u201conerous\u201d burden of proof required to support a use variance was not required to support a variance from conditions imposed upon a permitted conditional use. <em>Coventry Square, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 298, 650 A.2d 340. The Court explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">In the case of prohibited uses, the high standard of proof required to establish special reasons for a use variance is necessary to vindicate the municipality\u2019s determination that the use ordinarily should not be allowed in the zoning district. In the case of conditional uses, the underlying municipal decision is quite different. The municipality has determined that the use is allowable in the zoning district but has imposed conditions that must be satisfied ... [A] conditional-use applicant\u2019s inability to comply with some of the ordinance\u2019s conditions need not materially affect the appropriateness of the site for the conditional use. Accordingly, the standard of proof of special reasons to support a variance from one or more conditions imposed on a conditional use should be relevant to the nature of the deviation from the ordinance____The use-variance proofs attempt to justify the board of adjustment\u2019s grant of permission for a use that the municipality has prohibited. Proofs to support a conditional-use variance need only justify the municipality\u2019s continued permission for a use notwithstanding a deviation from one or more conditions of the ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 297-98, 650 A.2d 340.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">In a more general sense, the standards of review for any particular variance application must reflect \u201ccriteria that are appropriate for the specific types of variances\u201d sought. <em>Id. </em>at 298, 650 A.2d 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">In <em>Randolph Town Ctr., supra, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 416, 735 A.2d 1166, we extended <em>Coventry Square\u2019s </em>reasoning to consideration of the appropriate standards of review for a FAR variance application. <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-70d(4). We noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-15\">Because a(d)4 FAB variance also deals with uses that are permitted in the zone and thus is different from variances for excluded uses, we hold pursuant to <em>Coventry Square </em>that an applicant for a FAB (d)(4) variance need not show that the site is particularly suited for more intensive development. To impose such a stringent burden would mean that a FAB variance applicant would have perhaps as difficult a burden to meet as an applicant for a prohibited use variance. To require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>such a burden would be inconsistent with the principle that variances for permitted uses need not meet the \u201cstringent special reasons standards for a commercial-use variance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 416-17, 735 A.2d 1166 (quoting <em>Coventry Square, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 287, 650 A.2d 340).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We concluded that a successful applicant for a FAR variance would still have to demonstrate: \u201cspecial reasons\u201d for the grant of the variance, the so-called \u201cpositive criteria\u201d of N.J.S.A 40:55D-70d, and, that the variance would not cause \u201csubstantial detriment to the public good and [would] not substantially impair the intent and the purpose of the zone plan and the zoning ordinance,\u201d the so-called \u201cnegative criteria\u201d of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 415-16, 735 A.2d 1166. However, the successful applicant need only show that the \u201csite will accommodate the problems associated with a proposed use with larger floor area than permitted by the ordinance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 735 A.2d 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Similarly, in <em>Grasso v. Borough of Spring Lake, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 866 A.2d 988 (App.Div.2004), we extended <em>Coventry Square\u2019s </em>less stringent review standards to consideration of applications for height variances. <em>N.J.SA </em>40:55D-70d(6). Once again, we reiterated that the standard of review of the applicant\u2019s \u201cspecial reasons\u201d for a variance depends on the type of variance at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 866 A.2d 988. \u201c[S]pecial reasons necessary to establish a height variance must be tailored to the purpose for imposing height restrictions in the zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 866 A.2d 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">We now hold that <em>Coventry Square </em>relaxed standard of review should be applied to variance applications seeking deviations from the density requirements in a particular zone. <em>N.J.S A </em>40:55D-70d(5). Density variances for permitted uses in the zone should not trigger the application of <em>Medici\u2019s </em>more stringent standard for the same reasons expressed in <em>Coventry Square. </em>A density variance seeks a departure from certain regulations applicable to a use the municipality has chosen to permit, not prohibit, in the zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Such requests need not demonstrate that the property is \u201cparticularly suitable to more intensive development\u201d in order to prove \u201cspecial reasons\u201d under the MLUL. <em>Randolph Town Ctr., supra, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 416, 735 A.2d 1166. Rather, in considering such applications, zoning boards of adjustment should focus their attention on whether the applicant\u2019s proofs demonstrate \u201cthat the site will accommodate the problems associated with a proposed use with [a greater density] than permitted by the ordinance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 735 A.2d 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Since special reasons supporting a particular variance request \u201cmust be tailored\u201d to the purpose served by the restriction in the ordinance, <em>Grasso, supra, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 52, 866 A.2d 988, we examine the purpose of restricting density in a particular zone. The MLUL explicitly recognizes the regulation of the density of development as a general purpose of zoning that contributes to \u201cthe well-being of persons, neighborhoods, communities and regions and preservation of the environment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2(e). Density restrictions, in the residential context, and FAR restrictions, in the commercial setting, both serve to limit the intensity of the use of the land to be developed. <em>Commercial Realty, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>at 561, 585 A.2d 928; <em>see also </em>Cox, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7-7.2 at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Special reasons are those that promote the purposes of zoning as set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2. <em>Burbridge, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 386-87, 568 A.2d 527; <em>Medici, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 10, 18, 526 A.2d 109. Though not expressly stated in the MLUL, the preservation of the character of a neighborhood or property values in that neighborhood have also been recognized as legitimate purposes of zoning. <em>Home Builders League of S. Jersey, Inc. v. Twp. of Berlin, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>127, 145, 405 A.2d 381 (1979). A successful applicant for a density variance therefore must show that despite the proposed increase in density above the zone\u2019s restrictions, and, thus, the increased intensity in the use of the site, the project nonetheless served one or more of the purposes of zoning and was consistent with the overall goals of the MLUL.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>For example, it might be shown that the project promoted a more desirable visual environment through development of otherwise underdeveloped or vacant property, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2(i); <em>see also Burbridge, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 387-88, 568 A.2d 527 (aesthetic improvement may support special reasons for variance in expansion of an existing non-conforming use), or, a successful applicant might demonstrate that the project\u2019s construction with the requested density variance better promotes the character of the neighborhood or better preserves property values in the adjacent community.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Likewise, in addressing the so-called negative criteria, the applicant would need to demonstrate that the increase in density would not have a more detrimental affect on the neighborhood than construction of the project in a manner consistent with the zone\u2019s restrictions. For example, the applicant might demonstrate that the increased proposed density was only minimally greater than the permitted density in the zone or in adjacent areas. <em>Randolph Town Ctr., supra, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 418, 735 A.2d 1166. The applicant might show that it was unlikely that a minimal increase in density would create a \u201csubstantial detriment\u201d to nearby properties. <em>Yahnel v. Bd. of Adjustment of Jamesburg, </em>79 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 519, 192 A.2d 177 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>116, 195 A.2d 15 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Our discussion of how an applicant might sufficiently demonstrate the positive and negative criteria in a density variance application is purely illustrative. We do not mean to imply that in any particular situation, satisfactory proof of such matters should compel the zoning board of adjustment\u2019s approval of the requested variance. We respect the proper use of the authorized discretion accorded to any board to consider the proofs in any particular matter that comes before it. <em>Kramer, supra, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>at 296, 212 A.2d 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Applying the above standards to the facts here, we conclude that this matter must be remanded to the Board. Neither party supplied us with the record of the testimony and evidence present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>ed before the Board. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether plaintiffs produced sufficient proof to justify the grant of a density variance under the standards we have now enunciated, and, in any event, the decision should initially be made by the Board. In light of the contents of the Board\u2019s resolution, we must conclude that the Board applied the more restrictive <em>Medici </em>standards to its consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 request. Upon remand, the Board should allow plaintiffs to supplement the record to address any relevant factors. Likewise, the Board is permitted to consider any other evidence from its professional staff or objectors in adopting its findings of fact and conclusions of law as appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Reversed and remanded to the Board. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-13\"> Slothower was named as a defendant in plaintiff\u2019s prerogative writ complaint filed in the Law Division.
