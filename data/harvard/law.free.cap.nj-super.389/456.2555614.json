He contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">[a]n interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A, </em>[43:15A-61] that a!low[s] for the exclusion of veterans who have otherwise attained the age of 60 and 20 years of aggregate service, from receiving the increased benefit allowance under the statute [because they were not in service at the time of retirement], denies those veterans[ ] due process and equal protection under the laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">We reject these contentions and affirm the final administrative determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">The material facts are not in dispute. As a result, we incorporate, for purposes of this opinion, the Statement of Facts embodied in appellant\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">Robert McKenzie was enrolled in the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (\u201cPERS\u201d) as a result of his employment with the Newark Public Schools on January 1, 1991. On March 24, 2003, Mr. McKenzie filed an application for a deferred retirement. The \u201cPERS\u201d Board approved Robert McKenzie\u2019s Deferral Retirement on March 16,2005, with an effective date of May 1, 2005, which was the first of the month following his sixtieth birthday. Mr. McKenzie [had] separated from service with the Newark Public School System on January 19, 2001 [effective January 31, 2001].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">On July 12, 2002, Robert McKenzie provided an application to the Division of Pension and Benefits to purchase service credit [for \u2018Various periods of military, out-of-state and federal government service rendered prior to his enrollment in the PERS\u201d]. On November 8, 2002, Mr. McKenzie requested an extension to purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>[the] service credit. The extension was approved on March 24, 2005, which was one month hefore his sixtieth birthday. Mr. McKenzie appeared at the Division of Pensions and Benefits and was advised by a counselor in client services that he did not meet the requirements for a Veteran\u2019s Retirement. On April 25, 2005, David Pointer, Chief of the Retirement Bureau, informed Mr. McKenzie that at the time he terminated employment, he did not meet the age and service requirements to be eligible for a Veteran\u2019s retirement status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The parties agreed at argument before us that the novel question involved on this appeal is whether an employee who is granted a deferred retirement (because he performed the requisite service or could purchase prior service credits before reaching retirement age) can receive veterans\u2019 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-61 provides a \u201crule of 80\u201d based on an aggregate of age and service. Appellant would have had sufficient service credits to satisfy the twenty-year service requirement upon purchase of the prior service credits by the time he reached age sixty.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>43:15A-61 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">b. Any public employee veteran member <em>in office, position or employment </em>of this State or a county, municipality, public agency, school district or board of education and who (1) shall have attained 60 years of age and who has 20 years of aggregate service credit in such office, position or employment, or (2) shall have attained 55 years of age and who has 25 years of aggregate service credit in such office, position or employment, shall have the privilege of retiring for service and receiving, instead of the retirement allowance provided under section 48 of this act <em>[N.J.S.A </em>43:15A-48], a retirement allowance of 54.5% of the compensation for which contributions are made during the 12-month period of membership providing the largest possible benefit to the member or the member\u2019s beneficiary. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Relying on <em>Kramer v. Bd. of </em>Trs., <em>P.E.R.S., </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. 46, 676 </em>A.2d 1117 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>458, 690 A.2d 606 (1997), appellant claims the statute should be interpreted to relate only to the time required for the \u201caggregate[d] service and <em>not </em>[as] a requirement that triggers the qualifications under the statute to receive the benefits[] only when the member is working in public service at the time of retirement.\u201d <em>Kramer </em>dealt with a question of aggregation and concerned whether credits could be aggregated upon re-entry of service following retirement to achieve the required twenty years of service under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>section 61(b). We required strict compliance with \u201cthe very specific and express terms\u201d of the statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-57.2, which did not permit aggregation of benefits \u201conce the service is broken by an intervening retirement.\u201d <em>Kramer, supra, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 53, 676 A.2d 1117; <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-57.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u201cThe legislative purpose\u201d behind <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-61(b) is \u201cto reward those whose military commitments substantially interfered with their civilian lives[,]\u201d and the statute should be \u201cliberally construed to effectuate [its] beneficent purpose.\u201d <em>Kramer, supra, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 52, 676 A.2d 1117. However, \u201c[w]hile pension statutes \u2018should be liberally construed ... in favor of ... persons intended to be benefit[ ]ed thereby,\u2019 <em>Getter v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury of N.J., </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>591, 597[-98] (1969), such construction \u2018should not obscure or override considerations of ... a potential adverse impact on the financial integrity of the [f]und.\u2019 <em>Chaleff v. Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund Trustees, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>194, 197, 457 A.2d 33 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>573, 468 A.2d 215 (1983).\u201d <em>Kramer, supra, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 54, 676 A.2d 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">PERS has consistently determined that a pensioner must be in active service at the time he or she satisfies the age and service requirements in order to receive veterans\u2019 benefits. <em>See Gerber v. Bd. of Trs., P.E.R.S., </em>93 N.J.A.R.2d (Vol. 7) 135 (Div. of Pensions); <em>see also </em>1964-78 <em>Ops. of the Att\u2019y Gen. of N.J. </em>116, 122 (Formal Op.l966-No. 2) (requiring a veteran member of PERS to \u201cbe in compensated active \u2018office, position or employment\u2019 upon attainment [of requisite age and service] to qualify for the special veterans\u2019 half pay retirement allowance ...\u201d under the statute as it then read).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Presumably, the Legislature became aware of the consistent and uniform interpretation of the Executive Branch on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Although an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administers is not binding upon us, the agency\u2019s interpretation is entitled to \u201csubstantial deference\u201d \u201cprovided it is not plainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Merin v. Maglaki, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>430, 436-37, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992). This is particularly true where the Legislature is aware of the interpretation but has not endeavored to change or override it. <em>Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of Trs., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>55, 70, 389 A.2d 465 (1978) (\u201cwhere an agency has based its statutory interpretation on an opinion by the Attorney General, ... a court should attach weight to the Attorney General\u2019s opinion\u201d); <em>see also Garfield Trust Co. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>420, 430-31, 508 A.2d 1104 (1986); <em>Body-Rite Repair Co. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>540, 545-46, 446 A.2d 515 (1982). In any event, despite other amendments to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-61, the Legislature has taken no action to modify the longstanding interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-61(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In essence, we find no support for the view that an employee can work for half the years of service required for pension eligibility and leave government service before retirement eligibility, but nevertheless obtain a pension with a veterans\u2019 preference as a result of his purchasing service credits after severance. Rather, the employee must remain actively engaged in his or her \u201coffice, position or employment\u201d until he or she attains the age and service requirements in order to qualify for veterans\u2019 benefits upon retirement. So viewed, there can be no constitutional deprivation. <em>See, e.g., N.J. State Bar Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>24, 40-45, 902 A.2d 944 (2006), <em>certif. denied, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>491, 909 A.2d 726 (2006); A.A. <em>v. State, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>481, 494-500, 895 A.2d 453 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>346, 907 A.2d 1007 (2006); <em>Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v.
