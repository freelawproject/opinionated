The decision reversed the findings and conclusions of the Administrative Law Judge and denied Medicaid Only benefits to a nursing home patient, I.L., on the ground that her countable assets exceeded the allowable maximum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At issue is the period June 1, 2002 through December 31,2004. There is no dispute that I.L. was ineligible prior to June 1, 2002 and eligible as of January 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The question presented by this appeal is whether an individual is eligible for the Medicaid Only program when she was the legal owner of life insurance whose value ordinarily would have disqualified her for a brief period, but because she suffered from dementia and likely from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and because no guardian had power over her assets, the cash value of the policies was not accessible to her. As of June 1, 2002, I.L. owned three life insurance policies having a total cash surrender value of $5,913. To be eligible for the Medicaid Only program, an applicant may not own total countable resources that exceed $2,000. <em>See N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.4(b)3. The issue is whether petitioner\u2019s medical condition rendered these assets \u201cnot accessible\u201d under <em>N.JAC. </em>10:71-4.4(b)(6), thereby excluding the cash value of the life insurance policies from petitioner\u2019s countable resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We now hold that the cash value of I.L.\u2019s insurance policies was not accessible to her on June 1, 2002, and contrary to the determination of the Division, she was eligible for benefits as of that date. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">These are the salient facts and the relevant procedural history gleaned from the record on appeal. Three separate applications for Medicaid Only benefits were filed on behalf of I.L. between 2001 and 2004. Each application was rejected by the Atlantic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>County Board of Social Services.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s daughter, G.A.T., filed the first application on her behalf in August 2001; the Board denied that application in October 2001 for failure to provide required documentation, including proof of I.L.\u2019s financial circumstances. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10:4.2(b) and (c). Petitioner\u2019s granddaughter, K.T., filed the second application on her behalf in May 2002. The Board did not act upon that application for more than a year, until June 2003, when it again denied petitioner\u2019s application for failure to provide required documentation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The third and final application on I.L.\u2019s behalf was filed with the Board in June 2004. That application was filed by Absecon Manor Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, where petitioner had resided since June 2002. The Board denied the third application in August 2004 on the ground that I.L. owned \u201ccountable resources\u201d in excess of $2,000, thereby rendering her ineligible for the Medicaid Only program. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.5(c). The countable resources cited by the Board were three life insurance policies with a combined cash value of $5,913.34.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Appeals from the Board\u2019s decisions on both the second and third applications were filed with the Division. The appeals were referred to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) as contested cases and consolidated in September 2004. The consolidated appeals were heard in the OAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">These are the relevant facts that were before the administrative law judge. On May 2, 2002, I.L. was found on the floor of her apartment in a confused state and admitted to the Atlantic City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Medical Center. I.L. was eighty-five years old in May 2002 and suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease with severe dementia; she had a history of hypertension and had previously suffered a stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">After several weeks in the hospital, I.L.\u2019s granddaughter sought to have her moved to a nursing home. On May 7, 2002, the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services approved I.L.\u2019s placement in a nursing facility, under a pre-admission screening program. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-17.10 to -17.15. The approval was contingent upon a determination that I.L. was eligible for Medicaid benefits. On May 17, I.L.\u2019s granddaughter filed an application with the Board to enroll I.L. in the Medicaid Only program, and on May 28, 2002, her granddaughter completed an application for residence with Absecon Manor on her grandmother\u2019s behalf. Three days later, on May 31, petitioner was admitted to Absecon Manor.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">After I.L.\u2019s admission, it appears that LL.\u2019s daughter and granddaughter abandoned her to the care of the nursing home. They did not cooperate in dealing with the Board or with Absecon Manor. After learning that the Board had denied I.L.\u2019s application for Medicaid benefits for failure to provide documentation, Absecon Manor began compiling the required documentation of I.L.\u2019s financial resources and discovered that she owned two bank certificates of deposit before her admission to Absecon Manor. The record clearly establishes that I.L.\u2019s daughter and granddaughter withdrew the entire balance in each certificate, more than $37,000, and closed the accounts before her May 2002 hospitalization.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Apparently as a result of I.L.\u2019s ownership of those accounts and the transfers without consideration within the thirty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>six month \u201clook back\u201d period, see <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.10, I.L. was determined to be ineligible for Medicaid benefits through May 31, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Having compiled the necessary documentation, Absecon Manor filed I.L.\u2019s third application with the Board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Absecon Manor reported that I.L. still owned three life insurance policies, with cash surrender values of $2,821, $997, and $2,095, respectively, or a total of $5,913.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board, citing the $5,913.34 total value of those life insurance policies, concluded that I.L. was ineligible for the Medicaid Only program. <em>See also N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.5(c). As of October 7, 2004, Absecon Manor had not been reimbursed for over $100,000 allegedly spent to provide services to I.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Administrative Law Judge Bruce M. Gorman heard arguments and issued an Initial Decision concluding that petitioner\u2019s insurance policies were not countable assets for purposes of determining her Medicaid eligibility. The decision reversed the Board\u2019s denial of benefits for the contested period.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">We agree with the administrative law judge\u2019s conclusions with respect to the second and third applications. Addressing the denial of the second application (for failure to supply required documentations), the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">Three factors caused the delay in producing the requested information. First, petitioner\u2019s mental condition rendered her incapable of assisting the process. Second, her immediate family failed to cooperate. Indeed, the immediate family had no reason to cooperate and every reason not to cooperate, given that the daughter and granddaughter had gained financially from the transfer of assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>within the look-back period, and given that Absecon Manor was providing care for the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">With respect to the third application, the judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">I must agree with petitioner\u2019s analysis. Based upon petitioner\u2019s mental incapacity together with the refusal of her family to cooperate, I FIND and CONCLUDE that the three insurance policies are not accessible to petitioner through no fault of her own. Accordingly, I further FIND and CONCLUDE that the said insurance policies do not constitute countable assets for purposes of determining Medicaid eligibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">This holding does not mean that the three insurance policies should pass on to petitioner\u2019s heirs. Once a Law Guardian is appointed by the Superior Court, that guardian must pursue the surrender of the cash value of the insurance policies, and those monies must be paid over to respondent as reimbursement. But the mere existence of those policies, not accessible to petitioner under the facts of this case, should not defer her Medicaid eligibility. That eligibility commenced June 1, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">After May 31, 2002, petitioner was without means. Absecon Manor provided services to petitioner subsequent to that date. There is no logical reason, nor is there any reason in law why Absecon Manor should not be permitted to recoup those monies. The inability of petitioner to provide proper identifying documentation at the time or to surrender her insurance policies is wholly understandable, given her dementia. Absecon Manor is to be complimented, not penalized, for taking her in and then expending the effort to locate petitioner\u2019s assets, and finally to pursue an appropriate legal guardian for her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">For all the reasons set forth above, I FIND and CONCLUDE that petitioner\u2019s assets fell below the mandated $2000 level on June 1, 2002. Consequently, I further FIND and CONCLUDE that petitioner\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid began on June 1,2002, and the determinations of respondent must be REVERSED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">The Director reversed the Initial Decision, inferring that the nursing home was the real party in interest and that the administrative law judge improperly applied the doctrine of equitable estoppel to hold the Board responsible for the apparent advice of I.L.\u2019s case worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">In rejecting the judge\u2019s conclusions, the Director gave this explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">The Initial Decision found that three insurance policies were not available through no fault of Petitioner and are not countable assets. Moreover the decision states \u201cthere is no logical reason, nor is there any reason in law why Absecon Manor should not be permitted to recoup those monies [spent on I.L.\u2019s care].\u201d However there is a long established principle in law that prevents I.L. from establishing the eligibility necessary to allow Absecon to bill for its services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-13\">In essence, the Initial Decision is applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the State without discussing the legal theory and standards behind the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>doctrine. Significantly, the courts in New Jersey have rarely applied the doctrine of estoppel to governmental entities absent a finding of malice, <em>Cipriano v. Department of Civil Serv., </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>86, 91, 376 A.2d 571 (App.Div.1977), particularly when estoppel would \u201cinterfere with essential governmental functions.\u201d <em>Vogt v. Borough of Belmar, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>195, 205,101 A.2d 849 (1954).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">[(Alteration in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We agree that the doctrine of equitable estoppel is disfavored against a public entity, <em>e.g., County of Morris v. Fauver, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>80, 104, 707 A.2d 958 (1998), and does not apply here. But we find no basis for the Director\u2019s inference that the judge\u2019s ruling was based on an application of equitable estoppel against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">As we said, Absecon Manor filed the third application on petitioner\u2019s behalf in June 2004. Shortly after that application was denied, on September 20, 2004, the nursing home filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking the appointment of a legal guardian for petitioner. After finding that I.L. was \u201can incapacitated person as a result of unsoundness of mind and is incapable of governing her affairs,\u201d the court on November 19, 2004, appointed the Public Guardian as legal guardian for I.L. pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12-25. Not surprisingly, the Public Guardian quickly spent down the value of petitioner\u2019s life insurance policies. The Division\u2019s own regulations recognize that \u201c[a]s of November 2003, the average cost [of nursing home services in New Jersey] is $6,050.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.10(m)l. As a result of the Guardian\u2019s spend down, the Board found petitioner \u201celigible to receive Medicaid benefits retroactively to January 1,2005.\u201d The Board rejected her 2002 application on the basis of treating the insurance policies as a countable resource. It did not announce or communicate that rejection until June 2003.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">We turn now to legal analysis of the Director\u2019s determination that I.L. was ineligible for benefits on June 1, 2002 and continuing through December 31, 2004, solely on account of her ownership of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>those insurance policies with a cash value above the permissible $2,000 cap by some $3,913 ($5,913 less $2,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.1 provides the \u201cresources criteria and eligibility standards\u201d for Medicaid applicants. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71.4.1(a). \u201c[A] resource shall be defined as any real or personal property which is owned by the applicant ... and which could be converted to cash to be used for his/her support and maintenance.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.1(b). \u201c[N]onliquid resources shall be considered in the determination of eligibility, <em>unless such resources are specifically excluded under ... N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.4(b).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(Emphasis added.) Moreover, \u201c[i]n order to be considered in the determination of eligibility, a resource must be \u2018available.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.1(e). Availability exists when, among other conditions not relevant here, \u201c[t]he person has the right, authority, or power to liquidate ... <em>property----\"N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.1(c)l.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">There is no dispute that I.L. owned the policies in issue, that they had cash value, and that they were available in the sense that I.L. had the right to liquidate those policies. Moreover, <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.2(a) provides that \u201c[a]ny resource which is not specifically excludable under the provisions of <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.4 shall be considered a countable resource for the purpose of determining Medicaid Only eligibility.\u201d Contrariwise, \u201c[a] resource which is classified as excludable shall not be considered ... in the determination of eligibility for participation in the Medicaid Only Program.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.4(a). If a resource is expressly \u201cexcludable\u201d under <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.4, then it is not \u201ccountable\u201d under Section 4.2, irrespective of Section 4.1. The determinative issue then, under both <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.1 and -4.2, is whether I.L.\u2019s insurance policies were excludable under <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.4(b) lists ten categories of excludable resources. The categories potentially relevant to I.L.\u2019s applications are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">4. The cash surrender value of all life insurance policies owned and in the control of the individual, if the total face value of such policies does not exceed $1,500 ... [but] [i]f the total face value of such policies exceeds $1,500, the total cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>surrender value of all policies shall be included as a resource, countable toward the appropriate resource maximum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">6. <em>The value of resources which are not accessible to an individual through no fault of his or her own.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The cash value of I.L.\u2019s life insurance policies exceeded $1,500 as of June 1, 2002, thus exclusion 4 does not apply. Exclusion 6 is the disputed and potentially available exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">I.L. argues, and the administrative law judge found, that the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies was \u201cnot accessible [to her] through no fault of ... her own,\u201d because she was not capable of handling her financial affairs at any relevant time and no guardian had yet been sought or appointed for her or her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">The brief filed on behalf of I.L. includes this succinct statement of her argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">The term \u201caccessible\u201d is not defined by the Medicaid regulations. However, the common meaning of \u201caccessible\u201d is \u201ceasily approached or entered ... [e]asily obtained.\u201d [<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] Thus, when the Medicaid regulations are read as a whole, the calculation of resources used to determine eligibility <em>(countable </em>resources under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.2) is the total resources over which the applicant has the right, authority, or power to liquidate <em>(available </em>resources as defined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.1(e)) excluding any resources which are not easily obtained <em>(not accessible </em>resources as set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.4(b)6). [Internal citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">The Verified Complaint for Guardianship, certified by the Administrator of Absecon Manor in September 2004, included these statements of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">4. [I.L.] has one daughter, [G.A.T.], Upon information and belief, [GA.T.] is domiciled in the Commonwealth of Virginia and her address is unknown to the Facility.

[I.L.] has no other known living next of kin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">10. Due to [I.L.\u2019s] incapacity, she is unable to liquidate her alleged resources in order to pay the Facility and reduce the value to a level in which she would quality for Medicaid benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">11. The Facility\u2019s interest in this action is that [I.L.] currently resides at and is under the care of the Facility. Due to [I.L.\u2019s] inability to manage her own affairs, and the complete lack of cooperation of [I.L.\u2019s] daughter or granddaughter in providing for [I.L.\u2019s] care at the Facility, [I.L.] is unable to make any health care decisions concerning her care, including providing her specific consent for any treatment which may need to be provided by the Facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The scope of our review of an agency decision, whether viewed as an adjudicative action or the interpretation and application of a statute or regulation, is limited. A presumption of validity generally is accorded to the agency\u2019s decision, which will be sustained unless it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable [or] ... \u2018clearly inconsistent with its statutory mission or with other State policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brady v.

Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>321, 327, 878 A.2d 16 (App.Div.) (\u201cAn agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d) (quoting <em>DiMaria v. Bd. of Trustees of the Pub. Employees Ret. Sys., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 351, 542 A.2d 498 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>N.J. </em>638, 552 A.2d 164 (1988)), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>393, 886 A.2d 663 (2005). Here, however, we find the agency\u2019s interpretation and application of its own regulation to be plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We are sensitive to the Legislature\u2019s intent, stated in the New Jersey Medical Assistance and Health Services Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-1 to -19.5, as amended, \u201cto provide medical assistance, insofar as practicable, on behalf of persons whose resources are ... [inadequate]\u201d as well as to ensure that all available federal funds are obtained for that purpose and that Medicaid benefits \u201cshall be the last resource benefits.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-2. Nonetheless, we do not read the Director\u2019s decision to be compelled or even consistent with that balanced intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">As the Division states in its brief, with respect to the life insurance policies, \u201cuntil these resources were spent below the applicable Medicaid eligibility limit, here $2,000, [I.L.] was not eligible for benefits.\u201d It is clear to us that if the policies\u2019 cash values had been \u201caccessible\u201d to I.L. (either directly or through an appointed guardian) her $3,913 excess of resources over the $2,000 limit, would have been spent down on her behalf within a very short time.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We emphasize the obvious fact that the required spend down would have occurred if <em>anyone </em>had had <em>access </em>to that resource as of June 1, 2002, since I.L.\u2019s nursing home stay obviously had a substantial cost. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.10(m)l. When the Public Guardian finally was appointed to oversee I.L.\u2019s person and property, that resource was quickly spent down.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Under the circumstances, I.L. was eligible for benefits on June 1, 2002 because the resource upon which the Division based its denial of eligibility was inaccessible to her and therefore excludable. It was arbitrary and unreasonable, and contrary to the underlying purpose of the Medicaid program providing benefits to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>cover skilled nursing home care for needy individuals, for the Board and then the Division to deny benefits to I.L. When her relatives failed to move for authority to access the policies in 2002, while the second application was before the Board, and when no one else with authority to do so moved either to access the policies or to have a guardian appointed for LL.\u2019s person and property, the Board at the very least could have acted on the application in a timely fashion, putting the nursing home on notice of the need to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In any event, once the facts were before the Division, it should have been apparent that LL.\u2019s circumstances required recognition that the cash values of her life insurance, while theoretically accessible to I.L. through an appointed guardian, were not in fact accessible until the guardian\u2019s appointment, a circumstance that existed \u201cthrough no fault of her own.\u201d <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.4(b)6.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The matter is remanded to the Division to calculate the benefits that should have been available to I.L. or for her care, as of June 1, 2002, and to consider Absecon Manor\u2019s entitlement to reimbursement for her care under the applicable guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\"> \"Medicaid Only\" appears to be the term applied to the program for needy persons who qualify only for medical benefits, but not other benefits, such as income maintenance or food stamps.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\"> <em>NJ.A.C. </em>10:71-1.5 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">The Medicaid Only program is administered by the county boards of social services (CBOSS) of the State of New Jersey through the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services in the Department of Human Services.

A \"closing withdrawal\u201d of $15,666.99, the balance of a second certificate of deposit held jointly in the names of I.L. and her daughter, was made on April 30, 2002. The record does not disclose whether any action has been taken to recover those funds, but the Division does not contend that I.L.\u2019s eligibility after June 1, 2002 is affected thereby.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\"><em>NJ.A.C. </em>10:71-2.5(c)4 permits an application to be made on behalf of an individual who is a resident of a skilled nursing facility by a designated staff member of the facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b389-13\"> The Initial Decision and the parties' briefs erroneously state that the cash surrender values of the policies were approximately $3,077, $1,162, and $2,435.
