(Father), and A.H. (Mother), separately appeal the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate their parental rights to their three children: \u201cKathy\u201d, born April 7, 1999, \u201cHarry\u201d, bom July 3, 2001, and \u201cJames\u201d, born June 15, 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By so doing, the court granted guardianship of the children to the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS or Division). These appeals have been consolidated for the purpose of addressing the issues raised therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">Both parents argue that the Division did not prove each of the four statutory elements of <em>N.J.SA </em>30:4C-15.1a by clear and convincing evidence. F.H. also argues that the Division failed to appropriately consider: (1) placing the children with his brother as an alternative to termination; (2) that the termination of Muslim parents\u2019 parental rights, followed by a Christian adoption, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>undermines the children\u2019s cultural and religious heritage; and (3) that the trial court failed to make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law under <em>R. </em>l:7-4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We granted defendants\u2019 motion for a limited remand to permit: (1) the presentation of additional evidence dealing with the availability of kinship placement as an alternative to termination; and (2) to permit the parents to present expert testimony with respect to Harry\u2019s alleged medical disorder. The record before us now contains the evidence presented to the trial court after remand, as well as the court\u2019s findings and determinations after considering this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">After carefully reviewing the entire record, we are satisfied that the Division presented sufficient evidence that the middle child, Harry, suffered serious injuries while in his parents\u2019 custody, thus creating legal grounds to warrant the termination of parental rights with respect to this child. Although the trial court\u2019s factual findings did not adequately articulate how the abuse suffered by this child was causally linked to the acts or omissions of his parents, there is nevertheless strong circumstantial evidence supporting such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">The record also shows that the evidence alleging abuse of the eldest child, Kathy, is, in and of itself, legally insufficient to warrant the termination of parental rights with respect to this child. Finally, with respect to the youngest child, James, DYFS failed to present any direct evidence that he was abused or neglected by his parents, or that, based on the abuse suffered by his siblings, there is an unacceptably high risk that he would be abused or neglected if he is returned to his parents\u2019 custody. The two memoranda of opinion issued by the trial court here did not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Under these circumstances, we affirm the Judgment of Guardianship entered by the court with respect to Harry. We vacate the Judgment of Guardianship with respect to Kathy and James. We further remand these two consolidated eases for the Family Part to conduct a permanency hearing and determine the individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>alized services this family needs to insure the safety and well-being of these two children. To achieve this goal, DYFS must design a web of services that includes: (1) close monitoring and supervision, to fulfill its paramount responsibility of protecting these children from harm; and (2) emotional and therapeutic support, to provide these parents with the skills needed to successfully parent, and to insure the physical and emotional well-being of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">If these measures prove to be ineffectual, DYFS may re-file its Guardianship Petition as to Kathy and James. At this juncture, the trial court must find sufficient evidence causally linking any incidents of abuse or neglect to specific acts or omissions committed by a particular parent. In order to sustain a judgment terminating a defendant\u2019s parental rights with respect to children who have not been the direct recipient of abuse or neglect, the trial court must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that DYFS has demonstrated that the parent\u2019s failure to adequately respond to and/or prevent the abuse endured by one child, exposes any similarly situated sibling to a high probability of being abused or neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">With these legal principles as our guide, we will now address the facts developed from the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">\n<em>First Referral of Abuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">According to Supervisor Dolores Cunneely, the family\u2019s first encounter with DYFS occurred on December 22, 2001. On this date, DYFS received a referral from Englewood Hospital alleging acts of neglect involving the middle child, Harry. Hospital records show that F.H. brought five-and-a-half month old Harry to the emergency room to be treated for a number of bruises. X-rays revealed a fractured elbow and an old fractured tibia.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">F.H. testified that he told the hospital staff that, three days earlier, Harry\u2019s two-and-a-half-year-old sister Kathy had tried to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>pull the boy out of an indoor infant swing. The swing fell on top of Kathy, with Harry still strapped in the chair. F.H. did not recall whether Harry\u2019s arm was behind him or in front of him when he picked him up. Hospital records corroborated F.H.\u2019s testimony in this respect. A.H. testified consistent with her husband\u2019s account of the event, adding only that Kathy had pulled Harry\u2019s arm because she was jealous and wanted to get in the swing. A.H. did not have any knowledge about any other fractures. In fact, according to A.H., Harry had not been involved in any other falls prior to this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">At this time, a hospital staff physician advised DYFS that Harry may be suffering from a medical condition known as Poland Sequence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If in fact Harry was afflicted with this physical disorder, he may not have been producing enough calcium for his bones. Harry\u2019s pediatrician confirmed this preliminary diagnosis. In this light, DYFS listed the case as \u201cunsubstantiated for abuse,\u201d and Harry was discharged to his home a few days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">\n<em>Second Referral of Abuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Approximately five weeks later, DYFS received a second referral from Hackensack University Medical Center. This time, Harry was brought into the hospital with facial bruising. A skeletal survey showed multiple fractures in different stages of healing. F.H. testified that he took Harry to the hospital because the child: (1) was not eating and appeared dehydrated; (2) had bruises on his face; and (8) had a cut under his lip. F.H. did not know that Harry had suffered multiple fractures of both arms and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>one leg. He was also unaware of what caused the facial bruises or the lip cut. With respect to this incident, A.H. testified that she did not know what caused the fractures. She had not detected any physical change in Harry between the two hospitalizations. It was her practice to always call the doctor when she saw something \u201cdifferent with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">According to DYFS Supervisor Cunneely, the parents had no explanation for the fractures. Despite this disturbing absence of any plausible explanation, the Division again concluded that the allegations of abuse were unsubstantiated, because the child\u2019s medical condition was still under review. On January 30, 2002, Dr. Cheryl Kurer indicated that Harry had normal heart function. A report from the geneticist Dr. Robert Wallerstein issued the following day, concluded there was no evidence of \u201costeoporosis or Wormian bones that would offer an explanation for the fractures.\u201d Harry was discharged from the hospital and returned to his parents\u2019 custody on February 8,2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Both parents declined the Division\u2019s offer to provide homemaker services, stating that the maternal grandmother was coming from Egypt to assist A.H. with the care of the children. Despite this initial disinterest from the parents, DYFS assisted the family in obtaining Medicaid benefits, and continued to monitor the situation until May 2002, when the grandmother arrived. In the absence of medical information concretely establishing the occurrence of an incident of abuse or neglect, DYFS closed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In January 2002, F.H. worked five days per week in two family-owned businesses. His work schedule consisted of seventeen-hour shifts on two of the five days, and ten-hour shifts on the other three days. In July 2002, F.H. was incarcerated for federal tax evasion, leaving A.H. as the primary caretaker for the three children. A.H. did not work outside the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">\n<em>Third Referral of Abuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The Division received a third referral, from the Palisades Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>eral Hospital, on December 4, 2002.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This time Harry was diagnosed with a severe hip fracture. A.H. brought him to the hospital. She explained that around eleven o\u2019clock that evening the boiler providing heat for the apartment had stopped working. The electric heaters she used had short-circuited the house\u2019s electrical system, and all of the children had gone to one room to cluster around the portable heaters. As the only adult present, A.H. said she was scared and confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">At one point, she went to the basement to check on the power. When she returned \u201cmaybe eight minutes\u201d later, one-and-a-half-year-old Harry was crying. He had fallen approximately two feet from the bed to the carpeted floor. When she asked Kathy what had happened, the child explained that she had been jumping on the bed and either fell on Harry, or the boy fell off the bed onto the floor. At this stage of his development, Harry could crawl and pull himself up, but could not yet walk on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">When A.H. checked Harry, she \u201csaw some bruises, some redness around his legs,\u201d but did not detect any other injuries, including fractures. In fact, she thought he was fine because he had stopped crying and went to sleep. As she prepared to bathe Harry the next morning, however, A.H. noticed he was standing \u201ccrooked,\u201d and immediately called for an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">On a \u201cconsultation sheet\u201d dated December 5, 2002, Dr. Waller-stein noted that the Poland Sequence diagnosis \u201cdoes NOT explain fractures or increased tendency to bone fragility\u201d but the \u201cassessment was incomplete\u201d because there was no information about \u201cdevelopmental/neuromotor status.\u201d This consultation sheet also reflects that Dr. Wallerstein was \u201csuspicious of an underlying genetic etiology but [he] had no documentation of a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>syndrome.\u201d A skeletal survey dated December 5, 2002, indicated that Harry\u2019s bones were \u201cnormally mineralized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">On December 11, 2002, the Division obtained legal and physical custody of the three children, and placed them in a foster home on the following day. The Division requested two consultations on the case \u2014 one from a DYFS nurse and another from the Audrey Hepburn Children\u2019s House. DYFS also referred AH. for a psychological evaluation. By this time, F.H. was incarcerated, and the maternal grandmother was not yet residing with A.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">\n<em>Abuse Substantiated</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">In a March 31, 2003, report entitled \u201ctherapy referral,\u201d the Division, for the first time, noted that neglect (with respect to Harry) had been substantiated, because the parents had not provided a reasonable explanation for the multiple fractures suffered by the child between December 22, 2001, and December 4, 2002. In June 2003, the Division received additional genetics test results from Dr. Wallerstein, who concluded that \u201cthere was no specific [medical] explanation for bone fragility.\u201d In this same report, Dr. Wallerstein noted that the skin biopsy test that had \u201cnormal\u201d results was <em>\u201c85% </em>accurate in ruling out osteogenesis imperfecta.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">As the mother of the children and the only adult available at the time of the removal, DYFS offered A.H. weekly supervised visitation \u2014 first from the Children\u2019s House and then from the International Institute. She was provided with twelve therapy sessions with Dr. Lafontant from the International Institute, and with parent education classes with the Red Cross. The record does not reflect whether AH. requested that DYFS provide her and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>children culturally sensitive services. The record is equally silent on whether, if requested, DYFS was able to provide culturally sensitive services such as therapists or psychologists knowledgeable about Muslim childrearing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">DYFS initially classified Harry as \u201cmedically fragile,\u201d placing him in a second foster home that specialized in medically fragile children. Harry remained injury-free from December 12, 2002, when he was placed in the first foster home, to March 26, 2003, when he was placed in the specialized foster home. In September 2003, Harry was again moved to a different specialized foster home when the earlier foster family relocated out of state.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Although he continued to have developmental delays, Harry did not have any behavioral problems in foster care. He did have an unusual reaction to bathing. The first foster mother reported to DYFS that Harry \u201cscreamed bloody murder if he had to get in the bathtub.\u201d A subsequent foster mother also reported that Harry hated to take a bath and \u201cscreams when taken into the bathroom.\u201d By contrast, A.H. denied having had any problems with Harry in the bathtub.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In June 2003, Kathy, who Cunneely described as a \u201cvery active\u201d and \u201csometimes aggressive\u201d child, was referred for assessment by the Institute for Child Development to the Therapeutic Learning Center, which works with children that have behavioral problems. After four therapy sessions with A.H., the International Institute issued a letter dated July 2, 2003, indicating that she did not pose a risk to the children. Because this letter did not address or explain Harry\u2019s injuries, DYFS requested a second risk-assessment report. By letter dated August 11, 2003, the International Institute reiterated its earlier assessment, this time describing the topics covered in therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Based in part on this evidence, the Division began developing a reunification plan for A.H. Although during that time F.H. was still incarcerated, he participated in court proceedings by phone. A.H. continued therapy for the twelve sessions offered by DYFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">\n<em>Evidence Involving Kathy and James</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Kathy and James were returned to A.H.\u2019s custody and care on September 22, 2003. By this time, the family was in financial crisis. On or about October 8, 2003, A.H. notified DYFS that she had moved to an apartment across the street from her previous residence, after losing her home to foreclosure. The new apartment was sparsely furnished; most of the furniture was in storage. The Division reviewed and approved this living arrangement, and Harry began to have weekend visitation with mother and siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The Division\u2019s plan to reunite Harry with his family proved to be short lived. On December 31, 2003, DYFS received a referral from the therapeutic learning center reporting that Kathy had injuries or small bruises. According to Kathy, her maternal grandmother had pinched her about a week or two weeks earlier; and her mother had also hit her.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">DYFS caseworker Melena Anderson went to the school to investigate. Anderson noticed a bloody scratch on Kathy\u2019s ear, a scratch on her left hand, and a small bruise on her upper arm. Kathy told Anderson that her grandmother had pinched her, scratched her and punched her arm because she had not listened to her mother. The school advised Anderson that that they had made two other referrals to DYFS earlier that month that had not been addressed. Thus, there were three incident reports in total.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The first incident allegedly occurred on December 12, 2003. Kathy told school staff that her grandmother had squeezed her inner thighs. The staff also noticed a bruise on the child\u2019s upper lip. The second incident was noted a week later, on December 19, 2003. On this date, Kathy reported that her mother was mad at her, spanked her, pinched her, and forced her to stand against a wall with her hands held up above her head. The school nurse noticed a small bruise. Finally, on December 31, 2003, Kathy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>reported that her grandmother had pinched and punched her. No physical evidence was noticed to corroborate this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">According to caseworker Anderson, both Kathy and James were \u201cdressed inappropriately, in terms of the number of layers of clothes.\u201d Although it was December and the school was \u201ccomfortable,\u201d Kathy was wearing four shirts, one sweater and two pairs of pants. She said that her mother would get mad if she took the layers off, and was not allowed to do so even if she was uncomfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Anderson visited A.H. and the maternal grandmother that same day. The interview was conducted in English. A.H. translated for her mother. Although Anderson spoke to A.H. directly, without the assistance of an interpreter, she \u201cnever got the sense [they] were misunderstanding each other.\u201d A.H. reported that Kathy had not had any marks or bruises when she left the house. A.H. called Kathy a liar \u201cmany times,\u201d and denied that she or her mother had hurt Kathy in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">As part of her Referral Response Report dated January 2, 2004, Anderson noted that \u201c[t]he Director of the school, Cindy Hick, indicated that [Kathy] has made stories up before. [A.H.] had called the school recently stating that [Kathy] reported that a teacher at the school had hit and pushed [Kathy] but that this did not happen as corroborated by the school staff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Conversely, A.H. testified that from the start of their conversation, Anderson\u2019s tone with her was stern and accusatorial. A.H. testified that she got Kathy ready for school that morning while her mother slept. Kathy was not bleeding when she left the house, and \u201chad no problems whatsoever\u201d when she took her to the bus that morning. Kathy had come home from school with bruises on prior occasions, and had reported that other kids on the bus would hit her and take her food. A.H. testified that she had called the school and even spoke to the bus driver, without results.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Kathy came home from school while Anderson was talking to A.H. According to Anderson, the child appeared \u201cvery timid and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>nervous,\u201d and kept looking fearfully at her grandmother until Anderson asked the grandmother to leave the room. At Anderson\u2019s request, Kathy told A.H. about the marks, and about what her grandmother had done. A.H.\u2019s response was both guarded and skeptical. She twice asked Kathy whether she was sure that it was not done by another child at school, to which Kathy responded: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">At trial, A.H. admitted that Kathy had told her that the grandmother had caused the scratches and bruises. She denied calling Kathy a liar, however, claiming that she had simply characterized the \u201cconversation\u201d as a lie. Because she believed her daughter, A.H. asked her mother to leave in July 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">During the interview, A.H. told Anderson that another caseworker and case aide had inappropriately touched Kathy between her legs. Although the incident had allegedly occurred two weeks earlier, A.H. had not reported it because she did not think anyone would believe her. She also wanted to wait for her husband to come home. In response, DYFS supervisor Cunneely testified that she did not have direct knowledge of the resolution of the allegations, but understood that the charges were not substantiated. Neither parent addressed those allegations during their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">As part of the investigation, Anderson spoke privately with Kathy about the molestation allegations. Using a doll, Anderson asked Kathy whether anyone had ever touched her in the breast or \u201ccrotch area.\u201d Kathy pointed to her inner thighs, and said her grandmother had touched her there. In response, DYFS decided not to permit any contact between Kathy and the grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Not fully satisfied with this arrangement, Anderson unsuccessfully attempted to get a homemaker to start immediately. Without the presence of a third-party, DYFS decided to remove <em>all of </em>the children from their home. Understandably, A.H. became very upset and continued to call Kathy a liar. She spoke to Kathy in Arabic, causing the child to tell Anderson \u201csomething\u201d about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>prior caseworker. A.H. continued to talk to Kathy in Arabic until Anderson asked her to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Once the children were in the car, Anderson asked Kathy if the caseworker had ever touched her. Kathy responded by pointing to her chest and the inside of her thighs. Anderson asked if he ever touched her under her clothes or hurt her. Kathy said: \u201cNo.\u201d In fact, Kathy said that the caseworker had been nice to her. When asked where the aide had touched her, Kathy pointed to the top of her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">By way of a potentially innocuous explanation, Anderson testified that the car seats used to transport Kathy had a strap across the chest, and a strap between the legs. This may account for the alleged improper touching. DYFS eventually concluded that no improper touching involving its employees had occurred. Kathy and James were thus removed from their mother\u2019s care and placed in a foster home together.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">After a permanency hearing pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.54b(2), the case was transferred to the Adoption Resource Center (ARC) on March 19, 2004, with the goal of terminating defendants\u2019 parental rights. When asked why the Division changed its goal from reunification to termination of parental rights, Supervisor Cunneely explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">After the second removal of the two children and [Harry] not having been reunified the case was assessed at that point in time, given the history in combination with everything else, and the second removal and still no \u2014 no taking of responsibility or explanation for the things, the Division presented that plan in the permanency hearing which was accepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">By that time, F.H. was living in a halfway house in Newark as part of a work-release program. He had not had any contacts with the children since his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">\n<em>Services Provided By DYFS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">On August 26, 2004, DYFS adoption worker Danielle Piotrowsky was assigned to be the family\u2019s caseworker in the ARC. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>continued in that capacity up until the time of the trial. At the time the case was transferred to the ARC, A.H. was attending parenting classes. A.H. participated in counseling, had supervised visitation with the children, and was subjected to bonding and psychological evaluations. Piotrowsky testified that A.H. had attended all the parenting classes and counseling sessions as requested by the Division. Despite her cooperation, A.H.\u2019s therapist was nevertheless concerned about her refusal to discuss the maternal grandmother. She also did not take responsibility for Harry\u2019s injuries and apparent abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The record shows that the supervised visitation program was changed several times in response to a series of events mostly involving F.H. First, there was a \u201cverbal altercation\u201d between F.H. and the foster mother. As a result, the foster mother felt threatened and did not want to transport Harry to the visits. Second, F.H. became \u201cirate\u201d and \u201cwas disrespectful\u201d to DYFS representatives when Harry was on vacation with his foster mother, and unable to attend one of the visits. The DYFS driver also objected to transporting F.H., claiming that he improperly \u201cinterrogated\u201d the children about the foster home during the transport. Finally, F.H. became angry when the children were brought to the visits late.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">According to Piotrowsky, the Adoption House had concerns about the parents\u2019 ability to control the children and found their parenting and disciplinary methods wanting. There were specific concerns about A.H. being too passive and not setting limits with the children. By the time the trial began, the Adoption House was no longer responsible for the supervised visitations. The staff felt intimidated by F.H. Reports of the visits documented that F.H. had a pattern of being \u201cbullying, demanding,\u201d and intimidating if things did not go his way. A.H. was characterized as \u201cextremely passive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">On November 18, 2004, Harry was moved for a fourth time since being placed in the Division\u2019s custody. Having been declassified from his medically fragile status, Harry was placed in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>regular foster home. At the time of the trial, he was still experiencing developmental delays and had special behavioral and emotional needs. Significantly, Harry had not suffered any injuries since being placed in foster care in December 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Kathy continued to exhibit \u201caggressive tendencies.\u201d She was receiving counseling, and was attending a regular Mndergarten class. Although she was doing \u201cokay\u201d in school, she continued to wet the bed. James had little to no interaction with his parents, but also exhibited aggressive tendencies. Although Kathy\u2019s and James\u2019s current foster mother had expressed an interest in adopting both children, Harry\u2019s foster family was not similarly inclined.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">On cross-examination, DYES Supervisor Cunneely admitted that the Division never investigated whether anyone other than the parents could have been responsible for the injuries because \u201c[tjhere was never any information given of an opportunity of anybody else.\u201d Cunneely also agreed that A.H. had gone to whatever services were offered by the Division, and had otherwise cooperated fully with all of the services offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">\n<em>Alternatives to Termination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">With respect to possible placement with a relative, Cunneely testified that the only relative provided to the Division was F.H.\u2019s brother. Efforts to contact this person were initially frustrated because the Division was given an incorrect phone number. When the brother was eventually contacted in January 2003, he indicated that he had five children of his own, and had to think about it. The Division did not hear back from him. Neither parent addressed placement with the father\u2019s brother in their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">We remanded the matter to permit the parents to present additional evidence as to kinship placement. Two lay witnesses testified for the parents at the remand hearing. In lieu of live testimony, the trial court also accepted two certifications submitted by the parents in support of their motion for a remand. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the court considered the certifications of F.H.\u2019s former wife and the daughter from that marriage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">As noted earlier, two witnesses testified for the parents at the remand hearing. Susan Hudick lived next door to the family for five years before they moved to the apartment across the street. She testified that she never heard fighting, yelling, or crying coming from the house. She observed both parents being \u201cvery caring\u201d with the children. Kathy was \u201cplayful\u201d and \u201ccharming\u201d and \u201can active three year old.\u201d The children were always \u201cclean and neat.\u201d She \u201cheard [the parents] angry with each other\u201d or with the children. Hudick admitted, however, that she had no direct knowledge of how Harry had been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">F.H.\u2019s brother S.H. was the second witness to testify at the remand hearing. The brothers lived near each other in Brooklyn during F.H.\u2019s first marriage. S.H. expressed no concerns about leaving his own children in his brother\u2019s care. In fact, S.H. claimed that F.H. spoiled his children. He never saw F.H. being physically aggressive towards his children, or being abusive to them or even yelling at them. He never observed any \u201cmarks\u201d on the children. S.H. described his brother as \u201cvery patient\u201d and \u201cvery polite.\u201d He admitted, however, that he was not present at the times Harry or Kathy were injured, and had no independent knowledge of those injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">With respect to his willingness to take custody of the children, S.H. claimed that \u201c[i]n the beginning,\u201d he asked for the phone number for the DYFS caseworker. When the caseworker mentioned that he could adopt the children, he responded that he had five children of his own and was \u201cnot a millionaire.\u201d The caseworker said she would \u201csend the paper anyway\u201d but he never received it. S.H. claimed that he \u201ccontacted her again and [sic] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>with no luck.\u201d He had only this one conversation with a DYFS representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">\n<em>Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AE0\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">At DYFS\u2019s request, psychologist Ernesto Perdomo evaluated F.H. and A.H. individually, for the purpose of conducting a bonding evaluation between the children and the parents. His intent was to \u201cdetermine whether [the parents] would be able to be effective parents and whether the children would be in any kind of risk with them.\u201d The examinations took place on five dates between February and July 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Perdomo conducted a diagnostic interview and gave several psychological tests to F.H. At trial, Perdomo expressed some concerns about the validity of the tests in light of the parties\u2019 cultural differences.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">I did some testing because he was able to speak enough English well enough, and he said he understood. My concern is that he comes from [a] different country, social!,] cultural and even religious background is very different from the main standards and norms used in the test. So the test \u2014 that\u2019s why I said you have to be very careful with those tests because of the cultural differences of [F.H.] But the test itself didn\u2019t reveal any problem anyway \u2014 doesn\u2019t reveal any major problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Perdomo also reviewed reports prepared by the Division. The entire interview was conducted in English, and lasted between an hour-and-a-half to two hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Perdomo found no indication of any mental problems. He found F.H. to be in denial about the problems with Harry, because he believed that the boy suffered from a medical condition, and that the Division was just \u201cagainst them.\u201d He believed that the second removal of the children was in retaliation for pressing charges against the caseworker. He also questioned the care the children had received in the foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>With A.H., Perdomo used an interpreter to assist with the \u201cextensive clinical interview\u201d lasting about an hour-and-a-half. He was unable to conduct any psychological tests because of cultural and language barriers. Despite these shortcomings, Perdomo found A.H. to be very educated, calm and with no indication of any mental disorder. She blamed Harry\u2019s injuries on his \u201cfragile bones\u201d and rough play with Kathy. She also claimed that Kathy was injured at the new therapeutic school, and that she had complained to the school about the bruises that they now claim she inflicted on her. A.H. did not accept any responsibility for the injuries to her children, nor did she take responsibility for failing to protect Kathy from the grandmother. In fact, she denied that the grandmother had done anything wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Perdomo found that both parents fervently wanted the return of their children. Perdomo was concerned, however, that neither parent accepted responsibility for the injuries sustained by Harry, and blamed the Division for their family\u2019s upheaval. Perdomo thus concluded that neither parent would be able to protect the children against future harm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In the area of bonding, Perdomo found that the children were very attached to their parents. Both parents acted \u201cvery appropriate\u201d with them, and the children interacted comfortably with them. Overall, Perdomo found the children to be \u201cvery bonded\u201d to the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In light of the serious injuries sustained by Hairy, Perdomo recommended that the Division proceed cautiously in any attempts to reunite the family. He also suggested family therapy as a precondition to reunification. In his opinion, both parents needed to recognize the problem presented by Harry\u2019s unexplained inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>r\u00edes, and accept the fact that these injuries were not caused by a medical disorder. Without these acknowledgments, Perdomo believed there was a \u201cvery high\u201d risk that there would be more injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Perdomo did not view Kathy as a risk to Harry. He took note of the fact that Harry did not suffer any further injuries after he was separated from his parents, even though he was initially placed in foster care together with Kathy. He also concluded that Kathy was safer as a result of being removed from her mother\u2019s custody. In support of this conclusion, he noted that Kathy did not suffer any further injuries after the second removal, even though she continued to attend the therapeutic day school that A.H. alleged was the cause of her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">On cross-examination, Perdomo admitted that the parents could benefit from services such as family therapy, counseling, parenting classes and supervision. He insisted, however, that the parents needed to accept responsibility for Harry\u2019s injuries, before any meaningful progress could took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The court also considered the testimony of psychologist Charles Hasson. He conducted psychological evaluations of the parents and bonding assessments of the children with the parents and foster parents at the request of the Law Guardian. The examinations took place on six dates. He indicated that he discussed with the parents the fact that the consensus among the medical professionals who had examined Harry, was that a medical disorder could not account for the frequency and severity of the child\u2019s fractures. He also emphasized that Harry had not had any similar injuries since being placed in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">According to Hasson, both parents remained steadfast in their belief that Hany had been afflicted with the medical condition known as \u201cPoland Sequence.\u201d The parents believed that this medical disorder was \u201ctime limited\u201d and that F.H., who also had that condition as a child, had the same experience with bone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>fractures. The problem eventually subsided as F.H. grew older. In this light, the parents continued to deny any responsibility for Harry\u2019s injuries, and attributed the cause to Kathy. A.H. also denied any responsibility for Kathy\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">In the process of conducting the interviews with the parents, Hasson confronted the same cultural difficulties that Perdomo experienced. Hasson interviewed A.H. for about two-and-a-half hours. He found her cooperative, but frightened, guarded, and defensive in her responses. Although she was intellectually aware of the reasons proffered by the Division for the removal of her children, A.H. believed that she and the children were victims of the Division\u2019s wrongful and unfounded accusations. A.H. believed that the Division was retaliating against her for spurning the caseworker\u2019s sexual advances. When asked about Kathy\u2019s allegations that she and her mother (Kathy\u2019s grandmother) had hurt her, A.H. claimed Kathy was a liar. Overall, Hasson was critical of A.H.\u2019s failure to take affirmative steps to protect her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Hasson did not find any evidence that A.H. was suffering from any mental or mood disorder. He believed her to have limited problem-solving skills, and described her as intelligent, but immature and weak. According to Hasson, those character traits would make it difficult for A.H. to manage as a parent, especially with a \u201cvery difficult\u201d and aggressive child like Kathy, and a child like Harry, who has developmental difficulties. Taking all of these factors into consideration, and adding the problems presented by F.H.\u2019s incarceration, (limited financial resources, coupled with traditional social alienation and cultural displacement experienced by all new immigrants) Hasson opined that A.H. suffered from mild chronic situational depression, and that she had certain dependent and passive-aggressive traits. He also believed that A.H. was in denial about her need for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Hasson interviewed F.H. for about two-and-a-half hours and conducted a series of psychological tests. He described F.H. as \u201ccool, calm, collected,\u201d with \u201c[v]ery low social anxiety.\u201d He opined that F.H. had \u201can arrogant, haughty quality about him, where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>feels as if he knows best, rather than other people.\u201d He was \u201cself assured\u201d and \u201ccompletely confident in who he is, his view of life, his view of a reality and his decision \u2014 decisions that he thought he made.\u201d In contrast to A.H., Hasson found F.H. \u201cverbally fluent.\u201d Intellectually, Hasson characterized F.H. as \u201ca very bright guy.\u201d F.H.\u2019s psychological tests results showed that he was guarded in his responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">According to Hasson, F.H. also took no responsibility for Harry\u2019s injuries or for lack of supervision of the children. He offered no explanation for Harry\u2019s second injury. He believed that the final injury, which resulted in the removal of all three children, was \u201cjust an accident.\u201d With respect to the second removal of the two children, F.H. asserted that this was done in retaliation for A.H. refusing the caseworker\u2019s sexual advances. He viewed the DYFS system as corrupt, and maintained that Harry had not suffered any injuries since being removed from the home because he outgrew his medical problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Hasson observed Kathy and James with the foster mother for a one-hour bonding session. Based only on these limited observations, he opined that the foster mother \u201cwas really good in terms of controlling the situation\u201d and intervening when there was a problem. She engaged the children and \u201cwas gentle with them.\u201d Both children called her \u201cmommy\u201d and were affectionate with her. According to Hasson, the foster mother indicated that Kathy seemed frightened when she first came to live with her, would flinch if chastised, and was anxious and wet the bed after visiting with the biological parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Hasson also conducted a bonding evaluation with both parents and with each parent individually. He found that A.H. \u201ctook a secondary role\u201d and F.H. \u201corganized and structured\u201d the visit. F.H. directed A.H. to study math with Kathy, while he played physically with the two boys. As the visit progressed, the children \u201cbecame more and more out of control\u201d with Kathy pulling her mother\u2019s hair, Harry smacking his mother on the back, and the children getting aggressive towards each other. When Hasson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>observed A.H. alone, she could not control the children, and appeared exhausted by the end of the visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In his opinion, both parents have difficulty with parenting their children in a way that would protect the children from harm. Hasson believed that the parents \u201clack the ability to bring out the best in their children, and to encourage their children to developmental growth.\u201d As such, Hasson concluded that the children would be \u201cin high risk\u201d if returned to the parents because F.H. has a \u201cquick temper with the children,\u201d and A.H. is overwhelmed by her parenting duties. Hasson ruled out the possibility that DYFS-sponsored therapy and other services would be sufficient to counteract these problems, because the parents had not acknowledged that they had problems, and thus lacked the motivation to change their behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Finally, Hasson stated in his report that \u201c[b]oth parents have serious emotional issues and bring out the worst in the children\u201d and \u201chad a toxic effect\u201d on them. He did not think reunification was \u201ca viable direction,\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s just too many obstacles for both of those parents to overcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Psychologist Paul Fulford testified on behalf of the parents. He examined the family twice during June and July of 2004, without the benefit of an interpreter. He reviewed certain discovery material from the Division and conducted intelligence and various personality and parenting tests on both parents. He did not review any hospital records or medical reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Fulford found F.H. to be of normal intelligence and cooperative with the testing. He noted that F.H. \u201cappeared to have an investment in appearing good\u201d as revealed in the personality assessment study. Fulford found A.H.\u2019s testing underestimated her abilities, possibly due to cultural or linguistic factors. He found no intellectual deficiency in A.H. and no significant depression or mood disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>After conducting a bonding evaluation with the children, Fulford described the family as affectionate and spontaneous. Although he found the children to be \u201clively,\u201d he did not think that the parents had difficulty controlling them. He concluded that the parents were able to successfully parent the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">With respect to the medical issues involving Harry, Fulford opined that both parents \u201crealize[d] the seriousness of the matter\u201d and \u201cthat this requires close or perhaps closer than the average parent level of supervision and changing the environment.\u201d According to Fulford, both parents admitted \u201cthat they might have made some mistakes or errors,\u201d but denied they did anything \u201cdeliberate.\u201d In Fulford\u2019s judgment, the parents were confused by F.H.\u2019s own medical history as a child. As to the incidents involving Kathy and the grandmother, Fulford testified that A.H. was \u201cupset by it\u201d and that the grandmother \u201cwas no longer involved in the caregiving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Dr. Julia DeBellis, the Medical Director of the Audrey Hepburn Children\u2019s House, was the final expert witness to testify before the trial court. Dr. DeBellis was called by the Division and admitted by the court as an expert in pediatrics and child abuse. Dr. DeBellis was retained as consulting physician after Harry\u2019s second hospitalization. She was specifically asked to \u201cgive an opinion regarding accidental and non-accidental trauma, child abuse and neglect.\u201d She reviewed all of the medical records available from the different hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">With respect to the January 2002, consultation, Dr. DeBellis found it \u201cimportant\u201d that Harry had multiple fractures in different stages of healing. She thus recommended that the child be evaluated by a geneticist, radiologist and hematologist. Some of these test results were still pending when Harry was first discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">At trial, Dr. DeBellis opined that the metafacial corner fracture found on Harry\u2019s shin at the time of the January 2002, hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>admission \u201chas a high specificity for non-accidental trauma\u201d and that the \u201cquality of force\u201d required for such an injury was \u201cparticularly attributed to or described in a shaking scenario.\u201d At that time, Harry also had other old and new fractures of the type that could have been accidental with children who are ambulating. In this case, these injuries could not have been accidental, because Harry, who was developmentally delayed, was not even rolling over at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Under these circumstances, Dr. DeBellis concluded that the shin and forearm fractures found on Harry at that time were not consistent with the explanation given, i.e., that the child fell from the arms of his sister. According to Dr. DeBellis, \u201cit is rare for a child to sustain a fracture from a short fall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">After reviewing the hospital admission records from December 21, 2001, Dr. DeBellis reiterated that Harry\u2019s fracture on that occasion was also not consistent with the explanation provided, i.e., that a two-and-a-half-year-old \u201cyanking\u201d on the arm of a five-month-old infant caused the injury. More force would have been required to cause this injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">According to Dr. DeBellis, the radiological report indicated that Harry\u2019s bone mineralization was normal. This meant that there was \u201cno radiological evidence of bone fragility.\u201d When multiple fractures are found in an infant, physicians look at the quality of the bones or for other abnormalities, such as the presence of wormian bodies, \u201cwhich may indicate a condition like osteogenesis imperfecta,\u201d \u201crickets or other bone, nutritional bone abnormalities that would alert [the physician] to a lower threshold for fracture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The staff at Hackensack University Medical Center found no \u201cbony abnormalities and no wormian bodies present.\u201d No calcium deficiency or renal problems were found. Harry also had normal levels of phosphorus and vitamin D. \u201cAssuming normal bones,\u201d Dr. DeBellis testified that younger children are less likely to fracture accidentally because of their limited mobility. Although Harry did have hypotonia, and had been earlier diagnosed with Poland Sequence, fragile bones are not considered part of either disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>In Dr. DeBellis\u2019s opinion, Harry\u2019s fractures were non-accidental. This conclusion was also supported by the fact that the child had not suffered any further fractures since he was placed in foster care on December 12, 2002. She did not find anything in \u201cthe literature\u201d to indicate that Harry would be less prone to fractures after age seventeen months, or that a child with fragile bones would get stronger as he got older. In fact, she stated that children are more likely to fracture as they get older and become more mobile. When questioned about F.H.\u2019s claim that the \u201cconsequences of Poland Sequence would resolve itself after the age of two,\u201d Dr. DeBellis explained that the condition \u201creflect[s] anatomical abnormalities\u201d that will not just go away without medical intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Dr. DeBellis thus opined, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, \u201cthat [Harry] does not have a medical condition that predisposes him to fractures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">\n<em>Trial Court\u2019s Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In a brief four-page memorandum of opinion, the trial court found that: (1) the parents offered no explanations for the cause of the nine bone fractures suffered by Harry before he was eighteen months old; (2) the allegations of a genetic condition that made the child\u2019s bones fragile or predisposed to fractures were not supported by the medical evidence; and (3) the conduct attributable to the older sister, characterized as \u201crough play,\u201d did not adequately explain the serious injuries sustained by Harry. The court was persuaded by the \u201cundisputed medical expert findings\u201d that Harry\u2019s bones were normal, and that the fractures could not have been caused accidentally. The court thus concluded that \u201c[Harry\u2019s] parents physically abused him causing him great harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">After detailing the hospitalizations, the Division\u2019s efforts, Kathy\u2019s injuries, and the parents\u2019 denials of responsibility, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>judge noted only that the parents \u201care not credible\u201d and \u201ctheir three children would be at substantial risk of physical harm if returned to their custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">After conducting the hearing required by our remand order, the trial court issued a three-paragraph supplemental memorandum of opinion, finding that \u201c[n]one of the witnesses offered any testimony concerning the factual issues regarding the abuse and neglect of the children.\u201d The court thereafter reaffirmed its earlier findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\n<em>Legal Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">We start our analysis by reaffirming certain bedrock principles of law that will inform and guide our discussion of the issues raised herein. Parents have a fundamental constitutional right to enjoy a relationship with and raise their children. <em>In re Guardianship of K.H.O., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>337, 346-47, 736 A.2d 1246 (1999). This constitutional protection is \u201ctempered by the State\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>responsibility to protect the welfare of children.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of J.N.H., </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>440, 471, 799 A.2d 518 (2002). This delicate balance is achieved through application of the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard. <em>K.U.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 347, 736 A.2d 1246. \u201cIn particular, \u2018parental fitness is the key to determining the best interests of the child in parental rights termination cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>J.N.H., supra, 172 N.J. </em>at 471, 799 A.2d 518 (citing <em>In re Guardianship of B.L.A, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>392, 402, 753 A.2d 770 (Ch.Div.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1a, DYFS can initiate a petition to terminate parental rights on the grounds of the \u201cbest interest of the child,\u201d if each of the following four elements is met by clear and convincing evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">(1) The child\u2019s safety, health or development has been or will continue to be endangered by the parental relationship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">(2) The parent is unwilling or unable to eliminate the harm facing the child or is unable or unwilling to provide a safe and stable home for the child and the delay of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>permanent placement will add to the harm. Such harm may include evidence that separating the child from his foster parents would cause serious and enduring emotional or psychological harm to the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">(3) The division has made reasonable efforts to provide services to help the parent correct the circumstances which led to the child\u2019s placement outside the home and the court has considered alternatives to termination of parental rights; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">(4) Termination of parental rights will not do more harm than good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The statute \u201cprescribes an integrated multi-element test that must be applied to determine whether termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of DMH, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>365, 375, 736 A.2d 1261 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Transferring guardianship to the State terminates all parental rights of the natural parents, permanently cutting off the relationship between the children and their biological parents, and is a prerequisite to having a child adopted. <em>In re Guardianship of J.C., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>1, 5, 608 A.2d 1312 (1992). When the child\u2019s biological parents resist the termination of their parental rights, the court must decide whether the parents can raise their children without causing them further harm. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 608 A.2d 1312.

The harm shown \u201cmust be one that threatens the child\u2019s health and will likely have continuing deleterious effects on the child.\u201d <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 352, 736 A.2d 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The nature and extent of the injuries sustained by Harry were not disputed. Instead, the parents focused on whether the Division proved that such injuries were <em>not </em>caused by Harry\u2019s alleged medical condition. On appeal, neither parent refers directly to Kathy\u2019s injuries inflicted by either A.H. or her maternal grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>F.H. contends that the State did not meet its burden of proof on the first prong, because the expert testimony presented did not definitively rule out that Harry did not suffer from a medical condition that rendered him more vulnerable to fractures. A.H. also argues that \u201cno one is certain whether [HarryJ\u2019s genetic make up [sic] contributed to his broken bones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The Division concedes that Harry was \u201ca special needs child who was born with Poland\u2019s sequence; has suffered from scoliosis; and has experienced developmental delays.\u201d The Division argues, however, that Harry\u2019s nine unexplained fractures in the first year-and-a-half of his life indisputably establish that the child was not properly nurtured by his parents. Thus, the burden of proof on the first prong was clearly met based on the unrebutted medical evidence that the fractures \u201cwere the result of non-accidental trauma.\u201d The Law Guardian joins the Division\u2019s arguments, arguing that the parents\u2019 insistence that Harry has \u201cfragile bones,\u201d despite all medical evidence to the contrary, is untenable and irrational on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We are satisfied that the evidence before the trial court, established by clear and convincing evidence, that the multiple fractures endured by Harry during the early part of his life were not caused or facilitated by a medical condition. Dr. DeBellis was the only medical professional who was qualified, by training and experience, to offer an opinion on this subject. Her diagnosis ruled out the presence of osteogenesis imperfecta, rickets or other bone or nutritional abnormalities as medical conditions that would alert a physician to a lower threshold for fracture.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Dr. DeBellis also indicated that Kathy could not have been responsible for Harry\u2019s two injuries, because the first injury was not consistent with being pulled out of a swing; the second injury required more force than a child of Kathy\u2019s age could muster. Finally, Dr. DeBellis took particular note, as did the trial judge, that Harry has remained injury-free throughout the entire time he has been in foster placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Thus: (1) the absence of objective evidence establishing a medical explanation for the injuries; (2) the implausibility of the parents\u2019 explanation for how these injuries occurred; (3) the presence of healed or partly healed injuries; and (4) the cessation of further trauma after the child\u2019s removal from the parents; all led the trial court to conclude that the Division established, by clear and convincing evidence, that Harry\u2019s injuries were the result of abuse or neglect by the parents. In other words, the court imputed liability to the parents because the injuries to the child occurred on their watch.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We agree that the evidence just described presents a strong circumstantial case that, at the very least, the parents permitted Harry to be seriously injured while he was in their custody. The presence of healed injuries also indicates a lack of due diligence in seeking medical attention for the child. All that being said, however, there is also clear evidence that the parents, especially A.H., have been compliant with all of the Division\u2019s requests. Both parents also have a strong and loving bond with the children and they with them, including Harry.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">We also recognize that after F.H.\u2019s incarceration, A.H. was left alone to deal with the economic and emotional crisis created by his absence. Although she was eventually joined by her mother, A.H. remained, for the most part, solely responsible for the economic, social, and emotional well-being of her family. As an Arab-American woman, A.H. was also coping with and adopting to a new and alien culture. This could only have served to compound the stress and anxiety caused by F.H.\u2019s involuntary absence from the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Despite this turmoil, the record supports the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that both parents were unable to eliminate the harm endured by Harry, and did not provide a safe and stable home for him. We remain greatly concerned for Harry\u2019s health and safety, (and consequently, for the health and safety of the other two children). We cannot ignore the fact that Harry has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>remained injury-free during the time he has been in foster placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">As to Kathy\u2019s injuries, both DYFS and the Law Guardian conceded at oral argument before us that, standing alone, these injuries and the events surrounding them, would not constitute sufficient grounds to warrant the termination of F.H.\u2019s and A.H.\u2019s parental rights. The injuries themselves were nothing more than minor bruises (minor ear scratch; a scratch on the left hand; and a small bruise on the upper arm), caused by pinching and other such forms of corporal punishment inflicted primarily by the maternal grandmother. There is no strong evidence that A.H. herself was personally involved in administering this form of discipline.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Viewed in the light least favorable to A.H., the evidence only suggests that she did not recognize the impropriety of this form of discipline, thus failing to protect Kathy from her grandmother\u2019s ill-advised childrearing methods. The grandmother\u2019s voluntary separation from the family (at A.H.\u2019s request), coupled with A.H.\u2019s full participation in DYFS-sponsored parenting classes, has rendered this concern, if not moot, significantly less problematic. Finally, F.H. cannot be held responsible for Kathy\u2019s injuries, because he was incarcerated during the time the maternal grandmother was around the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The record as to the youngest child, James, is significantly less compelling than the record pertaining to his siblings. There is absolutely no evidence that James was ever abused or neglected by his parents. We recognize, however, that under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6\u2014 8.46, \u201cproof of the abuse or neglect of one child shall be admissible evidence on the issue of the abuse or neglect of any other child of ... the parent____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>The Supreme Court has recognized that the courts \u201cneed not wait to act until a child is actually irreparably impaired by parental inattention or neglect.\u201d <em>DMH, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 383, 736 A.2d 1261. \u201cHowever, as a part of its burden of proof, the State must still demonstrate by a preponderance of the competent, material and relevant evidence <em>(N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.46b) the probability of present or future harm.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. S.S., </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 24, 855 A.2d 8 (App.Div.2004), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>426, 866 A.2d 983 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In <em>DMH, </em>DYFS sought to terminate the parental rights of the children\u2019s biological father, alleging he was unfit to parent due to \u201chis failure to provide any care and support for his children [resulting] in harm that endangered their welfare.\u201d <em>DMH, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 377, 736 A.2d 1261. DYFS pressed forward with this claim, despite the fact that it found that the father had not \u201cwilfully [forsaken the children]; he professed parental love for them and sporadically expressed interest in providing for them.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The Supreme Court embraced DYFS\u2019s theory of culpability, finding that the father, through his inattentiveness, had abdicated his parental responsibilities, thus satisfying DYFS\u2019s burden of proof as to prongs (1) and (2) of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1a. Specifically, the Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">[The father] shares in the responsibility and blame for the plight of his children. While the infant C.H. was living with her mother, the child suffered from neglect and instability, resulting in damage that remains with her to this day. During this early period, [the father] was nearby, knew of the conditions under which his child was living, yet did not ameliorate them; he failed to acknowledge paternity until 1993. DYFS caseworkers visiting the house between 1991 and 1993 found the family to be living in an overcrowded apartment under \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions. When his children were at risk of being placed in foster care due to their mother\u2019s neglect, drug abuse, and homelessness, [the father] did not come forward to request that they be placed in his custody. Nor did [the father] assist in securing adequate housing or providing care for the children when they were still in the custody of [their mother]. Thus, he compounded the mother\u2019s neglect and contributed to the circumstances that required the eventual placement of the children in foster care. The instability and lack of adequate care that characterized the lives of these children did not improve, but in fact deteriorated, after [the father] acknowledged his paternity. Following the biological mother\u2019s death, [the father] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>did not provide the children with the emotional support and comfort or even the reassurance of physical presence that such a trauma would require of a parent. Instead, he failed even to visit the children for six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">Each child has suffered. [The father], no less than [the mother], permitted C.H. to live unsupervised and unkempt in the shelter where DYFS had temporarily placed the family. DYFS eventually removed C.H. for lack of adequate supervision. C.H.\u2019s special needs, a result of these experiences, are well documented in the record. These have been expressed in aggressive behavior, use of sexually explicit language beyond her years, and stealing. During the period after the initial hearing, C.H. required hospitalization due to angry and explosive actions at school. Dr. Wells, the initial expert, testified that C.H.\u2019s problems are attributable in part to the unstable environment and inadequate living conditions she experienced during her first few years of life. We note that Dr. Nadelman, the second expert, confirmed this opinion, observing that C.H.\u2019s emotional problems were the result of the \u201cinstability and turmoil\u201d of her early life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">R.H. has been in foster care since shortly after his birth. [The father] did not protest R.H.\u2019s placement in foster care, and did not express any parental interest until after the child had been voluntarily placed in foster care. Outside of occasional visits, [the father] has never provided R.H. with any paternal care, nurture, or support. R.H. was bom with heroin in his system due to his mother\u2019s drug use during her pregnancy; that harm was compounded by [the father\u2019s] persistent failure to perform any parenting functions and to provide nurture, care, and support for R.H. for over three years. This constitutes a parental harm to that child arising out of the parental relationship----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">[Id. at 379-80, 736 A.2d 1261.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Against this record, the Court concluded that DYFS had presented sufficient evidence of parental unfitness. More importantly, the Court also concluded that this record revealed the father\u2019s future inability \u201cto provide his children with an adequately stable home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380, 736 A.2d 1261. Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition in <em>DMH </em>that \u201ccourts need not wait to act until a child is actually irreparably impaired by parental inattention or neglect,\u201d must be understood, considered, and applied in the context of a clear record showing a pattern of parental inaction and neglect, amounting to unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">Applying this standard, we conclude that the trial court failed to make sufficient factual findings to warrant the termination of F.H.\u2019s and A.H.\u2019s parental rights with respect to James. In contrast to the facts in <em>DMH, </em>the record here with respect to James is devoid of any evidence that he was abused or neglected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>by his parents. Indeed, DYFS removed James from his parents\u2019 custody while F.H. was incarcerated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We are mindful that Harry\u2019s injuries may be viewed as a harbinger of what could befall James if he is left, unsupervised, in his parents\u2019 custody. As we noted in <em>J. &amp; E., supra, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 493, 385 A.2d 240:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">Predictions as to probable future conduct can only be based upon past performance____We cannot conceive that the Legislature intended to guarantee to parents at least one chance to kill or abuse each child. Evidence of parents\u2019 fitness or unfitness can be gleaned not only from their past treatment of the child in question but also from the quality of care to other children in their custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The record here, however, does not present a consistent pattern of egregious acts of abuse or neglect. The facts here are more nuanced. Even with respect to Harry, the parents\u2019 conduct here is heavily laden with the complexities and ambiguities of human behavior. On the one hand, Harry suffered from many medically unexplained fractures. On the other hand, this fact came to light when both F.H. and A.H. brought Harry to the attention of medical professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Our conclusion that DYFS did not satisfy the first prong of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1a as to Kathy and James is based, in part, on the fact that the safety and health of Harry were jeopardized by a particular and discrete form of neglect, i.e., failing to protect him from harm, resulting in numerous fractures. Because the pattern of Harry\u2019s neglect was limited to this single form of repetitive injury rather than being more pervasive and diffuse, we are satisfied that, in light of the absence of any evidence in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>of injury to Kathy and James, the concern we expressed in <em>J. &amp; E., </em>for the safety of the other siblings is not warranted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\n<em>Second Prong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">\n<em>Parents\u2019 Inability to Prevent Harm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The second statutory element of the best interests standard is aimed at \u201cdetermining whether the parent has cured and overcome the initial harm that endangered the health, safety, or welfare of the child, and is able to continue a parental relationship without recurrent harm to the child.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1a(2); <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 348, 736 A.2d 1246. Alternatively, the State can show \u201cthat the parent is unable to provide a safe and stable home for the child and that the delay in securing permanency continues or adds to the child\u2019s harm.\u201d <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 348, 736 A.2d 1246. \u201cIn other words, the issue becomes whether the parent can cease causing the child harm before any delay in permanent placement becomes a harm in and of itself.\u201d AG., <em>supra, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 434, 782 A.2d 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">We have discussed at length how Harry continued to experience serious, medically unexplained trauma while he was in his parents\u2019 custody. We are troubled, as was the trial judge, by the parents\u2019 steadfast refusal to acknowledge any responsibility for these injuries. Of particular concern, is the parents\u2019 insistence on attributing Harry\u2019s injuries to a medical disorder, even in the face of incontestable medical evidence to the contrary, or to the aggressive tendencies of his slightly older sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">Neither parent was directly accused of having caused Harry\u2019s injuries. Rather, the Division\u2019s ease was based on the parents\u2019 unwillingness to recognize that their parental role included providing a safe environment for all of their children, including Harry. We are satisfied that the record supports, through circumstantial evidence, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Division met its burden of proof as to Prong Two, but only with respect Harry.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\u201c \u2018[T]he cornerstone of the [best interest] inquiry is not whether the biological parents are fit but whether they can cease causing their child harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>S.A, supra, </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 535, 889 A.2d 1120 (quoting <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 10, 608 A.2d 1312).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The record is insufficient to show, however, that the parents\u2019 were unwilling or unable to eliminate any harm with respect to Kathy and James. First, there is no evidence that James was ever placed in an unsafe environment. As to Kathy, even assuming that she was placed in a harmful environment when the maternal grandmother was in the home, that risk was eliminated by AH. There is no evidence that F.H. was ever abusive to his daughter, or that A.H. caused or permitted any serious harm to befall Kathy. Moreover, DYFS conceded at oral argument before us that the minor lacerations and bruises observed were insufficient, in and of themselves, to warrant termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\n<em>Third Prong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\n<em>Services provided by DYFS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The third element requires DYFS to undertake \u201creasonable efforts to provide services to help the parent correct the circumstances which led to the child\u2019s placement outside the home and the court has considered alternatives to termination of parental rights.\u201d <em>N.J.SA </em>30:4C-15.1a(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">F.H. argues that the trial court failed to explore placement with his brother. A.H. contends that DYFS failed to offer testimony that the caseworker mailed the appropriate documents to her brother-in-law, or that any follow-up was done regarding placement of the children with him. She thus requests that we remand the case for consideration of the brother-in-law as an alternative placement even though that option was not \u201cexplicitly argue[d] on the record.\u201d The Division maintains that F.H.\u2019s brother is not a viable option.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>After reviewing the record, including F.H.\u2019s testimony presented to the trial court after our remand, we are satisfied that DYFS correctly rejected this individual as an alternative placement for the children, including Harry. Because we conclude that termination is warranted here only with respect to Harry, we will focus our analysis on determining whether placing Harry with his paternal uncle is a reasonable alternative under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We start our discussion of this question by noting that Harry is a developmentally delayed child with special needs. He has not fared well in foster placement, resulting in him being moved a number of times. It seems clear to us that what this child needs, in addition to love and nurturing, is stability. Given the testimony presented before the trial court, it is highly dubious that the paternal uncle will be able to provide Harry with the specialized care he needs on a permanent basis. This man candidly admitted that he has five children of his own that reasonably demand and receive a great deal of his attention. Despite his best intentions, his time and efforts will naturally be prioritized around the needs of his own children. Under such circumstances, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in determining that he was not a viable alternative to termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">It is \u201cwell established that it is the Division\u2019s policy to place children with relatives whenever possible.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth and Family Servs. v. M.F., </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>515, 527, 815 A.2d 1029 (App.Div.2003). There is no presumption, however, in favor of placement with a relative as opposed to a third party. <em>Id. </em>at 528-29, 815 A.2d 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We now turn to A.H.\u2019s claims that the Division did not make reasonable efforts at reunification, by failing to provide home services or counseling to her on how to care for a physically-challenged child like Harry. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1e defines the term \u201creasonable efforts\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">attempts by an agency authorized by the division to assist the parents in remedying the circumstances and conditions that led to the placement of the child and in reinforcing the family structure, including, but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>(1) consultation and cooperation with the parent in developing a plan for appropriate services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">(2) providing services that have been agreed upon, to the family, in order to further the goal of family reunification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">(3) informing the parent at appropriate intervals of the child\u2019s progress, development and health; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">(4) facilitating appropriate visitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:1331-4.2 sets forth guidelines, requiring that DYFS provide services to the family according to a case plan, including enlisting the assistance of relatives, providing services directly, or providing referrals to community service providers. DYFS must monitor these services, change them as needs arise, and identify and strive to overcome \u201cbarriers to service provision or service utilization.\u201d <em>DMH, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 387, 736 A.2d 1261 (quoting <em>N.J. AC. </em>10:133I-4.2(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Our Supreme Court has also held that DYFS must encourage, foster and maintain the bond between the parent and child, promote and assist in visitation, keep the parent informed of the child\u2019s progress in foster care, and inform the parent of the necessary or appropriate measures he or she should pursue in order to continue and strengthen that relationship and, eventually, regain custody of his or her children. <em>Id. </em>at 390, 736 A.2d 1261. \u201cThe refusal to provide or allow an able and willing parent contact with her child is tantamount to a unilateral displacement of the biological parent, which is impermissible without judicial approval.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 736 A.2d 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">\u201cReasonable efforts\u201d will vary depending upon the circumstances of the removal. <em>A.G., supra, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 437, 782 A.2d 458. The failure or lack of success of such efforts does not foreclose a finding that the Division met its statutory burden to try to reunify the children with the family. <em>DMH, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 393, 736 A.2d 1261; <em>see K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 354, 736 A.2d 1246 (requirements satisfied where DYFS attempted to find relatives or friends who would care for the child, encouraged continued parental visits, informed the mother of the child\u2019s progress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>monitored the mother\u2019s visits, and provided drug treatment programs).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Here, neither parent argues that the Division failed to keep them informed of the children\u2019s progress or that visitation was inadequate. Instead, both parents focused on the Division\u2019s effort in offering them services to facilitate reunification. It is undisputed that when first offered homemaker services, A.H. refused, with F.H.\u2019s tacit approval. It is also undisputed that AH. was offered and received both counseling and parenting classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">F.H. was in prison from July 2002, and was still incarcerated in December 2003, when the Division changed its goal from reunification to termination. We have recognized \u201cthe difficulty and likely futility of providing services to a person in custody----\u201d <em>S.A., supra, </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 535-36, 889 A.2d 1120. Nonetheless, it was undisputed that the Division offered homemaker services to the family, provided supervised visitation and transportation services through several agencies after problems arose with F.H. and certain staff members, provided psychological and bonding evaluations for both parents and the children, medical evaluations for Harry, and therapeutic daycare for Kathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">AH. was the primary caretaker for the children. In this context, it was not unreasonable for the Division to focus its efforts on her. <em>See DMH, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 393, 736 A.2d 1261 (where one parent has been primary or dominant in caring for the children, it was reasonable for DYFS to focus its efforts on that parent \u201cso long as DYFS does not ignore or exclude\u201d the other parent). Even if the Division had been deficient in the services offered to F.H., reversal would still not be warranted, because the best interests of the child controls. <em>See In re Guardianship of J.R., </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>211, 221-25, 416 A.2d 62 (App.Div.) (DYFS\u2019s failure to fulfill statutory duty did not warrant reversal of decision terminating parental rights because best interest controlled), <em>certif. denied, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>102,425 A.2d 266 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>\n<em>Fourth Prong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\n<em>Termination of Parental Rights Would, Do More Harm than Good.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">This prong requires DYFS to show that the termination of parental rights will not do more harm than good. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1a(4). Here, A.H. argues that: (1) the record of visitations with the children does not support termination; and (2) no expert found that termination was in the children\u2019s best interest. As an alternative, A.H. proposes that the concerns raised by DYFS can be addressed by counseling. F.H. contends that the trial court\u2019s conclusion with respect to this prong was a \u201cnaked conclusion,\u201d without support in both law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The Division responds that a bonding assessment with the foster parents was not necessary in this case, because the parents were unwilling or unable to eliminate the risk of harm to the children, and the children needed permanency. The Law Guardian argues that the fourth prong was satisfied through evidence showing that the parents do not take any responsibility for the injuries suffered by Harry or Kathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">In our view, the evidence presented by DYFS shows that Harry has not bonded with his current foster parents. Under the fourth prong, we must determine \u201cwhether, after considering and balancing the two relationships, the child will suffer a greater harm from the termination of ties with [his or] her natural parents than from the permanent disruption of [his or] her relationship with [his or] her foster parents.\u201d <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 355, 736 A.2d 1246. \u201cThis criterion is related to the first and second elements of the best interests standard, which also focus on parental harm to the children.\u201d <em>DMH, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 384, 736 A.2d 1261. The child\u2019s need for permanency and stability emerges as a \u201ccentral factor\u201d in guardianship cases. <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 357, 736 A.2d 1246. In fact, \u201c[t]he trend over the last thirty years has been towards foster care reforms that place limits on the amount of time a parent may have to correct conditions at home in anticipation of reunification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358, 736 A.2d 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Here, there was very limited testimony as to the bond between Kathy, James and their foster mother. There was no testimony as to any bond between Harry and his then foster parents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> None of the experts opined that any of the children would suffer harm from being removed from their foster families. We thus conclude that the Division did not present \u201cclear and convincing evidence that separating the [children] from [their] foster parents would cause serious and enduring emotional or psychological harm.\u201d <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 19, 608 A.2d 1312. On the other hand, the record shows that both F.H. and A.H. have a strong emotional attachment to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">That being said, however, the statutory standards utilized to determine parental fitness \u201care neither discrete nor separate.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth and Family Servs. v. F.M., </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>235, 258, 867 A.2d 499 (App.Div.2005). The history of unexplained serious trauma endured by Harry while in his parents\u2019 care, coupled with the parents\u2019 intractable refusal to acknowledge any responsibility for these injuries, creates a clear and compelling record warranting the termination of parental rights, even in the absence of evidence showing that Harry has bonded with his foster parents. Stated differently, permitting Harry to continue to reside with and be subject to his parents\u2019 jurisdiction, would cause greater harm than allowing him to remain in DYFS\u2019 custody pending a more suitable and permanent foster care placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">We hold that the Division met its burden of proof that the parents were unwilling or unable to provide a safe and secure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>environment for Harry. The record shows that while in defendants\u2019 custody, Harry suffered multiple serious injuries that were not caused by any medical disorder. The record also shows that the parents\u2019 explanation for how these injuries occurred was not consistent with the medical evidence or with the force necessary to trigger the resulting mechanism of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">With respect to Kathy, there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s holding that the parents caused or were otherwise responsible for causing significant physical or emotional injuries to her. Finally, with respect to James, there was no evidence showing that the parents caused or were otherwise responsible for causing any physical or emotional injuries to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In this light, we (1) affirm the judgment of the Family Part terminating defendants\u2019 parental rights with respect to Harry; and (2) reverse the judgment of the Family Part terminating defendants\u2019 parental rights with respect to Kathy and James. We remand the matter to the Family Part to explore, at a permanency hearing, DYFS\u2019s capability to provide defendants with the services and supervision necessary to insure the health, welfare, and safety of Kathy and James. This permanency hearing must take place within thirty days from the date of the release of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">A precipitous reunification of Kathy and James with their parents would be both unwise and unwarranted. Rather, a carefully monitored, closely supervised, gradual increase in both the frequency and scope of the parents\u2019 contacts with these two children will provide the best means to achieve the desired goal: the eventual return of Kathy and James to their parents, without compromising the children\u2019s safety. If, after the passage of sufficient time to assess the efficacy of these services, the trial court is satisfied that reunification with respect to Kathy and James is no longer legally viable, DYFS may re-file its Guardianship Petition. At this juncture, the trial court must find sufficient evidence causally linking any incidents of abuse or neglect to specific acts or omissions committed by a particular parent. <em>S.A., 382 N.J.Super. </em>at 535, 889 A.2d 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>In order to sustain a judgment terminating a defendant\u2019s parental rights with respect to children who have not been the direct recipient of abuse or neglect, the trial court must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that DYFS has demonstrated that the parent\u2019s failure to adequately respond to and/or prevent the abuse endured by one child, exposes any similarly situated sibling to a high probability of being abused or neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">We are also mindful that the future of these three children remains unsettled. We recognize that our decision separates Harry from the rest of his family. In this sense, it seems that this child is being punished just for being the object of his parents\u2019 neglect. Under no circumstances, however, can we permit such a prospect to come to pass. No rational child-protection system can countenance such an outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The Supreme Court recently considered the question of whether biological siblings who are adopted by separate families retain a legally cognizable right to visitation with each other, independent of the wishes of the their newly adoptive parents. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth and Family Servs. v. S.S., </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>556, 902 A.2d 215 (2006). In <em>S.S.,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">the Family Court terminated [the mother\u2019s] parental rights to her biological daughter, A.M.S. The Appellate Division affirmed, and [the mother] does not challenge the termination of her rights. At the time of A.M.S.\u2019s birth, her four older siblings had been removed from [the mother\u2019s] home. As A.M.S. approaches her fourth birthday, she lives happily with the only family she has known her entire life, a foster family that loves and wishes to adopt her. Her four older siblings, now ages six, nine, thirteen, and sixteen, live with another family that has already adopted them. Through the cooperation and earing of those two families, A.M.S. has been able to visit and maintain a continuing relationship with her siblings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao-\"><em>[Id. </em>at 558, 902 A.2d 215.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In light of the families\u2019 voluntary cooperation with respect to contacts between siblings, the Supreme Court declined to decide the issue, concluding that the parties had not presented a genuine controversy, because \u201cthe sibling relationship [was] not in jeopardy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559, 902 A.2d 215. The Court noted, however, that the question of whether \u201ca child has a constitutional right to visit with a brother or a sister who has been adopted by another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>family\u201d has never been addressed by any court in this State. <em>Id. </em>at 563, 902 A.2d 215. Moreover, although noting the existence of a statutory framework that could potentially bear on the question, the Court expressly declined to decide the issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>9:2-7.1 provides the framework for grandparent and sibling visitation when visitation is proven to be \u201cin the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:2-7.1(a). Significantly, however, this Court has held that a natural grandparent does not have a right of contact with grandchildren who have been adopted by a non-relative under the Visitation Statute. We declared in <em>[In re Adoption of a Child by] W.P. &amp; M.P., </em>[163 <em>N.J. </em>158, 748 A.2d 515 (2000)] that the New Jersey Adoption Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:3-37 to -56, trumps the rights of grandparents, as defined in <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:2-7.1, reasoning that \u201cthe complete termination of the biological parents\u2019 rights\u201d has \u201cthe logical effect of terminating a biological grandparent\u2019s right to visitation.\u201d <em>W.P. &amp; M.P., supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 168, 748 A.2d 515. We never directly addressed whether the same analysis and outcome would apply to a sibling. In other words, we have not had occasion to consider whether the rights provided to siblings under the Child Placement Bill of Rights Act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>[N.J.S.A </em>9:6B-1 to -6] and the Visitation Statute are still viable after parental rights have been terminated and brothers and sisters have been adopted by separate families.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 562-63, 902 A.2d 215 (internal citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Finally, after reviewing how other states have addressed the question, the Court concluded that, in the absence of a genuine controversy, the Legislature was better suited to address the issue. <em>Id. </em>at 566, 902 A.2d 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>As in <em>S.S., </em>the issue of whether Harry, Kathy and James have a legally enforceable right to visit and otherwise remain in contact with each other is not properly before us. No party has briefed the issue, and it was not a part of the trial court\u2019s analysis. In fact, there is no record before us attesting whether, as in <em>S.S., </em>the families involved would be amenable to a voluntary visitation schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Thus, although we hope that any future plans DYFS has for Harry will include a sibling-visitation component to provide that, as the years go by, Harry remains in meaningful contact with his \u201cbig sister\u201d and \u201clittle brother,\u201d we cannot dictate such a plan. The net effect of our decision is to enable Harry to be legally capable of being adopted by a caring and loving family. When this occurs, it will be up to his new parents to determine what is in his best interest, including whether or not to foster a relationship with his biological siblings. Although it seems clear to us that DYFS should make available to Harry the appropriate therapeutic services to insure that he knows that nothing he did caused him to be estranged from his siblings, the decision to accept or reject such services lies in Harry\u2019s future adoptive parents. We thus affirm the termination of defendants\u2019 parental rights with respect to Harry.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Finally, we reject defendants\u2019 arguments that the Division\u2019s actions undermined the children\u2019s religious and cultural rights to be raised as Muslims. A Judgment of Guardianship \u201cpermanently severs the relationship between children and their biological parents,\u201d including, by implication, the right to dictate a child\u2019s cultural and religious upbringing. <em>In re Guardianship of J.P. and B.P., </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>494, 505, 852 A.2d 1093 (2004). DYFS\u2019 mission, and its driving concern in these type of cases, is first and foremost the physical and emotional well-being of the children. Although the continuation of a child\u2019s cultural and religious traditions may be laudatory, it cannot guide a decision to remove or not to remove; to terminate or not to terminate; or to pass over an otherwise suitable foster placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>DYFS shall retain custody of Kathy and James until otherwise ordered by the Family Part.
