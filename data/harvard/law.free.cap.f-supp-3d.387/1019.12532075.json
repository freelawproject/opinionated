CARNEY, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Douglas Troester brings this putative wage-and-hour class action against Defendant Starbucks Corporation (\"Starbucks\"), alleging claims for (1) failure to pay minimum and overtime wages, (2) failure to provide accurate written wage statements, (3) failure to timely pay all final wages, and (4) unfair competition. (Dkt. 1-1 [Complaint, hereinafter \"Compl.\"].) Troester alleges that Starbucks required its employees to perform certain tasks after clocking out and that Starbucks did not compensate its employees for these tasks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 7, 2014, Judge Gary Feess granted Starbucks summary judgment on all claims, holding the time Troester spent in and around the store after clocking out was not recoverable because it was \"de minimis.\" (Dkt. 37.) Troester appealed, and\n   the Ninth Circuit certified a question to the California Supreme Court, asking whether the federal Fair Labor Standards Act's de minimis doctrine applied to claims for unpaid wages under California Labor Code sections 510, 1194, and 1197.\n   <em>\n    Troester v. Starbucks Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12395542\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/680/511/#p512\">\n    680 F. App'x 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512 (9th Cir. 2016). The California Supreme Court held that \"the relevant California statutes and wage order have not incorporated the de minimis doctrine found in the [Fair Labor Standards Act] .... [and] do not allow employers to require employees to routinely work for minutes off the clock without compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    Troester v.

It further concluded that \"although California has a de minimis rule that is a background principle of state law, the rule is not applicable to the regularly reoccurring activities that are principally at issue here.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514715\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/235/820/#p848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In light of the California Supreme Court's answer to the certified question, the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded the case to this Court for further proceedings. Before the Court is Starbucks's motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 59 [hereinafter \"Mot.\"].) For the following reasons, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In February 2008, Starbucks hired Troester to work as a barista in one of its coffee shops. (Dkt. 64-4 [Defendant's Reply Separate Statement of Undisputed Facts, hereinafter \"DUF\"] 1-2.) Starbucks promoted Troester to shift supervisor in June 2008. (DUF 2.) During his employment, Troester worked at multiple Starbucks locations, including stores at Hollywood Way, Enterprise Landing, and Lankershim and Magnolia. (Dkt. 64-4 [Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Additional Separate Statement of Undisputed Facts, hereinafter \"PUF\"] 2.) In January 2011, Troester stopped working for Starbucks. (DUF 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While employed by Starbucks, Troester recorded his work time and clocked in and out using Starbucks's point-of-sale (\"POS\") system. (DUF 5.) Troester admits Starbucks always paid him for all the time he recorded in the POS system. (DUF 6.) Troester also recorded time in the punch communication log. Troester used the punch communication log to capture time spent on tasks such as running errands for the store before clocking in, assisting a customer in the store lobby while not clocked in, and talking to the store manager about \"official business\" while not clocked in. (DUF 8.) Troester used the punch communication log multiple times to record time spent on tasks performed after clocking out, such as picking up product for the store. (DUF 40.) Troester also used the punch communication log multiple times to correct wrong time punches. (DUF 41.) Troester admits that Starbucks always paid him for the time he recorded in the punch communication log. (DUF 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At issue in this case is the time that Troester allegedly worked off the clock on certain closing shifts while he was a shift supervisor. Troester claims that he performed unpaid work during shifts at the end of the business day. (DUF 11.) Troester asserts that Starbucks trained its employees to clock out before performing certain closing tasks. (PUF 19.) Based on the\n   software used by Starbucks, Troester had to clock out before using the store computer to transmit sales data to Starbucks headquarters. (DUF 13.) To send data to Starbucks headquarters, Troester selected \"close computer\" with the computer's mouse or keyboard, entered a password, and pressed the \"Y\" key. (DUF 14.) Troester then set the store alarm by typing a numeric code on the alarm panel located near the computer. (DUF 15.) The store's alarm system required employees leave the store within sixty seconds of setting the alarm. (DUF 22.) After activating the alarm, Troester exited and locked the front door. (DUF 23.) He then walked coworkers to their vehicles. (DUF 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In total, Troester contends he spent about four to ten minutes performing these tasks. Troester claims that it took him approximately \"one minute to two minutes\" to send the sales data and activate the alarm after clocking out. (DUF 17.) A comparison of the store's alarm records to Troester's time records indicates that Troester activated the alarm, on average, within one minute of clocking out. (DUF 19.) The comparison also indicates that Troester activated the alarm within two minutes of clocking out on more than 90 percent of his shifts. (DUF 20.) In total, Troester estimates that, from December 2008 to October 2010, he was not paid wages for the approximately 12 hours and 50 minutes of time spent between clocking out and activating the alarm. (PUF 34.) Troester also estimates that it took thirty seconds to walk out of the store after activating the alarm and that it took around fifteen seconds to lock the door. (DUF 24-25.) Troester estimates walking his coworkers to their cars took thirty-five to forty-five seconds. (DUF 27.) Troester contends he should be paid for the time he spent sending sales data to headquarters, setting the alarm, walking out of the store, locking the door, and walking coworkers to their cars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Troester also claims that he performed certain tasks off the clock on a less frequent basis. Troester contends that every \"couple of months,\" after clocking out and exiting the store, he brought the store's patio furniture inside the store after he and the other employees forgot to bring the patio furniture in while still on the clock. (DUF 29.) He also asserts that two or three times a month, after clocking out and exiting the store, he stayed outside the store with a coworker who was waiting for a ride. (DUF 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Starbucks first argues that the Court cannot apply the California Supreme Court's holding \"retroactively\" because it would violate due process. Starbucks also argues that Troester cannot recover for any tasks that occurred after he exited the store because these tasks were irregular or brief and not compensable. Finally, Starbucks argues that even if Troester's wage claims survive, his other claims fail for a variety of reasons.

While waiting for coworkers' rides, Troester was outside the store and had completed all his closing tasks. Troester admits that managers never instructed or told him to wait with his coworkers after their shifts, and Troester does not point to any Starbucks policy that required him to do so. He also presents no evidence that Starbucks knew or should have known that he was working off the clock by waiting with other employees for their rides. Troester therefore presents no evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact that the time he spent waiting for coworkers' rides is compensable as \"hours worked.\" Starbucks is entitled to partial summary judgment on this ground.

Bringing in Patio Furniture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Troester also seeks to recover for the time he spent bringing in patio furniture. According to Troester, every \"couple of months,\" after clocking out and exiting the store, Troester brought the store's patio furniture inside the store after he and the other employees forgot to do so while they were still on the clock. (DUF 29.) Troester never used the punch communication log to document the off-the-clock time he spent bringing in patio furniture. (DUF 39.) He also never raised any concerns with the store manager, the district manager, or the human resources department. (DUF 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Starbucks argues that Troester cannot recover for the time spent bringing in patio furniture because there is no evidence that Starbucks knew or should have known of this work. Troster only brought in the patio furniture off the clock if he or his coworkers forgot to do so while they were clocked in. (DUF 29.) Although Troester was no longer under Starbucks's control, Troester contends that he was \"suffered or permitted to work.\" To prove that he was \"suffered or permitted to work,\" however, Troester must prove that Starbucks had actual or constructive knowledge of his alleged off-the-clock work.\n   <em>\n    Morillion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"158011\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/22/575/#p582\">\n    22 Cal. 4th at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%203\">\n    94 Cal.Rptr.2d 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=995%20P.2d%20139\">\n    995 P.2d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Troester presents no evidence that Starbucks knew or should have known that Troester was occasionally bringing in patio furniture while off the clock. He never used the punch communication log to record this time and he never raised any concerns with management. (DUF 39, 42.) Troester has failed to present any evidence to create a dispute of material fact as to whether off-the-clock time spent bringing in patio furniture is compensable as \"hours worked.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v.

Cal. 2007) (granting summary judgment to defendant where employee failed to present evidence of the employer's knowledge that the employee worked off the clock).

Walking Coworkers to Cars\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Troester also seeks to recover for the time he spent walking his coworkers to their cars. Troester asserts that it was Starbucks's policy for shift supervisors to\n   walk coworkers to their vehicles at the end of a closing shift. A training document for shift supervisors states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Your job as a shift supervisor is to ensure that all of the closing tasks are completed, and not to complete all the closing tasks yourself.... [T]here are a few safety and security tasks that only the shift supervisor can handle ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Dkt. 62-23 Ex. T.) The document then lists a number of shift supervisor-specific closing tasks, including \"[e]nsure all pars/prep is made for the next day,\" \"[c]heck voicemail,\" \"[c]hange out all tills,\" \"[a]rm the alarm system,\" and, lastly, \"[w]alk partners to their vehicles.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Starbucks contends walking coworkers to their cars was not a job requirement, but a common courtesy. (PUF 28.) Troester claims that it took thirty-five to forty-five seconds to walk his coworkers to their cars. (DUF 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Starbucks argues that Troester cannot recover for the time he spent walking coworkers to their cars because Troester cannot prove that the time was \"hours worked.\" The training document, however, explicitly states that a shift supervisor must complete all closing tasks, including walking employees to their vehicles. Starbucks also evaluated shift supervisors based on their ability to perform closing duties and follow operational procedures to ensure the safety and security of their coworkers. (PUF 26.) Based on the training document, it is reasonable to infer that walking coworkers to their vehicles was one of a shift supervisor's responsibilities. A factfinder also might reasonably infer that Starbucks had at least constructive knowledge that their shift supervisors worked off the clock, since employees would walk out only after they had all clocked out and Starbucks requires at least two employees to be in the store at all times. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PUF 9.) There is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether Troester can recover for the time spent walking coworkers to their vehicles as \"hours worked.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Starbucks also argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because this task was irregular or brief and therefore falls under the California Supreme Court's narrower version of the de minimis rule. In holding that the de minimis rule did not apply to unpaid wages claims for regularly occurring activity, the California Supreme Court \"decline[d] to decide whether a de minimis principle may\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   apply to wage and hour claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Troester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514715\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/235/820/#p848\">\n    5 Cal. 5th at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514715\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/235/820/#p848\">\n    235 Cal.Rptr.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514715\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/235/820/#p848\">\n    421 P.3d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Until the California Supreme Court's decision in this case, it was reasonable for Starbucks to assert that it did not owe any wages under the de minimis doctrine. The DLSE Enforcement Manual suggested courts may apply the federal de minimis doctrine to state law claims, and a number of courts had in fact applied this doctrine to claims under California labor law. Although Starbucks's defense was ultimately unsuccessful, it was reasonable for Starbucks to assert this defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Starbucks also moves for summary judgment on Troester's wage statement claim. To prevail on his wage statement claim, Troester must prove that Starbucks committed a \"knowing and intentional\" violation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    Cal.
