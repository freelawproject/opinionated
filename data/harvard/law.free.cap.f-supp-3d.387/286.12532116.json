Campbell,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   during his removal proceedings. Docket Item 4 at 15. In those three years, the government has never given Campbell an individualized hearing to adjudicate the reasons for his detention: his risk of flight or dangerousness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   What is more, Campbell may be a United States Citizen. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has determined that there is \"a genuine dispute of material fact\" regarding Campbell's United States citizenship, \"requiring resolution by the District Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

For the following reasons, this Court concludes that, given its length, Campbell's ongoing detention without an individualized hearing addressing the reasons for his detention violates his right to due process. Therefore, the government may not continue to detain Campbell unless a neutral decision maker determines by clear and convincing evidence that his detention necessarily serves a legitimate and compelling regulatory purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts, taken from the record, come largely from filings with the United States Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

On July 14, 2016, Immigration Judge Steven J. Connelly summarily denied Campbell's motion and ordered him removed to Jamaica. Docket Item 5-2 at 49.
