Esurance issued a homeowner's insurance policy to Seth and Michelle Hamm, covering their residence in Coos County, Oregon. The policy was in effect during the relevant period and contained an exclusion for conduct which constitutes a criminal act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 18, 2018, Seth Hamm and Emilio Pina got into an altercation, during which Seth Hamm shot Pina with a firearm. On May 7, 2018, Seth Hamm pleaded guilty to Assault in the Third Degree with a firearm and was sentenced to thirty-six months in prison. Compl. Ex. C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 3, 2018, Pina sued Seth Hamm for his injuries stemming from the gunshot wound, seeking $1.6 million. Compl. Ex. D. Seth and Michelle Hamm have made a claim for Esurance to defend and indemnify Seth Hamm in that action. Esurance undertook to defend Seth Hamm under a reservation of rights. Pina subsequently dismissed his lawsuit with the intent to refile. As of yet, Pina has not refiled his suit against Seth Hamm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2018, Esurance filed this this action for declaratory relief. Esurance seeks a judgment declaring that the applicable policy provides no coverage for Seth and Michelle Hamm for claims made by Pina in the underlying lawsuit and that Esurance has no obligation to defend or indemnify Seth and Michelle Hamm for any injuries stemming from the criminal acts of Seth Hamm on March 18, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows that \"there is no genuine dispute as to any materials fact and the [moving party] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

R. Civ. P. 55(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the present case, Pina filed an Answer on the same day Esurance filed its Motion for Default. ECF Nos. 12, 13. Esurance's Motion is therefore DENIED as to Pina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the case of Michelle Hamm, Esurance has submitted an Affidavit of Service showing that Michelle Hamm was personally served on November 20, 2018. ECF No. 12-1. A Return of Service Executed as to Michelle Hamm was entered on December 6, 2018, and her answer was due on December 11, 2018. ECF No. 11. Michelle Hamm has not appeared or otherwise defended in this action and so the Court GRANTS Esurance's Motion for Entry of Default as to Michelle Hamm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant Emilio Pina has moved for judgment on the pleadings on the basis that this case was filed in the Medford Division, which is the wrong venue. Pursuant to Local Rule 3-2(b), the filing party must identify the division within the District of Oregon where \"divisional venue\" lies. For purposes of the Local Rules, \"divisional venue\" means \"the division of the Court in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of the property that is the subject of the action is situated.\" LR 3-2(b). The events that form the basis for this case occurred in Coos County, Oregon. Coos County is part of the District's Eugene Division. LR 3-2(a)(3). As such, the parties agree that the case should have been filed in the Eugene Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In cases where the complaint has been filed in the wrong division or district, the court \"shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Pina urges the Court to dismiss the case without prejudice and permit Esurance to refile in the Eugene Division. Such a remedy is, while permissible, not an efficient use of the parties' time or the Court's resources. The Court therefore finds that the interests of justice are served by transferring this case to the Eugene Division. This Court presides over cases filed in both the Eugene Division and the Medford Division and so shall continue to preside over this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Co. v. Morgan\n    </em>\n    , analyzes factual circumstances very similar to the present case. In\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    , a third party named Nicholson attended a party hosted by the insured, Adam Morgan and his mother Debby Morgan.\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n     123 F. Supp.3d at 1270\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . During the party, Adam participated in a violent assault against Nicholson. Adam was criminally charged for his conduct and pleaded guilty to Assault III. Nicholson subsequently brought a civil action against the Morgans in Marion County Circuit Court. The Morgans were insured by Allstate, which sought a declaratory judgment relieving it of the obligation to defend or indemnify Adam and Debby.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The criminal acts exclusion clause in the Allstate policy at issue in\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    is word-for-word identical to the Esurance policy in the present case.\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n     123 F. Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1272 ; Lanz Decl. Ex. C, at 30. In\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    , the court concluded that it was permitted to look beyond the allegations of the complaint to consider whether Adam's conviction for Assault III exercised a preclusive effect for purposes of Allstate's duty to defend and indemnify.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n     at 1275-76\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In making that assessment, the court concluded that the injuries described in Nicholson's complaint could not refer to anything other than the conduct covered by Adam's guilty plea.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n     at 1277-78\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court further concluded that Nicholson's injuries were covered by the criminal acts exclusion clause.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n     at 1277\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As such, the court found that Allstate had no duty to defend or indemnify Adam for Nicholson's injuries.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n     at 1278\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    In the present case, Pina's original complaint alleged that his injuries were the result of his having been shot by Seth Hamm. Lanz Decl. Ex. D, at 2. Pina further alleged that Seth Hamm pleaded guilty to and was convicted of recklessly causing injury to Pina by means of a firearm.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    This case is somewhat complicated by the fact that Pina has dismissed his underlying\n    state court complaint and has not yet re-filed it. Pina suggests that he might, through artful pleading, allege that he was injured by Seth Hamm without explicit reference to the fact that Seth Hamm was subsequently convicted of a criminal act. Pina does not suggest that the allegations contained in his original complaint are false or incorrect, however. Furthermore, Esurance has submitted a copy of the Second Amended Judgment showing Seth Hamm's conviction of Assault III with a firearm against Pina. Lanz Decl. Ex. A. Although this document falls outside of the underlying complaint and policy, the Court is permitted to consider it for the purposes of issue preclusion. As\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    was considering the effect of an Assault III conviction on an identical exclusionary clause, the Court finds\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    's reasoning especially persuasive. Consistent with\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    , this Court concludes that Seth Hamm's guilty plea and conviction exercise a preclusive effect with respect to whether Pina's injury was the reasonably expected result of an insured's criminal act. As the conduct underlying a conviction for Assault III constitutes a criminal act as described by the exclusionary clause of the Hamms' Esurance policy, the Court concludes that Esurance is relieved of its obligation to defend or indemnify Seth Hamm for the injuries he inflicted on Pina on March 18, 2018.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Duty to Defend and Indemnify Michelle Hamm\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Pina's original lawsuit does not name Michelle Hamm as a defendant. Lanz Decl. Ex. D. It contains no allegations concerning Michelle Hamm. Nor is there any evidence suggesting that Michelle Hamm has been charged with any criminal offense stemming from Pina's injuries. Nevertheless, Pina suggests that when he files his new complaint in Coos County Circuit Court, he might name Michelle Hamm as a defendant under an as-yet-unidentified theory of liability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Once again,\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    is instructive. In\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    , the Allstate policy contained the following provision:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    The terms of the policy impose joint obligations on the person named on the Policy Declarations as the insured and on that person's residence spouse. These persons are defined as you and your. This means that the responsibilities, acts and omissions of a person defined as you and your will be binding upon any other person defined as you and your.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    The terms of this policy impose joint obligations on persons defined as an insured person. This means that the responsibilities, acts and failures to act of a person defined as an insured person will be binding upon another person defined as an insured person.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n     123 F. Supp.3d at 1269\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The court determined that this \"joint obligation clause\" \"renders the criminal acts exclusion applicable to claims for negligence against other insureds.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    As such, the court held that Allstate was relieved of its obligation to defend any of the insured from any claim arising out of Adam's criminal acts.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027475\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/123/1266/#p1272\">\n     at 1269-70\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Esurance policy in the present case contains a functionally identical joint obligation clause. Lanz Decl Ex. C, at 6. As such, the Court find the reasoning of\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    especially persuasive. Although Pina has not articulated any theory of liability as to Michelle Hamm, the Court concludes that, as in\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    , the combination of the joint obligation clause and the criminal exclusion clause operate to relieve Esurance of the obligation to defend any of the insureds covered by the policy, including Michelle Hamm, for Pina's injuries stemming from the criminal acts of Seth Hamm on March 18, 2018.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Plaintiff's Motion for Entry of Default, ECF No. 12, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
