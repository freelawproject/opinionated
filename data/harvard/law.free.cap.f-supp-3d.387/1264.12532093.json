For reasons explained below, the court denies Mr. Hernandez-Mendez's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The government has charged Mr. Hernandez-Mendez, a Mexican citizen, with one count of illegal reentry under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Doc. 1. He has entered the country illegally four times, and he describes each entry in his motion. Specifically, his arguments focus on two of those illegal entries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Hernandez-Mendez illegally entered the country for the second time on November 15, 2017. Law enforcement officers arrested him in Kansas City, Kansas, and detained him. Doc. 18 at 2-3. That day, he received a Form I-862 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   18-1)-a Notice to Appear-that ordered him to appear before a United States Department of Justice immigration judge on a date and at a time \"[t]o be set.\" Doc. 18-1 at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Hernandez-Mendez also received a Spanish version of a Notice of Rights and Request for Disposition form, on which he indicated his request for a hearing before an immigration judge. Doc. 18 at 3. The Notice to Appear that Mr. Hernandez-Mendez conceded he received (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) also contained a Certificate of Service noting that the law enforcement officer who had served the Notice to Appear orally informed Mr. Hernandez-Mendez of \"the time and place of his ... hearing and of the consequences of failure to appear.\" Doc. 18-1 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 18 at 3-4 n.3; Doc. 21 at 3. Mr. Hernandez-Mendez apparently signed both the Notice to Appear and the Certificate of Service. Doc. 18-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The government asserts that Mr. Hernandez-Mendez retained multiple attorneys to represent him and, through counsel and while detained, asked for a continuance. He was sent a \"Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings\" at the Versailles, Missouri, county jail where he was detained. Doc. 21 at 3-4; Doc. 23-1. The immigration court set his new hearing for January 9, 2018. At this hearing, Mr. Hernandez-Mendez conceded that he had \"re-entered [the country] without permission.\" Doc. 18 at 3. Because Mr. Hernandez-Mendez already had departed the country once voluntarily, the presiding immigration judge informed him of his two options: (1) a removal order; or (2) additional time to find and consult counsel. Mr. Hernandez-Mendez chose the removal order. He was deported on January 19, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Hernandez-Mendez illegally entered the country for the third time on February 6, 2018, when Border Patrol agents arrested him near Santa Teresa, New Mexico. This time, the Department of Homeland Security served him with a Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order, or a Form I-871.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Essentially, this Notice asserted that the government could reinstate the January 9, 2018, immigration court order to remove Mr. Hernandez-Mendez again. But, this time, the government didn't deport Mr. Hernandez-Mendez immediately. Instead, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Mexico prosecuted him. Mr. Hernandez-Mendez pleaded guilty to illegal reentry. The court sentenced him, and, on March 6, 2018, he was deported again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, Mr. Hernandez-Mendez entered the country illegally for the fourth time. On June 27, 2018, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") officers arrested him in Kansas City, Kansas. Mr. Hernandez-Mendez told officers that he had entered the country illegally in April 2018. The Indictment in this case arises from this June 27 arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court held a hearing on Mr. Hernandez-Mendez's motion on April 25, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 22. In the sections below, the court discusses the statutory and case authorities governing the motion and addresses Mr. Hernandez-Mendez's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), which interpreted statutory provisions governing removal. In that case, the Court considered a notice to appear that didn't contain a date and time for defendant Wescley Fonseca Pereira's initial removal hearing. \"More than a year\" after the government had sent the defendant the notice to appear, \"the Immigration Court mailed Pereira a more specific notice setting the date and time for his initial hearing, but the notice was sent to the wrong address and was returned as undeliverable. As a result, Pereira failed to appear, and the Immigration Court ordered him removed in absentia.\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S. Ct. at 2107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pereira remained unaware of the proceedings and the removal order, and he stayed in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   evaluated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, which provides that the Attorney General \"may cancel removal of ... an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien ... has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A). But, the same section ends this 10-year period \"when [an] alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1229b(d)(1). The Court referred to \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) as the \"stop-time rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S. Ct. at 2108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \u00a7 1229b specifically references \u00a7 1229(a), the Court concluded that Congress had answered the \"narrow[ ]\" question whether \"a 'notice to appear' that does not specify the 'time and place at which the proceedings will be held,' as required by \u00a7 1229(a)(1)(G)(i), trigger[s] the stop-time rule[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since Congress had supplied a clear answer to this question, the Court concluded that it didn't need to \"resort to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference\" to agency interpretations and decisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court also employed several canons of statutory construction and evaluated practical considerations, but\n   ultimately held that \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(d)(1) and 1229(a) contained clear, unambiguous language. This language, the court held, meant that such a notice isn't sufficient to invoke the stop-time rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Hernandez-Mendez's motion here asserts two main arguments: one challenges the January 9, 2018, removal order, and the other challenges the March 6, 2018, removal based on the January 9 order. The court addresses these arguments, in turn, in the two sections, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Deficient Notice to Appear\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Does\n    <em>\n     Pereira\n    </em>\n    require a notice to appear to contain the time and place of the removal hearing to establish the immigration court's subject matter jurisdiction?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Hernandez-Mendez primarily asserts that notices to appear must contain time and place information for removal hearings under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   . Without that crucial information, Mr. Hernandez-Mendez argues, a notice to appear is void, and it divests the immigration court of subject matter jurisdiction over those removal proceedings. Mr. Hernandez-Mendez recognizes that our court has rejected this argument several times. But, he asserts, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   categorized\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) -which includes the \"time and place\" requirement-as \"definitional.\" Doc. 18 at 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S. Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2116 ). He also argues that, under established statutory construction rules, \" 'identical words ... used in different parts of the same act ... are intended to have the same meaning.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S. Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2115 ). Mr. Hernandez-Mendez rejects BIA decisions and regulations such as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1003.15, and 1003.18, which don't require notices to appear to contain time, date, or place information. These decisions and regulations, he contends, directly contravene Congress's explicit requirement in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) that notices to appear must indeed contain the \"time and place\" of removal hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But, recent cases from our court show that Mr. Hernandez-Mendez is not the first to invoke\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   for these arguments.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Kan. Oct. 15, 2018). In all these cases, our court has interpreted\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   narrowly and denied several defendants' motions to dismiss their indictments. Specifically, the court has concluded that a notice to appear omitting the time, date, or place for a defendant's removal hearing does not violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and thus does not divest the immigration court of subject matter jurisdiction over removal proceedings. This outcome aligns with decisions from the Sixth and Ninth Circuits. Both courts have held that an initial notice to appear lacking time, date, or place information did not, alone, deprive an immigration court of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Cardenas-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201058197\">\n    2019 WL 1058197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6 ;\n   <em>\n    Fernandez-Casas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201058198\">\n    2019 WL 1058198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6 ;\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Valadez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201058200\">\n    2019 WL 1058200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6. Also, this court has analogized service of a notice to appear under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to service of process in civil cases.

Mr. Hernandez-Mendez only advances arguments this court has rejected over the last few months. The court explicitly has declined to adopt his subject matter jurisdiction argument that tries to extend\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   beyond its \"narrow\" holding.\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.

And, Mr. Hernandez-Mendez's case is distinguishable from the facts of\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   : Here, Mr. Hernandez-Mendez appeared for his hearing. He signed a Certificate of Service attesting that the law enforcement officer who served him had provided him with oral notice of the time and place of his removal hearing. The government also asserts that Mr. Hernandez-Mendez received notice about the continued date for his removal hearing while detained.

In other words, Mr. Hernandez-Mendez argues, \"Congress provided explicit guidance on how to utilize the hearing notice ... to confer jurisdiction on the immigration court.\" Doc. 18 at 23.

Judge Teeter construed \u00a7 1229(a) -and the service requirements in that section-as analogous to service of process requirements under rules such as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4.

Mr. Hernandez-Mendez hasn't persuaded the court that the transitional statute's reference to the immigration court's \"jurisdiction\" suffices to confer subject matter jurisdiction on immigration courts through notices to appear. \"Congress has specifically authorized immigration judges to conduct removal proceedings and to decide whether an alien is removable under immigration laws.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205013523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (first citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (c) ; then citing\n   <em>\n    Ins.

Instead, he asserts merely that his first removal order, based on a deficient Notice to Appear that divested the immigration court of subject matter jurisdiction, nullified his second removal order. And, he contends, his second removal order cannot \"independently support an illegal reentry charge\" because it extends only as far as the purportedly void first removal order. Doc. 18 at 28. This court consistently has held that the requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 1326(d)(1)-(3) control (and the Tenth Circuit hasn't reached a different conclusion).
