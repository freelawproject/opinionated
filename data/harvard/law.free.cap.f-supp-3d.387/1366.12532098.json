BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This insurance coverage dispute arises from a motor vehicle accident on September 17, 2018 involving Plaintiff and Jazmen Koht, an uninsured or underinsured driver (\"\n   <strong>\n    Accident\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) Ms. Koht allegedly caused the Accident by carelessly and negligently making a left turn into Plaintiff's path. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) At the time of the Accident, Plaintiff had an insurance policy with Defendant that provided $200,000 in uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage (\"\n   <strong>\n    Policy\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 14, p. 2;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Doc. 1-1, p. 10 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Policy Disclosure\n   </strong>\n   \").) Plaintiff contends Defendant refused to pay the full amount of her claim from the Accident, so she sued in state court on March 13, 2019 for: (1) uninsured motorist benefits; and (2) bad faith under Florida law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1, \u00b6\u00b6 7-26.) As relief Plaintiff seeks,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"the full amount of uninsured motorist benefits under the Policy,\" the total amount of damages Plaintiff suffered, attorneys' fees, and post-judgment interest. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant removed the case here on April 10, 2019, invoking the Court's diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Doc. 1 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Notice\n   </strong>\n   \").) Relevant here, the Notice states that it is facially apparent from the complaint that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 based on the complaint's demand for the policy limits and allegations that Plaintiff is entitled to the policy limits and that her injuries were in excess of the policy limits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.) Defendant then moved to dismiss the bad faith claim as premature (Doc. 3), and the Court granted the motion (Doc. 12).

While the existence of policy limits alone in excess of the jurisdictional threshold may be insufficient to establish the necessary amount in controversy, without more, here the plaintiff seeks the policy limits in her complaint, and evidence shows those limits exceed $75,000, thus it is facially apparent from the complaint that the amount in controversy requirement is satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keenan v.

Indeed, Plaintiff even concedes the policy provided $200,000 in uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. (Doc. 14, p. 2.) Further, although the complaint lacks specific allegations or evidence of the extent of Plaintiff's injuries, Plaintiff alleges in her bad faith claim that she \"is entitled to the limit of uninsured motorist benefits under the Policy\" and that she suffered \"serious and permanent injuries ... the value of which were clearly in excess of the policy limits\"-supporting that the amount in controversy requirement is met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 19(c).) Because Plaintiff contends her damages exceed the policy limits of $200,000 in the uninsured motorist benefits claim (Doc. 1-1, p. 4), it is facially apparent from Plaintiff's complaint that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, so Defendant established that removal is proper.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keenan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206312853\">\n    2017 WL 6312853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 ;\n   <em>\n    Hudspeth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208221940\">\n    2016 WL 8221940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's arguments in support of remand are rejected. The irony of the Plaintiff contending that the Defendant was in bad faith by not capitulating the full $200,000 policy limits in payment of the claim now contending that the same Defendant has failed to establish the requisite amount in controversy to provided federal jurisdiction is not lost on the Court. First, Plaintiff argues that her complaint demanded damages in excess of $15,000 and that policy limits alone are not indicators of the amount in controversy. (Doc. 14, pp. 3, 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-11.) But in the cases Plaintiff cites where policy limits were insufficient to establish the amount in controversy, the complaints did not explicitly demand the policy limits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garrison v.

Because Plaintiff's complaint explicitly demanded \"the full amount of the insured motorist benefits under the Policy\" (Doc. 1-1, p. 4), the Court is persuaded that the amount in controversy is the upper policy limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Next, Plaintiff argues that Defendant cannot rely on her bad faith claim, demand letter and settlement correspondence, or Civil Remedies Notice of Insurer Violations (\"\n   <strong>\n    CRN\n   </strong>\n   \") to establish the amount in controversy. (Doc. 14, pp. 11-14.) But, as discussed above, allegations in bad faith claims may be considered in assessing the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 5. The same is true for the demand letters and CRN, although such evidence is unnecessary when the requisite amount in controversy is facially apparent from the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201167329\">\n    2018 WL 1167329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 (citing cases considering demand letters and CRNs in determining the amount in controversy);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudspeth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208221940\">\n    2016 WL 8221940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (noting that when the requisite amount in controversy is facially apparent, \"a defendant need not submit additional evidence\").
