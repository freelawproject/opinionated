Plaintiffs are young immigrants who have been determined by the courts of the State of Washington to have been abused, neglected, or abandoned by one or both of their parents. They seek classification as Special Immigrant Juveniles (\"SIJ\") as a pathway to lawful permanent residency in the United States. They contend that defendants - the United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), the individuals in charge of DHS and USCIS, and the director of the National Benefits Center - adopted a new policy in 2018 that unlawfully denies them SIJ status.

Pub. L. No. 110-457 \u00a7 235(d),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%205044\">\n    122 Stat. 5044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). First, the TVPRA expanded the universe of immigrants would could obtain SIJ status. It removed the requirement that applicants be eligible for long-term foster care, broadening the statute to apply instead to juveniles for whom \"reunification with 1 or both of the immigrant's parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis found under state law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%205044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 235(d)(1)(B) (amending\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J) ). It also made SIJ status available to juveniles who had been \"legally committed to, or placed under the custody of, an agency or department of a State, or an individual or entity appointed by a State or juvenile court\" in addition to those who had been \"declared dependent on a juvenile court.\" Second, the TVPRA clarified that an applicant's eligibility for SIJ status is dependent on the juvenile's age at the time he or she applied for SIJ status rather than at the time the application was processed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 235(d)(6). Finally, the amendments removed the requirement that the agency \"expressly consent\" to the state court's dependency order, instead requiring \"consent[ ] to the grant of special immigration juvenile status.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 235(d)(1)(B). USCIS exercises its \"consent\" authority by verifying whether the SIJ petition is bona fide, \"meaning that the juvenile court order was not sought primarily to obtain the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence\" but \"rather to obtain relief from abuse or neglect.\" Dkt. #25 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following enactment of the TVPRA, a petitioner for SIJ status must be (a) under twenty-one years of age, (b) unmarried, (c) declared dependent on a juvenile court or placed in the custody of a state agency or individual appointed by the court, and (d) the subject of state court findings that (i)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   reunification with one or both parents is not viable because of abuse, abandonment, neglect, or similar basis under state law and (ii) it is not in the juvenile's best interests to be returned to his or her country of origin. Despite the amendments, the implementing regulations continue to reference pre-TVPRA statutory text conditioning SIJ status on eligibility for long-term foster care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (c)(4)-(5) (2009) (\"SIJ regulation\"). Defendants rely heavily on these regulations in support of their rather convoluted argument that a state court is competent to make the factual findings required by the SIJ statute only if it has the power to reunify the juvenile with his or her biological parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Washington Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Washington juvenile courts have jurisdiction to determine the care and custody of youth up to the age of twenty-one in certain circumstances. Pursuant to RCW 13.34.267, juvenile courts may, with the consent of the youth, maintain jurisdiction over dependency proceedings after the juvenile turns eighteen \"to promote permanency and positive outcomes\" and counteract the increased risks facing dependent juveniles when they leave the child welfare system. RCW 13.34.267 (Findings - 2013 Wash. Legis. Serv. Ch. 332 (S.S.S.B. 5405) (West)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the context of this extended foster care program, Washington courts have jurisdiction to make the findings necessary for an immigrant youth to pursue SIJ status. Juvenile courts in Washington may also extend their jurisdiction over youth if, prior to his or her eighteenth birthday, criminal proceedings are pending or an extension is necessary for disposition or sentence to be imposed or enforced. RCW 13.40.300(3). In this context, the state court has authority to commit a juvenile to Washington's Department of Social and Health Services (\"DSHS\") for placement in a juvenile facility or release to a \"responsible adult\" at least up until the age of twenty-one (and in some cases until the age of twenty-five). RCW 13.40.040(5) ; RCW 13.40.300. When committing juveniles to DSHS, courts have the power to make the findings necessary for an immigrant youth to pursue SIJ status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2017, the Washington legislature established the Vulnerable Youth Guardianship (\"VYG\") program specifically for juveniles aged eighteen to twenty-one years old. RCW 13.90.900. The VYG program allows the juvenile to consent to the appointment of a guardian even if he or she was not previously in the child welfare system. The legislature found that \"[o]pening court doors for the provision of a vulnerable youth guardianship serves the state's interests in eliminating human trafficking, preventing further victimization of youth, decreasing reliance on public resources, reducing youth homelessness, and offering protection for youth who may otherwise be targets of traffickers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In creating the VYG program, the legislature intended to fix a disconnect between state and federal law. RCW 13.90.901(1)(d). Under federal immigration law, SIJ status is available to youth until the age of twenty-one.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). In Washington, however, youth who were not already under the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts had limited opportunities to request that the state court make the findings necessary to apply for SIJ status. As of 2017,\n   Washington extended juvenile court jurisdiction to cover \"judicial determinations regarding the custody and care of youth\" between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one and to make findings necessary for a juvenile in that age group to seek SIJ status. RCW 13.90.901(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff Leobardo Moreno Galvez came to the United States on his own when he turned 14 and has lived with relatives and friends during the past six years. In 2016, Moreno Galvez was arrested for Minor in Possession at seventeen years of age. The Skagit County Superior Court adjudicating the offense extended its jurisdiction past Moreno Galvez' eighteenth birthday. When he was eighteen years old, the Superior Court placed him in state custody and found that (a) it had jurisdiction under state law to make a judicial determination about his care and custody, (b) Moreno Galvez should be legally committed to or placed in the custody of a state agency as of October 20, 2016, (c) reunification with one or both parents was not viable because they had sent him away years ago and \"failed to provide for his basic needs including food, shelter, clothing and education,\" and (d) it would not be in Moreno Galvez' best interests to return to Mexico. Dkt. #4-4 at 2-3. Six weeks later, Moreno Galvez submitted a Form I-360 Petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status to USCIS. On December 20, 2018, USCIS denied the petition, stating that \"the evidence you submitted does not establish that the state court had jurisdiction under state law to make a legal conclusion about returning you to your parent(s)' custody.\" Dkt. #4-7 at 3. The denial notified Moreno Galvez that he was not lawfully present in the United States and that, if he did not depart within thirty-three days of the letter, USCIS may commence removal proceedings against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff Jose Luis Vicente Ramos entered the United States as an unaccompanied minor in 2016, when he was seventeen years old. He eventually went to live with a cousin in Vancouver, Washington. In February 2018, Vicente Ramos was detained by USCIS. Utilizing the VYG program, Vicente Ramos consented to the appointment of his cousin as his guardian and requested that the Pierce County Superior Court make the necessary SIJ findings. It did so and, ten days later, Vicente Ramos submitted a Form I-360 Petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status to USCIS. The petition was denied on February 5, 2019, on the ground that Vicente Ramos had failed to show that the state court had jurisdiction \"to make a legal conclusion about returning you to your parent(s)' custody.\" Dkt. #4-10 at 3. Vicente Ramos was ordered removed in May 2019. He remains detained in Northwest Detention Center while an administrative appeal is pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff Angel de Jesus Mu\u00f1oz Olivera and his younger brother presented themselves at the border on August 30, 2017, intending to seek help from a relative living in Kennewick, Washington. The brothers were separated, however, and Mu\u00f1oz Olivera was detained by USCIS for over three months. Utilizing the VYG program, Mu\u00f1oz Olivera consented to the appointment of the Kennewick relative as his guardian and obtained the factual findings necessary to support an SIJ petition from the Pierce County Juvenile Court. On November 15, 2017, Mu\u00f1oz Olivera submitted his Form I-360 Petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status to USCIS. The agency has not yet adjudicated the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    D. USCIS Change in Policy Regarding Petitions for SIJ Status\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the summer of 2017, USCIS began holding SIJ applications for individuals between\n   the ages of 18 and 21. USCIS had centralized adjudication of SIJ applications in November 2016 and was awaiting legal guidance from the USCIS Office of Chief Counsel (\"OCC\") regarding a new policy that would affect SIJ adjudications for that age group. The new guidance was issued in February 2018 and specifies that, in order for a state court to be one of \"competent jurisdiction\" to make the necessary SIJ findings, the court must have the power not only to determine whether reunification with a parent is appropriate or viable, but also \"to order reunification, if warranted.\" Dkt. #4-2 at 2. A USCIS spokesperson acknowledged the practical effect of this new policy in April 2018:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Since most courts cannot place a child back in the custody of their parent once the child reaches the age of majority (as determined by state [sic] and in most instances that is age 18), those state courts do not have power and authority to make the reunification finding for purposes of SIJ eligibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dkt. #4-4 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant National Benefits Center now handles all SIJ petitions. In fiscal year 2018, it received approximately 18,000 SIJ petitions, making up less than .1% of its entire caseload. The number of SIJ petitions tripled between 2014 and 2018. As of September 24, 2018, the National Benefits Center had a backlog of 32,518 SIJ petitions, with 23,589 of them pending for more than 180 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") mandates that district courts set aside agency action if it is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). Plaintiffs argue that USCIS's February 2018 change in policy violates the APA because it is inconsistent with the governing statute, was imposed without explanation, and was issued without the required notice and comment period. They also argue that USCIS' delayed consideration of SIJ petitions past 180 days is unlawful. USCIS argues that its interpretation of the governing statute is reasonable given the purposes for which the SIJ program was created and that adequate notice of the policy change was provided because its Policy Manual is available to the public and the new guidance merely interprets existing law and is therefore not subject to the requirements for notice, public comment, or input before implementation. In addition, USCIS argues that any delays in processing SIJ petitions should be excused and that the Court lacks jurisdiction to interfere with its initiation or conduct of removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    1. In Accordance with Federal Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The primary issue in this case is whether the new policy requiring that a state court have the power to order reunification\n   with a parent before it will be deemed competent to make factual findings regarding the viability of reunification and/or the best interests of the juvenile violates the SIJ statute or is a reasonable interpretation thereof. The Court finds that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the new policy is \"not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). There is no textual authority for the new requirement in the statute. The statute does not require that reunification be possible\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or otherwise define state court competency by whether the juvenile has reached the \"age of majority.\" Congress expressly made SIJ status available to juveniles up to the age of twenty-one and, as a USCIS spokesperson acknowledged shortly after the new policy went into effect, the change in policy generally excludes from protection any juvenile over the age of eighteen. Dkt. #4-4 at 10. The statute requires only that the youth be declared dependent on a juvenile court or placed in the custody of a state agency or an individual appointed by the juvenile court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J). The implementing regulations define \"juvenile court\" as \"a court located in the United States having jurisdiction under State law to make judicial determinations about the custody and care of juveniles.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). As discussed above, Washington law grants the courts of the state jurisdiction to make judicial determinations regarding the custody and care of youth between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one in certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 13.34.267 ; RCW 13.40.040(5) ; RCW 13.40.300 ; RCW 13.90.901(1)(a). The Washington courts that placed Moreno Galvez in state custody and appointed guardians for Vicente Ramos and Mu\u00f1oz Olivera had jurisdiction under state law to determine their care and custody\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, pursuant to the plain language of the governing statute and regulations, had jurisdiction to make the required SIJ findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   USCIS argues, however, that in order to give effect to Congress' intent when creating the SIJ program, it must be permitted to impose additional requirements or limitations so that the program is not used for the purpose of obtaining immigration benefits, as opposed to protecting a child from abuse or neglect. Using Mu\u00f1oz Olivera's case as an example, USCIS argues that the \"capacity to reunify\" criteria is reasonable and necessary because it allows the agency to reject petitions, such as Mu\u00f1oz Olivera's, that are based on a formulaic state court order issued while Mu\u00f1oz Olivera was detained at the border and without any sort of proceeding or hearing common in child welfare law. Dkt. #25 at 28. USCIS also suggests, without citation to authority, that Congress intended that state courts act only within the scope of the child welfare laws that existed at some unspecified point in the past when making SIJ determinations, and that the new wave of state laws that allow eighteen to twenty-one year olds to request the appointment\n   of a guardian do not create courts of \"competent jurisdiction\" for purposes of the SIJ statute because they are not steeped in and based on traditional child welfare law. Dkt. #25 at 25. Both arguments appear to be based on a concern that new laws and/or lax procedures will encourage abuses of the SIJ benefit by recent immigrants seeking lawful permanent residence status as opposed to child protective services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court assumes, for purposes of this motion, that the agency has a legitimate concern regarding potential abuses of the SIJ program. Nevertheless, its choice of remedy - to impose an additional requirement not contemplated by the statute and which excludes from the program an age group that Congress intended to benefit - is not only unreasonable, but unnecessary. The statute and existing USCIS policies address the agency's stated concern in two ways. First, pursuant to the statute, the state court must make an explicit finding that the juvenile should not be returned to one or both parents because of abuse, abandonment, neglect, or a similar ground that is disqualifying under state law. If the state court has reason to believe that an immigrant is attempting to game the system by making false claims of endangerment, the predicate finding should not be made. The fact of endangerment and the best interests of the child are issues within the traditional expertise of the state courts, and the SIJ statute, not surprisingly, assigns this fact-finding task to the state court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J)(i)-(ii).

Pursuant to agency policies, the purpose of this consent is to verify whether the SIJ petition is bona fide, meaning that the juvenile court order was not sought primarily to obtain the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, but rather to obtain relief from abuse or neglect. 6 Pol. Man. part J, ch. 2(D)(5). If USCIS concludes that a petition was improperly motivated, it has discretion to withhold consent and deny SIJ status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   USCIS did not exercise its discretion under the \"consent\" provision as to any of the named plaintiffs, however. Instead, it ignored state law - which clearly granted to the state courts jurisdiction to make custody and care determinations for named plaintiffs - and the state courts' factual determinations, declaring those courts incompetent solely because they lacked the authority to issue a certain type of custody order, namely reunification with a parent. The requirement is inconsistent with the governing statute and unnecessary to safeguard the program. The Court finds, as have the three other courts that have analyzed the issue, that the imposition of the \"reunification\" requirement is inconsistent with the SIJ statute's plain language, exceeded the agency's authority, and is unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    W.A.O. v.

Moreno Galvez had to wait more than two years for his petition to be adjudicated. USCIS took almost eight months to adjudicate Vicente Ramos' petition. Mu\u00f1oz Olivera's petition remains pending over a year and a half after it was filed. At least two of the three named plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed on the merits of their unreasonable delay claim, and, in the absence of evidence that Vicente Ramos' petition raised novel or complex issues which caused the delay in its adjudication, he has raised serious questions going to the merits of his delay claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Here, plaintiffs have demonstrated\n   that they will suffer irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction. If USCIS is permitted to continue to rely on its interpretation of the SIJ statute and, in Mu\u00f1oz Olivera's case, to delay adjudication indefinitely, plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm by losing eligibility for SIJ status and the benefits that go along with that status. For example, SIJ designees are exempt from a variety of grounds for removal, such as \"being found to be a 'public charge,' lacking a 'valid entry document,' or having 'misrepresented a material fact'-while seeking admission into the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Osorio-Martinez v.

In addition, SIJ status allows the juvenile to submit an application to adjust his or her immigration status to lawful, which was the reason Congress created the SIJ classification in the first place.

Dkt. #25 at 32-33. Plaintiffs' claims arise from the improper denial of the SIJ petitions, a consequence of which is the initiation or threatened initiation of removal proceedings. In order to retain jurisdiction over the parties and ensure that relief can be afforded if plaintiffs are able to establish that the denials were unlawful, the Court has the power to temporarily enjoin removals that would occur only because of the government's unlawful\n   action and that would effectively bar plaintiffs' ability to pursue SIJ status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
