Before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 21), supported by an accompanying brief (Doc. No. 18). Plaintiff filed a response (Doc. No. 23), and Defendants replied (Doc. No. 28). For the below-stated reasons, Defendants' motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    ALLEGED FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Wachter, Inc. (hereinafter \"Plaintiff\"), a Kansas corporation registered to do business in the state of Tennessee, is a national provider of infrastructure services, communications equipment, and technical support. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 14). Plaintiff's services include on-site wired and wireless network infrastructure, telephone and structured cabling, design, installation, and electrical services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 13, 2010, Plaintiff hired Brian Pitts as an Account Project Manager to manage multi-client complex projects in Nashville, Tennessee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). On December 5, 2011, Plaintiff promoted Mr. Pitts to Local Business Unit Manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). As Local Business Unit Manager, Mr. Pitts' responsibilities included leading, coaching, and managing Plaintiff's Nashville office; managing projects; and monitoring profits and losses for the business unit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). On September 20, 2017, Plaintiff promoted Mr. Pitts to Local Business Account Manager and he was responsible for seeking and maintaining new customer opportunities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21). On July 22, 2013, Plaintiff hired Josh Estes as a foreman to manage projects for customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As part of their employment, Plaintiff provided Mr. Pitts and Mr. Estes with an email account and access to Plaintiff's computer system which contained certain confidential and trade secret information including, but not limited to, pricing and other financial data; customer lists; customer requirements; customer contacts; and other nonpublic business information about Plaintiff, its customers, and suppliers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). As a condition of their employment, Mr. Pitts and Mr. Estes signed [Plaintiff's] Employee Handbook, which contains a Conflict of Interest policy that provides, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of Wachter's business dealings....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Personal gain may result not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant ownership in a firm with which [Plaintiff] does business, but also when an employee or relative receives any kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any transaction or business dealings involving [Plaintiff].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27). The Employee Handbook also contains a confidentiality policy that provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   No one is permitted to remove or make copies of any [of Plaintiff's] records, reports or documents without prior management approval. Disclosure of confidential information could lead to termination, as well as other possible legal action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the course of their employment with Plaintiff, Mr. Estes and Mr. Pitts accessed their email accounts provided by Plaintiff and Plaintiff's computer system to review and obtain data for their own personal benefit and/or for the benefit of Cabling Innovations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). Mr. Pitts forwarded emails from his Plaintiff-provided email account to his personal and/or Cabling Innovations email account, Mr. Estes, and Megan Pitts (Mr. Pitts' spouse) without Plaintiff's authorization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 30-31). The following are examples of how Mr. Pitts used the information he obtained through his employment with Plaintiff to bid for/obtain work on behalf of Cabling Innovations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 In February 2017, Mr. Pitts utilized Plaintiff's resources and confidential information to recommend contracting work with Cabling Innovations to Plaintiff's customer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 In November 2017, Mr. and Ms. Pitts utilized Plaintiff's resources and confidential information to submit a bid to Plaintiff's customer on behalf of Cabling Innovations for work at the eMIIDS project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 In February 2018, Mr. Pitts utilized Plaintiff's resources and confidential information to submit a bid to Plaintiff's customer on behalf of Cabling Innovations for work at the Medhost project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 In March 2018, Mr. Pitts and Mr. Estes utilized Plaintiff's resources and confidential information to obtain and perform work for Plaintiff's customer on behalf of Cabling Innovations at the E|Spaces Chattanooga project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 In April 2018, Mr. Pitts utilized Plaintiff's confidential information to submit a bid to Plaintiff's customer on behalf of Cabling Innovations for work at the MDF project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). The work obtained from Plaintiff's customers would have not been\n   obtained by Cabling Innovations but for Mr. Pitts' sharing of Plaintiff's confidential information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). Also during Mr. Pitts' employment, he expensed to Plaintiff entertainment expenses he claimed were for the benefit of Plaintiff's customer, when the expenses were actually for the benefit of Mr. Pitts and/or Cabling Innovations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). Plaintiff terminated Mr. Pitts on April 27, 2018. (Id. at \u00b6 22). Mr. Estes resigned on February 2, 2018.

After all, conduct supports a civil claim under the CFAA only if it falls within the statute's criminal prohibitions.

Under the rule of lenity, \"ambiguities are generally resolved in favor of the party accused of violating the law,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Some courts in other circuits have held that such factual circumstances state a claim under the CFAA, against either the plaintiff's employee or the employee's subsequent employer who was in cahoots with the employee while the employee was still employed by the plaintiff.

Each case relied on agency principles to hold that the plaintiff's employee lost the authorized access previously possessed when the employee ceased to be a loyal employee (agent) of the plaintiff.

Plaintiff argues that it properly alleged interception by alleging that Mr. Pitts intercepted communications meant for Plaintiff and sent that information to his personal email account, to his email accounts associated with Cabling Innovations, and to Mr. Estes, and Megan Pitts (agents or employees of Cabling Innovations). However, this argument is at odds with the actual allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint. Plaintiff alleges numerous times that any emails forwarded by Mr. Pitts were forwarded by Mr. Pitts from Mr. Pitts' email account in Plaintiff's email system. (Doc.

In that case, the court found a former employee violated the SCA as a matter of law when he used the log-in information\n   <em>\n    of another person\n   </em>\n   , a former co-worker, to spy on the activities of his former company; thus, the plaintiff did not have authorization himself to access the information. That is vastly different from the situation here, where Plaintiff specifically alleges that Mr. Pitts \"was authorized to access and use [Plaintiff's] email system\" and there is no allegation that Mr. Pitts used anyone else's log-in information.

In\n   <em>\n    Sherman\n   </em>\n   , a former employee was accused of violating the SCA, by continuing to use, after he left employment, his personal access code to log on to the same business account (which was hosted by a third party) that he had used while still employed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527132\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/94/817/#p820\">\n    94 F.

The court found that the plaintiff failed to state an SCA claim because the Complaint lacked any allegations of the former employees' \"clear[ ] and [ ] explicit restriction on access [occasioned by his departure from his employer].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527132\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/94/817/#p820\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11527132\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/94/817/#p820\">\n    at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like in\n   <em>\n    Sherman\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's Complaint does not contain any allegations the Mr. Pitts accessed his email account provided by Plaintiff or any of Plaintiff's information at any time without authority, and in fact, alleges the opposite. Accordingly, based on the allegations in the Complaint, Mr. Pitts' act of forwarding the emails did not exceed his authority to lawful access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In response, Plaintiff's concede that \"if all that occurred here was that [Mr.] Pitts accessed his email [from his account with Plaintiff] to forward those emails to his personal email account, there would be no liability.\" (Doc. No. 23 at 12). Plaintiff argues, however, that it was not Mr. Pitts accessing his emails; instead, it was Cabling Innovations, through its owner (Mr. Pitts), who was accessing emails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The court in\n   <em>\n    Cardinal Health\n   </em>\n   rejected a somewhat similar argument. There, the plaintiff argued that even though the former employee was authorized to access his email account with his former employer, the corporation to which the plaintiff sent the information was not granted access. Thus, according to the plaintiff, the corporation (working through the plaintiff's former employee), in an unauthorized manner, intentionally made use of and \"accessed\" the computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The court rejected this \"strained reading\" of the term \"access\" and reasoned that \"[c]onduct such as receiving unauthorized materials and discussing those materials implicates 'disclosure' and 'use' of those materials, and it is settled that the SCA does not punish 'disclosing' and 'using' the unauthorized materials.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 978. The court explained that its reading of the term \"access\" was not \"unreasonably narrow,\" as the plaintiff argued, \"but [was] the logical interpretation of a large body of case law that all points in the same direction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court finds the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Cardinal Health\n   </em>\n   convincing. The fact that Mr. Pitts partly owned Cabling Innovations does not change the fact that he had valid access to Plaintiff's information even if he would have lost that access had\n   Plaintiff known that he allegedly sought to use it to benefit Cabling Innovations. Accordingly, Plaintiff's SCA claim falls into the \"user\" exception to the SCA, and thus Plaintiff fails to state an SCA claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sun West Mortgage Co. v.

Thus, the definition of a 'trade secret' under the Act is\n   <em>\n    sufficiently broad\n   </em>\n   to include information which at common law would have been considered [mere] confidential information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2047-25-1702\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2047-25-1702\">\n    at *13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). As the Court in\n   <em>\n    Hauck\n   </em>\n   explained, \"Despite [TUTSA's] apparently limiting language displacing only 'conflicting tort, restitutionary, and other law ... providing civil remedies for\n   <em>\n    misappropriation of a trade secret\n   </em>\n   ,\" the [T]UTSA's preemption provision has generally been interpreted to abolish all free-standing alternative causes of action\n   <em>\n    for theft or misuse of confidential, proprietary, or otherwise secret information falling short of trade secret status\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , idea misappropriation, information piracy, theft of commercial information, etc.).\"\n   <em>\n    Hauck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8967820\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/375/649/#p654\">\n    375 F.
