The motion has been fully briefed and is ripe for decision. (Docs. 34, 39, 52, 54, 60, 62, 65, 67, 68, 73, 74, 82, 83, 86.) Defendants' motions are GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART for the reasons stated herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Materials Outside the Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This action arises from the shooting of Matthew Holmes by McPherson County Sheriff's Deputy Chris Somers on August 28, 2017. Before setting forth the facts applicable to the pending motions, the court must first determine whether materials outside the pleading should be considered by the court at this stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Videos of the Incident\n   </em>\n   . Multiple videos have been submitted as exhibits in this matter. The videos include both videos from cameras worn by Defendant officers\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and from patrol cars. The following videos have been submitted: 1) Skyler Hinton's body cam video (Doc. 39, Exh. 1); 2) Joshua Hulse's dash cam video (Doc. 39, Exh. 2); 3) Officer Minkevitch's body cam video (Doc. 34, Exh. A); 4) Officer Hawpe's body cam video (Doc. 34, Exh. B); 5) Deputy Gayer's body cam video (Doc. 34, Exh. C); and 6) Chris Somers' body cam video (Doc. 34, Exh. D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants assert that the court may consider the videos on the pending motions to dismiss because the \"video\" is referenced in the complaint and central to the claims. Plaintiff's complaint makes one reference to the \"video.\" In paragraph 41, Plaintiff states that \"Defendant Somers' account that Mr. Holmes gained control of a weapon is contradicted by the video of the shooting.\" (Doc. 1 at 7.) Plaintiff did not attach any video to her complaint. Plaintiff objects to the use of the videos at this stage of the proceedings. Plaintiff, however, does not assert that the videos are not authentic copies of the events that transpired during the evening of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On a motion to dismiss, the court may consider the complaint itself and any attached exhibits or any documents incorporated by reference.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Plaintiff contends that she did not incorporate the video into her complaint. Plaintiff also asserts that the video is not central to her claim as other evidence, including witnesses and reports, support the claims in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants have cited various authority in support of their position that the court may consider the videos in ruling on a motion to dismiss. Much of the authority, however, can be distinguished as several cases were at the summary judgment stage and, in some cases, the plaintiffs either attached the videos as exhibits or did not object to their consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Kan. May 23, 2016) (considered videos).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After reviewing the parties' briefing, the court declines to consider the videos in deciding the motions to dismiss. Six different videos have been submitted in support of the motions. The parties' memoranda conflict as to the events occurring on the videos, the statements made therein, and the party making those statements. At this stage, the court cannot evaluate competing interpretations of the videos and, having reviewed the videos, the court finds that certain events and statements included therein may be susceptible to more than one interpretation. Ultimately, evaluation of the videos in this case will be aided by testimony and possibly other forms of evidence that can be considered at summary judgment or at trial. While the court's decision here does not mean that the court would never consider a video on a motion to dismiss, the court declines to do so in this case. Defendants are free to rely on the videos at the summary judgment stage to the extent that is consistent with the law regarding video evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    December 12, 2017, Statement by McPherson County Attorney\n   </em>\n   . The City of Newton Defendants (\"NPD Defendants\") have attached the Statement issued by McPherson County Attorney Greg Benefiel regarding the death of Holmes. Defendants assert that the court should consider the Statement as Plaintiff quotes from the Statement in her complaint. (Doc. 39 at 3.) The complaint states that \"In order to provide post-hoc justification, Defendant Somers fabricated that he saw Mr. Holmes with his hands on a gun. There is absolutely no evidence to support this claim, as the McPherson County Attorney's Office admits: 'There is no evidence that Holmes actually gained control of Cpl. Hawpe's duty weapon.' \" (Doc. 1 at 7.) Plaintiff objects to the court's consideration of the Statement on the basis that it is hearsay and is not authenticated. (Doc. 60 at 53.) Defendants do not respond to Plaintiff's objection. (Doc. 74.) The court declines to consider the Statement in deciding the pending motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Court Records in Other Actions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The NPD Defendants have also submitted exhibits that include court records from excessive force actions that are cited in Plaintiff's complaint. (Doc. 39.) The records are submitted for the purpose of determining whether the underlying allegations in the complaints were meritorious and substantially similar to the allegations in this complaint. (Doc. 39 at 16-17.) Although the court can take judicial notice of publicly filed court documents, the court declines to review the records for the purpose of determining whether these alleged instances of misconduct were meritorious and substantially similar in order to establish the existence of a policy and/or deliberate indifference. Such determination is more appropriate for summary judgment. At this stage, the court will consider only the allegations in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The following facts are taken from the allegations in the complaint, without regard to the evidence contained in the videos. Additional facts are noted throughout this order. On August 28, 2017, officers were attempting to stop Holmes, who was driving his vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officers were from the Harvey County Sheriff's Office (\"HCSO\"), the McPherson County Sheriff's Office (\"MCSO\") and the City of Newton Police Department (\"NPD\"). In addition to naming individual defendants, Plaintiff has also asserted claims against unknown officers from those agencies. The named individual Defendants include Chris Somers and Jason Achilles\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   , deputies of the MCSO, and Jerry Montagne, the Sheriff of McPherson County. Defendants Anthony Hawpe and Skyler Hinton are all law enforcement officers of the NPD. Defendant Chad Gay is the Sheriff of Harvey County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Holmes was 24 years old in August 2017. Holmes is African-American and suffered from schizophrenia. Wendy Couser is Holmes' mother and the court-appointed administrator for Holmes' estate. Couser was previously employed by the NPD for several years. The NPD Defendants knew Holmes personally and were aware that he suffered from schizophrenia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On the evening of August 28, Holmes was fleeing from officers in his vehicle. After stopping his vehicle, Holmes remained in his car for approximately three minutes before exiting. According to the complaint, Holmes exited slowly and with his hands raised.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Holmes was unarmed and his hands were empty. Almost immediately after Holmes exited the vehicle, Defendant Achilles shot Holmes with a bean bag gun and Defendant Somers fired an electroshock weapon at Holmes. Defendant Hawpe then allegedly drove Holmes to the ground. An unknown HCSO\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   officer\n   allegedly hit Holmes on his head with the butt of a shotgun. After several seconds, a shot was heard. Defendant Somers had fired his weapon into Holmes' back. After the shot, Hawpe allegedly punched Holmes in the face several times. Defendant Hinton then allegedly used an expandable baton to strike Holmes several times. This entire event lasted approximately 21 seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the individual Defendants acted out of anger and rage and were motivated by Holmes' race. After Holmes was shot, the individual Defendants allegedly failed to provide first aid care. The video recordings were allegedly turned off. Holmes did not immediately succumb to his injuries but later died from the gunshot wound. The complaint alleges that Holmes never touched or took possession of any weapon during the altercation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The complaint asserts several claims against Defendants. All Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety on the basis that it fails to state a valid claim for relief and that the individual Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. The court will address the claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Rule 12(b)(6).\n   </em>\n   In order to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint must contain enough allegations of fact to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\n   <em>\n    Robbins v.

Turning to the first factor, the severity of the crime, only the HCSO Defendants offer any argument. They assert that the crime at issue is fleeing the police. (Doc. 54 at 13.) Viewing the complaint, the court agrees. The court, however, disagrees with the HCSO Defendants' view of the crime as a felony. Under Kansas law, a first conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude a pursuing police officer is a misdemeanor unless Holmes additionally committed any of the acts described in K.S.A. 8-1568(b)(1) or is attempting to elude capture for commission of a felony. K.S.A. 8-1568(b)(2). At this time, the allegations state that Holmes was fleeing the police. There are no additional allegations regarding his actions prior to fleeing nor are there any allegations that would support a conclusion that a felony could be charged under Kansas law. Therefore, viewing the allegations in a light most favorable to Plaintiff at this stage of the proceedings, the crime at issue was a misdemeanor. When officers suspect that a misdemeanor has been committed, this \"reduces the level of force that was reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Casey v. City of Fed. Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3327851\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/1278/#p1281\">\n    509 F.3d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1281 (10th Cir. 2007). \"\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   establishes that force is least justified against nonviolent misdemeanants who do not flee or actively resist arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3327851\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/1278/#p1281\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3327851\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/1278/#p1281\">\n    at 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the court does not view this as a minor crime because of the potential for injury to the public and officers from fleeing the police, the allegations must be viewed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff and, as alleged, this crime is a misdemeanor under Kansas law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The second factor is whether the suspect poses a threat to the officers. The allegations in the complaint state that Holmes was not armed when he exited his vehicle, had his hands raised and empty, and did not attempt to touch or grab an officer's gun. There are no allegations that Holmes was threatening or confrontational. At this stage, the court must view the allegations in a light most favorable to Plaintiff. Defendants' briefs all argue this factor on the basis of the videos. (Doc. 34 at 10-11.) As discussed, the court has declined to consider the videos at this stage. The allegations as stated in the complaint do not support a finding that Holmes posed a threat to the officers or any other individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the third factor is whether Holmes was actively resisting arrest or attempting to flee. All Defendants argue that this factor weighs against Plaintiff because of actions that are allegedly shown in the videos. Again, this court has not considered the videos. Defendants also argue that Holmes had been fleeing from Defendants prior to the stop. However, the\n   Tenth Circuit has held that \"initial resistance does not justify the continuation of force once the resistance ceases.\"\n   <em>\n    McCoy v. Meyers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516497\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/1034/#p1051\">\n    887 F.3d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1051 (10th Cir. 2018). Recently, the Tenth Circuit reiterated this holding and found that changed circumstances do not support a finding that an individual was resisting arrest.\n   <em>\n    Osterhout v.

After stopping his motorcycle, the plaintiff had his hands up and did not resist arrest. The officer allegedly hit the plaintiff in the face without warning, which resulted in a broken nose and other injuries. In reviewing the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors, the Tenth Circuit held that a \"reasonable jury could conclude based on this evidence that Officer Morgan 'should have been able to recognize and react to the changed circumstances,'\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516497\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/1034/#p1051\">\n    887 F.3d at 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted), and further conclude that under these circumstances, a reasonable officer would not have believed that Mr. Osterhout posed an immediate threat to the officers or the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Osterhout\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=763%20Fed.%20Appx.%20757\">\n    763 Fed.Appx. at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tenth Circuit further found that these same facts supported a finding that the last factor weighed in favor of a finding of excessive force.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=763%20Fed.%20Appx.%20757\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   After reviewing the factors, the court finds that the allegations support a finding that the crime at issue was not severe, Holmes did not pose an immediate threat to the officers or others, and Holmes was not actively resisting arrest at the time of the force used by the individual Defendants. The complaint alleges that the officers' use of force included lethal force, a taser, bean bags, punches to the face and the use of a shotgun to hit Holmes in the face. Viewing the allegations in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, the court finds that a reasonable jury could conclude that all allegations of use of force by Achilles, Somers, Hawpe, Hinton and the Unknown Officer violated Holmes' Fourth Amendment rights. Moreover, based on the authority cited and the reasons stated above, the court finds that it would have been obvious to the individual Defendants that it was unconstitutional to use even the least amount of force alleged in the complaint, punches to the face or a hit with a shotgun, on Holmes when he was \"not resisting arrest, not attempting to flee, and there was no objective reason to believe that he posed an immediate threat to the officers or the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Osterhout\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=763%20Fed.%20Appx.%20757\">\n    763 Fed.Appx. at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Clearly Established\n   </em>\n   . The second prong requires the court to determine if the right was clearly established at the time of violation. Achilles argues that the right should be defined as \"the right not to be shot with a non-lethal bean bag following a high speed police chase, after refusing to get out of the vehicle for several minutes, and then getting out of the vehicle yelling 'shoot me' while simultaneously disobeying officers' orders to get on the ground, all while his passenger remained uncontrolled in the vehicle.\" (Doc. 34 at 15-16.) The court declines to read the right so narrowly because the Supreme Court has clearly stated that the court is not required to find that \" 'the very action in question has previously been held unlawful.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1866. All individual officers make arguments that the right was not clearly established based on Holmes' actions as shown in the videos. Again, the court has not considered the videos and is viewing the facts alleged in the complaint in a light most favorable to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The court finds that Tenth Circuit precedent makes it clear to a reasonable officer in each individual Defendant's position\n   that using the force employed by the individual Defendants under the circumstances alleged was unconstitutional. The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly held that force is unconstitutional when used against individuals like Holmes \"who were not suspected of serious crimes, posed little to no threat, and put up little to no resistance.\"\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516497\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/1034/#p1051\">\n    887 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1052 n. 21 (citing Tenth Circuit cases predating the present incident).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

As discussed, \u00a7 1983 claims are based on the violation of an individual's personal rights. An exception to this applies when an estate may bring claims on behalf of a deceased plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539832\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/900/1489/#p1506\">\n    900 F.2d at 1506-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A \u00a7 1983 survival action is not a separate claim that has a separate award of damages.

Upon a review of the state case record, however, the second paragraph is taken almost entirely verbatim\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   from a paragraph contained in the appellant's opening brief. The opinion, however, does not cite to the appellant's brief. That leads the court to conclude that there was either an oversight in the opinion by failing to cite to the brief or, alternatively, that the Kansas Supreme Court completely adopted the appellant's argument as law. The court concludes that it is more likely the former because the legal conclusions in the paragraph are not preceded by any indication that this is the Supreme Court's holding, nor are there any citations in the paragraph that would indicate that all the statements contained therein are established law. That is to say, unlike the balance of the Kansas Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Nielander\n   </em>\n   , the sweeping conclusions set forth in the questionable paragraph are devoid of legal analysis or citation to authority. Also, the paragraph immediately preceding the paragraph in question indicates that the Kansas Supreme Court is setting forth the position of appellants and the succeeding four paragraphs largely set forth the positions of the various parties and\n   <em>\n    amici curiae.\n   </em>\n   Although the court finds that some of the statements contained within the paragraph are accurate statements of the law, such as that the sheriff is an independently elected officer and that the board of commissioners funds the sheriff's office, the statement that a sheriff is a state officer does not appear to be a conclusive statement of Kansas law. Therefore, in light of the confusion regarding this paragraph, the court declines to read\n   <em>\n    Nielander\n   </em>\n   as holding that a sheriff is categorically a state officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As for the second factor, the degree of the sheriff's autonomy from the State, sheriffs do have autonomy in personnel decisions and they are in charge of the county jail.\n   <em>\n    Nielander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861220\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/275/257/\">\n    275 Kan. at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861220\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/275/257/\">\n    62 P.3d 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; K.S.A. 19-811.

Therefore, as to the claims of failure to train against Sheriff Gay, in his official capacity, and the NPD, the court finds that Plaintiff has stated a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    Policy of Failing to Supervise and Discipline\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she has sufficiently alleged \"policies or customs that [the Departments] failed to adequately supervise employees or otherwise hold them accountable for constitutional violations similar to what befell Matt.\" (Doc. 60 at 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In order to establish this claim, Plaintiff must allege that the Departments had in place (1) a custom or policy of failure to discipline; (2) deliberate indifference on the part of the decision maker, and (3) a causal link to the constitutional deprivation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gates v.

Evidence of prior complaints can be sufficient to show that a municipal Defendant and the officials ignored the officers' misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cordova v.

With respect to NPD and HCSO, Plaintiff has alleged that there were specific instances of excessive force that were not disciplined, citing to the previous litigation. Plaintiff has failed to cite to any specific incidents concerning the MCSO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff has alleged that the policies caused Holmes's injuries. The harm alleged by Plaintiff is the harm that one would plausibly expect the alleged policy of failing to discipline would cause. Therefore, as to the claims of failure to train against Sheriff Gay and the NPD, the court finds that Plaintiff has stated a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion on Municipal Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Defendant Montagne's motion to dismiss the municipal claims against him is granted.

Americans with Disabilities Act: Title II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Plaintiff asserts a claim under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") on the basis that Defendants failed to accommodate Holmes, who has schizophrenia, during the arrest. Defendants move for dismissal of this claim on the basis that the ADA does not apply to arrests and that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \"Title II of the ADA commands that 'no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.' \"\n   <em>\n    City &amp; Cty. of San Francisco, Calif. v.

The ADA clearly only applies to public entities. Therefore, to the\n   extent Plaintiff is making claims against the individuals, those claims must be dismissed. Defendants contend that the ADA is inapplicable in this case because Holmes posed a threat to the officers. The facts alleged in the complaint, however, do not support a finding that Holmes posed a threat. Therefore, the ADA claim is not subject to dismissal on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Although the Tenth Circuit has not decided whether the ADA is applicable to arrests, it has indicated that \"accommodations may be necessary when disabled individuals are arrested.\"\n   <em>\n    J.H. ex rel. J.P. v. Bernalillo Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358017\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1255/#p1261\">\n    806 F.3d 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1261 (10th Cir. 2015). Moreover, other circuits have found that the ADA is applicable during arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McHenry v. City of Ottawa, Kansas\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-2736-DDC-JPO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204269903\">\n    2017 WL 4269903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (D. Kan. Sept. 26, 2017) (citing cases). Plaintiff essentially asserts that the accommodation necessary here was for officers to attempt to deescalate the situation or employ non-violent methods of arrest. (Doc. 1 at 16.) This \"accommodation\" is essentially a repackaging of Plaintiff's excessive force claim into a claim under the ADA. Although the ADA might require an accommodation of a disability upon arrest, depending on the officers' knowledge and the apparent need for accommodation, the court declines to extend the ADA to the facts alleged in this case. Rather, the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of excessive force, and the resulting requirement that use of force be reasonable, is sufficiently flexible to accommodate application to disabled suspects in situations where the officer has knowledge of the disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Therefore, the court finds that the facts alleged do not state a claim under the ADA. Defendants' motions to dismiss Plaintiff's ADA claim are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Respondeat Superior\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff includes a state law claim for respondeat superior. All Defendants have moved for dismissal of this claim on the basis that it is not a separate legal claim. Plaintiff's responses do not address Defendants' arguments. Respondeat superior is a theory under which liability is imposed on an employer for tortious acts committed by its employees.\n   <em>\n    McGuire v. Sifers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1500252\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/235/368/#p378\">\n    235 Kan. 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1500252\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/235/368/#p378\">\n    681 P.2d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). It is not a separate cause of action by itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Therefore, to the extent Plaintiff is attempting to assert a separate cause of action on this theory, it is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Indeed, the videos depict a much more chaotic scene than suggested by the complaint. Nevertheless, rather than wade into the morass of trying to sort out what facts are indisputable from the video and which ones are debatable or in need of additional testimony to sort out, the court accepts the facts as alleged in the complaint at this stage, noting that the facts ultimately established in this case may differ considerably from those recited herein.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    The complaint states at page 2 that the officer was employed by HCSO.

R. 15.1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    Defendants do not move for dismissal of the unknown officer who allegedly hit Holmes with a shotgun and, clearly, the unknown officer has not been served in this matter. The HCSO Defendants do argue that the facts in the complaint are not sufficient to state a claim against the unknown officer. (Doc. 54 at 12-14.) An analysis as to whether the complaint sufficiently alleges a claim against the unknown officer is necessary in order to determine if there is supervisory and municipal liability against Sheriff Gay. Therefore, the court has included the allegations of the use of force by the unknown officer in this section. However, if and when the unknown officer is identified and served, the unknown officer is free to assert defenses and arguments and will not be foreclosed from moving for dismissal on the basis of this order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    This ruling does not imply that each individual Defendant had a duty to intervene. This ruling only finds that at this stage of the proceeding each individual Defendant's alleged use of force could be found to be an unreasonable use of force and that the law regarding each use of force was clearly established.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Although the Complaint generally refers to all Defendants in the allegations stating this claim, Plaintiff argues that the claim is against Achilles, Somers, Hawpe, Hinton and the unknown HCSO Officer.

The opinion also uses \"or\" when the brief had used the word \"nor.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    At the summary judgment stage, however, previous complaints of excessive force will not support a finding that there was a policy if those complaints lacked merit.
