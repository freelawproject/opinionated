In the Motion, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's Complaint, brought pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), should proceed under Count II alone because the remaining counts seek relief that does not exist under the statute. The Court, having considered the parties' submissions and being fully advised in the premises, will grant in part Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Tyrone Keys (\"Keys\") played in the National Football League (\"NFL\") for seven seasons as a defensive lineman. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 5. He played from 1983 until he had to retire in 1989 due to football injuries to his back, knees, and shoulder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Shortly after his NFL career ended, Keys submitted a disability claim to Defendant, the Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle NFL Player Retirement Plan (the \"Plan\"), a multi-employer pension and welfare benefits plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. Keys submitted the claim to the Plan administrators due to his significant football-induced impairments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the time Keys submitted his initial disability claim, there were three relevant classifications of disability benefits: (i) Line of Duty Benefits, awarded to players who have a \"substantial disablement\" due to playing NFL football but who are considered not totally disabled; (ii) Football Degenerative Total and Permanent (\"T&amp;P\") benefits awarded to players who are considered to be substantially prevented from engaging in any occupation,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   totally disabled, due to impairments caused by playing NFL football; and (iii) Inactive T&amp;P Benefits, awarded to former NFL players who are found to be totally and permanently disabled but whose disability is considered to be unrelated to their NFL football careers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The claims administrators for the Plan include the Disability Initial Claims Committee (the \"DICC\"), an entity consisting of two people-one appointed by the NFL Players Association and one appointed by NFL management-and the Retirement Board (the \"Board\"), consisting of six people, three appointed by the NFL Players Association and three appointed by NFL management.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. The DICC is the initial decision maker and the Board members are the plan fiduciaries who conduct the fiduciary review of a claim that has been denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1991, Keys submitted a claim for Line of Duty benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. Once Keys submitted his claim for Line of Duty benefits, the Plan's administrators sent him to one of its top orthopedic physicians, Hugh Unger, M.D., for an evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Unger performed his first evaluation of Keys on December 9, 1991, approximately two years after Keys' last season.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Unger noted that Keys suffered a herniated lumbar disc and tore the meniscus of his right knee in 1989, his last season.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Unger also noted that Keys sustained a cracked glenoid rim of his right shoulder while playing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By 1991, Keys had been through knee, back, and shoulder surgeries for NFL-related injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After examining Keys in December 1991, Dr. Unger reported the following NFL-related impairments to the Plan's administrators, predicting that the impairments would degenerate further with time:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Impression: Chondromalacia of the patella, bilateral Degenerative arthritis of the right shoulder and Glenolabrial disease\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Osteoarthritis of the medial and lateral patellar facets and of the medial femoral condyle\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Status post foraminotomy and discectomy, L4 5\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Dr. Unger also evaluated the degree of Keys' NFL-related impairments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. He reported that Keys had a 50 to 59 percent loss of use of his back as a result of playing in the NFL, a 30 to 49 percent loss of use of his shoulder as a result of playing in the NFL, and a 60 to 79 percent loss of use of both knees as a result of playing in the NFL.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the additional remarks section of the report to the Board in 1991, Dr. Unger wrote as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   This patient has multiple extremity involvements, with arthritis of the right shoulder, chondromalacia of both knees, and tear of the medial meniscus. It is anticipated that further degeneration in the right shoulder may develop in time and he may develop early arthritic changes in his knees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Board awarded Keys Line of Duty benefits based upon Dr. Unger's findings and opinions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Dr. Unger examined Keys annually at the Plan administrator's request up until 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At each examination, Dr. Unger found the same degree of NFL-related impairments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Keys was paid Line of Duty benefits for the maximum period available of five years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. Prior to those benefits expiring on December 1, 1997, Keys requested that his benefits be reclassified as T&amp;P Football Degenerative disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. That request was denied in 1997.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 7, 2002, Keys was involved in a minor automobile accident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. His car was hit from behind while stopped at a red light.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The accident aggravated his pre-existing professional football injuries but had no effect on the permanent injuries he sustained playing NFL football.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In September 2003, Keys re-applied for Football Degenerative T&amp;P disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. In his application, he listed his impairing conditions caused by playing NFL football.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He relied upon the opinions of his treating physicians, an independent medical examination, and his medical history in attributing the following impairments to his NFL football career:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Condition 1\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I have unfortunately cervical spondylosis with upper extremity radicular symptoms referred to as radiculopathy. I am unable to sit for much more than 10 minutes without having to stand. I am unable to stand for more than 5 minutes without having to sit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Condition 2\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I unfortunately have significant spondylosis lumbar spondylosis with facet arthropathy at multiple levels &amp; lower extremity radiculopathy. I am unable to complete a work day because of having to constant alternate between sitting &amp; standing every few minutes to relive (sic) the pain. I herniated my lumbar in the last NFL game.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Condition 3\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I unfortunately have degenerative joint disease chondromalacia &amp; osteochondrel defect of the humeral and osteochondrel defect of the humeral &amp; osteochondral defect of the glenoid rim and degenerative tears of the glenoid. I am scheduled to begin pain management consultation next week. I landed on my shoulder &amp; was never told that it was cracked by team doctors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Condition 4\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I have chondromalacia patella in both knees. I am unable to sit for more than 10 minutes without having to stand up to relieve the pain. I also cannot stand for more than 10 minutes because of the pain. I am to begin pain management consultation to include facet injection &amp; associated trigger points and neural forarrminal (sic) injections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thereafter, the Plan's administrators sent Keys to one of their physician experts, Harold Selesnick, M.D.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. After an extensive physical examination, Dr. Selesnick found that Keys was disabled due to NFL football injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He wrote as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   I believe that due to Mr. Keys' chronic cervical and lumbar injuries, right shoulder limitation of motion, and pain and bilateral knee degeneration arthritis with limitation of motion and pain, that he is unable to work in any occupation for remuneration or profit. I believe that these limitations are permanent and he is likely to worsen with time to the point that he will eventually require bilateral knee replacements and possible right shoulder replacement surgery. I believe the cervical degenerative arthritis and lumbar degenerative arthritis will likely progress with time as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After review of the application and the records that were submitted, on March 3, 2004, the Board awarded Keys Inactive T&amp;P disability benefits, effective January 1, 2004.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Keys appealed through counsel, pointing out that all of the medical evidence indicated that he was totally and permanently disabled due to his NFL football career.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After further review, and relying upon Dr. Selesnick's examination and report, the DICC approved Keys' claim for Football Degenerative T&amp;P benefits at their meeting on April 7, 2004.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Football Degenerative T&amp;P benefits were paid to Keys retroactive to January 1, 2004 and Keys repaid Inactive T&amp;P benefits that he had received.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Plan requires continuing proof of total and permanent disability once a participant is awarded benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. Consequently, the Plan's administrators had their medical experts examine Keys multiple times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Each time, their experts found that Keys was totally disabled by his NFL career.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In April 2011, the DICC deadlocked (1 to 1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on whether Keys should receive ongoing T&amp;P disability benefits as a result of a 2009 tax return.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Benefits were continued while Keys appealed the decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Keys appealed the DICC's April 2011 decision to terminate his Football Degenerative disability benefits to the Board and advised the Board that he had been approved for Social Security (\"SS\") disability benefits\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but he had not received the award decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. Under the Plan, a player will be approved for Plan disability benefits if he is approved for SS disability benefits, unless four or more members of the Board determine the player has received SS disability benefits fraudulently.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In August 2011, the classification \"Football Degenerative\" T&amp;P benefits was revised and those benefits were thereafter designated as \"Inactive A\" T&amp;P benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. \"Inactive B\" T&amp;P benefits replaced the prior classification of \"Inactive\" T&amp;P benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Keys received Inactive A T&amp;P benefits in September, October, and November 2011 while his appeal was pending.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In November 2011, the Board upheld the DICC's April 2011 termination of benefits decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. The Board took the position that Keys' earnings stated in his 2009 tax return were incompatible with T&amp;P disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board further alleged it received no evidence that Keys had been approved for SS disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Keys reapplied for T&amp;P disability benefits from the Plan in February 2012 and submitted the SS disability decision he had received by that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. The DICC denied his claim by letter dated March 5, 2012, maintaining that articles and documents he submitted with his application indicated that he was still working.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Keys appealed through counsel, pointing out that he performed limited charity work but did not have the capacity for full-time work due to his NFL-related impairments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. Key's tax returns were submitted with the appeal, showing that he was not engaged in any full-time employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At their meeting in November, 2012, the Board awarded Inactive B benefits to Keys, effective December 2011, based upon his re-application, his SS award, and his appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Keys appealed the Board's decision, pointing out that the classification was wrong and that he should have been awarded Inactive A benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. The Board denied his appeal at their meeting in May 2013, and Keys requested reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After reconsideration, the Board awarded Inactive A benefits to Keys with an effective date of December 2013, subject to Keys providing additional information to the Plan administrators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Keys was asked to provide authorizations allowing the Plan administrators to obtain Keys' SS disability files and his federal tax returns, along with a list of any employment Keys had been engaged in after January 2004.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Keys was paid Inactive B benefits during this time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In February 2015, the Board terminated Keys' lnactive B benefits, alleging Keys failed to provide the requested information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Counsel for Keys provided the information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In July 2015, Keys' Inactive A benefits were reinstated retroactively to December 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Keys, through counsel, indicated that Inactive A benefits should have been retroactively awarded to December 2011, not December 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. Keys requested the difference between Inactive A benefits\n   and Inactive B benefits for the period from December 2011 through November 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Players classified as Inactive A receive greater monthly benefits than players classified as Inactive B.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30, n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In August 2017, the Plan administrators notified Keys that the Board decided to deny his claim for additional benefits for the time period December 1, 2011 through November 2013 and was also terminating his Inactive A benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. The Board had determined that Keys was never entitled to Inactive A benefits (formerly Football Degenerative T&amp;P benefits), and as a result was overpaid by $831,488.28 (the difference between Inactive A and Inactive B for the time period between January 1, 2004 until August 1, 2017).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board notified Keys that he would no longer be paid any disability benefits and that his monthly Inactive B T&amp;P benefits would be applied as they accrued to the outstanding indebtedness of $831,488.28 due the Plan as a result of the overpayment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Board notified Keys that when the Plan administrators reviewed Keys' SS file, they acquired a complete copy of a medical report from August 1, 2003, from Chet Janecki, M.D., that indicated Keys had been in a car accident in May 2002.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. The Board alleged for the first time that it had not received or acquired Janecki's full report before June 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Board erroneously maintained that Keys' 2003 application for T&amp;P Football Degenerative disability benefits was \"intentionally and materially incomplete and inaccurate\" because he did not provide the details of the 2002 car accident in his application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, the Board notified Keys that the car accident, rather than playing seven years in the NFL, was the \"proximate cause of the impairments underlying [Keys'] 2003 application\" and, therefore, Keys was never entitled to Football Degenerative/Inactive A benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Keys appealed the Board's determination, arguing that the longstanding impairments listed in his 2003 application were the result of playing NFL football, as was made clear by a reasonable review of his medical records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. He pointed out that the car accident did not cause any of the NFL-related impairments he listed in his application, and that the ongoing award of benefits year after year by the Plan administrators, as well as the SS disability award, were based upon a significant volume of medical evidence that Keys remained totally and permanently disabled as a result of his NFL career.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also pointed out that the DICC knew about the 2002 automobile accident prior to the award of Football Degenerative T&amp;P benefits in 2004.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Board denied Keys' appeal by letter dated February 26, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.

Count III asserts that Defendants previously had information about Keys' 2002 automobile accident in their possession but chose not to pursue any additional information until recently.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. Under Count III, Keys seeks to retain the benefits previously paid to him, requesting that Defendants \"be estopped from clawing back Inactive A...benefits paid to Keys.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Count I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants seek dismissal of Count I. Defendants contend that the relief Keys seeks-a declaration that he did not provide false information-does not exist under section 1132(a)(1)(B). Doc. 19 at p. 7. Defendants state: \"Count I asks this Court to opine on the veracity of the documents that Keys submitted, and to his state of mind in submitting such documents. This type of declaratory relief is not available under section [1132](a)(1)(B).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Keys responds that nothing within ERISA requires that a claimant set forth just one claim where he has been affected by separate decisions of a plan administrator. Doc. 22 at p. 3. Keys states that Count I seeks an enforcement of his rights under the Plan, a permissible purpose of ERISA. Specifically, Keys \"seeks to enforce his rights under the plan to retain all of the disability benefits he has received and to prevent the offset of his continuing disability benefits because he did not submit false information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. Keys further asserts that Count I is narrowly tailored to address the issue of Defendants' clawback of $831,488.28 in benefits based on a provision in the Plan that allows for the recovery of overpayments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Under section 1132(a)(1)(B), a plan participant or beneficiary may bring a civil action \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). \"[T]hree distinct remedies\" are available to a participant or beneficiary\n   who initiates a section 1132(a)(1)(B) action: (1) the recovery of accrued benefits; (2) a declaratory judgment that he or she is entitled to benefits under the provisions of the plan; and (3) an order enjoining the plan administrator from improperly refusing to pay future benefits.\n   <em>\n    Heffner v.

The cited plan provision,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which discusses the recovery of overpayments, deals with the payment of benefits. Doc. 22 at pp. 4-5. A declaratory judgment on the issue would resolve the question of Keys' entitlement to benefits under the Plan, specifically, whether it was an abuse of discretion for Defendants to effectively revoke plan benefits by requiring reimbursement. Stated differently, Keys asks the Court to make a determination regarding Keys' benefits, based on a contractual provision in the Plan. That is a permissible purpose of section 1132(a)(1)(B) ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heffner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045739\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/1330/#p1337\">\n    443 F.3d at 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Further, Keys' claim in Count I for declaratory relief is not subsumed by Count II, as Defendants argue. In Count II, Keys asks the Court, among other things, to determine that Defendants' decision to terminate Inactive A benefits beginning August 2017 was an abuse of discretion. Defendants' decision to terminate Inactive A benefits beginning August 2017 was based on a finding that Keys was never entitled to Inactive A benefits between 2004 to 2017. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 31. A finding by the Court that this decision was an abuse of discretion may mean that Keys was entitled to Inactive A benefits between 2004 and 2017 and may further mean that Keys is owed benefits (and therefore would not owe Defendants). However, a finding that Defendants did not abuse their discretion in determining that Keys was never entitled to Inactive A benefits from 2004 to 2017 would mean that Keys is not owed benefits and may have been overpaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In the latter instance, the question of whether Keys owes under the Plan's overpayment provision based on the submission of false information would still be at issue. The application of the overpayment provision is therefore a potentially distinct issue and may be properly brought in a separate claim for declaratory relief. Therefore, Defendants' Motion will be denied with respect to Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Count III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendants also seek dismissal of Count III. Defendants contend that the relief Keys seeks in this count-a claim for retention of benefits paid based on estoppel-also does not exist under section 1132(a)(1)(B) and is inadequately pleaded. Doc. 19 at p. 8. Defendants state that the Eleventh Circuit, in\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Am. General Life and Acc. Ins.

In any event, whether the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Glus\n   </em>\n   would apply to this ERISA case is questionable given other binding precedent.
