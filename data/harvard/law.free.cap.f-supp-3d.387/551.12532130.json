Although the plaintiff did not recall at the time he filed suit, the parties had a preexisting agreement dating back to 2011, through which the defendant referred patients to the plaintiff for independent medical evaluations. Generally, an agreement of this sort constitutes an established business relationship (\"EBR\") that exempts fax senders or broadcasters from TCPA liability, but the parties agree that the EBR exemption is unavailable here because the fax did not include the necessary opt-out notice. Nonetheless, the defendant now moves for summary judgment, arguing that this action fails because the fax was not \"unsolicited\" within the meaning of the TCPA, as the subject matter being advertised directly related to the parties' agreement and, specifically, its requirement that the plaintiff maintain the relevant medical certifications. Thus, the heart of the dispute is whether, through the parties' existing relationship, the plaintiff provided express permission to warrant the fax \"solicited.\" The court agrees with the defendant that the plaintiff consented to receive certain faxes in the course of the parties' relationship. However, the court cannot conclude, based on the current record, that the connection between the agreement's certification requirements and the seminar being advertised is sufficiently close to establish express consent existed as a matter of law. Instead, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the scope of the granted consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant also claims that it is entitled to summary judgment on all the plaintiff's claims because (1) the plaintiff lacks both Article III and prudential standing and (2) applying the TCPA to the offending fax would violate the defendant's First Amendment rights. As to the plaintiff's claim for treble damages, the defendant argues that summary judgment is appropriate because there is no evidence that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated the TCPA. The defendant further argues that, after granting judgment in its favor on the plaintiff's federal causes of action, the court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiff's conversion claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court rejects the argument that the plaintiff lacks Article III standing because his alleged injury-lost use of a fax machine, paper, and toner and intrusion into his day-would have occurred even if the fax included a compliant opt-out notice. To the contrary, Congress required advertisers to include valid opt-out notices on unsolicited faxes to parties with whom they have an EBR precisely because it recognized that a cost-free mechanism to avoid future communications mitigated the risk of unwanted intrusion. As to the defendant's argument that the plaintiff lacks prudential standing, the fact that he has brought other TCPA lawsuits does not render him a \"professional plaintiff\" outside the zone of interests the statute is meant to protect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant also argues that the TCPA, as applied to the plaintiff, violates its First Amendment right to free speech,\n   because the plaintiff's deposition testimony that he did not consider the fax to have violated his privacy means he did not suffer the injury Congress meant to address by requiring opt-out notices on unsolicited faxes sent in the context of an EBR. However, the plaintiff's other testimony establishes that he did, in fact, suffer what constitutes a legal invasion of privacy as Congress understood it, even if he himself, as a non-lawyer, would not use that terminology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lastly, the court holds that the defendant's claim that its representatives did not know about the TCPA, although undisputed, does not mean that the alleged violation cannot have been willful or knowing so as to create the possibility treble damages. To the contrary, treble damages could be appropriate if the defendant sent a fax advertisement it knew was unsolicited, even if it did not realize that doing so amounted to a statutory violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accordingly, the court denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Dr. Mauthe also filed a motion for class certification the same day. Doc. No. 2. On May 16, 2018, the court denied the motion for class certification without prejudice, noting that the plaintiff had not yet served the defendant with the complaint and the parties had not yet engaged in any class action discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order at 1, Doc.

The Agreement mandated that Dr. Mauthe remain certified, but it did not mandate that he use MCMC or its partners to meet that requirement.

Instead, Congress took aim at the\n   <em>\n    intrusive\n   </em>\n   nature of unsolicited faxes.

The fact that the IME Agreement required Dr. Mauthe to maintain his medical certification, which in turn required him to earn CME credits, is certainly evidence that the subject of the fax was related to the parties' agreement, but that relationship is not direct enough to warrant a holding that the provided consent extends to the fax as a matter of law.
