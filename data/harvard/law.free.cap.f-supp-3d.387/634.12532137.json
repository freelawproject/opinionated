Gelshenen, Jr. (collectively, \"Gelshenen\"), a personal injury lawyer and firm, were named as defendants in a single-count putative class-action lawsuit,\n   <em>\n    Hatch v. Demayo\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-CV-925,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204357447\">\n    2017 WL 4357447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 29, 2017) (the \"Underlying Action\"). The plaintiffs, drivers who had been involved in automobile accidents in North Carolina, alleged that the defendants, including Gelshenen, violated the federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act (\"DPPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202721\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2725 (2012), by obtaining plaintiffs' names and addresses from copies of official accident reports maintained by the State of North Carolina and using that information to mail legal advertisements to plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Present Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gelshenen tendered defense of the Underlying Action to Plaintiff Hartford Casualty\n   Insurance Company (\"Hartford\") under a series of business liability insurance policies (the \"Policies\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Gelshenen purchased from Hartford. The Policies generally provide that Hartford would defend and indemnify Gelshenen against damages for personal and advertising injuries that Gelshenen became legally obligated to pay. Hartford denies that it owes Gelshenen any duty to defend or indemnify the Underlying Action because the DPPA claim asserted in that action falls under two different exclusionary provisions in the Policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The first provision excludes coverage for personal and advertising injury arising out of the violation of a right of privacy created by a federal statute, such as the DPPA (the \"Privacy Exclusion\"). The second provision excludes coverage for personal and advertising injury arising from the alleged violation of a statute that limits the communication or distribution of material or information, such as the DPPA (the \"Communication Exclusion\"). Because an alleged violation of the DPPA falls squarely within the plain language of both of these exclusions, and because the only claim asserted in the Underlying Action is based on the DPPA, Hartford has no duty to defend Gelshenen in the Underlying Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hartford Cas.

The Court's role is to look at the Underlying Complaint and the Policies side-by-side to determine whether there is coverage. As explained below, the events alleged in the\n   <em>\n    Hatch\n   </em>\n   action are excluded under the Polices referenced in the pleadings. If Gelshenen contends that there are policies that exist beyond June 2017, and that such policies render Hartford's motion not yet ripe for determination, then Gelshenen should have submitted some proof of their existence. At this point, the Court has only Gelshenen's vague reference to other policies that may exist, with no explanation as to why Gelshenen does not have copies of his own insurance policies or what efforts he has made to obtain them. Hartford has met its own burden in proving that the events in the Underlying Action are excluded under the Policies, and Gelshenen has offered no evidence to suggest that the Underlying Action could give rise to even \"a mere possibility\" that Gelshenen's potential liability is covered by any insurance policy issued by Hartford.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Home Indem.

As such, Gelshenen's \"vague reference to other policies that might exist beyond June 1, 2017\" will not delay disposition of Hartford's motion because, \"[e]ven if those policies exist, they are not the subject of the operative pleadings and necessarily do not create a reason to delay a request for judgment on the pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl.

Given that there is no evidence so support Gelshenen's contentions, that there is ample evidence to support Hartford's position, and that Gelshenen will be protected in the event that coverage is later established, the Court will not delay ruling on Hartford's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Exception to the Privacy Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Gelshenen argues that the exception to the Privacy Exclusion applies because the plaintiffs in the Underlying Action could potentially state a claim for invasion of privacy under North Carolina common law. Gelshenen does not dispute that the Underlying Action alleges an injury that arises out of the violation of a privacy right created by federal statute and falls within the scope of the Privacy Exclusion. It merely argues that the exception to the Privacy Exclusion applies. However, the Fourth Circuit has already rejected this argument under almost identical circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Hartford has established that the claim asserted in the Underlying Action falls squarely within the plain language of both exclusions.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greve\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205557669\">\n    2017 WL 5557669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once an insurer establishes that an exclusion precludes coverage, the burden shifts to the policyholder to show that an exception to the exclusion exists and applies to restore coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Home Indem.

Under the terms of the Privacy Exclusion, coverage is not excluded where the factual allegations in the Underlying Action could potentially give rise to common law damages for a violation of privacy claim. Gelshenen argues the facts alleged in the\n   underlying complaint trigger the exception to the exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Hartford asks the Court to follow\n   <em>\n    Hartford Cas.

Hartford refused based on the same two statutory exclusions\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   contained in the Policies here. In granting Hartford's motion for judgment on the pleadings, the district court in\n   <em>\n    Greve\n   </em>\n   found that the alleged violations of the DPPA asserted in the Underlying Action fell directly within the scope of both exclusions. The Fourth Circuit agreed that the DPPA claim fell directly within the scope of Privacy Exclusion and, therefore, stated that it need not address whether the claim would also be excluded under the Communication Exclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the Privacy Exclusion defeated coverage under the plain language of the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fourth Circuit further explained that the exception to the exclusion did not apply because facts alleged in the Underlying Action \"could not state a claim for either type\" of privacy tort recognized by North Carolina law. Here, Gelshenen's Policies are essentially identical to those in Greve, which was decided based on the same Underlying Action. Gelshenen has given no reason why it is any different than\n   <em>\n    Greve\n   </em>\n   , or why the Court should depart from clear Fourth Circuit guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Like\n   <em>\n    Greve\n   </em>\n   , Gelshenen argues that the allegations of the Underlying Action state a claim for an invasion of privacy tort recognized by North Carolina common law. As Hartford explained in its opening memorandum and reply, however, the Underlying Action does not attempt to assert a common law claim, and the facts alleged do not support a common law privacy claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. (#36) at 12; Pl.'s Reply (#38) at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greve\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=742%20F.%20App%27x%20738\">\n    742 F.

Applicability of Communication Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, as a separate and independent matter, Gelshenen argues that, because some of his actions did not involve the sending, transmitting, communication or distribution of material, the Communication\n   Exclusion is inapplicable. It contends that there are both potentially covered and non-covered claims included in the allegations and, therefore, all claims must be defended. Def.'s Mem. Opp. Mot.
