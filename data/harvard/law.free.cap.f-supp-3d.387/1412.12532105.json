Fla. 2017) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the motion, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because she has not sufficiently alleged that Defendant, or a third party on its behalf, used an ATDS. Defendant also contends that Plaintiff expressly consented to receiving messages, including from an ATDS, when she voluntarily gave her cellular telephone number to Defendant as part of their business relationship. In response, Plaintiff asserts that the allegations in the amended complaint are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Federal courts have found \"the bare allegation a defendant used an ATDS sufficiently states a claim under the TCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Wijesinha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2057136\">\n    2019 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 34124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2019). Here, the amended complaint contains more than a bare allegation. Accepting the well-pled allegations as true, the Court finds it is plausible that Defendant, or a third-party on its behalf, used an ATDS. Specifically, Plaintiff alleged that the text message does not provide any identifiable characteristic of the intended recipient, is impersonal and generic, and includes an \"opt-out\" feature. D.E. 11 \u00b6\u00b6 45-47. The phone number used by Defendant is a \"long code\" that enables it to send text messages\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   , while deceiving recipients into believing the message was personalized and sent from an individual.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-50. Defendant also used systems that allowed text messages to be sent to randomly or sequentially generated numbers without human intervention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Thus, Plaintiff plausibly alleged this element of its TCPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Furthermore, telephone calls that otherwise violate the TCPA may nevertheless be lawful if they were made \"with the prior express consent of the called party[.]\" \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A). However, the existence of prior express consent is not an element of a prima facie case, but rather an affirmative defense for which the defendant bears the burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    Gambon v. R &amp; F Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:14-cv-403,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20179125\">\n    2014 U.S. Dist.

Jan. 5, 2015) (adopting report and recommendation) (citations omitted). Thus, the Court need not address the issue of prior express consent at this juncture. However, taking the factual allegations as true, the Court finds that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that she did not provide prior express consent. D.E. 11 \u00b6\u00b6 43, 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Class Allegations and Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Next, Defendant moves to strike Plaintiff's class allegations because the defined class is a fail-safe class which is not ascertainable. At this early stage in litigation, the Court finds a ruling on the merits of the putative class allegations premature. The Court will address arguments regarding the appropriateness of the class definition\n   at the class certification stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eisenband v.

The arguments raised in Defendant's motion to strike class allegations are better suited for a response to a formal motion for class certification, if and when one is filed. As there is no factual record, it is not possible at this time to for the Court to determine whether the class certification will ultimately fail.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition, Defendant argues that because Plaintiff has not alleged a likelihood of future injury, she does not have standing to pursue declaratory relief. As such, Defendant moves to strike Plaintiff's request for a declaration that Defendant's practices violate the TCPA. To have standing to obtain declaratory relief, \"a plaintiff must allege facts from which it appears there is a substantial likelihood that he will suffer injury in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Walden v.

In the amended complaint, Plaintiff does not assert that any violative conduct since she received the text message in February of 2019. Not only are there no allegations of continuing violations, but there are no allegations of likely future violations. The Court agrees that has Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege or demonstrate that she is likely to suffer injury in the future. Therefore, Plaintiff lacks standing to seek declaratory relief. Accordingly, the Court will strike the request for declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, the Court denies Defendant's request for attorney's fees and costs for defending the amended complaint. Defendant has not provided a statutory or contractual basis for an award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Because Plaintiff has stated a plausible claim for relief for a violation of the TCPA, the Court will not dismiss the amended complaint. In addition, the Court will address arguments regarding the class definition upon a formal motion for class certification. Further, the Court will strike the request for declaratory relief. Accordingly, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Motion (D.E. 14) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.
