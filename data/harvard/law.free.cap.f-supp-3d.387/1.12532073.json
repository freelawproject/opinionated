Yet, the opinion exhibits that forgoing an evidentiary hearing reflected an assessment of the merits of Fields' third claim-the only claim which did not encounter a procedural bar. Specifically, the district court judge explained that the factual predicates for the claim-that Simmons' testimony was false and that Sowells had divulged exculpatory information-were unsubstantiated.\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20148739\">\n    2006 WL 148739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3.

Given that assessment of the merits, the motion could be denied under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) based exclusively on the \"parties' submissions and relevant portions of the record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at *1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, insofar as Fields' Rule 60(b) motion claims an unfair proceeding due to the lack of an evidentiary hearing, that position seeks to revisit the merits of his underlying claim under \u00a7 2255. This Court lacks jurisdiction to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nor does the Court have jurisdiction to consider reopening the judgment denying Fields' \u00a7 2255 motion because no discovery was conducted. \"A habeas petitioner, unlike the usual civil litigant in federal court, is not entitled to discovery as a matter of ordinary course.\"\n   <em>\n    Bracy v.

Warden, Wyoming Medium Corr.

Therefore, Rule 60(b) is not the proper vehicle to present arguments about the denial of a discovery request in a habeas proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Yet, Fields did not request discovery for the \u00a7 2255 motion that he now seeks to revisit.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Vacate. Therefore, the absence of discovery does not reflect any determination of the merits of the claim for which Fields sought discovery. Still, Fields' prior failure to request discovery dooms his Rule 60(b) motion all the same. When a Rule 60(b) motions attacks a defect that was, in fact, \"based on the movant's own conduct, or his habeas counsel's omissions,\" that motion \"ordinarily does not go to the integrity of the proceedings, but in effect asks for a second chance to have the merits favorably determined.\"\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209485\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/524/#p529\">\n    545 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   532 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209485\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/524/#p529\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Post v.

Here, too, Fields' assertion that, in the absence of discovery, the integrity of his prior habeas proceeding was comprised, is a disguised effort to relitigate the habeas petition. Without the D.C. Circuit's permission, this Court does not have jurisdiction to consider that argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The government asks that, rather than deny Fields' motion, the motion should be transferred, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201631\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to the D.C.
