Diamond, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs John Cunningham, David Ciuffetelli, Benjamin DiDonato, and John Rucki, Jr. challenge two amendments to Defendant Wawa, Inc.'s Employee Stock Ownership Plan that eliminated their right to hold Wawa stock through age 68 and forced them to sell their shares at a purportedly unfair price. (Compl., Doc. No. 1.) Plaintiffs seek to certify a Class of all terminated employee participants in the ESOP whose accounts were liquidated after September 12, 2015 for Counts I-IV, IX, and X in their Complaint. (Doc. No. 56.) They also seek to certify a Subclass of: (1) all Class members who participated in\n   the ESOP before January 1, 2014 and were terminated on or after January 1, 2015 for Counts VI and VIII in their Complaint; and (2) all Class members who retired between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2014 for Counts V-VIII in their Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants challenge class certification as to only three claims. (Doc. No. 57.) I will grant Plaintiffs' Motion to Certify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Established in 1992, the Wawa Employee Stock Ownership Plan is an ERISA-qualified employee benefit plan sponsored by Defendant Wawa; its primary asset is Wawa equity. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 16, 29; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 3, 16, 29, Doc. No. 49.) The Retirement Plans Committee is the ESOP administrator. (Compl. \u00b6 17; Answer \u00b6 17.) Individual Defendants Culotta, Eckhardt, Morey, Pulos, Swartz, and Wiggins are Committee members and Wawa officers. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-24; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 18-24.) Individual Defendants Wood, Wright, and Stoeckel are the Trustees of the ESOP. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-27; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Wawa ESOP initially permitted all retired and terminated employees-including those terminated for cause-to continue to hold Wawa stock through the ESOP after their Wawa employment ended. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ESOP (eff. Jan. 1, 2004), Doc. No. 56-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Peterson Dep. 120:21-121:8, Doc. No. 77-3, Civ. No. 16-497;\n   <em>\n    accord.\n   </em>\n   Stipulation \u00b6 2, Doc. No. 54.) As required by ERISA, Wawa periodically provided Summary Plan Descriptions of the Plan terms. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37, 43, 46; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 37, 43, 46; Peterson Dep. 70:18-25);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201022\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Each SPD stated that terminated employee participants would be \"paid in the same form and manner as retirement benefits,\" and that \"no amendment to the Plan will reduce the benefit you have already earned or divest you of any entitlement to a benefit.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2004 SPD 8-9, Doc. No. 77-4, Civ. No. 16-497; 2006 SPD 9, Doc. No. 77-5, Civ. No. 16-497; 2011 SPD 9, Doc. No. 77-6, Civ. No. 16-497; 2014 SPD 12, Doc. No. 77-7, Civ. No. 16-497;\n   <em>\n    accord.\n   </em>\n   Joint Stipulation \u00b6 1, Doc. No. 46.) The SPDs also provided that \"if the total value of your benefit is more than $5,000, you may elect to delay payment until the April 1 of the year following the year you reach age 68.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2011 SPD 9; 2014 SPD 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2004 SPD 8-9; 2006 SPD 9 (until 2011, former employees could hold Wawa stock until age 70\u00bd).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning in 2014, Wawa amended the ESOP to remove former employees from the Plan. (ESOP (eff. Jan. 1, 2014) Art. V \u00a7 5.2(d), Doc. No. 77-9, Civ. No. 16-497.) The 2014 Amendment required the Trustee to liquidate the ESOP stock of any Participant who terminated employment\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   January 1, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The 2014 Amendment stated that all liquidated proceeds would be transferred to Participants' 401(k) accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Parties dispute when Defendants informed Participants about this Amendment. Plaintiffs allege that they did not learn about the 2014 Amendment until \"at least mid-August 2014 and possibly as late as sometime in 2015.\" (Compl. \u00b6 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 7, 2015, Wawa amended the ESOP again-this time requiring the Trustee to liquidate the ESOP stock of any Participant who terminated employment\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   January 1, 2015. (ESOP Amendments, Doc. No. 77-12, Civ. No. 16-497.) On August 10, 2015, Wood and Stoeckel (the ESOP Trustees) sent a letter to all terminated employees informing them that Wawa had adopted the 2015 Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 77-21, Civ. No. 16-497.) On September 11, 2015, Defendants began effectuating that Amendment: terminated participants received $6,940 per share of Wawa stock and were required to pay a\n   $50.00 distribution fee. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77, 80, 86, 103; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 77, 80, 103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs Cunningham, Ciuffetelli, Rucki, and DiDonato are terminated employee ESOP participants who were divested of their Wawa stock because of the Plan Amendments. Wawa terminated: (1) Cunningham in September 2011; (2) DiDonato in September 2013; (3) Rucki in January 2015; and (4) Ciuffetelli in August 2015. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-15; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 12-15.) Wawa liquidated shares in Cunningham, Ciuffetelli, and Rucki's ESOP accounts in March 2016, and DiDonato's in March 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 1, 2016, two terminated Wawa employees, acting on behalf of a proposed Class of terminated Wawa employees, challenged the 2015 Amendment. (Compl., Doc. No. 1, Civ. No. 16-497.) The case,\n   <em>\n    Pfeifer v. Wawa\n   </em>\n   , settled on August 31, 2018. The\n   <em>\n    Pfeifer\n   </em>\n   settlement Class included: (1) ESOP participants who ended employment with Wawa\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   January 1, 2015; and (2) ESOP participants who retired\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   January 1, 2011. (Doc. Nos. 133, 134, Civ. No. 16-497;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 5.) These Class participants had their ESOP accounts liquidated on September 11, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 8, 2018, while the\n   <em>\n    Pfeifer\n   </em>\n   settlement was pending, Plaintiffs Cunningham, Ciuffetelli, Rucki, and DiDonato filed the instant Complaint against Wawa and its fiduciaries, on behalf of another group of terminated Wawa employees. (Doc. No. 1.) These Plaintiffs similarly allege that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    Count I\n   </em>\n   : The Trustee and Committee Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by authorizing the ESOP's sale of Wawa stock in the ESOP accounts of Plaintiffs and the Class at a price below fair market value.

Resp. 9.) Defendants argue that the class certification record establishes that the Plan \"expressly conditioned the accrual of benefits on performance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)

I agree. Indeed, Defendants have not argued or presented evidence that any \"poor performers\" went unpaid during their employment, and their corporate representative admitted that before the 2015 Amendment, employees terminated for cause were treated identically under the Plan as those terminated for any other reason. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Peterson Dep. 120:22-121:25.) Moreover, after three years, the Plan provides that a portion of an employee's benefit is no longer forfeitable-directly contradicting Defendants' assertion that Plan benefits could be subsequently forfeited for poor performance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ESOP (eff. Jan. 1, 2004) Art. VI \u00a7 6.3.) The Plan thus provides that the quality of a given Subclass member's performance while employed does not affect the entitlement to benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fields v.

No. 56), Defendants' Response (Doc. No. 57), and all related stipulations and submissions, as well as the arguments presented at the April 18, 2019 hearing, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiffs' Motion (Doc. No. 56) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   1. The case is hereby certified as a class action on behalf of the following individuals:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   a. On Counts I-IV, IX, and X (the \"Class\"): All Participants in the Wawa, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"Wawa ESOP\") with account balances greater than $5,000.00 as of the date that they terminated employment whose accounts were liquidated on or after September 12, 2015 and the beneficiaries of such participants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   b. On Counts VI and VIII (the \"Terminated Pre-2014 Employee Subclass\"): All Participant members of the Class who were employed by Wawa and participated in the ESOP before January 1, 2014 and who terminated employment on or after January 1, 2015 except for Participants whose accounts were liquidated due to death, disability\n   or a voluntary request for distribution, and the beneficiaries of such participants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   c. On Counts V-VIII (the \"Retired Employee Subclass\"): All Participant members of the Class who Retired between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2014 except for Participants whose accounts were liquidated due to death, disability or a voluntary request for distribution, and the beneficiaries of such Participants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   2. Plaintiffs have pled the following claims in their Complaint:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   a. Count I alleges that the Trustee and Committee Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by authorizing the ESOP's sale of Wawa stock in the ESOP accounts of Plaintiffs and the Class at a price below fair market value;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   b. Count II alleges that the Trustee Defendants and Wawa unlawfully caused the Plan to engage in a related party transaction (the forced sale) at a price below fair market value;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   c. Count III alleges that the Trustee Defendants unlawfully caused the Plan to engage in a related party transaction (the forced sale) for inadequate consideration;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   d. Count IV claims that the Trustee and Committee Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by authorizing the forced sale because the sale failed to follow Plan \u00a7 11.2, which prohibits any Plan transfers that decrease the value of the Plan;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   e. Count V claims that the Trustee and Committee Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by misrepresenting that terminated employee participants could hold Wawa stock in their ESOP accounts until age 68;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   f. Count VI alleges that the 2014 and 2015 Plan Amendments violated the anti-cutback provision of ERISA \u00a7 204(g) (as to the distribution of accounts);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   g. Count VII claims that Defendants violated ERISA by unilaterally amending the terms of the ESOP after Plaintiffs and the Class completed performance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   h. Count VIII alleges that the Committee Defendants provided inaccurate information in Summary Plan Descriptions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   i. Count IX claims that Wawa breached its fiduciary duties by failing to monitor the Trustee and Committee Defendants' activities; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   j. Count X claims that to the extent that the Plan attempts to disclaim liability of its fiduciaries for fiduciary breaches, that provision is void as a matter of public policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   3. The Court finds that Counts I-X satisfy the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   a. Because the Class consists of over 1,000 individuals, and the Subclasses each consist of hundreds of members, joinder of all Class members would be impracticable;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   b. The Certified Claims involve common questions of law and fact. The Certified Claims all contest either the validity of the 2014 and 2015 Amendments or the calculation of the fair market value of Wawa stock at the time of the liquidation. The 2014 and 2015 Amendments were applied uniformly to each Class and Subclass\n   member, which requires resolution of the same factual and legal issues for each individual. The Certified Claims also allege that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by making material misrepresentations in class-wide communications, transferring Class and Subclass members' accounts, in determining fair market value for Wawa stock, and in attempting to disclaim liability to fiduciary breaches in the Plan;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   c. With respect to the Certified Claims, Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of the Class and Subclasses and seek the same relief. Plaintiffs Cunningham, Ciuffetelli, Rucki, and DiDonato were all participants in the ESOP until their shares were liquidated in the forced sale. Defendants' conduct-in adopting and implementing the 2014 and 2015 Amendments-was identical as to Plaintiffs and each Class and Subclass member. Defendants have not raised any unique defenses against Plaintiffs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   d. Plaintiffs and their counsel have no interests antagonistic to the Class or Subclasses, and Plaintiffs have retained counsel with extensive experience litigating ERISA class actions, including ESOP cases. Plaintiffs and their counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class and Subclasses;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   4. Counts I, II, III, IV, VI, IX, and X meet the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1) because the Plan administrator is required by law to interpret and consistently apply the terms of the Plan to all similarly-situated participants. As such, varying or inconsistent adjudications regarding the 2014 and 2015 Amendments and the fair market value of Wawa stock would establish incompatible standards of conduct. For similar reasons, an adjudication regarding the interpretation of the Plan as to Plaintiffs would, as a practical matter, adjudicate the same terms with respect to the other participants. Additionally, the relief sought by Plaintiffs supports certification under Rule 23(b)(1) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   5. Counts I-X meet the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Defendants have acted on the same grounds as to all members of the Class and Subclasses by passing the 2014 and 2015 Amendments and using the same fair market value of Wawa stock for all the Class and Subclass members' shares. In addition, Plaintiffs' claims primarily seek declaratory and injunctive relief: a declaration that the 2015 Amendment is invalid and a declaration that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties in implementing the Amendment, in disclosing the terms of the Plan to participants, in determining the fair market value to be paid for Wawa stock, and in transferring participants' accounts. The primary relief sought by invalidation of the 2014 and 2015 Plan Amendments is declaratory and injunctive, and would be accomplished by declaring the Amendment invalid, rescinding the liquidation of Class and Subclass members' Wawa stock, restoring the accounts of the Class and Subclasses in the Wawa ESOP, and reforming the Plan. To the extent that monetary relief is awarded, any monetary relief would flow from the declaratory relief;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   6. In light of the foregoing findings and conclusions, the following are certified as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1) and (b)(2) (as set forth above):\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   a. On behalf of the Class in Paragraph 1: Counts I-IV, IX, and X;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   b. On behalf of the Terminated Pre-2014 Employee Subclass in Paragraph 1: Counts VI and VIII; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   c. On behalf of the Retired Employee Subclass in Paragraph 1: Counts V-VIII.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   7. Pursuant to Rule 23(a)(4) : (1) Plaintiffs John Cunningham, David Ciuffetelli, Benjamin DiDonato, and John Rucki, Jr. are hereby appointed representatives of the Class; (2) Plaintiffs Ciuffetelli and Rucki are hereby appointed representatives of the Terminated Pre-2014 Employee Subclass; and (3) Plaintiffs Cunningham and DiDonato are hereby appointed representatives of the Retired Employee Subclass;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   8. Pursuant to Rule 23(g)(1), the law firms of Feinberg Jackson Worthman &amp; Wasow LLP, Block &amp; Leviton LLP, and Donahoo &amp; Associates, P.C. are appointed as Counsel for the Class and Subclasses. Cohen Milstein Sellers &amp; Toll, PLLC is appointed Liaison Counsel for the Class and Subclasses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    AND IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
