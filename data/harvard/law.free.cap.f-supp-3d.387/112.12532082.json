ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Freedom of Information Act requires the FBI to make two showings before the Court may grant a stay of the proceedings: (1) that exceptional circumstances exist, and (2) that the FBI is \"exercising due diligence\" in responding to DCNF's request.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(C)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The FBI argues that it satisfies both of these prongs and asks the Court to stay this matter \"until December 25, 2020, at which time the FBI will begin processing Plaintiff's FOIA request at a rate of 500 reviewed pages per month.\" Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 14, at 10. Under the FBI's proposal, processing of the 7,000 documents would be completed at the end of February 2022. In support of its motion requesting a stay, the FBI submits a declaration\n   from David Hardy, the Section Chief at the FBI's Record/Information Dissemination Section, Information Management Division.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl., ECF No. 14-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Do Exceptional Circumstances Exist?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Number of Requests Received over Time\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant relies on the Hardy Declaration to provide additional details in support of the argument that exceptional circumstances exist. The FBI contends that since 2015, it has faced a \"spike in [the number of FOIPA] requests submitted to the agency,\" resulting in a growing backlog in the processing of such requests. Hardy Decl., ECF No. 14-1, at \u00b6 12. The FBI points to statistical analysis showing that in fiscal years (\"FY\") 2011-2015, the FBI received an average of approximately 19,400 requests, but starting in FY 2016, the number of requests grew 18 percent, and in FY 2017, \"the growth trend increased at an even more accelerated pace\" with an increase of 23 percent over FY 2016, and a subsequent 18 percent rise in FY 2018. Hardy Decl. at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff points out that the FBI relies on a declaration that \"limits its discussion to only those requests received by the FBI from FY 2014 to the present\" and \"lumps together both FOIA and Privacy Act requests.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 15, at 5. Plaintiff disputes the FBI's claims about its unexpected increase in FOIA claims, noting that \"[t]he 'recent surge' in FOIA requests the FBI alleges to have experienced represents the normal and expected increase following the election and inauguration of a new president and the start of a new administration.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 15, at 3. In contrast, the chart attached by Plaintiff, which runs from 2005-2017, gives a more global picture of the total number of FOIA requests, the number processed and the backlog, and it shows that \"the FBI has received fewer FOIA requests during the first two years of the Trump election and Administration than it did under the first two years of the Obama election and Administration,\" and further, that the \"backlog of FOIA requests has only gotten worse.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 15, at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 6 (Table); Bolinder Decl., ECF 15-1, at \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Comparing the requests during the first year of the Obama Administration versus during the first year of the Trump Administration, Plaintiff explains that in the 2008 election year, the FBI received the highest number of requests received in the past decade - 17,241 - which was also 4,732 more than it received the previous year. Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 15, at 5. In contrast, in the 2016 election year, the FBI \"received 15,202 requests,\" which was \"2,039 fewer than 2008 and only 2,271 more than the previous year.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff notes further that in 2009, \"the FBI received 15,664 FOIA requests, which was over 600 more than the 15,042 received in 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff disputes the \"FBI['s] claim[ ] that '[i]nstead of experiencing the peaks and valleys of incoming requests within a relatively predictable range of annual requests, recent figures demonstrate the FBI's annual volume of requests has broken out to new levels not sustainable with existent resources and technology.' \" Pl.'s Opp'n at 6, citing Hardy Decl. at \u00b6 21. Plaintiff claims that this contention is \"belied by the fact that the FBI processed an average of 15,859 requests in 2008-2010, which exceeds the total number of requests received in each of the years since then,\" and furthermore, the historical data over the last thirteen years (provided by Plaintiff) shows that the FBI processed \"roughly the same number of requests as it received\" and \"worked to make up the\n   difference\" in years where it received more requests, comparing the period 2012-2013 with 2014-2015. Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 15, at 6 (Table), at 7 (Chart); Bolinder Decl. at \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court finds that the statistical evidence presented by the parties supports a finding of no exceptional circumstances. While the number of FOIA requests received by the FBI increased from 2015 to 2016, from 12,931 to 15,202, the number held steady at around 15,100 from 2016 to 2017, and this was not as high as the number of requests received during the 2008-2009 time frame, which ranged between 15,664 and 17,241 requests. The statistical evidence cited by the Defendant shows a steady increase in FOIPA requests (about 20 percent annually) from 2016-2018. Accordingly, the increase in the amount of FOIA requests cannot be said to be unforeseen or remarkable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Complexity of the Requests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The FBI claims that FOIA requests have \"grown significantly more complex\" because they \"contain numerous and/or multi-faceted subject and often require much more coordination with external and internal stakeholders to ensure the FBI makes appropriate disclosure decisions.\" Hardy Decl., ECF No. 13-1, at \u00b6 13.

The Declaration focuses instead on the general manner in which the FBI processes FOIA requests, the structure of RIDS, and technological improvements. The Declaration mentions that RIDS is currently engaging in an \"aggressive hiring program\" designed to \"keep up with constant personnel turnover,\" with the proviso that \"it takes years to fully develop a FOIA analyst.\" Hardy Decl., ECF No. 14-1, at \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff notes that the backlog of FOIA requests significantly increased from 2015 (around 2,600) to 2016-2017 (hovering around 4,400) from where it was during 2008-2010 (around 1,450), even though the number of FOIA requests was highest in 2008-2009, and the number of FOIA requests was comparable in 2016-2017 to the number in 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 6 (Table). Plaintiff includes a Chart in its Opposition titled \"FBI Backlog Against Number of Requests\" and observes that while \"the FBI absorbed the significant increase in FOIA requests in 2008-2010 without carrying a significant backlog,\" the FBI has failed to respond to the \"steady increase in the number of FOIA requests over the last six years\" or to address the \"bump\" at the onset of the new administration, and therefore, the backlog has grown. Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 15, at 12 (Chart). Plaintiff contends that the FBI has not done enough to control or reduce its backlog with regard to FOIA processing generally or this case specifically, where \"the only backlog reduction noted in the FBI's declaration is that, through negotiation, it reduced the number of pages to be processed.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 15, at 12.

During 2008 and 2009, the FBI was processing around 16,400 requests each year, similar to the approximately 15,600 requests processed in 2017; however, the backlog was around 1,400 requests in 2008-2009, while it stands at around 4,400 requests in both 2016 and 2017. Furthermore, while the number of requests processed in 2016 was approximately 13,750, which was on par with 2015, the backlog jumped from approximately 2,600 in 2015 to 4,300 in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With regard to any affirmative steps taken by the FBI in this case to reduce its FOIA backlog, the FBI did effectively encourage Plaintiff to modify its request with a resulting reduction from 11,000 to 7,000 regarding the number of potentially responsive pages. The FBI mentioned that it is engaged currently in an \"aggressive hiring program\" to try to keep up with \"constant personnel turnover,\" and it has secured additional funding recently to hire more contract personnel; however, the FBI concedes that it \"takes years to fully develop a FOIA analyst\" and thus, the \"increase in production from these contractors will likely be incremental.\" Hardy Decl., ECF 14-1, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39 &amp; n.19. The Court finds that the FBI has not demonstrated\n   that it has addressed its FOIA backlog in a meaningful and timely fashion so as to warrant an\n   <em>\n    Open America\n   </em>\n   stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The FBI has indicated that there are 7,000 potentially responsive documents to Plaintiff's modified request. This Court finds no reason in this case to vary from the FBI's policy of processing 500 pages per month, which will result in a processing schedule spanning 14 months from June 2019 through August 2020.
