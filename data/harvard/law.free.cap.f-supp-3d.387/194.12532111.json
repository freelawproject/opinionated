In its complaint, New Hope alleges that the \"regulation was adopted for the purpose of targeting faith-based adoption ministries,\" that OCFS promulgated the regulation for the purpose of suppressing faith-based policies such as those of New Hope, which it found objectionable, and that the regulation is \"not neutral or generally applicable as applied.\" Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 204, 248.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   On its face, 18 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 421.3(d) is generally applicable and it is plainly not the object of the regulation to interfere with New Hope's, or any other agency's, exercise of religion. The regulation states that \"[a]uthorized agencies providing adoption services shall ... prohibit discrimination and harassment against applicants for\n   adoption services on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, religion, or disability, and, shall take reasonable steps to prevent such discrimination or harassment by staff and volunteers, promptly investigate incidents of discrimination and harassment, and take reasonable and appropriate corrective or disciplinary action when such incidents occur.\" 18 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 421.3(d). The regulation applies to all authorized agencies, regardless of any religious affiliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Moreover, section 421.3(d) is neutral. In determining the neutrality of a law or regulation, a court may consider, among other things, \"the historical background of the decision under challenge, the specific series of events leading to the enactment or official policy in question, and the legislative or administrative history, including contemporaneous statements made by members of the decisionmaking body.\"\n   <em>\n    Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.

The plain language of the regulation demonstrates its neutrality, which makes no reference to religion, other than to prohibit religious discrimination. Further, as discussed in more detail above, the actions of OCFS leading up to the promulgation of section 421.3(d) further support a finding of neutrality. After New York codified the right to adopt by unmarried adult couples and married adult couples regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, the communications from OCFS indicate that it could not \"contemplate any case where the issue of sexual orientation would be a legitimate basis, whether in whole or in part, to deny the application of a person to be an adoptive parent.\" Moreover, in discussing the purpose of the regulation, OCFS stated that it was to \"[p]rohibit[ ] discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression in essential social services.\" N.Y.S. Register, Nov. 6, 2013, p.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The rule making documents and subsequent OCFS Information Letters clearly set forth the intent of section 421.3(d). When read in connection with the explicit intended purpose of the regulation and the established law relating to adoption, the allegations that New Hope's religious beliefs are incidentally affected by the regulation are insufficient for the Court to find that New Hope has pled a plausible First Amendment free exercise claim. Absent from the complaint and submissions in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction are any allegations of type of hostility or bias demonstrated in\n   <em>\n    Masterpiece Cakeshop\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Lukumi\n   </em>\n   . Rather, the facts before the Court more closely align with\n   <em>\n    Fulton\n   </em>\n   , where the Third Circuit found that the plaintiff was unlikely to succeed on its claim because the record demonstrated that the defendant respected the plaintiff's sincerely held beliefs while enforcing the anti-discrimination provision at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   New Hope further argues that \"the Regulation is not neutral or 'generally applicable' because it exists within a framework that makes numerous exceptions to OCFS's supposed antidiscrimination policy, permitting and even requiring 'discrimination' in many contexts based on many factors including secular, religious, and racial, as well as based on the very wide individualized discretion of the evaluating\n   agency concerning the fitness of the would-be adoptive parents, all in service of the foundational goal of the best interests of the child.\" Dkt. No. 36 at 13 (citing Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 172-81, 248-49, 262). Contrary to New Hope's suggestion, these \"exceptions\" to the anti-discrimination policy do not render the regulation non-neutral or generally applicable. New Hope cites to provisions in the regulations that require authorized agencies to consider things such as the \"age of the child and of the adoptive parent(s); ... the cultural, ethnic, or racial background of the child and the capacity of the adoptive parent to meet the needs of the child with such background as one of a number of factors used to determine best interests.\" 18 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 421.18. However, as the Third Circuit found in\n   <em>\n    Fulton\n   </em>\n   , there are significant differences between New Hope's refusal to recommend or place children with unmarried couples or same sex couples as adoptive parents and the requirement for authorized agencies to consider such things as the race of the child and prospective adoptive parents in determining the best interests of the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fulton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520907\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/140/\">\n    922 F.3d at 157-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Most significantly, unlike New Hope's practice, the cited provisions do not permit authorized agencies to refuse to work with individuals because of their membership in a protected class. Instead, the cited provisions are clearly intended to find the best fit for each child, \"taking the whole of that child's life and circumstances into account.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520907\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/140/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, nothing in the record suggests that OCFS has knowingly permitted any other authorized agency to discriminate against members of a protected class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   New Hope also contends that \"the\n   <em>\n    enforcement\n   </em>\n   of the Regulation has been decidedly non-neutral, 'target[ing] and show[ing] hostility towards ... New Hope because of its religious beliefs and practices,' ... demanding that New Hope 'compromise' its beliefs as a condition of staying open, ... and revoking approval of multiple faith-based agencies because of their faith-based policies concerning the families with whom they place children.\" Dkt. No. 36 at 13-14 (quoting Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 236, 192, 202-03). Further, New Hope contends that \"OCFS's targeting of and hostility towards New Hope because of its faith-based policy is further demonstrated by OCFS's threat to revoke New Hope's license even though this threat is contrary to law - which authorizes OCFS to order a licensed agency to cease providing services\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   in the event that it makes findings of abuse which OCFS has not made - and could not make - with respect to New Hope.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520907\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/140/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 14 (citing Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 200, 251).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   This is a common theme present throughout New Hope's submissions. Basically, New Hope's argument can be broken down as follows: OCFS is targeting New Hope because it discriminates against same-sex couples and unmarried opposite-gender couples; New Hope is discriminating against same-sex couples and unmarried opposite-gender couples because of its religious beliefs; therefore, OCFS is targeting New Hope for its religious beliefs. This syllogism, however, runs directly counter to the premise of\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   that, while religious belief is always protected, religiously motivated conduct enjoys no special protections or exemption from neutral, generally applied legal requirements. The fact that New Hope's conduct springs from sincerely held and strongly felt religious beliefs does not imply that OCFS's decision to regulate that conduct springs from antipathy to those beliefs. \"If all comment and action on religiously motivated conduct by those enforcing neutral, generally applicable laws against discrimination is construed as ill will against the religious belief itself, then\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   is a dead letter,\n   and the nation's civil rights laws might be as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Fulton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520907\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/140/\">\n    922 F.3d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Having concluded that section 421.3(d) is facially neutral and generally applicable, and that it has been neutrally and generally applied in this case, the Court concludes that OCFS's enforcement of it is rationally related to a number of legitimate government objectives.

The process of authorizing such agencies here, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Velazquez\n   </em>\n   , is not intended to create a forum for private speech or to facilitate private speech. Adoption agencies like New Hope were authorized to perform governmental functions for OCFS. That New Hope's work as an authorized agency is governmental in nature is further supported by the fact that OCFS provides regular oversight of its authorized agencies and, in fact, provides the same services through state operated adoption agencies. As the court found in\n   <em>\n    Fulton\n   </em>\n   , New Hope's work as an authorized agency is an extension of OCFS's own work and New Hope's speech, to the extent any is required when performing its services as an authorized agency, constitutes governmental speech under\n   <em>\n    Velazquez\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fulton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526229\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/320/661/\">\n    320 F.

Therefore, OCFS is permitted to \"take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message,\" that adoption and foster care services are provided to all New Yorkers consistent with anti-discrimination policy set forth in 18 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 421.3(d), was and is \"neither garbled nor distorted by\" New Hope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Further, the Court finds that, even assuming\n   <em>\n    Velazquez\n   </em>\n   does not apply to the present matter, New Hope's compelled speech claim must still be dismissed because OCFS and the regulation simply do not compel speech. New Hope argues that \"requiring New Hope to work with, counsel, and recommend unmarried and same-sex couples 'would, at the very least, force [New Hope] to send a message, both to [other adoptive parents, to birthparents] and to the world, that [New Hope] accepts' such relationships as appropriate and believes that adoption by such couples can be in the best interests of the child.\" Dkt. No. 36 at 24 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dale\n   </em>\n   , 530 U.S. at 653,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414133\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/640/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Contrary to New Hope's contention, no such message is being compelled. Rather, application of section 421.3(d) to New Hope simply prohibits discrimination against potential adoptive parents on the basis of marital status and sexual orientation. In approving an unmarried or same sex couple for adoption, the only message that would be conveyed is that, applying the regulatory criteria set forth above, placement with such a couple would be in the child's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Although not entirely clear from the face of the complaint, at oral argument, New Hope's counsel clarified that the free speech claim that they are attempting to raise is not that the adoption itself is the expressive activity, but rather the \"ministry\" that New Hope engages in on an ongoing basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Oral Argument dated Feb. 19, 2019 (\"Tr.\") at 27. However, as the complaint and other evidence before the Court makes clear, OCFS is not prohibiting New Hope's ongoing ministry in any way or compelling it to\n   change the message it wishes to convey. New Hope is not being forced to state that it approves of non-married or same sex couples. Rather, the only statement being made by approving such couples as adoptive parents is that they satisfy the criteria set forth by the state, without regard to any views as to the marital status or sexual orientation of the couple.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Given the extensive religious ministry and information provided to potential adoptive parents, there is no doubt that New Hope's general disapproval of cohabiting unmarried couples and same sex couples will continue to be made clear. Indeed, nothing is preventing New Hope from continuing to share its religious beliefs throughout the entire process. All that is forbidden is discrimination against prospective adoptive parents on the basis of their marital status and/or sexual orientation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Telescope Media Group v.

Additionally, it has not alleged that any other authorized agencies are refusing to apply the relevant statutory and regulatory factors when determining whether approval of a family's application to adopt would be in a child's best interest. Instead, New Hope alleges only that the general applicability of section 421.3(d) incidentally touches on its beliefs.

After reviewing New Hope's adoption program, OCFS praised many aspect of the program and expressed a desire to resolve the issues identified in a way in which New Hope is able to continue providing adoption services. Such facts clearly fail to demonstrate a discriminatory purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In establishing discriminatory effect, a plaintiff is not \"obligated to show a better treated, similarly situated group of individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Pyke v.

The complaint make clear that the only purpose behind OCFS's actions was to prevent unlawful discrimination on the basis of marital status and sexual orientation. The complaint further alleges that OCFS enforced or was in the process of enforcing section 421.3(d) against other faith-based providers, including \"several Catholic providers, a Jewish provider, an LDS [ (Latter Day Saints) ], and a Muslim provider\" who shared New Hope's beliefs \"concerning life, marriage, the family, and human sexuality.\" Dkt.

Such consistent enforcement of this neutral regulation against other authorized agencies engaging in the same discriminatory conduct as alleged here renders New Hope's allegation of discriminatory animus implausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Since New Hope has failed to allege intentional discrimination, rational basis\n   review applies.

Having already found that New Hope has failed to plausibly allege any violation of its constitutional rights, the Court grants OCFS's motion to dismiss as to New Hope's unconstitutional conditions claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Catholic Charities of Maine, Inc. v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Undoubtedly, New Hope and all authorized adoption agencies perform essential services that greatly impact the lives of thousands of children who, without such organizations, would grow up without a home. As New Hope notes in its complaint, there are over 440,000 children in foster care in the United States, with over 120,000 of those children waiting to be adopted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. In federal fiscal year 2017, New York had 27,268 children served in foster care, with 19,213 in foster care as of September 30, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. Of those, over 4,400 New York children were waiting to be adopted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. Further, during fiscal year 2017, throughout New York, a total of only 1,729 children were adopted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   It is clear from the materials before the Court that OCFS does not contend that New Hope is not acting in the best interests of the children when placing these children for adoption. In fact, after OCFS conducted is review on September 6, 2018, Director Sara Simon sent New Hope a letter in which she praised New Hope's strengths in certain areas, including its \"strong emphasis on assisting the birth parents in making an informed decision for their newborn, providing them time to make the decision, along with a supportive and detailed adoptive family selection process.\" Dkt. No. 1-6 at 3. The issue which led to the present matter is the refusal to provide adoption services to unmarried same sex couples or same sex couples regardless of marital status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The gratitude owed to all those working to better the lives of New York's most\n   vulnerable children is too great to convey in words. While such gratitude is ultimately ineffable, the Court still concludes this Memorandum-Decision and Order by recognizing the parties in this case for their many years of sacrifice and labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Until recent events, the parties have had a fruitful relationship; a relationship that has benefitted New York's children in immeasurable ways. For this reason, the Court would prefer that the parties seek out some compromise to their current dispute without further judicial intervention. As the district court noted in\n   <em>\n    Fulton\n   </em>\n   , \"[c]reative problem solving through concerted and thoughtful discourse without court intervention is often the best method to avoid what may appear to the parties, or to other persons in the public, to be harsh legal results.\"\n   <em>\n    Fulton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526229\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/320/661/\">\n    320 F. Supp. 3d at 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Ultimately, OCFS stands on firm ground in requiring authorized agencies to abide by New York's non-discrimination policies when administering public services. Under\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the First Amendment does not prohibit government regulation of religiously motivated conduct so long as that regulation is not a veiled attempt to suppress disfavored religious beliefs. And while New Hope may assert that OCFS's actions were not driven by a sincere commitment to equality, but rather by antireligious bias, the current record does not show religious persecution or bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   After carefully reviewing the entire record in this matter, the parties' submissions and the applicable law, the Court hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   that OCFS's motion to dismiss (Dkt.

New Hope then proceeds to present a convoluted theory of an equal protection violation that is entirely inapplicable to the present matter.
