In his initial four-count Complaint, Plaintiff alleges claims of wrongful termination in violation of the Vermont Occupational Safety and Health Act (\"VOSHA\"), 21 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 201 -32; wrongful termination in violation of public policy; breach of contract; and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the court are Defendant's motion to dismiss (Doc. 3), Plaintiff's motion to amend his Complaint (Doc. 12), and Plaintiff's supplemental motion to amend his Complaint (Doc. 13). Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), Defendant seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiff opposes dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In Plaintiff's first motion to amend his Complaint, he seeks to add a claim for wrongful termination in violation of the Vermont Earned Sick Time Act (\"VESTA\"), 21 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 481 -87. In Plaintiff's supplemental motion to amend his Complaint, he seeks to add a claim for promissory estoppel. Defendant opposes these proposed amendments on the grounds that they are futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is represented by William J. Pettersen, IV, Esq. Defendant is represented\n   by Kevin L. Kite, Esq., Mara D. Afzali, Esq., and Michael D. Billok, Esq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Complaint's Allegations.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff is a resident of Ferrisburgh, Vermont. Defendant is a corporation with headquarters in Kentucky that was awarded a Department of Labor contract to manage and operate the Northland Job Corps Center (\"NJCC\") in Vergennes, Vermont. The NJCC is an educational facility that provides training and employment services to disadvantaged youth and adults. On or about May 23, 2018, Defendant hired Plaintiff as a full-time residential counselor in the Department of Independent Living at NJCC. Plaintiff's duties included overseeing NJCC dormitories and ensuring that they were sanitary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about Monday, July 23, 2018, a group of NJCC students reported to Plaintiff and the lead counselor, Angela Mobley, that they did not have any cleaning sanitizer. The students complained that the counselor who usually supervised their dormitory had failed to keep the dormitory properly stocked with sanitizer, although they did not specify how long this condition persisted. At the time, many of the students in that dormitory were sick, as was the counselor who usually supervised them. The students showed Plaintiff and Ms. Mobley an empty cleaning basket that purportedly should have contained cleaning supplies. Plaintiff alleges that counselors are required to ensure sanitizer is available to all students to clean their dormitories. Ms. Mobley thereafter obtained four spray bottles and sanitizer for the dormitory. At a meeting with counselors on the same day, she asked the counselors how they were doing and one of the counselors, Tori Ramos, stated that she was extremely sick. Ms. Mobley responded to the effect of \"you people in Vermont need to take your medicine.\" (Doc. 6 at 3.) Ms. Mobley told Ms. Ramos that she could go home if she could find someone to assume her duties and responsibilities. Plaintiff alleges that \"[u]pon information and belief, Ms. Ramos ended up working her entire shift on Monday.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the morning of Tuesday, July 24, 2018, Plaintiff met with Alisha Grangent, the Center Director of NJCC responsible for overseeing the NJCC campus, and expressed his concern that the failure of \"one or more counselors\" to properly supply a dormitory with cleaning supplies and Ms. Mobley's refusal to permit counselors to leave work when they were sick was placing students and employees at risk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Ms. Grangent responded by noting that Christina Brace, the Acting Wellness Coordinator, had informed her about an abdominal virus that was \"going around campus[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That same day, Plaintiff left work before the end of his shift after informing Ms. Grangent and her executive assistant that he was leaving early because he felt ill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff was not scheduled to work on Wednesday, July 25, 2018 or Thursday, July 26, 2018. On Wednesday July 25, 2018, Plaintiff called Defendant's Human Resources Department, located at its corporate office in Kentucky, and left a voicemail indicating that there were \"some difficulties on campus at NJCC that he would like to report.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges that he received no response to his voicemail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the morning of Friday, July 27, 2018, prior to arriving at work, Plaintiff called Mari Trybendis, a Human Resources Assistant, and asked how to submit a written\n   complaint regarding his health and safety concerns. He also asked for reassignment from the Department of Independent Living to another unspecified department. Ms. Trybendis directed Plaintiff to email his complaint to her as well as his request for reassignment and to copy Ms. Grangent on those communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff drafted a letter to Bernadette Brookes, Human Resources Manager, wherein he explained the health and safety issues that he had witnessed earlier in the week, noted that he believed those issues posed \"an unnecessary risk to him and others[,]\" and requested a reassignment from the Department of Independent Living.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Plaintiff emailed this letter to Ms. Trybendis and Ms. Grangent on Friday, July 27, 2018 and asked that they direct the letter to other appropriate supervisors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A few hours after sending the July 27, 2018 email, Plaintiff received a voicemail from Ms. Brookes notifying him that she wished to speak with him about his continued employment. Plaintiff met with Ms. Brookes that afternoon, at which time Ms. Brookes terminated Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff asked Ms. Brookes why she had not addressed any of his complaints. Ms. Brookes responded that she had not received any complaints from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant thereafter issued Plaintiff a termination notice dated July 27, 2018 which stated that Plaintiff was terminated because he did not report for his scheduled shifts on Monday, July 23, Tuesday, July 24, and Wednesday July 25, 2018. The termination notice was signed by Ms. Mobley, Ms. Brookes, and Howard Harmon, Defendant's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Plaintiff alleges that the claimed reason for his termination was false and pretextual and that he was actually terminated because he complained to his supervisors regarding health and safety violations he witnessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant's Employee Handbook (the \"Handbook\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   states as follows in its introductory section:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   All parties involved will adhere to ETR's Core Values in all that we do.

Whether Plaintiff's Claim for Wrongful Termination in Violation of VESTA is Futile.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In his First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), Plaintiff alleges that he reported a violation of 21 V.S.A. \u00a7 483(g), which provides that \"[a]n employer shall not require an employee to find a replacement for absences, including absences for professional diagnostic, preventive, routine, or therapeutic health care[,]\" and was wrongfully terminated as a result. VESTA incorporates the retaliation provision set forth in 21 V.S.A. \u00a7 397, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (a) An employer shall not discharge or in any other manner retaliate against an employee because:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (1) the employee lodged a complaint of a violation of this subchapter;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (2) the employee has cooperated with the Commissioner in an investigation of a violation of this subchapter; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (3) the employer believes that the employee may lodge a complaint or cooperate in an investigation of a violation of this subchapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (b) Any person aggrieved by a violation of this section may bring an action in the Civil Division of the Superior Court seeking compensatory and punitive damages or equitable relief, including restraint of prohibited acts, restitution of wages or benefits, reinstatement, costs, reasonable attorney's fees, and other appropriate relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   21 V.S.A. \u00a7 397 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   21 V.S.A. \u00a7 483(1) (\"The provisions against retaliation set forth in section 397 of this title shall apply to this subchapter.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege that it committed a violation of 21 V.S.A. \u00a7 483(g) because he does not provide support for his allegation that another counselor was prevented from leaving work when she was sick. In the FAC, Plaintiff asserts that he overheard Ms. Mobley tell another counselor who was sick that \"she could go home if she could find someone to fill in for her.\" (Doc. 12-1 at 4.) Plaintiff further alleges that he communicated to Ms. Grangent his concern regarding \"the failure on the part of Ms. Mobley to let her counselors go home when they were sick\" and that he sent a letter to Ms. Grangent and Ms. Trybendis \"notifying his supervisors about the health and safety issues he had witnessed earlier in the week.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Accepting these facts as true, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that Ms. Mobley required another employee, Ms. Ramos, to find a replacement in order to leave work due to an illness in violation of 21 V.S.A. \u00a7 483(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant next contends that Plaintiff fails to plead a retaliation claim because he did not follow the procedures allegedly required by 21 V.S.A. \u00a7 483(n) or the administrative rules promulgated by the Department of Labor for lodging a complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff responds that his oral\n   and written complaints to his supervisors concerning Ms. Mobley's actions constitute protected activity under 21 V.S.A. \u00a7 397(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Neither VESTA nor the Vermont courts have defined what it means to \"lodge[ ] a complaint\" under 21 V.S.A. \u00a7 397(a)(1). The Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act (\"VFEPA\"), 21 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 495 -96, includes the following analogous retaliation provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   An employer, employment agency, or labor organization shall not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because the employee ... has lodged a complaint or has testified, assisted, or participated in any manner with the Attorney General, a State's Attorney, the Department of Labor, or the Human Rights Commission in an investigation of prohibited acts or practices[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   21 V.S.A. \u00a7 495(a)(8)(B).
