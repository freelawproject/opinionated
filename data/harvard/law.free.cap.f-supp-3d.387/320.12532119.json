STANTON, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This memorandum addresses points which are somewhat esoteric, but important because they affect the presence or absence of diversity jurisdiction: the difference between \"citizens\" and \"residents.\" Diversity jurisdiction depends on different\n   <em>\n    citizenship\n   </em>\n   , and on the citizenship of each member of a limited liability company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution gives the federal courts jurisdiction to controversies \"between Citizens of different States\" (not residents), a distinction which is echoed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) granting district courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions where more than $75,000 is in controversy, between \"citizens of different states.\" Residences matter only if they assist in establishing domicile and citizenship. These are technical jurisdictional pleading requirements that are not widely known, but must be observed because regardless of their places of residence, the consequence of a party (which includes any member of a limited liability company) whose citizenship is the same as any adversary's is a lack of diversity jurisdiction, and the court simply has no power to hear the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The complaint relies upon this court's diversity jurisdiction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Jurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship among the parties. The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, exclusive of costs. This Court thus has original subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the complaint does not adequately allege the existence of diversity jurisdiction. Accordingly, plaintiffs are directed to file, on or before July 22, 2016 affidavits or an amended complaint adequately establishing the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) provides that district courts shall have jurisdiction over cases involving over $75,000 between \"citizens of different states.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff Avant and defendant W108 are limited liability companies.
