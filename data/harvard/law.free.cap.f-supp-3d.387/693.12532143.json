(\"CBRE\"), the [217] Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant Walgreen Co., the [234] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against Walgreen Co. filed by Plaintiff Tommy O'Bryant, and the [238] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against CBRE also filed by Plaintiff. The Motions are fully briefed. Having considered the submissions of the parties, the record, and relevant law, the Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment because, as a matter of law, they did not breach a duty of care owed to Plaintiff. Defendants' summary judgment motions will accordingly be granted, and Plaintiff's summary judgment motions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 27, 2015, Plaintiff Tommy O'Bryant was smoking a cigarette and talking with his wife's cousin on the sidewalk abutting the east side of the Biloxi, Mississippi Walgreens store. A Dodge Ram truck operated by Edward Kersh pulled into a nose-in parking space in front of where O'Bryant was standing. Kersh's foot slipped off the brake pedal and onto the accelerator, causing his truck to lurch over the curb, onto the sidewalk, and into O'Bryant. The truck struck O'Bryant with enough force to pin him against the brick wall of the building and damage the brick fa\u00e7ade. O'Bryant suffered significant injuries, ultimtely necessitating the amputation of his left leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   O'Bryant filed suit against Walgreen Co. and CBRE, alleging their negligence and gross negligence were responsible for O'Bryant's injury. His claims are brought pursuant to theories of premises liability under Mississippi law. Walgreen Co. owns the store and parking lot where the incident occurred. Walgreen Co. contracted with CBRE for repairs to, and maintenance of its store premises nationwide, including repairs following incidents in which vehicles had struck store buildings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Walgreen Co.'s Motion argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because it neither owed O'Bryant a relevant duty of\n   care\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor breached any such duty. CBRE's Motion argues that it never had the requisite control over or responsibility for the conditions of the Walgreens parking lot to be a proper defendant in a premises liability case. O'Bryant's Motions contend that the undisputed evidence entitles him to partial summary judgment on the issues of duty, breach, and causation such that the only remaining issue for a jury is damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.

The supreme court reversed the trial court's denial of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In Mississippi's case law specific to store patrons injured by errant vehicles, the justification for a no-duty rule is a lack of foreseeability, but the basis for an exception to this rule is evidence indicating the foreseeability of the injury. The resulting confusion demonstrates the pitfalls of constructing no-duty rules out of general foreseeability judgments. Thus, it is difficult to reconcile\n   <em>\n    Cheeks, Stanley, Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Buffalo Services\n   </em>\n   . Each decision appears to push state premises liability law in a different direction. Although all speak in terms of whether a duty exists,\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Stanley\n   </em>\n   seem to instead treat\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   's rule as a gloss on the duty of reasonable care owed to an invitee - they treat the rule as a scope of duty doctrine. This is likely because the stated rationale for the\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   rule was that it was unforeseeable a third-party-vehicle would negligently injure a patron on premises (rather than a clear statement of public policy, such as, \"store owners should not have to bear the cost of protecting patrons from vehicles crashing into buildings\"). Both opinions are deeply concerned with the facts of the case and how the premises owner might have breached a duty of reasonable care seemingly disclaimed in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Buffalo Services\n   </em>\n   more closely treat the so-called no-duty rule as a true no-duty rule (despite still expressing a foreseeability rationale for its application).\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   engaged with a pure question of law.\n   <em>\n    Buffalo Services\n   </em>\n   assessed the facts only so far as to determine that the\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   exception to the\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   rule did not apply. The most recent statement on the matter from the Mississippi Supreme Court is\n   <em>\n    Buffalo Services\n   </em>\n   , which therefore controls. It also provides the clearest framework of the\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   progeny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The law begins with the general rule: a store owner owes patrons no duty to protect against a third-party negligently driving a vehicle into the store. To find otherwise would be to elevate a store owner's duty to that of insuring patron safety. And Mississippi law is clear that store owners have no such duty. Additionally, because Mississippi cases have not limited application of this rule to only circumstances in which patrons\n   <em>\n    inside\n   </em>\n   a store are injured by a vehicle crashing into the store, the rule need not be restated in this way. There is one exception to this general rule. Although Mississippi does not, by default, impose a duty on store owners to protect patrons from negligently driven vehicles, store owners may assume such a duty by (1) creating a situation that makes injury to a patron on the premises by a vehicle reasonably foreseeable\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) undertaking extra measures to protect patrons entering or exiting the store.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus,\n   where a store owner creates a situation making injury to patrons by a vehicle reasonably foreseeable and undertakes measures to protect patrons entering and exiting the store, the duty of reasonable care and to warn of hidden dangerous conditions\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   encompass protecting patrons from negligently driven vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Defendants Are Not Liable as a Matter of Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The parties seem to agree that (1) the general rule, if applicable is dispositive of this case, and (2) the threshold issue is, therefore, whether there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Walgreen Co. assumed a duty to protect against a third-party negligently driving a vehicle into the store. It is undisputed that Walgreen Co. placed a sidewalk around the store with a six-inch curb to, at least in part, protect patrons from vehicles operating on the premises. The evidence Plaintiff submits in support of his contention that Walgreen Co. created a situation making it reasonably foreseeable that a patron would be injured can be boiled down to the following facts: (1) Walgreen Co. put a trashcan with an ashtray on the sidewalk along the east side of the building, where Plaintiff was standing; (2) Walgreen Co. also places Redbox video rental machines and Blue Rhino propane tank stations on its sidewalks; (3) Walgreen Co. placed nose-in parking along the sidewalks surrounding the store; (4) the store location in Biloxi experienced a prior incident on July 17, 2014 in which a customer pulling into a handicapped nose-in parking space on the north side of the building drove over the wheel stop, curb, and sidewalk, alliding with the store building; and (5)\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Plaintiff's injury, on November 13, 2015, a vehicle drove over the curb and allided with the building when the driver mistakenly stepped on the gas pedal instead of the brake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff also asks the Court to consider information concerning Walgreens storefront crash data nationwide from 2011 through 2018 and data on persons who have been injured or killed by vehicles on Walgreen Co. premises nationwide, but - as Plaintiff has repeatedly emphasized - this is not a negligent design case. Incidents occurring at other stores have no bearing on whether Walgreen Co. adequately maintains the premises at the store in Biloxi, Mississippi. They would only become relevant if Plaintiff were challenging the design of Walgreen Co.'s properties, irrespective of what specifically is done at the Biloxi location.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pippen v. Tronox, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529610\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/359/440/#p446\">\n    359 F. Supp. 3d 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446 (N.D. Miss. 2019) (\"The Plaintiffs in this case seek to impose liability against Tronox, not for a defect or danger present on the premises, but for a danger or defect in the independent subcontractor's own equipment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff also submits the opinion testimony of Rob Reiter, a self-designated expert in \"storefront safety.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reiter opines that areas where pedestrians are invited to linger - such as benches, smoking areas, and vending machines - are areas of increased risk if not protected from vehicles. Moreover, he states that correctly installed bollards at the end of nose-in parking spaces at the Biloxi store would have prevented Plaintiff's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, the evidence shows that Walgreen Co. has placed amenities - an ashtray, a Redbox machine, and a Blue Rhino station - at various points on the sidewalk, which separates nose-in parking from the building; that patrons are more likely to linger in front of these amenities; that once prior to the Plaintiff's injury a vehicle drove up over the curb and crashed into the building; and that Plaintiff's injury would not have happened if bollards protected the sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This evidence in insufficient to establish that Walgreen Co. created circumstances making vehicle-caused injury to a patron reasonably foreseeable. Regardless of whether amenities on the sidewalk make it more likely than otherwise that patrons will linger on the sidewalk, the suggestion to use these amenities is nothing like the use of the pay window in\n   <em>\n    Stanley\n   </em>\n   , where each patron was required to stand with their back to approaching cars to pay for fuel. More importantly, only once before Plaintiff's injury had a vehicle hopped the curb and hit the building, and nothing about the six-inch curb is alleged to be defective or incomplete. By contrast, the bollards in\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   extended up to the store entrance but did not actually protect the store entrance. The inadequacies contemplated by\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   seem to be more akin to a curb with inconsistent height, or a sloped edge so that a vehicle could easily ride up on to the sidewalk, or unprotected gaps for handicap access. Accordingly, Walgreen Co. assumed no duty to protect against negligently driven vehicles, and the general rule espoused in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even assuming arguendo that Walgreen Co. and CBRE (assertedly by contract) did assume a duty, the evidence in the record is still insufficient to create an issue of fact for the jury as to whether Defendants breached their duty. Plaintiff's position is that Defendants should have installed bollards at the end of the nose-in parking spaces because this would have prevented the injury Plaintiff sustained. But Plaintiff has pointed to no case law to support the notion that use of a six-inch curb might not be a reasonable measure to protect from errant vehicles. The case law this Court has found suggests the opposite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jefferson v. Qwik Korner Mkt., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4591621\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/28/990/\">\n    28 Cal.App.4th 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20171\">\n    34 Cal. Rptr. 2d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (1994) (collecting numerous cases finding no liability in curb-jumping cases). And a curb is not a hidden condition, let alone a dangerous one. While a person might reasonably feel highly protected while in the proximity of bollards (as in\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   ), it would be unreasonable for a person to assume a similar degree of protection when standing on a curb. A curb provides no false illusion of safety. It is patently obvious that a vehicle\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   drive over it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mississippi law does not require a premises owner to insure an invitee's safety. Under Mississippi law the legal duty owed to store patrons is to keep the premises reasonably safe and, when not reasonably safe, to warn only where there is hidden danger or peril that is not in plain and open view. In the opinion of the Court, Plaintiff's evidence is, as a matter of law, insufficient to demonstrate that Defendants breached this duty or assumed a duty to erect protective bollards.
