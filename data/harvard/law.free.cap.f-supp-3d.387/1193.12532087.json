Dkt. #32 &amp; #34. Plaintiffs are a group consisting of gun dealers (\"Dealers\"), aspiring gun owners under the age of 21 (\"Young Adults\"), and gun rights advocacy organizations. They seek a declaration that several of I-1639's amendments to Washington's gun control laws are unconstitutional and ask the Court to enjoin enforcement. Specifically, Plaintiffs challenge the portions of the initiative that prohibit the sale of pistols and semiautomatic assault rifles to individuals under the age of 21 and prohibit the sale of semiautomatic assault rifles to residents of another state. They also allege a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , arguing that the challenged portions of I-1639 infringe their Second Amendment rights and violate the Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Atkins is the Sheriff of Clark County and Meidl is the Chief of Police of Spokane. They argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to assert a claim against them because neither officer has enforced I-1639 against Plaintiffs or threatened to do so. Atkins and Meidl also contend that they are not proper defendants in this action because any potential injuries Plaintiffs suffered are the result of I-1639 itself, not its enforcement. Finally, Atkins and Meidl assert that Plaintiffs' 1983 claim fails because Clark County and Spokane's enforcement of I-1639 is non-discretionary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the following reasons, Atkins and Meidl's Motions to Dismiss are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action in February of 2019. Their lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of sections 12 and 13 of I-1639, which was approved by voters in 2018. Section 12 amends RCW 9.41.124, which formerly permitted out-of-state individuals to purchase any weapon available to Washington residents. The amendment created by I-1639 creates an exception for \"firearms defined as semiautomatic assault rifles.\" RCW 9.41.124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 13 amends RCW 9.41.240 to include the following: \"A person under twenty-one years of age may not purchase a pistol or semiautomatic assault rifle, and except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person may sell or transfer a semiautomatic assault rifle to a person under twenty-one years of age.\" Section 13 also changes the rules around possession of semiautomatic assault rifles for young adults, but Plaintiffs do not appear to challenge those provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While it is not directly challenged in this lawsuit, section 3 of I-1639 amends the procedures for background checks under RCW 9.41.090. Background checks are now required for all sales of semiautomatic assault rifles as well as pistols. RCW 9.41.090(6)(a). Dealers are required to collect an application from the purchaser containing certain information and send it to the chief of police of the municipality or the sheriff of the county, or the state if it opts to set up its own background check system. RCW 9.41.090(3)(b), (6)(c). The relevant authority has the power to deny the application if the applicant is ineligible to purchase the firearm under any state or federal law. RCW 9.41.090(6)(c). This, too, is a change from the previous law, which only allowed the authority to deny the application under state law if the purchaser was ineligible for reasons related to criminal history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 9.41.040.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Two of the Plaintiffs, Daniel Mitchell and Robin Ball, are licensed firearm dealers from Vancouver and Spokane, respectively.

I-1639's amendments to RCW 9.41.090 provide that a dealer may not deliver a pistol or semiautomatic assault rifle until they have obtained an application from the purchaser, delivered it to the local chief of police or sheriff, and waited the requisite time period without receiving a response. RCW 9.41.090(6)(a)-(c). If the chief of police or sheriff find that the purchaser is ineligible to buy a firearm, including under RCW 9.41.240's age requirements and RCW 9.41.124's residence requirements, they must deny the application. RCW 9.41.090(6)(c). Washington law therefore charges local sheriff and police departments with a \"direct duty\" to enforce I-1639's new firearm purchase restrictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Urquhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518033\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1094/#p1103\">\n    899 F.3d at 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, RCW 9.41.810 makes it a misdemeanor to violate any part of RCW 9.41. As the heads of local law enforcement in the jurisdictions where Plaintiffs live, \"the buck stops with\" Atkins and Meidl when it comes to enforcing the new restrictions created by I-1639.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3746895\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/1128/#p1132\">\n    674 F.3d at 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Atkins and Meidl argue that they are not proper defendants because, contrary to Plaintiffs' allegations, they do not possess the authority to revoke dealers' licenses. Instead, under RCW 9.41.137, the department of licensing \"shall have the authority, after notice and hearing, to revoke the license of any licensed dealer found to be in violation of this chapter.\" But regardless of whether Atkins and Meidl lack final authority to revoke a license, their on-the-ground enforcement of Washington's gun laws means they carry out \"vital steps\" in the license revocation process.
