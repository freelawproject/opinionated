In this action, plaintiff attempts to recover from defendants money that one of plaintiff's employees, Daphney Harstad (\"Harstad\"), fraudulently diverted and used to pay off personal debts she owed on credit cards issued by defendants. In relevant part, the complaint alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Plaintiff, Borsheim Builders Supply, Inc., is a North Dakota Corporation, with its principal place of business located in Williston, North Dakota.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Upon information and belief, Defendant, Chase Cardholder Services, Inc. (hereinafter \"Chase\"), is a corporation organized in the state of Delaware, with its principal place of business located in Wilmington, Delaware.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. Upon information and belief, Defendant, Merrick Bank Corporation (hereinafter \"Merrick\"), is a corporation organized in the state of Utah, with its principal place of business located in Jordan, Utah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   4. Upon information and belief, Defendant, HSBC Card Services, Inc. (hereinafter \"HSBC\"), is a corporation organized in the state of Delaware, with its principal place of business located in Wilmington, Delaware.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   5. Plaintiff Borsheim is a large crane company operating in North Dakota.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   6. Borsheim employed an office manager, Georgene Baustad, who was going to retire and planned to train a successor. Ms. Baustad hired Daphney Harstad (hereinafter \"Harstad\") in 1997, and she was trained to replace Ms. Baustad over the course of two years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   7. Between 1997 and 2010, Borsheim grew substantially and maintained over 70 employees by 2010. Due to the length of time Ms. Harstad was employed with the company and the growing demands of her position, she was granted authority to sign checks on behalf of the company like many accountants are.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   8. On or around March of 2014, Borsheim discovered, through various discrepancies and questionable practices, that Harstad had been embezzling and otherwise misappropriating Borsheim funds for personal use, including paying her personal credit cards bills using Borsheim checks, and referring to her personal accounts on the subject line of said checks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   9. This specific practice of using checks to pay Harstad's credit card debts was done for several years and were sent to each of the Defendants systematically over long periods of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   10. Defendants, each of them, accepted these checks and wired said funds into their accounts so as to satisfy the personal debts of Ms. Harstad that she had accrued through the use of her credit cards and/or other financial services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   11. Upon information and belief, not one of the Defendants ever questioned or investigated the payment method or that the checks were coming from Borsheim Crane rather than Harstad herself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   12. The practice of sending the checks as payment to the various Defendants\n   continued for years with no inquiry or investigation into her practices and failed to implement any safeguards that would prevent such fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   13. In or around July of 2014, the embezzlement and other fraudulent activities were investigated by authorities, including the FBI, and Ms. Harstad was subsequently prosecuted on federal charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   14. Since the embezzlement and fraudulent payments were discovered, no payments have been returned by any of the named Defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   15.

In seeking to recover the embezzled money, plaintiff asserts claims for conversion, negligence, aiding and abetting fraud, and money had and received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the motions to dismiss now before the court, defendants argue that plaintiff's claims must be dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure state a claim upon which relief can be granted. More particularly, defendants argue that the claims are not legally cognizable for various reasons. They also argue the claims are time-barred. Finally, defendants contend that the aiding and abetting fraud claim must be dismissed because of the failure to plead it with the particularity required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

R. Civ. 9. According to the defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [a]bsent from the claim are any particular references to (1) the bank employees or representatives who had knowledge of and provided substantial assistance to Harstad in carrying out her fraudulent scheme; (2) the specific checks used to perpetuate the fraudulent scheme; (3) when the alleged fraudulent scheme was agreed upon; (4) how the fraudulent scheme was carried out. Simply put, the claim fails to identify specifically the \"who, what, where, when, and how\" of the alleged fraud and should be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Doc. No. 8, p. 13). Defendants argue that because of these deficiencies plaintiff's fraud claim should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Governing law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) requires dismissal of an action if there has been a failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. To state a cognizable claim, the complaint need only meet the requirement of Rule 8(a)(2) that it contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Erickson v.

Plaintiff has satisfied its pleading requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, plaintiff has pled more than labels and conclusions. Plaintiff outlined in detail Harstad's fraudulent conduct. And, with respect to the defendants, plaintiff alleged that the checks they took were in plaintiff's name as the drawer and not\n   Harstad's, that the checks were presented to the defendants for satisfaction of Harstad's personal credit card debts, and that defendants applied the proceeds from the checks for that purpose. Finally, plaintiffs pled the total amounts of the checks involved for each of the defendants (the total amounts were sizeable) and the time period during which the fraud allegedly took place. This is sufficient to meet the requirement of Rule 9(b) that the \"circumstances\" of the fraud be pled with particularity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As for defendants' purported knowledge, Rule 9(b) permits that it can be pled generally. And, in this case, plaintiff went beyond that by pleading facts, which if true,\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be circumstantial evidence that defendants had the requisite knowledge of Harstad's defalcations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, if defendants' argument is that plaintiff has not pled enough to make out a claim for aiding and abetting fraud that satisfies the \"plausibility\" requirement of\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , that too is rejected. While there are a number of reasons why defendants may not have been aware of the underlying fraud, it is not out of the realm of possibility that defendants may have had actual knowledge of the fraud. For example, defendants may have detected the fraud as apart of a fraud detection program, but decided to take the checks anyway in order to avoid losses resulting from their having already paid the merchants or other persons that Harstad presented her credit cards to. While this appears to be on the lower end of probability, and while the court is skeptical that plaintiff will be able to prove defendants possessed the requisite knowledge for plaintiff to prevail on a claim of aiding and abetting fraud, this skepticism alone does not mean plaintiff has failed to satisfy the \"plausibility\" requirement of\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apex IT v.

The obvious reason for the shorter three-year period of limitations is the desire to provide greater certainty and finality when dealing with instruments that are negotiable. This is further reflected in Article 4 of the UCC which governs bank deposits and collections and includes provisions that govern the liability of banks in the handling and collection of negotiable instruments. Article 4 has a corresponding three-year statute of limitations for claims arising under that chapter. N.D.C.C. \u00a7 41-04-11 (4-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For reasons that will be discussed later, if the three-year limitations period in subsection (7) of \u00a7 41-03-18 (3-118) applies to one or more of plaintiff's claims, then the complaint must be dismissed all or in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendants' argument that the 1990 revisions to UCC Article 3 have displaced all common law remedies so there is no possibility of any longer statute of limitations applying\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   One of defendants' arguments is that the 1990 revisions to UCC Article have completely displaced the common law remedies being asserted in this case for conversion, money had and received, negligence, and fraud. Hence, according to defendants, the only claims that plaintiff might have arise under the UCC and are\n   governed by the three-year limitations period of \u00a7 41-03-18(7) (3-118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff disagrees. Plaintiff argues that all of the claims it has pled are standalone common law claims that have not been displaced by the UCC, and that the six-year statute of limitations set forth in N.D.C.C. \u00a7 28-01-16 applies to each of the claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of its argument that all of its claims are freestanding common law claims that have not been displaced by the UCC, plaintiff relies in substantial part on N.D.C.C. \u00a7 41-01-03 (1-103), which reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00a7 41-01-03.

Section 41-01-03(2) (1-103) specifically provides that principles of law and equity can supplement the provisions of the UCC codified in Title 41. Further, Article 3 provides for few express causes of action and mainly addresses the scope of and limitations upon liability, standards of care, and defenses. Finally, in cases discussed in the next section, the North Dakota Supreme Court has exhibited a willingness to look to common law principles to give rise to liability beyond what is expressly provided for in Article 3. Consequently, while the number of instances in which common law principles may be looked to as creating liability beyond what is expressly provided for under Article 3 may be fewer with the 1990 revisions, the North Dakota Supreme Court likely would not conclude that the only liability of parties with respect to negotiable instruments is that expressly provided for in Article 3.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Pratt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204516822\">\n    2017 WL 4516822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (rejecting argument that a claim for unjust enrichment in a similar case against a credit card company was displaced by Article 3 due to the comprehensiveness of its provisions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   But, the application of common law principles to create liability beyond what might be expressly provided for in Article 3 does not mean the resulting claim would be completely freestanding and devoid of application of Article 3's provisions that may shape its scope or provide, applicable defenses. As discussed next, the North Dakota Supreme Court would likely conclude that Article 3's three-year limitations period would apply to all of plaintiff's claims even if common law principles are relied on to supplement Article 3's provision and create liability beyond what Article 3 may expressly provide for.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

At issue in\n   <em>\n    Great American\n   </em>\n   was a bank's acceptance of a check issued by an insurer that was endorsed by only one of two named payees. The insurer obtained an assignment of rights from the non-endorsing co-payee and sued the bank for conversion. The state district court entered judgment against the bank following a bench trial. The bank appealed, asserting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the state statute codifying a former version of UCC \u00a7 3-419 had displaced the common law for conversion in North Dakota and that its acceptance of the check without the endorsement of the co-payee did not constitute conversion under the UCC. The North Dakota Supreme Court disagreed, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [The insurer] counters that a collecting bank that pays a draft without the endorsement of a joint payee is liable to that joint payee for conversion under common law and also under the U.C.C. because the general principles of common law supplement the U.C.C.

Further, there was no issue with respect to statute of limitations in\n   <em>\n    Great American\n   </em>\n   nor could there have been since this case predated the 1990 revisions to Article 3 that added a statute of limitations. Finally, given what the court stated about looking to common law to supplement the existing provisions of Article 3 so that the missing endorsement scenario (which was not covered by the UCC at the time) would not be treated differently from a forged endorsement (which was covered by Article 3) the court likely would not have applied different statute of limitations to the two claims had the shorter and more specific three-year limitations period been in effect. Rather, the court likely would have concluded that, even though common law was looked to supplement the UCC's provisions and create liability, the claim would still be one arising under Article 3 and subject to any other provisions that might be applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii.

Western State Bank\n   </em>\n   , 2008, ND 104, \u00b6\u00b6 46-51,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8244488\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/750/412/\">\n    750 N.W.2d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Alerus\n   </em>\n   , the claims relevant to this case involved the attempt on the part of a trust to recover money it had lost as result of embezzlement on the part of one its trustees. In that case, the trustee committing the defalcations wrote checks drawn on the trust's account at Alerus Financial, made the checks payable to defendant Western State Bank, and then tendered the checks to Western State Bank in satisfaction of personal debts owed by the trustee to that bank. The trustee had the authority to sign trust checks generally, but arguably not the authority to write checks on the trust's account to satisfy his personal debts to Western State Bank. When the trustee's defalcations were uncovered, the other trustees sued Western State Bank as well as another defendant on claims not relevant here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 2-13\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The principal claims of the trust against Western State Bank were for conversion, negligence, and breach of a fiduciary duty, which the Trust contended were claims arising both under common law and the UCC. The trial court had dismissed the conversion claim based upon its conclusion that the trustee had the authority to issue the checks and Western State Bank could rely upon that. As for the negligence and breach of fiduciary claims, the trial court concluded Western State Bank owed no duty to the trust since it did not have banking relationship with it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 35-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The North Dakota Supreme Court on appeal held that the trial court had erred in dismissing all of these claims based upon the reasons it had articulated. With\n   respect to the conversion claim, the court concluded there were material issues of disputed fact with respect to whether the trustee had actual authority to sign the checks in question (it appeared he did not) and whether Western State Bank had actual notice of the lack of authority. And, in discussing why these questions were relevant, the court referenced N.D.C.C. \u00a7 41-01-09(2)(oo) (1-201) defining unauthorized signatures and \u00a7 41-03-40(s) (3-403) stating that, if more than one person's signature is required to constitute an authorized signature of an organization, the signature is unauthorized if one of the required signatures is missing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37-45. With respect to the negligence and breach of fiduciary claims, the court concluded that Alerus's duty was defined by \u00a7 41-03-33 (3-307) and there were material issues of disputed fact with respect to whether that duty was breached given the existence of circumstances that may have put Alerus on notice of the breach of fiduciary duty by the person signing the checks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46-50. The court then remanded the case to the district court to reconsider the conversion, negligence, and breach of fiduciary claims, but without deciding at the end of the day whether the trust actually had good claims. The court stated that it wanted the trial court in the first instance to address whether Western State Bank had defenses under the UCC or by application of common law principles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Alerus\n   </em>\n   leaves as many questions unanswered as it decided. For example, did the Trust actually have a viable conversion claim? Notably, the court did not address the consequences, if any, of \u00a7 41-03-57 (3-420), which specifically addresses claims for conversion. Also, it did not address the common law doctrine that there is no action for conversion of cash unless it can be traced to specific account where it may remain. This doctrine is addressed in more detail later. With respect to the breach of fiduciary claim, the court appears to suggest that it arises out of \u00a7 41-03-33 (3-307), but, if so, it would have to be an implied cause of action since that section itself does not appear to specifically create liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White, Summers, &amp; Hillman\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19.34. Also, how does such a claim differ, if at all, from the negligence claim that the court suggested might also be available with \u00a7 41-03-33 (3-307) defining the applicable duty? Finally, the court explicitly left open the question of defenses, which might include whether the trust would be foreclosed from collecting because of its own conduct in apparently not inspecting its statements and detecting the fraud or have its fault compared with the defendants. Some of these points will be returned to later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   However, relevant to the point under discussion now, there is nothing in\n   <em>\n    Alerus\n   </em>\n   which suggests that the North Dakota Supreme Court would conclude that the claims it left open for further development by the trial court would be freestanding common law claims that would not be subject to Article 3 provisions that may limit the scope of the claims and provide defenses. In fact, the contrary appears to be true given that the court referenced provisions of Article 3 to frame or otherwise give content to the potential claims for conversion, negligence, and breach of a fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     iii.

While the North Dakota Supreme Court upheld the claim of negligence, it did so after applying Article 3's provisions with respect to what duty was owed by the defendant bank (which unlike the defendants in this case had a banking relationship with the grain elevator) and only after concluding that the Article 3's defense of holder in due course was not available.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10690871\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/259/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10690871\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/259/667/\">\n    at 669-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In that case, the Eighth Circuit summarized what was at issue and the holding of the district court as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   According to the complaint, Ronald Roberts and Kenneth Powell fraudulently induced the plaintiffs to write checks or to transfer funds by cashier's check to them, or to organizations controlled by them, in amounts that totaled more than $ 2.5 million. The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants, Allegiant and Royal, acted negligently in depositing these checks because the checks lacked proper endorsements or were made payable to entities other than the ones into whose accounts they were deposited. The district court concluded that the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) preempted any common-law claims for negligence against depositary banks, and that the UCC itself provided no cause of action for the maker of a check or the purchaser of a cashier's check against a depositary bank that improperly deposits the check.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9437381\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/288/339/#p341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9437381\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/288/339/#p341\">\n    at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded the case for further consideration, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   The UCC provides that \"principles of law and equity ... shall supplement its provisions\" unless \"displaced by [its] particular provisions.\" Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 400.1-103. We have discovered no \"particular provision\" of the UCC that would \"displace\" a common-law claim of negligence, so we conclude that the Missouri Supreme Court would hold that a drawer of a check could have a common-law cause of action against a depositary bank for negligently handling the drawer's check.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   We come to this conclusion with some very considerable reluctance because of the holding in\n   <em>\n    City of Wellston\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

But it is important to our reasoning that the UCC itself quite specifically reserves common-law claims unless they are particularly displaced by one of its provisions. The code, in other words, does not purport to occupy the field so completely as to preempt altogether any other law dealing with bank collections. In short, it is not the only place to look to determine whether an action lies in the present circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   One other point bears mentioning.

First, in\n   <em>\n    Cassello\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit applied what it believed to be Missouri law, albeit reluctantly, because it relied upon a Missouri Supreme Court case that was not directly on point. Here, the court must predict how the North Dakota Supreme Court would decide the issues now before the court. Second, while the Eighth Circuit framed the issue as to whether the potential claim may be a claim arising under common law and not displaced by the UCC, the court did not reach the issue of whether the common law claim would be a completely standalone claim or whether it might be subject to defenses that might be available under Missouri's version of Article 3. In fact, the court specifically stated it was not even deciding whether there was a claim for negligence based on the facts pled because the parties had not briefed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

That being said, the North Dakota Supreme Court is likely to conclude that, when a negotiable instrument is central to a claim against a defendant, the claim arises out of Article 3 and is subject to Article 3's three-year period of limitations even when common law principles are used to create liability that is in addition to what Article 3 expressly provides. Or, to put it somewhat differently, Article 3's three-year limitations period has displaced statutes that otherwise might apply to claims applying the common law principles used to supplement Article 3's provisions.

Subsection (b) states the basic relationship of the Uniform Commercial Code to supplemental bodies of law. The Uniform Commercial Code was drafted against the backdrop of existing bodies of law, including the common law and equity, and relies on those bodies of law to supplement its provisions in many important ways. At the same time, the Uniform Commercial Code is the primary\n   source of commercial law rules in areas that it governs, and its rules represent choices made by its drafters and the enacting legislatures about the appropriate policies to be furthered in the transactions it covers. Therefore, while principles of common law and equity may\n   <em>\n    supplement\n   </em>\n   provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, they may not be used to supplant its provisions, or the purposes and policies those provisions reflect, unless a specific provision of the Uniform Commercial Code provides otherwise. In the absence of such a provision, the Uniform Commercial Code preempts principles of common law and equity that are inconsistent with either its provisions or its purposes and policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   The language of subsection (b) is intended to reflect both the concept of supplementation and the concept of preemption. Some courts, however, had difficulty in applying the identical language of former Section 1-103 to determine when other law appropriately may be applied to supplement the Uniform Commercial Code, and when that law has been displaced by the Code. Some decisions applied other law in situations in which that application, while not inconsistent with the text of any particular provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, clearly was inconsistent with the underlying purposes and policies reflected in the relevant provisions of the Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sheerbonnet, Ltd. v.

In part, this difficulty arose from Comment 1 to former Section 1-103, which stated that \"this section indicates the continued applicability to commercial contracts of all supplemental bodies of law except insofar as they are explicitly displaced by this Act.\" The \"explicitly displaced\" language of that Comment did not accurately reflect the proper scope of Uniform Commercial Code preemption, which extends to displacement of other law that is inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as with its text.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Official Comments to UCC \u00a7 1-103 (italics in original).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   \u2022 The breadth of the text of \u00a7 41-03-18(7) (3-118), which, for purposes of convenience, is set forth again as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   7.

More particularly, a shorter and more uniform statute of limitations advances the goals of Articles 3 and 4 of providing greater certainty and finality with respect to the commercial transactions involving negotiable instruments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    PSI Resources, LLC v.

Ct. App. 2006). Also, the shorter statute of limitations is consistent with the general notion reflected in other sections of Articles 3 and 4 that persons employing, taking, or otherwise dealing with instruments that are\n   <em>\n    negotiable\n   </em>\n   need to be vigilant in protecting their rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   \u2022 As already discussed, the cases in which the North Dakota Supreme Court has considered common law principles in adjudicating claims involving negotiable instruments, it has not resolved or suggested it would resolve the cases based upon common law principles independent of the provisions of Article 3. Rather, it has looked to Article 3's provisions when they limit the rights and obligations of the parties and otherwise provide defenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In concluding that the North Dakota Supreme Court would hold that the UCC's three-year limitations period would apply to claims in which a negotiable instrument plays a central role even if common law principles are looked to provide liability in supplementation of Article 3's provisions, the undersigned acknowledges it might be a closer question with respect to plaintiff's claim of aiding and abetting fraud. With respect to that claim, plaintiff alleges that defendants aided and abetted Harstad's fraud, contending that they knew or should have known of her fraudulent conduct when they took the checks at issue, submitted them for collection to plaintiff's bank, and then used the proceeds to reduce her credit card debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As an initial matter, the court does not believe plaintiff has a separate claim for fraud based on the \"should have known\" contention. Rather, any claim that defendants \"should have known\" would be for negligence or some other non-fraud claim. Hence, the court confines its consideration here to plaintiff's allegations that defendants had actual knowledge that Harstad lacked the authority to write the checks they took and that the checks were taken for an improper purpose. Even in this instance, the court believes the North Dakota Supreme Court would conclude that the three-year limitations period would apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   First, even though \u00a7 41-03-18(7) (3-118) does not specifically reference fraud, the most commonsense reading of the section (particularly in context of Article 3's other provisions which deal with instances of\n   fraud,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , fraudulent endorsements) is that it has displaced all other statutes of limitations for claims in which negotiable instruments plays a central part. Second, proving actual knowledge of an underlying fraud is often difficult and, in some instances, jurors may be allowed to find the existence of the requisite knowledge based upon circumstantial evidence. And, in that instance, the provisions of Article 3 may very well impact what circumstantial evidence is relevant. For example, plaintiffs may argue that the jury should be entitled to infer actual knowledge based upon the nature of the checks and the circumstances under which defendants took them. However, if the defendants are able to demonstrate they did not actually inspect the checks and did not breach a standard of care because they used automatic processing, then the nature of the checks, and the circumstances under which they were taken, would be irrelevant. Third, while there is a certain logic to exposing a bank that has actually aided and abetted fraud to the same period of limitations as the perpetrator (assuming it is longer), initially a claim is nothing more than an allegation and not all plaintiffs who claim that a bank had actual knowledge will be successful in actually proving that to be the case. And here, given what Articles 3 and 4 generally attempt to accomplish, the interests of providing greater certainty and finality for those who take and otherwise deal with negotiable instruments in good faith may trump. Or, to put another way, the negotiable instrument plays a more central role in the claims against defendants than it would against Harstad.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DLK Co. of Ohio v. Meece\n   </em>\n   , No. CA2012-07-060,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20940148\">\n    2013 WL 940148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Ohio Ct.

Finally, while based upon reasons somewhat different, the Seventh Circuit concluded in\n   <em>\n    Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. of America, Inc. v. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897010\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/499/#p505\">\n    480 F.3d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 505 (7th Cir. 2007) that the claim for fraud in that case was subject to UCC's three-year period of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    4. This action is untimely based upon the three-year statute of limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   It is clear from the face of the complaint that the checks alleged to have been part of the fraudulent scheme were issued and cashed prior to plaintiff becoming aware of the fraud. It is also clear from plaintiff's allegations that more than three years elapsed from when plaintiff acknowledges it became aware that Harstad was paying off her credit card debts by writing checks on plaintiff's account to the date of the filing of this action. That being the case, it makes no difference here whether the cause of action accrued when the acts giving rise to the potential claims were committed or later when plaintiff discovered Harstad's defalcations. Plaintiff's claims are clearly time-barred given the court's conclusion that the three-year limitations period applies to all of plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant's other arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The court has rejected defendant's argument that 1990 revisions to Articles 3 and 4 have displaced all liability arising out of the application of common law principles in supplementation of Article 3's provisions. That, however, does not dispose of defendant's arguments that one or more of the specific claims in this case have been displaced by the UCC. The court will address these arguments briefly in the event it is\n   concluding upon appeal that the court erroneously concluded that the three-year limitations period applies to all claims in which a negotiable instrument plays a central part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

A representative, other than a depositary bank, that has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   (italics added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Defendants argue that the intent of \u00a7 41-03-57 (3-420), which is part of the 1990 revisions to Article 3 enacted in North Dakota in 1991, was to occupy the field such that any liability for conversion for a claim involving a negotiable instrument would only be as provided for under this section. And, that being the case according to defendants, this forecloses any argument for a claim for conversion based solely upon common law principles and for which a longer statute of limitations would apply. The other consequence of the enactment of \u00a7 41-03-57 (3-420) according to the defendants is that the language set forth above in italics forecloses any claim for conversion-even one arising under Article 3. This is because plaintiff is an \"issuer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 41-03-03(1)(c) (3-103) &amp; 41-03-05(3) (\u00a7 3-105).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Plaintiff disagrees with these arguments. Plaintiff contends that \u00a7 41-03-57 (3-420) applies by its terms only to conversion of instruments and not conversion of proceeds from instruments, which plaintiff contends is its claim here and one arising under common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In other jurisdictions, some courts have agreed that \u00a7 41-03-57 (3-420) governs all claims for conversion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Grand Rapids Auto Sales, Inc. v.

Further, so long as plaintiff would have adequate tort remedies if the conditions for obtaining that relief can be satisfied, that might foreclose the equitable remedy of restitution.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Raaum Estates by and though Raaum v.

Hence, the claim is time-barred for this reason even if the court is incorrect in its more general conclusion that Article 3's three-year limitations period applies to all claims in which a negotiable instrument plays a central role even if the liability is created by the supplementation of common law principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSIONS AND ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   For the reasons articulated above, the court concludes that plaintiff's claims are barred by the three-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 41-03-18(7) (3-118). For this reason, defendants' motions to dismiss (Doc Nos. 7 &amp; 14) are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and plaintiff's complaint is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    Plaintiff also named Chase Cardholder Services, Inc. as a defendant.

If it turned out that the one or both of the defendants actually inspected the checks in question (possibly due to internal fraud protocols being triggered) and if it was determined there was negligence in failing to take action, the North Dakota Supreme Court might conclude it would be appropriate to apply comparative negligence principles comparable to those set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 41-03-42 (3-405) and 41-03-43 (3-406), which, by their terms, are confined to negligence in cases involving a forged signature or alteration of an instrument and not an unauthorized signature.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     White, Summers, &amp; Hillman\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 19.25.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    In North Dakota, it may not make a significant difference whether the claim is one for conversion as opposed to negligence so long as the foregoing provisions of the UCC would apply and defendants' receipt of the payments is not \"wrongful\" if done without the appropriate knowledge the signatures were unauthorized. This is because, if law outside of the UCC is looked to supplement its provisions, North Dakota's comparative fault law provides for comparing of fault for all acts or omissions (both intentional or simply negligent) that give rise to tort liability.
