The parties have briefed the issues, and the Court has determined to decide the matter without oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Dynamic Energy Solutions, LLC (\"Dynamic\"), helps to \"design, finance, build and maintain solar energy projects for commercial, institutional, and utility clients.\" Complaint (\"Complt.\"), dkt. # 1, at \u00b6 2. Dynamic constructs photovoltaic power stations (\"solar farms\") that convert sunlight into electricity \"on a large scale.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dynamic makes money by selling the electricity generated back to the power grid, selling or leasing the solar farm to another party, and by serving as a contractor for solar developments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Operating on this principle, in June 2016 Dynamic executed a Site Lease Option with Defendant Scott Pinney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. That Option provided Dynamic an exclusive option to lease a 15-acre parcel of land from Pinney in Dryden, New York.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That parcel was part of 157-acre property that Pinney owned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dynamic needed the rights to develop property to obtain licenses, permits, and funding necessary to build the solar farm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Part of the funding was to come from a state grant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dynamic also planned to engage in due diligence on the property to determine the feasibility of the project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Pinney leased the \"exact same\" property to Dynamic's Competitor, Defendant Sun8 within a few months of signing the Lease Option with Dynamic. Sun8 is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Defendant Distributed Sun, LLC (\"Distributed Sun\"), one of Dynamic's competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 19. Plaintiff alleges that Distributed Sun develops solar energy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Pinney leased the entire\n   157-acre parcel to Sun8, which \"necessarily subsum[ed]\" the property Dynamic hoped to develop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Pinney did not inform Dynamic of the competing lease until Dynamic attempted to exercise its option on the smaller tract of land.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By the time Dynamic sought to exercise its option, Dynamic had already spent a considerable sum of money applying for approvals necessary for the project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Dynamic had also been awarded a $1.05 million grant from NYSERDA, New York's renewable energy agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That grant applied only to the property on which Sun8 negotiated a lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Fearful about economic loss, Dynamic contacted Pinney, Sun 8, and Distributed Sun in an attempted to find a solution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. The Defendants refused Dynamic's offer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pinney recorded Sun8's lease for Sun8's benefit and issued Sun8 an \"estoppel certificate,\" which stated that the Sun8 lease had priority on the land.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dynamic claims that Defendants' conduct cost Dynamic millions, \"including wasted cost outlays, loss of the state grant, loss of the value of the development, and wasted time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that Distributed Sun and Sun8 applied for \"permits, zoning changes, licenses and/or other permission from the Town of Dryden\" as part of the Defendants' proposed solar farm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. Shortly after Defendants sent in the applications, but before Defendants rejected Sun8 and Pinney's attempts to solve the lease problem, Dynamic's general counsel sent the Town of Dryden a letter requesting that the Town take no action on the Defendants' pending applications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Counsel sought time to resolve the leasing dispute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Dynamic sent these letters, Defendants Distributed Sun and Sun8 filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of Tompkins County, New York.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. The action,\n   <em>\n    Sun8 PDC LLC v. Scott Pinney and Dynamic Energy Solutions, LLC\n   </em>\n   , brought a number of claims, including one for tortious interference with a contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In this respect, Distributed Sun and Sun8 pointed to Dynamic's letter to the Town of Dryden, as well as \"other unspecified 'contact[ ] with [T]own officials, members of the Dryden Planning Board and/or Town Board, and [T]own residents[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the tortious interference claim in this case \"could not possibly have had a substantial basis in fact and law\" and was not \"supported by a substantial argument for extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Plaintiff contends that the tortious-interference claim was \"frivolous,\" as evidenced by Sun8's voluntary dismissal of that count after the parties briefed a dismissal motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff further contends that Sun8 filed the motion \"to harass, intimidate, punish, or otherwise inhibit Dynamic's free exercise of its speech, petition, or association rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Distributed Sun's own conduct, Plaintiff claims, supports this interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiff, \"Distributed Sun's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") called Dynamic's CEO,\" threatening \"to f@$% [Dynamic] up.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Plaintiff alleges that \"Distributed Sun directed the filing of the Sun8 lawsuit the next day.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff filed the instant Complaint on July 27, 2018. The Complaint contains two counts. Count One seeks damages for breach of contract against Pinney. Count Two seeks damages against Sun8 and Direct Sun for filing a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (a \"SLAPP\" suit) in violation of New York Civil Rights Law \u00a7\u00a7 70-a and 76-a. Direct Sun and Sun8 filed a motion to dismiss the action against those Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. # 20. The relevant parties briefed those issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pinney filed an Answer and Counterclaim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. # 21. Pinney's Counterclaim centers on the conduct of Ron Szymanski. Pinney alleges that Dynamic had a contractual relationship with Szymanski beginning on or about November 21, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Pinney claims that Szymanski operated as the agent and alter ego of Dynamic at all relevant times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. According to Pinney, Szymanski's \"duty to Dynamic was to locate real property that might be used for solar projects by solar energy developers other than Dynamic.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. Szymanski allegedly approached Pinney in late 2015 or early 2016 to inquire about his interest in leasing land for solar energy development; he did not reveal to Pinney that he was serving as Dynamic's agent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. Instead, Pinney alleges, Szymanski promised that he would \"work for Pinney to obtain the best price for the Dryden property.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Pinney further alleges that Szymanski came to him in June 2016 with two documents to sign.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. Based on Szymanski's representations, Pinney believed that the documents would permit Dynamic and Distributed Sun to both survey and inspect the property for its suitability for solar development.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. \"Based on Szymanski's representations,\" Pinney alleges, he reasonably believed that neither document bound him to lease his property to either company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pinney claims that Dynamic and Szymanski \"intended to place a cloud on the title\" to Pinney's property \"as a means of extorting payments from Pinney or Distributed Sun[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. From June 2016 to February 2017, Pinney had no contact with Dynamic, even though he and his wife had both attempted to reach out to Dynamic to gauge whether the company was still interested in the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Pinney contends that Dynamic did not visit, survey, or inspect the property during that period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. By contrast, Distributed Sun made frequent contact with Pinney about the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Representatives visited the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dynamic reappeared only after Pinney signed a lease with Sun8, claiming a right to Pinney's land.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Dynamic rejected Pinney's offer of alternative property in Dryden for solar farm development.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Pinney's one-count counterclaim alleges fraud against Dynamic because of promises Szymanic made about the document that Pinney signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dynamic filed a motion to dismiss this counterclaim. The relevant parties briefed that issue as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants Sun8 and Distributed Sun have filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Plaintiff seeks dismissal of Pinney's counterclaim on the same basis. Both sides argue that the relevant party has not stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. In addressing such motions, the Court must accept \"all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw[ ] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Holmes v.

Supreme Ct., 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants insist that the lawsuit in question related to a legitimate land dispute between the two parties; the lawsuit sought to clarify the parties' rights as they related to a piece of land both sides sought to develop. As a suit between two sophisticated business entities, Sun8's action did not represent the sort of attempt to silence a public-interest opponent's opposition to a development project that the statute was designed to protect. In that sense, Defendants argue, Plaintiff has failed to allege that Sun8's lawsuit was materially related to any public petition. Sun8's lawsuit made only passing reference to any communication by Dynamic with public officials, and was not designed to stifle community opposition to the project. That passing reference reflected the fact, Defendants argue, that Dynamic did not engage in substantial public petition in reference to the project, and that speech did not amount to a direct challenge to the application by Defendants. A narrow construction of the anti-SLAPP act, Defendants claim, requires the Court to dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The detailed factual allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint describe Dynamic's dealings with Szymanski.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complt. at \u00b6\u00b6 22-25. Serving as Dynamic's \"intermediary,\" Syzmanksi facilitated the \"negotiation\" of \"an option to lease land\" between Dynamic and Pinney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Dynamic intended to use this period, during which the Plaintiff had an \"exclusive right to lease land,\" \"to conduct due diligence, apply for permits and grants, and to otherwise examine the economic feasibility of its particular solar project.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties contemplated\n   an agreement that gave Dynamic an 18-month \"exclusive right and option to acquire the solar rights\" to about 15 acres of the larger property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. If Dynamic exercised the option, Dynamic would lease the 15-acre parcel for a 25-year term with two additional five-year terms available at Dynamics discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. Dynamic could exercise this option by notifying Szymanski.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. Plaintiff alleges that Pinney executed the lease option on June 23, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. Dynamic countersigned on July 7, 2016, and Pinney cashed the $1,000 check for the option on September 20, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the same time, Plaintiff alleges, Pinney engaged in other financial dealings regarding the same property. On or about June 23, 2016, Plaintiff alleges, Pinney signed a \"non-binding Letter of Intent\" with Sun8 for lease of an 11-acre parcel on Pinney's Dryden property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. This parcel did not conflict with the parcel for which Plaintiff held a lease option.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 11, 2016, however, Pinney signed a lease with Sun8 for approximately 49.1 acres on that land.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. Plaintiff alleges that Sun8 \"applied to install an interconnection point to the electrical grid\" after signing this lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. Upon doing so, however, Sun8 \"was told that there was another applicant ahead in line on the same property.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. As such, Plaintiff contends \"Sun8 was on notice that Pinney had leased a portion of the Subject Property to another developer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite this apparent conflict over uses on the property, Sun8 and Pinney signed an amendment to their lease agreement on January 29, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. This amendment leased the entire property to Sun8, necessarily subsuming the property for which Plaintiff held an option.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Conflict between Pinney, Dynamic, and Defendants erupted when Plaintiff attempted to exercise its option on January 31, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. On February 14, 2017, Szymanski admitted to Dynamic that he had leased the land for which Dynamic had an option.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. After communication between Dynamic, Pinney and Sun8 about the conflict between the two agreements, Syzmanski notified Pinney on March 6, 2017 that Dynamic intended to exercise its option.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. That same day, Sun8's counsel filed an instrument to record the Sun8 lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. On a March 24, 2017 call with representatives for both Sun8 and Dynamic, Pinney refused to fulfill his obligations under Dynamic's lease option.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43. This conduct, Plaintiff alleges, cost Dynamic its lease option, all of Dynamic's investment in preparation for the lease, a $1.5 million grant from New York State, and any future profits from the development.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 45-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff contends that this conflict led Sun8 to file a SLAPP suit. Plaintiff avers that Sun8 used the lease to develop a solar project on Pinney's project that included the area for which Dynamic held an option.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. As part of the development process, \"Sun8 and Distributed Sun submitted to governmental bodies at least five separate applications for site plan approval and subdivision approval, and for at least one special use permit[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. Plaintiff further alleges that, on March 16, 2017, the day that the Dryden Town Board \"was scheduled to consider an application by the Sun Defendants at a public meeting, Dynamic emailed\" Jason Leifer, a\n   Town Supervisor, \"in his capacity as an elected official.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54. The e-mail \"informed the Town Supervisor about the existence of the Dynamic Lease Option.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The e-mail, Plaintiff alleges, \"stated that Dynamic had only recently learned about the Sun8 Lease, and that Dynamic was trying to reach a resolution with Sun8.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff \"requested that the Town not take action on Sun8's application until Dynamic and Sun8 had an opportunity to resolve their dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54. The relevant Dryden Town Boards approved Sun8's applications in a series of decisions from February through August 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dynamic's counsel issued document preservation notices by e-mail and overnight mail to Pinney and Sun8 on October 25, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57. Counsel sent these \"notices in anticipation of litigation against Pinney for breach of contract and other related claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. Distributed Sun's CEO, Chase Weir, called Dynamic twice the next day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59. Weir first spoke to Cheryl Cramer, Dynamic's Senior Business Development Manager.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60. He then spoke with Dynamic's CEO, Michael Perillo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60. Plaintiff alleges that Weir spoke angrily to Cramer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62. \"Among other hostilities,\" Plaintiff alleges, Weir \"told Cramer that Dynamic 'ha[d] done a bad action.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62. He then \"slammed\" down the phone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Weir had a similarly \"threatening and hostile\" call with Perillo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Weir told Perillo that Distributed Sun had spent $70,000 in June and/or July 2017 drafting a lawsuit against Dynamic for tortious interference, and that Perillo planned to file that suit the next day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66. Weir allegedly asserted that he was prepared to spend $500,000 litigating that suit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67. Weir ended the conversation by telling Perillo \"I'm going to fuck you up. I'm going to fuck you.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants filed their suit on October 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69. Plaintiff alleges that the lawsuit contained a cause of action for tortious interference with a contract, which Plaintiff contends that Defendants drafted \"during the period of its public applications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. According to Plaintiff, \"the core\" of this claim \"focused on Dynamic's alleged engagement with elected officials and others during the Sun Defendants' application process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Complaint alleged that Dynamic's tortious conduct \"included contracting town officials, members of the Dryden Planning Board and/or Town Board, and town residents for the purpose of obstructing, opposing, and interfering with the permitting process for Plaintiff's solar project.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71. Defendants further alleged that Dynamic had \" 'actively provoked opposition from town residents against Plaintiff's solar project and worked to disrupt the town permitting process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72. This conduct, the Defendants allegedly claimed, meant that Dynamic had \"spoke[n] actionably and tortiously to the Town of Dryden and others[,]\" and that Dynamic had \" 'misuse[d]' ... government processes' \" and caused government and private actors to slow down approval of Defendants' projects and limit their ability to raise money for them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff claims that Defendants' tortious interference claim lacked a basis in law and \"was so nonsensical that Sun8 eventually withdrew it[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77. The cause of action, Plaintiff claims, failed even to allege a proper claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79. Defendants could not have maintained such a cause of action, Plaintiff asserts, because a\n   tortious interference claim requires a showing that a defendant used improper means, and the only conduct alleged against Dynamic was engaging in public participation, which cannot support such a claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80. Plaintiff further contends that purpose of the tortious interference lawsuit was to \"harass, intimidate, or punish\" Dynamic for exercising its right to oppose the project; \"[t]his is apparent,\" Plaintiff contends, \"from various statements made by Sun8 and CEO Weir, as well as the incohrent nature of the\" tortious interference claim \"and the Sun8 Lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85. The state court granted Dynamic's motion to dismiss the Sun8 lawsuit on June 6, 2018, and dismissed the case on June 27, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 91.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Sun8's state-court suit, and in particular the tortious interference claim, amounted to a SLAPP suit: \"Sun8 brought a tort claim against Dynamic in retaliation for Dynamic having exercised its First Amendment right to comment on or oppose a public application.\" Plaintiff points out that it filed a motion to dismiss Defendant's state-court complaint. In response, Sun8 withdrew the tortious interference claim. The trial court subsequently granted the motion to dismiss the rest of the complaint. Dynamic contends that the allegations in the instant Complaint make a right to relief plausible and urge the Court to deny Defendants' motion. Dynamic focuses on Sun8's claim of tortious interference, noting that part of that claim concerned Dynamic's attempt to argue against issuing permits for construction to the Defendants. Plaintiff alleges that this claim, which Defendants eventually abandoned, had no basis in law and served merely to harass Dynamic for opposing its project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"[A] SLAPP-suit defendant must directly challenge an application or permission in order to establish a cause of action under the Civil Rights Law.\"\n   <em>\n    Guerrero v.

The e-mail \"informed the Town Supervisor about the existence of the Dynamic Lease Option.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The e-mail, Plaintiff alleges, \"stated that Dynamic had only recently learned about the Sun8 Lease, and that Dynamic was trying to reach a resolution with Sun8.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff \"requested that the Town not take action on Sun8's application until Dynamic and Sun8 had an opportunity to resolve their dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54. This allegation does not contain a \"direct\" challenge to the Defendants' application for permission to construct the solar project. The email from Dynamic to Leifer does not protest solar installation on the land, but instead informs the Town that a dispute over the validity of the lease exists, and asks for a delay in permitting until the parties can resolve the dispute. This allegation does not assert that Dynamic made public any opposition to the program, but instead had raised in a private communication a business dispute. Plaintiff here asked Leifer to intervene to protect its own financial interest, and not to raise a voice about the project. Construing the anti-SLAPP statute narrowly, the Court finds that Dynamic did not offer the sort of challenge to the existence of a project that would entitle the Plaintiff to the protection of the statute. This finding is sufficient to grant the Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In addition, Dynamic, a company operating in the same field as the Defendant companies, is hardly the sort of public-interest group that the New York legislature intended to protect with the Anti-SLAPP statute. In\n   <em>\n    149 Mercer Owner LLC v. 151 Mercer Retail LLC\n   </em>\n   , 2017 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 4655 (N.Y. Sup.

Plaintiff had sued the defendants in the case for \"(1) strict liability for violation of the New York City Building Code; (2) negligence; and (3) breach of contract, requiring defendants to repair damage to the Project, to indemnify [plaintiff] for any damage caused to\" the adjoining building, and \"to indemnify it for any costs and expenses incurred because of the project.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. One of the defendants, an LLC, countersued, claiming \"(1) tortious interference with prospective business advantage; (2) declaratory judgment, to define the parties rights and obligations\" regarding the properties; \"(3) private nuisance; (4) public nuisance; (5) breach of contract; and (6) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Plaintiff moved to dismiss the counterclaims, \"contending that they [were] meritless and asserted solely to stifle [plaintiff's] exercise of its rights to public petition and participation, in violation of the SLAPP Statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. While the court noted that the defendant's counterclaims \"technically fall within the SLAPP Statute,\" the court still denied the plaintiff's motion to dismiss on SLAPP grounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9-10. In part, the court concluded, plaintiff was \"not the sort of defendant the SLAPP Statute is intended to protect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff was a business enterprise, not a \"citizen activist or civic group, trying to exercise petition and participation rights\" and \"purportedly being harassed by a financially superior opponent by means of baseless complaints and claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The same situation applies here, even if the Plaintiff's communications to Leifer were some form of public protest about the permit, Plaintiff is not a public group trying to protect public land or a coalition of neighbors concerned about the scope of the solar project, but another business disputing Defendants' control of the project. Plaintiff is Defendants' competitor in the solar business. The dispute in question involved who got to build the solar project on the contracted land. \"The purpose of statutes governing SLAPP suits in New York is to safeguard free speech and the free exercise of petition and association rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Trent v. Architectural Review Bd.\n   </em>\n   , 2005 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3423, *5 (Sup. Ct. Westchester Cty., July 7, 2005). Construing the statute narrowly, the Court must conclude that the state-court dispute does not fall within the intended purview of the SLAPP Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court notes as well that, unlike most parties that invoke the SLAPP Statute, Plaintiff did not do so as a counterclaim in State court. Instead, Plaintiff brought this action in federal court, which cost Plaintiff a filing fee and additional attorneys fees, and which forced the Defendants to enter an appearance and defend themselves in another venue. While the SLAPP Statute does not prohibit such litigation, causing a new suit to appear in a new forum is activity less in line with a public-interest entity trying to oppose a project the group deems harmful to the community and more in line with savvy business litigation seeking to protect business interest and cause complications and increase cost to a competitor. The SLAPP statute, construed narrowly, was not designed to serve that purpose, and the case could be dismissed on that basis as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Even if the Court were to find that Plaintiff here had properly alleged that Sun8's suit in state court came in response to protests about permitting and was materially related to those protests, Sun8 would still have a defense by showing that its claims \"had a substantial basis in fact and law.\"\n   <em>\n    Giorgio v.

Dynamic points out that the New York court dismissed Sun8's claim and contends that this dismissal is evidence that the claims lacked a substantial basis. The Court notes that New York law \"provides that a motion for summary judgment in 'an action involving public petition and participation ... shall be granted unless the party responding to the motion demonstrates that the action ... has a substantial basis in fact and law or is supported by a substantial argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Artisan Lofts Dev.

Instead, he alleges, Szymanski told him only that he was working for Pinney to secure the best deal he could for his land. Presumably, Szymanski's failure to reveal to Pinney that he was working for Dynamic made Pinney more likely to sign the Lease Option Agreement, thinking that it benefitted him.

He does not allege that Dynamic's alleged fraud caused him to accept that $1000 when the value of the consideration he provided in return was far higher. Indeed, the facts agreed to by the parties here would make such an allegation impossible to prove. Indeed, Pinney allegedly signed a lease agreement with Sun8 during the exclusive period he provided\n   as consideration for the $1000 he received from Dynamic. He can hardly claim that he lost because he entered into a lease option agreement he supposedly violated. The only damages that the Court can conceive of for Pinney under these circumstances is a purely speculative loss, and one he is not permitted to recover under the standard recited above: funds from a lease agreement where the lessee was certain that no third party would contest the lease. In other words, funds that he would have realized in the absence of the alleged fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court will therefore grant the motion and dismiss the counterclaim for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. As the facts alleged and accepted as true make it impossible for Plaintiff to recover, the Court will grant Dynamic's motion with prejudice. The Court will also deny Pinney's request for leave to re-plead.
