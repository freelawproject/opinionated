(D.E. 51.) This case was originally assigned to United States District Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 30, 2006, the Government filed and served upon Defendant an Information pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating\n   that it intended to seek an enhanced statutory penalty under Section 841 based upon six prior state court convictions for felony drug offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.E. 101.) Defendant later filed a response to the Information challenging the Section 851 enhancement. (D.E. 115.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 1, 2006, a jury found Defendant guilty of Counts One, Two, and Three. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jury Verdict, D.E. 110; Trial Tr., Feb. 1, 2006 at 601:10-21.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury further found that the offense charged in Count Two involved at least 50 grams of crack cocaine, and that the offense charged in Count Three involved at least 5 grams of crack cocaine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jury Verdict at 1; Trial Tr., Feb. 1, 2006 at 601:10-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a revised Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") finding that Defendant's offenses involved 142.2 grams of crack cocaine. (PSR \u00b6\u00b6 15, 23.) Relevant here, the PSR found that the offense charged in Count Two involved 100.2 grams of crack cocaine, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11), and the offense charged in Count Three involved 10 grams of crack cocaine, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Based on the 142.2 grams of crack cocaine, Defendant's base offense level was 32 pursuant to the drug quantity tables in United States Sentencing Guideline (\"U.S.S.G.\") 2D1.1(a)(3) (2005), which provides that an offense involving at least 50 grams but less than 150 grams of cocaine base has an offense level of 32. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The PSR further found that because Defendant was over eighteen years old and had at least two prior convictions for controlled substance offenses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   he qualified as a Career Offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) As to Counts Two and Three, because the statutory maximum penalty under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) &amp; (B) with the Section 851 enhancement was life imprisonment, pursuant to Section 4B1.1(b)(1) Defendant's offense level was 37. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 98.) Because his career offender offense level under Section 4B1.1 was greater than his drug quantity offense level under Section 2D1.1, the career offender offense level applied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29 (citing\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) The PSR further found that because Defendant had 18 criminal history points, he had a criminal history category of VI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Based on a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI, Defendant's guideline imprisonment range was 360 months to life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   However, as to Count Two, Defendant was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum life sentence based upon the Section 851 enhancement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, as to Count Two, Defendant was sentenced under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A), which provides, in pertinent part: \"If any person commits a violation of this subparagraph ... after two or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense have become final, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without release and fined in accordance with the preceding sentence.\" Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2), the Court may impose a sentence \"at any point within the applicable guideline range, provided that the sentence ... is not less than any statutorily required minimum sentence.\" Because Count Two carried a statutorily-required minimum sentence of life, Defendant's guideline imprisonment range was life. (PSR \u00b6 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 14, 2006, Judge Ryskamp adopted the revised PSR and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment, consisting of concurrent terms of 240 months as to Count One, life imprisonment as to Count Two, and 360 months as to Count Three. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sentencing Hr'g Tr. at 8:1, 10:9-23; Judgment, D.E. 119 at 2.) Judge Ryskamp also imposed a total term of ten years' supervised release, consisting of concurrent terms of three years as to Count One, ten years as to Count Two, and eight years as to Count Three. (Judgment at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 28, 2008, the Eleventh Circuit issued its Mandate affirming Defendant's convictions and sentence. (Mandate, D.E. 138.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant filed an application for executive clemency, which President Barack Obama granted on October 6, 2016. (D.E. 152.) The Clemency Order commuted Defendant's sentence to a total of 360 months' imprisonment, leaving intact the terms of supervised release and all other conditions imposed by Judge Ryskamp. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Judgment, D.E. 153.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 21, 2016, the Clerk reassigned this case to the undersigned judge. (D.E. 155.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 18, 2019, Defendant filed a Motion to Reduce Sentence under the First Step Act and Motion for Appointment as Counsel. (D.E. 158.) In his Reply in support of the Motion, Defendant acknowledged that \"[r]eductions under the First Step Act are governed by [ 18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3582(c)(1).\" (D.E. 164 at 3.) On May 22, 2019, the Court entered an Order granting the motion to the extent that it requested the appointment of the Federal Public Defender, but denying the motion in all other respects. (D.E. 165.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Initially, the Court found that Defendant's convictions for Counts Two and Three are \"covered offenses\" for purposes of the First Step Act, Pub. L. No. 115-391,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%205194\">\n    132 Stat. 5194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because: (1) the offenses were committed prior to August 3, 2010; and (2) the statutory penalty for the convictions for Count Two and Three are contained in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) &amp; (B), respectively, which were modified by Section 2 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-220,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Stat.%202372\">\n    124 Stat. 2372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) However, the Court concluded that Defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court finds that because Defendant remains accountable for 100.2 grams of crack cocaine as to Count Two, remains a Career Offender, and remains subject to a Section 851 enhancement, he is not entitled to a sentence reduction under Section 3582(c)(1)(B). Applying Section 2 of the Fair Sentencing Act retroactively, Defendant's conviction in Count Two would now fall under Section 841(b)(1)(B) because he is accountable for 28 grams or more of crack cocaine but less than 280 grams. Based upon the Section 851 enhancement, the statutory range of imprisonment under Section 841(b)(1)(B) is 10 years to life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant's conviction in Count Three would now fall under Section 841(b)(1)(C) because Count Three involved a Schedule II controlled substance, but in an insufficient quantity to trigger the Section 841(b)(1)(B) penalties. Based upon the Section 851 enhancement, the statutory range of imprisonment under Section 841(b)(1)(C) is 0 to 30 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The application notes to Section 4B1.1 instruct that \"[i]f more than one count of conviction is of a ... controlled substance offense, use the maximum authorized term of imprisonment for the count that has the greatest offense statutory maximum.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 cmt. n.2 (2005). Here, Count Two carries the greatest offense statutory maximum. Because the maximum statutory term of imprisonment for Count Two remains life imprisonment, as a Career Offender the Defendant's offense level is still 37, his criminal history remains at Criminal History Category VI, resulting in the guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Defendant's commuted sentence of 360 months' imprisonment is at the bottom of the new guidelines range, he is not entitled to a reduced sentence under Section 3582 [ (c)(1)(B) ].\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Randell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20848\">\n    724 F. App'x 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851 (11th Cir. 2018) (holding that the defendant was not entitled to further reduction of his sentence after executive order of clemency, which reduced his sentence to 360 months, based on intervening amendments to sentencing guidelines that reduced base offense levels to crack cocaine offenses, because the defendant was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and therefore his guideline range was not affected by the amendments to the drug quantity table in Section 2D1.1 ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Assuming arguendo that Defendant is otherwise eligible for a variance below the bottom of the guidelines and commuted sentence of 360 months, the Court exercises its discretion not to grant a variance based on his disciplinary history while incarcerated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 161-1; Prob. Resp. at 4.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22.) Defendant has appealed the Court's Order. (D.E. 167.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 29, 2019, Defendant filed the instant Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the Court failed to consider whether he was entitled to a reduced term of supervised release under the First Step Act.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court agrees with the Government that Defendant did not specifically request a reduced term of supervised release in his Motion for Reduction of Sentence or Reply in support thereof. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 158 at 1 (\"The defendant, Ronald Razz, through counsel, and pursuant to Section 404 of the First Step Act, asks that the court\n   <em>\n    reduce his term of imprisonment\n   </em>\n   and appoint the Federal Public Defender to represent him.\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (\"For all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Razz requests that the court\n   <em>\n    reduce his sentence to less than 360 months\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added).) In his Reply in support of his Motion for Reduction of Sentence, Defendant mentioned that he \"is still serving a term of imprisonment and a term of supervised release that this court may further reduce pursuant to Section 404 of the First Step Act.\" (D.E. 164 at 5.) However, although he suggests in passing that the Court has discretion to reduce his term of supervised release under Section 404 of the First Step Act, he does not specifically request that the Court exercise that discretion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (\"For all of these reasons, as well as those set forth in his motion to reduce sentence, the court should grant Mr. Razz's motion,\n   <em>\n    reducing his sentence to less than 360 months\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant was granted conditional release on March 25, 2003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendant committed the instant offenses while on conditional release from his prison sentence in Case No. 00-5099CF A02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In determining Defendant's status as a Career Offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the PSR relied on Defendant's convictions in Case Nos. 90-15025CF A02, 91-2067CF A02, 92-5241CF A02, and 00-5099CF A02.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PSR \u00b6 29.) The PSR assigned Defendant a total of\n   <em>\n    eighteen\n   </em>\n   criminal history points: fifteen for his prior offenses, two for committing the instant offenses while on conditional release, and one for committing the instant offenses less than two years after release from custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In light of the foregoing, even assuming arguendo that the Court was authorized to reduce Defendant's term of supervised release, it would deny Defendant's request. Given that Section 841(b)(1)(B) requires a\n   <em>\n    minimum\n   </em>\n   term of eight years' supervised release for Count Two and Section 841(b)(1)(C) requires a\n   <em>\n    minimum\n   </em>\n   term of six years' supervised release for Count Three, the Court finds that a term of ten years' supervised release should remain based on the offense conduct, Defendant's extensive criminal history, and the fact that he committed the instant offenses while on conditional release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, the last paragraph of Section IV (\"Discussion\") of the Court's Order Denying Motion to Reduce Sentence Under the First Step Act (D.E. 165 at 22) is hereby amended to read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Assuming arguendo that Defendant is otherwise eligible for a variance below the bottom of the guidelines and commuted sentence of 360 months, the Court exercises its discretion not to grant a variance based on the offense conduct, Defendant's extensive criminal history as reflected in Paragraphs 33-62 of the PSR, the fact that he committed the instant offenses while on conditional release, and his disciplinary history while incarcerated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 161-1; Prob. Resp. at 4.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   This is the only amendment to the Court's Order Denying Motion to Reduce Sentence Under the First Step Act (D.E. 165).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
