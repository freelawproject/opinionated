The Court ruled, if the members of this class are given a bond hearing, it must comply with the Due Process Clause. An injunction ordering the Defendants to do so has already issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The first decision was based, not only on the Court's analysis of the constitutional due process owed to these class members, but also on 50 years of statutory and case law supporting the right of persons detained for non-criminal reasons to be released upon posting bond. Shortly after that injunction was issued, the Attorney General published a decision announcing that immigrants in removal proceedings awaiting the determination of their application for asylum must be detained for the duration of that process, subject to release only under a highly-limited \"parole\" system adjudicated solely by immigration officials. In the wake of that decision, the Government moved to vacate the previously-entered injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is the finding of this Court that it is unconstitutional to deny these class members a bond hearing while they await a final determination of their asylum request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 5, 2019, this Court entered an Order Granting Preliminary Injunction (Dkt.

While much of the analysis underlying the issuance of the initial preliminary injunction in this matter concerned Plaintiffs' constitutional rights in the context of their situation, there is no question that analysis sprang from an understanding (as a result of the ruling in\n   <em>\n    X-K\n   </em>\n   ) that the class members were entitled to a bond hearing under the INA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This order will undertake a fresh analysis of Plaintiffs' claims and their request for modified injunctive relief in light of those changed circumstances, but first must examine a series of threshold issues which the Government has raised as bars to continued injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Threshold issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standing and mootness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Government argues that the claims of the bond hearing class were premised on the ruling in\n   <em>\n    X-K\n   </em>\n   (i.e., that they were eligible for a bond hearing that they were not receiving in a timely manner and with the appropriate amount of due process) and thus have been \"mooted\" by the\n   <em>\n    M-S\n   </em>\n   determination that the statute does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   entitle them to a bond hearing. The claims of the bond hearing class survive the ruling in\n   <em>\n    M-S\n   </em>\n   : nowhere in the Second (and now, the Third) Amended Complaint do Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    X-K\n   </em>\n   as the basis for the relief they seek - their claims are premised on the fundamental unconstitutionality of the Government's claimed right to detain them indefinitely (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 26 at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 151-52; Dkt. No. 130 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 117-29) and allegations that the ruling in\n   <em>\n    M-S\n   </em>\n   and the policies and practices of\n   Defendants violate the APA. (Dkt. No. 130, \u00b6\u00b6 142-146, 152-159.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   That the named Plaintiffs (Vasquez and Orantes) are not currently being detained is also cited as grounds for challenging their standing and their ability to serve as class representatives. This is not a sound argument for two reasons: First, the INA gives Defendants the right to revoke a bond order at any time on the basis of \"changed circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Government submits a declaration from the Deputy Assistant Director of ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) which states that \"[a]t this time, ERO does not intend to re-detain aliens who, after having established credible fear, have an ICE custody release determination or an Immigration Court final bond determination pursuant to INA \u00a7 236 issued prior to July 15, 2019.\" (Dkt. No. 137, Decl. of Hott at \u00b6 6.) The Court is not persuaded that the conditional \"at this time\" language divests Plaintiffs of standing - the Government's unwillingness to unconditionally assert that Plaintiffs will not be re-detained means that the specter of re-detention looms and these Plaintiffs and many members of their class face the real and imminent threat of bondless and indefinite detention absent the relief they seek.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, as this Court has already ruled, the claims of the bond hearing class continue to be \"inherently transitory\" and thus the named Plaintiffs are permitted to represent the interests of class members whose claims may both come ripe and/or expire during the course of the litigation.

No. 91 at 19.) That holding was unquestionably grounded in the\n   <em>\n    Matter of X-K\n   </em>\n   , which held that Plaintiffs are entitled to a bond hearing under the INA. With the AG's determination that\n   <em>\n    X-K\n   </em>\n   \"was wrongly decided,\" the parties (and the Court) are required to address the impact of \u00a7 1252(f)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Government's position is straightforward: the effect of this provision is to ban classwide injunctive relief on any issue touching on the enforcement of the INA. Since it is now \"settled\" (from the Government's perspective) that the INA excludes Plaintiffs from bond hearings pending final adjudication of their asylum application, it can be argued that an injunction which\n   orders bond hearings for Plaintiffs as a class \"enjoin[s] or restrain[s] the operation\" of the statute \"other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien.\" There is support for this position in the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Jennings v. Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   opinion: \" Section 1252(f)(1) thus 'prohibits federal courts from granting classwide injunctive relief against the operation of \u00a7\u00a7 1221-123[2].' \" --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/#p851\">\n    138 S.Ct. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/#p851\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) ;\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reno v.

It is true that habeas is barred as to\n   <em>\n    injunctive relief\n   </em>\n   for\n   <em>\n    class actions\n   </em>\n   , but there is nothing barring a class from seeking a traditional writ of habeas corpus (which is distinct from injunctive relief\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Hamama v.

But this Court is not compelled to follow the dictates of the Sixth Circuit (and, per the remand in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

There is nothing in\n   <em>\n    St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   and nothing in applicable Ninth Circuit jurisprudence to indicate that, absent a specific restriction, this Court is not authorized to exercise the full panoply of its habeas powers, including its equitable powers to enjoin conduct found unconstitutional. On that basis, \u00a7 1252(f)(1) does not operate to bar the classwide injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    \u00a7 1252(e)(3)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Government also challenges the Court's jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3) (\"Challenges on Validity of the System\") provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [j]udicial review of determinations under section 1225(b)...and its implementation is available in an action instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, but shall be limited to determinations of (i) whether such section, or any regulation issued to implement such section, is constitutional.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Government contends that Plaintiffs' TAC represents the kind of \"systemic challenge to the constitutionality of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \" which, pursuant to the mandate above, may only properly be brought in the District of Columbia.

As such, \u00a7 1252(e)(3) is addressed to challenges to the removal\n   <em>\n    process\n   </em>\n   itself, not to detentions attendant upon that process. The Court is guided by the reasoning of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , which noted (in finding jurisdiction to consider challenges to the detention process under \u00a7 1225 ):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   For present purposes, it is enough to note that respondents are not asking for review of an order of removal; they are not challenging the decision to detain them in the first place or to seek removal; and they are not even challenging any part of the process by which their removability will be determined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/#p851\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In a case involving plaintiffs challenging their detention under \u00a7 1225(b), neither the Government, the Supreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit saw fit to raise \u00a7 1252(e)(3) as an impediment to consideration of the merits of the claims.

The Court disagrees. Even in its modified form, this remains a \"prohibitory\" injunction, one intended to preserve the status quo (which, at this point, is represented both by the original preliminary injunction and by the 50 years preceding this litigation during which EWI aliens have been considered entitled to bond hearings to test the necessity of their detention) and seeking only to \"prevent[ ] future constitutional violations.\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

After an initial custody determination by the district director, including the setting of a bond, the respondent may, at any time before an order under 8 CFR part 1240 becomes final, request amelioration of the conditions under which he or she may be released. Prior to such final order, and except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the immigration judge is\n   <em>\n    authorized to exercise the authority in section 236 of the Act\n   </em>\n   ... to detain the alien in custody, release the alien, and determine the amount of bond, if any, under which the respondent may be released, as provided in \u00a7 1003.19 of this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   (Emphasis supplied.) \u00a7 1003.19 is an adjunct regulation to \u00a7 1236.1, covering \"[c]ustody and bond determinations made by the service pursuant to 8 C.F.R. part 1236.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   These regulations concern the authority of immigration officials and judges under \"section 236 of the Act,\" which is also known as \u00a7 1226 of the INA. Plaintiffs' asylum applications are being processed (and they are being detained) pursuant to section 235 (or \u00a7 1225 ) of the Act, and the regulation which they allege is being revised or repealed in violation of the APA is inapplicable to them.

The Government's interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   To demonstrate their interest, Defendants cite their commitment to \"the efficient administration of the immigration laws at the border.\" (Dkt. No. 139, Defendants' Response at 24.) The Court has already indicated its disinclination to \"exalt expense over fundamental rights to liberty\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   (PI Order at 15), quoting the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [T]he government has no legitimate interest in detaining individuals who have been determined not to be a danger to the community and whose appearance at future immigration proceedings can be reasonably ensured...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/#p998\">\n    872 F.3d at 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court finds a private interest held by this class that is being affected by governmental action, a substantial risk of its erroneous deprivation under the AG's interpretation of the INA, and probable value in according Plaintiffs their right to a bond hearing, none of which are outweighed by the Government's interest in proceeding in accordance with the AG's dictates. While the same cannot be said for Plaintiffs' APA claim, the Court finds that the class has demonstrated a likelihood of success on their constitutional challenge to the complete elimination of bond hearings for its members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Irreparable harm\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As the Court has previously found, \"any deprivation of constitutional rights 'unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/#p998\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/#p998\">\n    at 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). All the harms attendant upon their prolonged detention cited in the original ruling on Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief remain applicable here - substandard physical conditions, low standards of medical care, lack of access to attorneys and evidence as Plaintiffs prepare their cases, separation from their families, and re-traumatization of a population already found to have legitimate circumstances of victimization.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Finally, there is the incalculable harm to those class members who, facing an uncertain length of time in custody and an arduous and obstacle-strewn road to establishing...[ ]their right to asylum[ ], simply abandon their claim and accept deportation back to countries where, as it has already been established to the Government's satisfaction, they face persecution, torture, and possibly death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   PI Order at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Government's arguments to the contrary lack substance.

Defendants again cite to the bond hearing class's access to individual habeas petitions to challenge their detention - the Court has already commented on the \"grim irony\" of the members of this class being forced to endure further delays while they contest the constitutionality of their detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs have succeeded in demonstrating \"irreparable harm\" in the absence of injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Equities/public interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   When the Government is a party to the case, the public interest and balance of equities factors \"merge.\"\n   <em>\n    Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v.
