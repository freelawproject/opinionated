Plaintiff Atain Specialty Insurance Company seeks a declaration that it has no duty to defend or indemnify defendants Boston Rickshaw LLC and Dennis Suozzi in an action brought by Laura Gentry Reagan and Robert Reagan in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Atain has filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). For the following reasons, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Underlying Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts appear as alleged in the Reagans' complaint in the underlying state action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laura Gentry Reagan and Robert Reagan v. Dennis Suozzi and Boston Rickshaw LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 1684-cv-02697 (Mass. Super. Ct.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 8, 2013, Laura Gentry Reagan and her husband Robert Reagan entered a pedicab on Charles Street in Boston, Massachusetts. (Underlying Comp. \u00b6 15). The pedicab was licensed and registered to Boston Rickshaw LLC and was operated by Dennis Suozzi, an employee of Boston Rickshaw. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the Reagans' ride, Suozzi allegedly changed lanes \"into the path of an unknown vehicle\" without looking to see whether the \"lane was open\" and without signaling properly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17-20). The lane change allegedly caused the vehicle traveling behind Suozzi to strike the rear of his pedicab. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). The Reagans contend that they suffered serious injuries as a result of the collision. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). Their complaint alleges claims of negligence against both Suozzi and Boston Rickshaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Insurance Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Atain issued a Commercial General Liability policy to Boston Rickshaw for the period from April 5, 2013, to April 5, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The policy contained a number of exclusions, which provided that the policy's \"insurance\n   [did] not apply to\" various categories of injuries. (Policy at 33). Exclusion (g), in its original form, was titled \"Aircraft, Auto or Watercraft,\" and provided that insurance did not apply to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   'Bodily injury' or 'property damage' arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, 'auto' or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured. Use includes operation and 'loading or unloading.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   This exclusion applies even if the claims against any insured alleged negligence or other wrongdoing in the supervision, hiring, employment, training or monitoring of others by that insured, if the 'occurrence' which caused the 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' involved by the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, 'auto' or watercraft that is owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35). The policy defined an \"auto\" as either \"[a] land motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer designed for travel on public roads, including any attached machinery or equipment\" or \"[a]ny other land vehicle that is subject to a compulsory or financial responsibility law or other motor vehicle insurance law in the state where it is licensed or principally garaged.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   However, the policy also had a number of endorsements that \"change[d] the policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). One of those endorsements, entitled \"AMENDMENT - AIRCRAFT, AUTO OR WATERCRAFT EXCLUSION,\" deleted the original Exclusion (g) and replaced it with the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   g. Aircraft, Auto Or Watercraft\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   This insurance does not apply to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) \"Bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" arising out of or in connection with any aircraft or watercraft unless outlined below;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) \"Bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" arising out of or in connection with any \"auto\" unless as outlined below; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (3) The \"loading or unloading\" of any aircraft, \"auto\" or watercraft by any insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   This exclusion applies to \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" arising out of any aircraft, \"auto\" or watercraft, whether or not owned, maintained, used, rented, leased, hired, loaned, borrowed or entrusted to others or provided to another by any insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   This exclusion applies even if the claims allege negligence or other wrongdoing in the supervision, hiring, employment, entrustment, permitting, training or monitoring of others by an insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   This exclusion applies even if the claims against any insured allege direct or vicarious liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Reagans filed their complaint in the underlying state civil action on August 30, 2016. Atain filed this declaratory judgment action on March 20, 2018. Atain has moved for judgment on the pleadings, contending that it has no duty to defend or indemnify defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Ripeness\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Reagans contend that Atain's claim for a declaratory judgment is not yet ripe. In support of that contention, they cite opinions from the Middle District of Florida and the Southern District of Alabama for the proposition that \"[a]n insurer's duty to indemnify is\n   not ripe for adjudication unless and until the insured or putative insured has been held liable in the underlying action.\"\n   <em>\n    Pa.

April 27, 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is true that courts frequently hold that an insurer's duty to indemnify does not become ripe for adjudication until the underlying lawsuit for liability is resolved.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mid-Continent Casualty Company v. Delacruz Drywall Plastering &amp; Stucco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=766%20Fed.%20Appx.%20768\">\n    766 Fed.Appx. 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2019). The same is not true, however, for an insurer's duty to defend. Indeed, courts routinely consider an insurer's duty to defend ripe for adjudication while the underlying lawsuit for liability is still pending.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Narragansett Bay Ins. Co. v. Kaplan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265721\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/364/#p372\">\n    146 F. Supp. 3d 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372 (D. Mass. 2015) (finding the question of whether an insured owed a duty to defend, but not the question of whether it owed a duty to indemnify, ripe for adjudication before liability had been determined in underlying action);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   16\n   <em>\n    Couch on Insurance 3d\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 227:29 (\"[W]hether an insurer has a duty to defend a suit against its insured is generally considered a controversy ripe for declaratory relief, even when the issue of the insurer's actual liability in the underlying suit may not be considered until after a resolution of that suit.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It appears, therefore, that even if the question of the duty to indemnify is not yet ripe for adjudication, the question of the duty to defend is. Under Massachusetts law, \"[i]f an insurer has no duty to defend, based on the allegation in the plaintiff's complaint, it necessarily follows that the insurer does not have a duty to indemnify.\"\n   <em>\n    Bagley v.

The Reagans essentially interpret the phrase \"whether or not\" as applying only to the word \"owned,\" leaving a clause that effectively reads \"arising out of any ... auto ... whether or not owned [by Boston Rickshaw], [that is] maintained, used, rented, leased, hired, loaned, borrowed or entrusted to others or provided to another [by Boston Rickshaw].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In support, the Reagans cite to\n   <em>\n    Minden v.

Ct. 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 970,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602432\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/958/#p970\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). And if the phrase \"whether or not\" applies to each of the terms in the series following it, the only rational interpretation of the exclusion is that it excludes coverage for injuries arising from\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   auto, whether or not that auto is \"owned,\" whether or not that auto is \"maintained,\" whether or not that auto is \"used,\" etc., by Boston Rickshaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As a result, the Reagans' interpretation only makes sense if the reader adds words that are not actually present in the policy. And Massachusetts law is clear that a court interpreting an insurance policy must \"construe the words of the policy according to the fair meaning of the\n   <em>\n    language used\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobs v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"482531\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/417/75/#p76\">\n    417 Mass. 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20N.E.2d%20463\">\n    627 N.E.2d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (citation omitted) (emphasis).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, the Reagans contend that reading the exclusion to apply to injuries arising out of any automobile would be \"unreasonable,\" \"absurd,\" and \"incomprehensible,\" and that a \"reasonable insured\" that \"operat[es] [pedicabs] on [the] public ways\" of a busy city such as Boston \"would not expect the Auto Exclusion to apply to autos outside of their control and use, or to any autos that strike their pedicabs.\" (Def. Mem. at 7). Again, however, under Massachusetts law, what a reasonably insured would \"expect\" an insurance policy to exclude or cover is only to be considered when the language of the policy is ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stolberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881594\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/61/#p69\">\n    680 F.3d at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And again, the language here is unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In any event, although \"[c]ontracts\" under Massachusetts law \"are construed ... to avoid absurd results,\" interpreting the exclusion as covering injuries caused by an automobile would not be absurd.\n   <em>\n    Sunbelt Financial Group, LLC v. North Reading Hardware and Paint Supply, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205910530\">\n    2009 WL 5910530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3 (Mass. Super. Nov. 23, 2009). There is nothing absurd about a general liability policy that precludes coverage for injuries arising out of automobiles. Indeed, it is commonplace for insureds to have separate automobile and general liability policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In short, the allegations in the underlying lawsuit are \"not susceptible to an interpretation that they state a claim covered by [the] policy.\" Atain thus has no duty to defend Boston Rickshaw or Dennis Suozzi.\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale Ins.

Because the Reagans' injuries \"[arose] ... out of an auto,\" the exclusion applies, and the policy does not provide coverage for either defense or indemnity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the motion for judgment on the pleadings of plaintiff Atain Specialty Insurance Co. is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    So Ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The Reagans also appear to contend that Atain's motion is not yet ripe because \"discovery has not been completed.\" (Def. Mem. at 5). But because an insurer's duty to defend is determined by whether \"the allegations in the underlying lawsuit are reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that they state a claim covered by [the] policy,\" the court need not consider anything beyond the complaint in the underlying lawsuit, other than the language of the policy, which has been attached as an exhibit to the complaint in this case.\n    <em>\n     Scottsdale Ins.
