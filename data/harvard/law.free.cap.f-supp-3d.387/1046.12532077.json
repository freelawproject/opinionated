The Court finds these motions suitable for determination on the papers submitted and without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b) ; Civ. L.R. 7.1(d)(1). For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   BofI Holding, Inc.'s motion (ECF No. 78) and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Charles Matthew Erhart's motion (ECF No. 96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court and the parties are well versed in the competing allegations that form the basis of these consolidated actions. Consequently, the Court provides only a synopsis of the parties' allegations here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BofI Holding, Inc. is the publicly-traded holding company for BofI Federal Bank, a federally-chartered savings and loan association that operates several brands of banks including Bank of Internet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Erhart's First Amended Complaint\n   (\"FAC\") \u00b6 4, ECF No. 32; BofI's FAC \u00b6 10, ECF No. 12 in Case No. 15-cv-2353.) BofI hired Charles Matthew Erhart as a Staff Internal Auditor in its headquarters in San Diego, California. (Erhart's FAC \u00b6 3; BofI's FAC \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The pleadings paint two different pictures of Erhart's time at BofI. In his First Amended Complaint, Erhart presents a captivating account of his tenure as an auditor in a turbulent corporate environment. (Erhart's FAC \u00b6\u00b6 3-75.) Erhart recounts how, time and again, he battled against pressure from senior management as he discovered conduct he believed to be wrongful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For example, Erhart claims he unearthed evidence that BofI failed to turn over information that was responsive to a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-31.) Erhart also allegedly discovered that BofI's Chief Executive Officer was \"depositing third-party checks for structured settlement annuity payments into a personal account, including nearly $ 100,000 in checks made payable to third parties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When BofI learned Erhart was potentially reporting these activities to the Bank's principal regulator, Erhart claims BofI engaged in a pattern of retaliatory conduct against him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Erhart's FAC \u00b6\u00b6 53-74.) This alleged conduct included BofI (i) repeatedly contacting Erhart while he was out sick from work, (ii) demanding the return of his company-issued laptop, (iii) making false statements about his medical leave and alleged whistleblowing activities, and (iv) ultimately terminating him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on these allegations, Erhart brings seven claims against BofI, including whistleblower retaliation in violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-163.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In contrast, BofI's countersuit portrays Erhart as an entry-level internal auditor who conducted improper \"rogue investigations.\" (BofI's FAC \u00b6\u00b6 7, 23-28.) BofI claims Erhart \"abused his power\" as an auditor by \"initiating and conducting his own unplanned and unapproved investigations into matters that were outside the scope of the\" Bank's internal audit plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) In doing so, Erhart allegedly \"misrepresented to other BofI employees that he was conducting authorized investigations as part of his job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) The Bank also contends that Erhart accessed confidential information for personal gain, disseminated confidential information to \"a website that allows comments on the stocks of publicly traded companies,\" and abandoned his job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 31, 40-41.) In light of these allegations, BofI brings its own catalog of eight claims against Erhart, including breach of contract, breach of the duty of loyalty, and violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court consolidated these actions but did not direct the parties to file consolidated pleadings. (ECF No. 31.)

Erhart's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Erhart moves for judgment on the pleadings as to seven of BofI's claims. At the outset, the Court underscores that, with few exceptions, it is limited under Rule 12(c) to considering the factual allegations contained in the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed R. Civ. P 12(b)-(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Real Prop.

Supp. 2d 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1137 (C.D. Cal. 2002). As explained in the Court's prior order regarding Erhart's affirmative defenses, BofI cannot impose tort liability on Erhart for conduct that is protected activity under state or federal whistleblower statutes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 40 at 32:18-33:14.) But a pleadings motion is not the proper venue to resolve the parties' competing factual contentions regarding what transpired during Erhart's tenure at the Bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   With this point in mind, the Court addresses each of Erhart's seven challenges to BofI's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Erhart first challenges BofI's claim that he committed fraud, arguing that BofI fails to plead this claim with the required specificity. (Erhart's Mot. 5:3-6:13.) Under California law, the elements of a cause of action for fraud are: \"(1) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure), (2) knowledge of falsity (or 'scienter'), (3) intent to defraud (i.e., to induce reliance), (4) justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage.\"\n   <em>\n    Lazar v.

Rule 9(b) in turn requires that \"[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud ... shall be stated with particularity.\" Fed. R. Civ.

(BofI's FAC \u00b6\u00b6 72-79.) BofI alleges Erhart's \"primary job duty was to prepare audits of various aspects of BofI's operations as specifically assigned to him, ... within the parameters of the Internal Audit Plan approved by [BofI's] independent Audit Committee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) One of Erhart's supposed rogue audits, an unapproved payroll investigation, \"was not part of the 2014 Audit Plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27(a).) BofI alleges that Erhart nonetheless \"knowingly made false statements to BofI employees that he was conducting authorized official investigations and audits as part of his job as a Staff Internal Auditor,\" including in several emails to employees in December 2014 \"to request information for his unapproved payroll audit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Even if BofI's fraud claim is not compelling, Rule 12(c) tests the sufficiency of the pleadings, and BofI's claim provides Erhart with \"notice of the particular misconduct which is alleged\" to allow him to \"defend against the charge.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bly-Magee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170453\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/1014/#p1019\">\n    236 F.3d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . BofI's pleading provides the requisite who (Erhart), what (making false statements that he was conducting authorized official investigations and audits as part of his job to obtain information improperly), when (December 11, 15, 19, and 22, 2014), where (at BofI), and how (by sending e-mails to employees who are identified by name in the pleading).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kearns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3652195\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/1120/#p1125\">\n    567 F.3d at 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . BofI alleges that (1) Erhart knew his statements were false, (2) Erhart intended to deceive the other employees to gain access to confidential information, and (3) the Bank was harmed by his conduct. (BofI's FAC \u00b6\u00b6 72-79.) BofI thus pleads a claim for fraud. Erhart's other arguments against this claim are better suited for summary judgment or trial. Therefore, eliminating this claim under Rule 12(c) is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of the Duty of Loyalty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Erhart argues BofI cannot maintain a breach of the duty of loyalty claim against him because no binding authority imposes a duty of loyalty on lower-level employees. (Erhart's Mot. 6:14-9:25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   He also argues the claim fails because BofI (i) does not allege Erhart \"transferred\" his loyalty to another employer and (ii) his alleged conduct was not \"inimical\" to BofI's best interests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The elements of a breach of the duty of loyalty claim are: \"(1) the existence of a relationship giving rise to a duty of loyalty; (2) one or more breaches of that duty; and (3) damage proximately caused by that breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Huong Que, Inc. v.

Most of the rules relating to duties, authority, liabilities, etc., are applicable to servants as well as other agents.\" (emphasis omitted)). And the Court is unpersuaded by Erhart's argument that a \"lower-level\" employee cannot owe an employer a duty of loyalty. \"California courts generally have not distinguished between managerial employees and lower-level employees with respect to the duty of loyalty.\"\n   <em>\n    E.D.C.

Indeed, if a customer service representative at a bank sold customer lists and account information to a competitor, the employee would not be able to escape liability for breach of the duty of loyalty simply because of the job's potential \"lower-level\" status. The Court therefore will not hold, as a matter of law, that Erhart-a staff internal auditor-lacked a duty of loyalty to BofI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   BofI must still plausibly plead that Erhart breached his duty of loyalty. The Bank's pleading identifies various examples of Erhart's conduct that BofI believes constitutes a breach of this duty. (BofI's FAC \u00b6 65(a)-(e).) Several of these examples are not plausible. For instance, BofI claims Erhart breached his duty of loyalty because he failed \"to fulfill his job duties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65(c).) That allegation may mean Erhart was an unsatisfactory employee, but it does not mean he failed to be loyal to BofI. The Court is similarly unconvinced that Erhart plausibly violated his duty of loyalty simply because he conducted \"additional investigations and audits that were outside the scope of the 2014 and 2015 Internal Audit Plans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65(a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   BofI, however, also alleges that Erhart \"wrongfully distribut[ed] BofI's Confidential Information to unauthorized recipients.\" (BofI's FAC \u00b6 65(e).) For example, BofI claims Erhart \"disseminated ... Confidential Information ... to contributors to a website that allows comments on the stocks of publicly traded companies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41(h).) BofI further claims it was harmed by Erhart's conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) When these allegations are accepted as true and construed in BofI's favor, this conduct could be viewed as \"inimical\n   to the best interests of\" BofI and constitute a breach of Erhart's duty of loyalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stokes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4729087\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/41/285/#p295\">\n    41 Cal.

First, section 502 does not require that Erhart \"hack\" into BofI's computer system or overcome code-based barriers for him to be potentially liable for the unauthorized taking or destruction of BofI's data. The statute punishes a person who \"[k]nowingly accesses\" a computer system for specified unauthorized uses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)-(3), (4), (11). The statute defines \"access\" as meaning \"to gain entry to, instruct, cause input to, ... or communicate with, the ... memory function resources of a computer, computer system, or computer network.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 502(b)(1). Therefore, section 502(c) \"does not require\n   <em>\n    unauthorized\n   </em>\n   access. It merely requires\n   <em>\n    knowing\n   </em>\n   access.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(BofI's FAC \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 82.)

BofI's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   BofI's motion for judgment on the pleadings raises four challenges to Erhart's pleading regarding: (1) the exhaustion of his claim under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) the legal sufficiency of portions of his three whistleblower retaliation claims; (3) the adequacy of his UCL claim; and (4) the proper named defendant for his action. The Court will address each item.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Exhaustion of Sarbanes-Oxley Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   BofI first argues partial judgment on the pleadings is appropriate regarding Erhart's whistleblower retaliation claim under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. (BofI's Mot. 7:1-11:16.) BofI contends Erhart failed to fully exhaust his administrative remedy with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") before filing his lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9:14-11:16.) Therefore, BofI seeks a ruling that this claim fails to the extent it rests on protected activity that was not adequately raised in Erhart's administrative complaint filed with OSHA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Erhart counters that he has adequately pled administrative exhaustion, and he claims resolving BofI's challenge requires a factual determination because the Court should consider \"the materials submitted to OSHA and what transpired.\" (Erhart's Opp'n 4:12-8:11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court is familiar with this issue because BofI previously challenged Erhart's First Amended Complaint based on exhaustion via a motion to strike portions of the pleading. (ECF No. 35-1 at 24:1-25:8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 3-1 at 21:14-23:11.) The Court denied BofI's motion to strike, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court declines BofI's invitation to carve up Erhart's amended pleading based on what he included in his administrative complaint. The Bank's motion overlooks the fact that Erhart is not simply bringing a claim under Sarbanes-Oxley. He has nine other claims. Although Sarbanes-Oxley may require Erhart to exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing a whistleblower retaliation claim, Dodd-Frank does not. The same is true for Erhart's whistleblower\n   retaliation claim under California Labor Code \u00a7 1102.5. Consequently, even if Erhart failed to fully exhaust his administrative remedies under Sarbanes-Oxley, the allegations BofI seeks to remove from his pleading are appropriately included to support Erhart's other claims.... Thus, the Court will not strike them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (ECF No. 44 at 36:24-37:10.) Accordingly, although BofI's present motion arises under Rule 12(c) instead of Rule 12(f), the motion essentially seeks the same relief as the Bank's prior attack on Erhart's pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court remains unconvinced that partially resolving Erhart's Sarbanes-Oxley claim on the pleadings is appropriate. Erhart alleges he exhausted his administrative remedies. (Erhart's FAC \u00b6 18.) And the Court already determined that Erhart states a plausible whistleblower retaliation claim under Sarbanes-Oxley. (ECF No. 44 at 11:14-21:27.) In addition, even if this Court were to now examine Erhart's administrative complaint to determine whether a portion of his Sarbanes-Oxley claim is unexhausted, Erhart requests permission to submit additional evidence regarding his administrative claim to demonstrate he meets his exhaustion burden. (Erhart's Opp'n 4:24.) By now, there has been substantial discovery on the merits of Erhart's claim, and the Court prefers to consider the partial exhaustion issue without the constraints of a pleadings motion. The Court could convert BofI's pleadings motion into a summary judgment motion and allow the parties to submit any additional relevant evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d), but BofI has already informed the Court that it intends to seek summary adjudication of Erhart's Sarbanes-Oxley claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 119.) Therefore, the Court denies without prejudice BofI's partial exhaustion contentions, and BofI can renew these arguments in its forthcoming evidentiary motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Partial Disposition of Whistleblower Retaliation Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Aside from the exhaustion issue, BofI requests the Court rule that Erhart's whistleblower retaliation claims partially fail to the extent that they are based on certain factual allegations in his pleading. (BofI's Mot. 11:18-20:20.) In response, Erhart argues that (1) his pleading states a cognizable claim for each whistleblower retaliation cause of action, and (2) this Court \"is not required to parse out specific factual allegations and decide whether or not each alone could state a claim for relief\" under the whistleblower statutes. (Erhart's Opp'n 8:24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court previously addressed this issue with respect to Erhart's federal whistleblower retaliation claims. Upon concluding Erhart stated cognizable claims, the Court denied BofI's request to \"analyze all of Erhart's allegations and delineate between exactly which of those factual allegations are actionable and which of those are not.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 55 at 4:17-19.) BofI's present request only differs in that the Bank now asks the Court to analyze a smaller subset of Erhart's factual allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court is unmoved by BofI's motion. Initially, BofI's request to dispose of only part of certain claims under Rule 12(c) on implausibility grounds is unconventional. Courts have entertained partial motions for judgment on the pleadings when the\n   motion resolves at least an entire cause of action or an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Strigliabotti v.

Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1369 (3d ed. 2004). Many courts, however, have refused to entertain motions for judgment on the pleadings that seek to dispose of only a part of an individual claim or defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court will not do so in these circumstances because considering BofI's partial motion for judgment on the pleadings would not promote efficiency or economy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5C Wright &amp; Arthur R.

BofI's targeted challenges to Erhart's fact-intensive whistleblower retaliation claims are better suited for a partial summary judgment motion or trial. Consequently, the Court denies BofI's request for judgment on the pleadings as to only parts of Erhart's whistleblower retaliation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Unfair Competition Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Unlike its challenges to BofI's whistleblower retaliation claims, BofI seeks judgment on the pleadings as to Erhart's entire cause of action under the UCL. (BofI's Mot. 20:22-21:16.) BofI argues Erhart's UCL claim fails because the alleged facts do not \"show any ongoing conduct,\" which precludes injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Bank has not previously challenged the legal sufficiency of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court incorporates its prior discussion of the standards for UCL claims.

Erhart alleges that BofI \"continues to engage in some\n   or all of the ... unfair and unlawful business practices\" described in his pleading. (Erhart's FAC \u00b6 127.) His pleading also identifies some of the conduct that is purportedly ongoing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%207448914\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74B (alleging BofI \"has continued to widely publish false and defamatory statements about Plaintiff\" regarding collaboration with \" 'short sellers' of BofI's stock\"); \u00b6 150 (alleging false statements about Plaintiff's business and personal reputation \"will continue to be published by [BofI]\"). Erhart seeks \"an injunction prohibiting Defendant from engaging in the unfair and unlawful conduct described.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.) Consequently, Erhart sufficiently states a UCL claim, and BofI's motion to resolve this claim under Rule 12(c) is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Improperly Named Defendant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Last, BofI Holding, Inc. argues it \"is incorrectly named as the defendant\" in Erhart's action and \"incorrectly described as 'd/b/a BofI Federal Bank and Bank of the Internet.' \" (BofI's Mot. 21:20-21.) BofI submits that \"BofI Holding, Inc. is the holding company for BofI Federal Bank, its consolidated subsidiary,\" and \"Erhart was at no time employed by BofI Holding, Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   21:21-24.) BofI therefore asks that all claims against BofI Holding, Inc. \"be dismissed with leave to amend for the limited purpose of naming the proper defendant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   21:24-25.) Erhart responds that this error \"can be readily corrected and [BofI] should stipulate to an amendment to correct the name.\" (Erhart's Opp'n 14:7-10.) Regardless, given that Erhart agrees BofI is incorrectly named in the pleading, the Court dismisses Erhart's claims and grants him leave to amend for the limited purpose of naming the proper defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   BofI's motion for judgment on the pleadings (ECF No. 78). The Court grants BofI's request to dismiss Erhart's claims because he names the incorrect defendant. Erhart is granted leave to amend for the limited purpose of naming the correct entity defendant. No other changes or corrections to the new pleading are authorized. Erhart shall file a Third Amended Complaint that makes this correction no later than\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     May 3, 2019\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .

In light of CUTSA's breadth and purpose, courts have concluded the statute \"supersedes claims based on the misappropriation of confidential information, whether or not that information meets the statutory definition of a trade secret.\"\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Mattel, Inc. v.
