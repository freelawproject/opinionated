BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Plastic Omnium Advanced Innovation and Research (\"Plastic\" or \"Plaintiff\") filed suit against Donghee on March 23, 2016, alleging infringement of seven U.S. patents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 1) On August 24, 2016, Plastic amended its complaint to assert infringement of eight U.S. patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,814,921 (the \"'921 patent\"), 6,866,812 (the \"'812 patent\"), 7,166,253 (the \"'253 patent\"), 8,122,604 (the \"'604 patent\"), 8,163,228 (the \"'228 patent\"), 9,079,490 (the \"'490 patent\"), 9,399,326 (the \"'326 patent\"), and 9,399,327 (the \"'327 patent\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 14) On October 23, 2017, the parties stipulated to dismissal of the '604 patent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 195) The parties filed the pending motions on February 2, 2018. A hearing on the motions was held on April 3. 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 298 (\"Tr.\") ) At the April 3 hearing, the parties informed the Court that Plastic has withdrawn its infringement allegations for the '228 patent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4-5, 70) The parties stipulated to dismissal of the '228 patent on April 17, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 297) Therefore, the Court will not consider motions directed to that patent, as they are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Donghee's\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Donghee moves to exclude Plastic's damages expert's opinion in its entirety, based on several grounds. Plastic's damages expert, David Haas, \"concluded that the appropriate compensation for [Donghee's] infringement of all of the Patents-in-Suit would be a total reasonable royalty of $9\" per fuel tank. (D.I. 221 Ex. A at 6) In reaching this conclusion, Mr. Haas \"categorized the asserted patents into three technology groupings\" - Core TSBM Technology, Deformable Pipe Technology, and Rivet Snapping Technology - and applied the 15\n   <em>\n    Georgia-Pacific\n   </em>\n   factors to determine what reasonable royalty rate the parties would have agreed to at the time of the hypothetical negotiation for each group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 24) The hypothetical negotiation construct \"attempts to ascertain the royalty upon which the parties would have agreed had they successfully negotiated an agreement just before infringement began,\" by presuming that the parties are both willing to enter into a license with each other and that the patents are valid, enforceable, and infringed.\n   <em>\n    Lucent Techs., Inc. v. Gateway, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057798\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/1301/#p1324\">\n    580 F.3d 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1324-25 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Haas determined that the hypothetical negotiation would have occurred as early as 2012 or as late as January 2014, and that the reasonable royalty rate and total damages would be the same regardless of which date within this period is selected. (D.I. 221 Ex. A at 24-25) Based on his analysis, Mr. Haas concluded that reasonable royalties would be $5 per unit for the Core TSBM Technology (the '921, '812, and '253 patents ), $2 per unit for the Deformable Pipe Technology (the '228 patent ), and $2 per unit for the Rivet Snapping Technology (the '490, '326, and '327 patents ). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Donghee identifies several issues with Mr. Haas's opinions. The Court will consider each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Sufficiency of Facts and Data Underlying Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Donghee first argues that \"Mr. Haas'[s] royalty rate opinions are not justified by, nor based on, sufficient facts or data,\" referring particularly to two pieces of evidence on which Mr. Haas relies. (D.I. 220 at 4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Donghee asserts that Mr. Haas's $9 total royalty (including the $2 royalty for the Rivet Snapping Technology) is not justified by his reliance on a license for one foreign patent having a royalty rate of $1. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5) This relates to the\n   <em>\n    Georgia-Pacific\n   </em>\n   factor of \"[t]he royalties received by the patentee for the licensing of the patent in suit, proving or tending to prove an established royalty.\"\n   <em>\n    Georgia-Pacific Corp. v.

Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Since there were no actual licenses to any of the seven asserted patents, Mr.\n   Haas reviewed the next best thing: a license for a European patent that is the foreign equivalent to a U.S. patent from which the asserted '326 and '327 patents are continuations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 221 Ex. A at 30) That license, dated July 1, 2013, was executed between Plastic's predecessor, Inergy Automotive Systems (\"Inergy\"), and Kautex Textron GmbH &amp; Co KG (\"Kautex\"), and licensed a European patent related to rivet snapping for 0.75 euros (then equivalent to $0.98) per product manufactured, sold, or delivered. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31) Recognizing that the license has some limited comparability, as it is for one non-asserted patent, Mr. Haas opined that \"a reasonable royalty rate for the asserted Rivet Snapping Technology patents would need to be higher than the approximately $1 per unit royalty\" agreed to in the Kautex license, because (1) that license granted rights to one patent not in suit but related to Rivet Snapping Technology, (2) that license benefitted Plastic by validating the technology, and (3) Plastic invested deeply in the technology whereas Donghee did \"not have similar R &amp; D costs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33, 35, 45)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court finds Mr. Haas's opinions with respect to the Kautex license, together with the rest of his analysis under the\n   <em>\n    Georgia-Pacific\n   </em>\n   factors, are sufficiently related to the facts of the case. Donghee's reliance on\n   <em>\n    ePlus, Inc. v. Lawson Software, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4188244\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/764/807/\">\n    764 F.Supp.2d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Va. 2011), for its argument that Mr. Haas arbitrarily \"doubles\" the $1 Kautex license royalty rate \"with absolutely no explanation,\" is unpersuasive. (D.I. 220 at 5-6) In\n   <em>\n    ePlus\n   </em>\n   , the expert first determined a baseline royalty rate under factor 1 based on an improper review of minimally probative settlement licenses that involved improperly converting lump sum royalties into per unit royalties and using an inappropriate royalty base, and then arbitrarily doubling that baseline royalty rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ePlus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4188244\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/764/807/\">\n    764 F.Supp.2d at 814-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Mr. Haas appropriately considered the totality of the evidence in connection with all 15\n   <em>\n    Georgia-Pacific\n   </em>\n   factors in determining a $2 rate for the Rivet Snapping Technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, Donghee argues it is inappropriate for Mr. Haas to rely on Inergy's \"unaccepted proposal\" to Kautex \"for a worldwide cross license of dozens of patents,\" particularly as there is no evidence that this proposal was ever communicated to Kautex. (D.I. 220 at 6) As part of his factor 1 analysis, Mr. Haas considered an April 30, 2009 Inergy slide deck regarding the status of discussions between Inergy and Kautex with respect to their patent portfolios. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 221 Ex. A at 33-36) (citing Ex. D) The deck demonstrates that Plastic \"contemplated a balancing royalty rate of 2.5% of revenue\" for its TSBM patent portfolio \"in addition to a royalty-free license to Kautex's NGFS patents,\" because Plastic believed its TSBM portfolio was stronger than Kautex's NGFS portfolio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34) Mr. Haas discussed several additional distinguishing characteristics between the contemplated cross-license and the hypothetical license, including that the cross-license was never executed, the negotiation was for a worldwide license, design-around costs, and the possible collaboration between the parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35) Thus, Mr. Haas concluded that a hypothetical license to the TSBM technology would have a royalty rate higher than 2.5%. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36) Donghee argues that Mr. Haas's opinions regarding this contemplated royalty offer should be excluded, because offers - particularly if never conveyed - have little value.

A at 26-27) Moreover, he apportioned the per unit royalty rates to account for the fact that \"each fuel tank program[']s specification and componentry is different, and each program has a different selling price per fuel tank.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27) Thus, a per unit royalty \"allows Donghee to discount, add, or eliminate attachments and other accessories to a fuel tank as needed, without having to pay a higher or lower royalty to Plastic.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, a per unit royalty is intended to account for the patented features of the fuel tank (and not unpatented accessories and attachments).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Mr. Haas also determined that the appropriate royalty base consisted of the total number of fuel tanks sold during the damages period, because this \"represent[s] the apportioned base of fuel tank units manufactured using the TSBM Core Technology patents plus internally mounted components attached through use of either\n   the Deformable Pipe Technology patent or the Rivet Snapping Technology patents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This royalty base \"is also consistent with the only executed license of [Plastic's] TSBM patented technology.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Haas further apportioned by accounting for a single infringement of each patent per tank.

Mr. Haas's Opinions Disclosed At Deposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Donghee further argues that Mr. Haas disclosed opinions during his deposition that were not provided in his expert reports and these new opinions should be excluded at trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 220 at 15) Near the end of Mr. Haas's deposition, counsel for Plastic asked Mr. Haas to walk through the analysis and conclusions contained in his report. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 242 Ex. B at 185-86) Mr. Haas proceeded to do so, in testimony that fills seven transcript pages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 186-93) Donghee asserts that Mr. Haas provided the following three new analyses in support of his $9 royalty rate: (1) the revenue associated with Mr. Haas's royalty base is $100 per unit, (2) the royalty rate should be 9%, which is derived by doubling the 2.5% rate from the unconsummated license offer and adding it to the 4% royalty rate from a Donghee-Kautex license, and (3) the royalty rate should have a $13 per unit royalty ceiling, which represents Plastic's per unit profit premium on an operating profit level. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 220 at 15)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mr. Haas, in supporting his $9 per unit royalty opinion, testified that the appropriate royalty on a $100 LFa fuel tank would be $9, below the $13 ceiling.

B at 191)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 9% royalty rate is derived by doubling the 2.5% balancing rate provided in the 2009 Inergy slide deck and adding 4%, which is the rate in a license Donghee took from Kautex to use Kautex's NGFS technology (which is similar to the TSBM technology). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 188-89; D.I. 221 Ex. A at 10, 38-40)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The $100 royalty base had not been disclosed in Mr. Haas's reports. But Mr. Haas explained his $100 figure was based on an approximation of Ms. Holt's opinion in her rebuttal report, which provided that the royalty base was $96.07. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 242 Ex. B at 199, 219; D.I. 222 Ex. D at 33) The doubling calculation, 4% royalty rate, and $13 profit figure were disclosed in Mr. Haas's opening report.

Therefore, Mr. Haas's deposition disclosures were not untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thus, for the reasons stated above, Donghee's\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Donghee's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Donghee moves for summary judgment of non-infringement of all of the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Parison Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Donghee argues that the accused product does not infringe the Parison Claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it does not extrude a parison. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 224 at 5) It is undisputed that Donghee's \"manufacturing process begins by forcing plastic through a circular coextrusion head, and then feeding the plastic that exits the coextrusion head into a separate piece of equipment, referred to as a 'flat die' tool,\" and that once inside \"the flat die, the molten plastic is 'cut' into two streams of plastic which are extruded as two sheets.\" (D.I. 224 at 6; D.I. 236 at 5) The parties' dispute centers on whether (1) the first piece of equipment, the \"coextrusion head,\" is or has a die, and (2) the extruded parison may continue to be located in the second piece of equipment, the \"flat die,\" and still be held to infringe. (D.I. 224 at 6; D.I. 236 at 5-6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court construed \"extruded parison of closed cross section\" and \"extruding a ... parison\" as \"a tubular preform with a closed cross-section that has been forced through a die, and is cut or split as it exits the die or at some time thereafter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 199 at 5) The Court determined that \"the patents specify that the 'parison' is cut in two as it leaves the die at the end of the extrusion head,\" and so \"this 'parison' cannot be strictly limited to a fully-formed tubular structure existing in its entirety outside the extrusion head/die.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6) The Court further determined that the splitting of the tubular preform does not occur \"at any stage earlier than right as the previously tubular structure leaves the die/extrusion head,\" so the term \"should not include molten plastic (or a tubular preform) present inside the die/extrusion head.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7) Additionally, the Court determined that the die cannot be located just anywhere, because the \"patents specify that the 'die' is located at the 'extrusion head['s]' 'lowest point.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because the splitting does not occur \"at any stage earlier than right as the previously tubular structure\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     leaves the die/extrusion head\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added), the claim construction makes clear that whether the extrusion equipment consists of a single combined extrusion head with a die or a more complex extrusion head with a separate attached die, the splitting of the molten plastic must not occur inside any of the extrusion head/die equipment. Since, for the accused product, it is undisputed that \"[t]he extruded plastic parison is [ ] cut in a separate 'flat die' tool after it leaves Donghee's coextrusion die\" (D.I. 236 at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8, 13, 17-18), there is no genuine issue of fact that Donghee's accused product does not literally infringe the Parison Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Donghee also moves for summary judgment of no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.

Even taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Plastic, and resolving all disputed facts in its favor, a reasonable jury could not find cutting the parison while it is extruding within extrusion equipment is insubstantially different than cutting the extruded parison outside the extrusion equipment. Additionally, Plastic's expert, Dr. Osswald, acknowledges differences between Donghee's flat die tool and the patented invention. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 225 Ex.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10; D.I. 236 at 3, 15; D.I. 258 at 4; Tr. at 28) Therefore, Plastic does not dispute that \"there is an interface between the external atmosphere and the nipple.\" (D.I. 236 at 15) The dispute here is whether the two valves and the hollow tubing interface with the external atmosphere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Donghee argues that since there is a direct air path between the valves and the external atmosphere through the hollow tubing, its product does not infringe. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 224 at 10) Plastic counters that \"the claimed 'interface' is referring to the internally-mounted component[']s point of attachment.\" (D.I. 236 at 14) In other words, \"even if something else at another location pierces the tank['s] wall,\" there can still be infringement if the accessory itself is attached without poking through the tank's wall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court agrees with Plastic. Since the two valves \"never penetrate the tank's wall and are attached at locations separate from the nipple,\" \"there is no interface between the external atmosphere and either valve,\" even though the nipple does pierce the wall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15) The patent claims the attachment of accessories inside the tank without poking holes in the tank's wall. In the accused product, the valves may be found to be separate accessories that are attached without poking holes in the tank's wall. The fact that the valves are connected to hollow tubes that are ultimately connected to the external atmosphere does not necessarily mean that\n   each accessory was\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     attached\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   by poking a hole in the tank's wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court disagrees with Donghee's contention that the claim's use of \"any\" before \"interface\" precludes a finding of infringement. (D.I. 258 at 5) The claim provides that the \"external atmosphere\" is \"outside of the hollow body.\" The phrase \"outside of the hollow body\" specifies that the interface must be with atmosphere outside of the tank, not inside hollow tubes within the tank.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cat Tech LLC v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 224 at 12; D.I. 236 at 16) Donghee argues that the Court's construction requires that the mounting bracket and adapter must be \"previously [in time] joined\" \"before they are attached to the valve assembly accessory.\" (D.I. 224 at 13:\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 21) In its opposition brief, Plastic responded that \"Donghee is importing an improper temporal limitation into the term 'preassembled structure,' \" when the claim language provides \"a structural limitation and not a sequential order of method steps.\" (D.I. 236 at 15-16) However, at the hearing, Plastic conceded that the claims do contain a temporal limitation, contending now that all that is required is that the components of the preassembled structure and the accessory to which it attaches are all preassembled, in whatever order,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   being attached to the fuel tank wall. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 23-26) Plastic argues there is nothing in the patent or the Court's construction that \"would require Plastic [ ] to prove the sequence in which the above structure is manufactured.\" (D.I. 236 at 16)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court disagrees with Plastic. The construction of \"preassembled structure\" requires that the parts of the preassembled structure are \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     previously\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   joined into a single arrangement\" such that they are \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     initially\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   distinct\" from the accessory and that the single arrangement is only\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     then\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"capable of attachment to at least one accessory.\" (D.I. 199 at 11) (emphasis added) The Court's construction contains a temporal limitation, but the record does not contain evidence of the attachment order of the parts before being attached to the fuel tank's wall. Hence, no reasonable jury\n   could find infringement and the Court will grant summary judgment on this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Concave and Convex Relief in '490 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The asserted claims of the '490 patent depend from independent claim 1, which requires that \"the snap-riveting orifice is at least partially surrounded by a concave relief that protrudes towards an inside of the tank into which a convex relief of the tool presses in order to force the material through the orifice, the convex relief of the tool comprising a counterform to mould an upper part of the rivet.\" ( '490 patent, cl. 1) Donghee argues that its product does not infringe for three reasons: (1) the accessory's orifice is not surrounded by concave relief, (2) the tool does not have convex relief that presses into the accessory's concave relief, and (3) the convex relief of the tool does not comprise a counterform. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 224 at 17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As noted, Donghee contends that the snap-riveting orifice is not surrounded by a concave relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19; D.I. 258 at 9-10) The patent defines \"concave\" as \"a hollow shape without a cover, the base of which is formed by the part of the accessory surrounding the orifice or orifices and which is pointing towards the inside of the tank.\" ( '490 patent at 3:62-66) Donghee insists that the accused product's orifice is not \"surrounded by a concave relief that protrudes towards an inside of the tank,\" as the snap-riveting tab does not comprise a base that surrounds the orifice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 224 at 19; D.I. 258 at 9-10) As shown in red in the below figure, Plastic's expert, Dr. Osswald, explains that \"the concave relief in the ROV support bracket is located outside the ridge or plateau that surrounds the snap-riveting orifice.\" (D.I. 225 Ex. A at 92)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plastic asserts that Donghee is incorrect in arguing that \"the concave relief must be immediately adjacent to the orifice.\" (D.I. 236 at 23) Essentially, it appears that Donghee is arguing that the concave relief must be within walls, whereas Plastic is arguing that the concave relief may be outside of the walls (or rivet, in Donghee's product).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court agrees with Donghee. The patent defines \"concave\" as having a base that \"is formed by the part of the accessory surrounding the orifice.\" ( '490 patent at 3:64-65) Hence, moving outward from the center of the orifice, there must be orifice, then base material of the accessory's fastening tab, then some sort of raised wall, ridge, or lip - rather than orifice, then wall or ridge, and then base material. The record does not permit a reasonable juror to find that Donghee's accused product meets these requirements. Accordingly, the Court will grant summary judgment of non-infringement of the '490 patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    5. \"Orifice\" Limitation in '326 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Claim 1, from which claim 13 depends, requires that \"the accessory has a wall portion which is equipped with at least one orifice which passes through the wall portion of the accessory.\" ( '326 patent, cl. 1) The specification defines an \"accessory\" as \"any object or functional device\n   generally associated with the fuel tank in its conventional mode of use or of operation and which collaborates therewith in order to perform certain useful functions;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or a support for one or several of such devices\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:5-10) (emphasis added)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Donghee argues that it cannot be found to infringe claims 1 and 13 of the '326 patent because Plastic cannot show that in its accused product its orifice exists in the accessory itself rather than in the support for the accessory. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 224 at 23) Plastic acknowledges that Donghee's orifices are in the support for the accessory rather than in the accessories themselves. But it contends that the patentee was its own lexicographer, clearly setting forth a definition of \"accessory\" that includes \"support.\" (D.I. 236 at 26) (citing\n   <em>\n    Jack Guttman, Inc. v. Kopykake Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11441848\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/302/1352/#p1360\">\n    302 F.3d 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1360-61 (Fed. Cir. 2002) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court agrees with Plastic. Even Donghee concedes that the patentee was its own lexicographer in defining \"accessory.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 46) This lexicography governs, notwithstanding Donghee's suggestion that the claims can use a term in a different manner than the express definition it was given in the specification by the patentee. Even if some redundancy results, a patentee is permitted to be its own lexicographer, and when it does the Court must construe claim terms consistent with the patentee's express definition. Based on that lexicography, a reasonable factfinder, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Plastic, could find infringement. Accordingly, summary judgment is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Outer Layer Protruding Through Orifice in '326 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Claims 25, 27, and 33 of the '326 patent require that \"the wall of the fuel tank comprises an outer layer of thermoplastic polymer and a barrier layer of thermoplastic resin impermeable to fuel\" and that \"some of the thermoplastic polymer of the outer layer and some of the barrier layer of the fuel tank wall [are] forced in the molten state into and through the at least one orifice.\" ( '326 patent, cl. 25) The parties do not dispute that Donghee's fuel tank wall consists of six layers, as shown below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   It is undisputed that the HDPE and HDPE Regrind layers are thermoplastic polymer layers and that the EVOH layer is a fuel-impermeable barrier layer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 236 at 27) It is further undisputed that at least some of the barrier layer and at least some of the HDPE Regrind layer enter the orifice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 224 at 24; D.I. 236 at 27) The central dispute is whether the \"outer layer\" is the HDPE Regrind layer, the HDPE layer, or both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plastic argues that \"Donghee's tank is made from a tripartite HDPE-EVOH-HDPE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   layered structure,\" so that the \"outer layer of thermoplastic polymer\" is either a single layer \"made from\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   HDPE regrind and pure HDPE\" or \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any layer on the outside\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of the EVOH.\" (D.I. 236 at 27) (emphasis added) Donghee counters that the \"outer layer of thermoplastic polymer\" must be the \"outside\" or outermost layer only and that the pure HDPE layer is \"compositionally distinct\" from the HDPE Regrind layer, so there is no infringement. (D.I. 224 at 24; D.I. 258 at 12)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court agrees with Plastic that \"there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether one of ordinary skill in the art would consider the HDPE regrind and final HDPE la[y]er to be a single outer layer or multiple, discrete outer layers of plastic.\" (D.I. 236 at 27-28) Accordingly, the Court will deny summary judgment of non-infringement on claims 25, 27, and 33 of the '326 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    7.
