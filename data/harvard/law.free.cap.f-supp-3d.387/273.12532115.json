Bullseye Restaurant\n   </em>\n   , E.D.N.Y. Civil Action No. 16-490 (the \"Underlying Action\"). Presently before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs' complaint and declaring that JRIC owes \"no duty to provide coverage to the Plaintiffs or any other party\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   with respect to [claims] asserted in the lawsuit\" Van Derham v. Bullseye Rest. Inc. (E.D.N.Y. Civil Action No. 16-490) (the \"Underlying Action\"). (Bullseye's Notice of Motion (DE 18)). For the reasons set forth below, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from the parties' 56.1 Statements and are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. History of Bullseye and Insurance Coverage By JRIC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bullseye operates a bar restaurant that also functions as a \"gentlemen's club\" under the name \"the Scene,\" which opened in 2001. Bullseye Media was the initial operating entity for the Scene. In 2010 Angelo Abbatiello (\"Abbatiello\") arranged for defendant Bullseye's incorporation and began operating the business, with Abbatiello owning all the stock. In 2014 Brennan became the owner of Bullseye and as such oversaw its business operations, including promotions, except for the period from approximately May 2015 through February or March 2016 when he took a leave of absence for personal reasons. During Brennan's leave of absence, Abbatiello assumed all of Brennan's responsibilities. When Bullseye's then current insurer went out of business, Abbatiello engaged the Robert S. Fede Insurance Agency to obtain coverage for Bullseye. (Pls.' 56.1 Resp. at \u00b6\u00b6 8-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, JRIC issued a Liquor Liability and Commercial General Liability to Bullseye under Policy Number 00067929-0 (the \"Policy\"), initially effective 8/3/2015 to 8/3/ 2016. However, JRIC, by notice dated September 28, 2015 and admittedly received by Bullseye, cancelled the Policy effective October 1, 2015 for nonpayment of premiums. (Pls.' 56.1 Resp. at \u00b6\u00b623-29.) The Court notes that while Plaintiffs dispute that the Policy period ended on October 1, 2015, they do not cite any record evidence in support thereof and do not dispute that JRIC cancelled the policy effective October 1, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27). They merely assert that Bullseye paid \"approximately $6375.00 representing \"advance premium' for the policy and therefor at the very lease [sic] the [ ] policy was in effect for a portion of the time period\" during which the acts giving rise to the claims in the Underlying Action occurred. (Pls.' Opp. Mem. at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Underlying Action and History of the Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 1, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Katarina Van Derham (\"Van Derham\"), Cielo Jean Gibson (\"Gibson\"), Gabby Jean Saucedo (\"Saucedo\"), Mariana Davalos (\"Davalos\"), and Chantel Zales (\"Zales\") filed the Underlying Action as plaintiffs against Bullseye and Brennan. According to the complaint therein, the plaintiffs are famous models whose images Bullseye and Brennan used, without their consent or payment therefor, as part of Bulleye's promotions on social media, which images created the appearance that those plaintiffs either worked as dancers at the Scene or otherwise endorsed the business when in fact they neither worked at or endorsed the Scene. The complaint in the Underlying Action alleges the following causes of action: (1) False Endorsement under \u00a7 43 of the Lanham Ac,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1); (2) invasion of privacy under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Civ.%20Rts.%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2050\">\n    N.Y.

Attached to the complaint in the Underlying Action are the following promotions: (1) a Facebook post for the Scene allegedly depicting Van Derham, published on December 1-17, 2015; (2) a Facebook post\n   published on December 14, 2015, allegedly featuring Gibson; (3) a Facebook post published on October 19, 2015, allegedly featuring Saucedo; (4) an image allegedly featuring Davalos, published on the Scene's webpage, undated, and on its Facebook page, published on September 9, 12, 13, and 14, 2015; and (5) a Facebook post published on October 7, 2015, allegedly featuring Zales. According to the docket in the Underlying Action, Bullseye and Brennan were served with process on March 3, 2016. (Pls.' 56.1 Resp. at \u00b6\u00b6 30-33;\n   <em>\n    Van Derham v. Bullseye Restaurant Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 16-490 (E.D.N.Y.) at DE 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bullseye and Brennan instituted a third party action against Neo Producttions Ltd., Michael DelRosso, Brian Gordon and Envato Pty. Ltd., the promoters and/or advertisers hired by Bullseye who it claims were responsible for construction of the advertising, and the management of Bullseye' website and social media posts. Del Rosso asserted as an affirmative defense that he did not produce the promotions at issue but purchased images from a vendor known as Envato Ltd. d/b/a PhotoDune.net (\"Envato\") and provided invoices as support. Although Bullseye had sued Envato in the Underlying Action, it stipulated to their dismissal without prejudice in or about November 2016; according to Plaintiffs they stipulated to the dismissal after \"it was discovered that none of the images at issue in the [Underlying Action] were images held by and licensed to Envato.\" Subsequent to undertaking advertising efforts on behalf of Bullseye, Nuzzi, whom the parties agree was responsible for at least some of the promotion at issue in the Underlying Action, died. (Pls.' 56.1 Resp. at \u00b677-80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Written notice of the Underlying Action was provided by Plaintiffs to JRC on November 1, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   JRIC acknowledged receipt of the claim on November 8, 2016 and asked Plaintiffs to provide any additional information.

JRIC Disclaims Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 7, 2016, JRIC disclaimed coverage for the claims in the underlying Action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citing various policy provision as support therefor, the disclaimer stated (1) it was denying coverage \"for any claims arising from any promoting published either before or after the effective dates of the Policy;\" (2) reserving \"the right to deny coverage to the extent [its] rights were prejudiced by the late notice of claim provided by the Plaintiffs;\" (3) denied coverage \"based on the RECORDING AND DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIAL OR INFORMATION IN VIOLATION OF LAW EXCLUSION;\" (4) denied coverage \"based on the FIDUCIARY EXCLUSION;\" (5) reserved the right to deny coverage to Brennan to the extent he did not qualify as an insured;\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (6) reserved the right to deny coverage based on the \"Knowing Violation of Rights of Another\" and \"Materials Published with Knowledge of Falsity\" exclusions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.' 56.1 Resp. at \u00b6\u00b638-46 (capitalization in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Bullseye's Advertising Practices and Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Prior to his leave of absence, Brennan oversaw all promotions, including arranging for promotions of guest dancers, pursuant to a contact and with their permission, in newspapers. (Pls.' 56.1 Resp. at \u00b616.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During Brennan's leave of absence, Abbatiello oversaw promotions. Abbatiello hired Anthony Nuzzi (d/b/a/ Neo Productions, Ltd.), Del Rosso, and Gordon, whom he met through their patronage of Bullseye to prepare and place advertising and manage Bullseye's website and social media posts. Plaintiffs deny any knowledge that these advertisers were doing anything illegal or in violation of statute in connection with Bullseye's promotions or with use of images in those promotions. According to Abbatiello's deposition testimony neither Nuzzi nor Del Rosso provided advanced copies of promotion prior to publication; he could not recall if Gordon provided advance copies for approval prior to publication. (Pls.' 56.1 Resp. at \u00b617, 53-57; Pls.' 56.1 Counterstatement at \u00b6 2-4, 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During discovery JRIC demanded copies of any and all communications between Bullseye or its representatives and any advertiser. In response Plaintiffs produced invoices and emails regarding the activities of DelRosso and Gordon, including at least one email sent directly to Abbatiello. Although Plaintiff produced these documents in discovery in this matter, they were originally produced by DelRosso in the Underlying Action as part of his initial disclosures pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a). After a search of their various email accounts, Plaintiffs did not find any emails from DelRosso, Gordon, or Nuzzi to Bullseye, Brennan or Abbatiello. No written communications between Bullseye or its representatives and Nuzzi were produced by Plaintiffs to JRIC; according to Plaintiffs they produced all the documents that were in their possession. (Pls.' 56.1 Resp. at \u00b6\u00b6 56-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Bullseye and Brennan instituted a third party action against the promoters and/or advertisers hired by Bullseye who were responsible for construction of the advertising, and the management of Bullseye' website and social media posts. Del Rosso asserted as an affirmative defense that he did not produce the promotions at issue but purchased images from a vendor known as Envato Ltd. d/b/a PhotoDune.net (\"Envato\") and provided invoices as support.

The Parties' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to JRIC, \"[c]overage is barred for the claims of all but one of the five Underlying Plaintiffs by virtue of the date of publication of the advertisements\" as they fall outside the coverage dates of the Policy. In addition, the claims in the underlying action fall squarely within the exclusion barring coverage for any advertising injury arising from the violation of any statute or law and within the fiduciary exclusion. Lastly, it asserts coverage is barred as a matter of law due to Plaintiffs failure to provide timely notice of the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs argue that JRIC did not suffer prejudice as a result of any late notice. They further assert that as some of the claims arguably arise from covered events, JRIC is required to defend the entire action. Lastly, they maintain that the exclusions relied on by JRIC are\n   not applicable to bar the duty to defend and/or to indemnify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Before addressing the arguments raised, it is appropriate to set forth the relevant Policy provisions. It is to this task that the Court now turns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Relevant Policy Provisions.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Section1 of the Policy entitled \"Coverages\" is divided into three parts, only one of is relevant here: Coverage B entitled \"Personal and Advertising Injury Liability.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Personal and Advertising Injury Liability\" coverage applies to \"personal and advertising injury\" caused by an offense arising out of the insured's business \"but only if the offense was committed in the 'coverage territory' during the policy period.\" (Policy\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   at Section 1B(1).) The policy contains the following definition of such injury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Personal and advertising injury\" means injury including consequential \"bodily injury\", arising out of one or more of the following offenses:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   a. False arrest, detention, or imprisonment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   b. Malicious prosecution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   c. The wrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies, committed by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   d. Oral or written publication, in any manner, or material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or services;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   e. Oral or written publication, in any manner of material that violates a person's right of privacy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   f. The use of another's advertising idea in your \"advertisement\" or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   g. Infringing upon another's copyright, trade dress or slogan in your \"advertisement\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Section V(14).) Among other things, the Policy excludes coverage for personal and advertising injury that is (1) caused by the knowing violation of the rights of another; (2) arises out of (a) materials published with knowledge of falsity or (b) materials published prior to the policy period. It also contains the following exclusion provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Distribution of Material in Violation Of Statutes\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"Personal and advertising injury\" arising directly or indirectly out of any action or omission that violates or is alleged to violate:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (1) The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), including any amendment of or addition to such law; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (2) the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, including any amendment of or addition to such law; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (3) Any statute, ordinance, or regulation, other than the TCPA or CAN-Spam Act of 2003, that prohibits or limits the sending, transmitting, communicating or distribution of material or information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Section 1(B) (2) (a)-(c), &amp; (p) (emphasis in original).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Coverage Dates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Relying on the coverage dates, i.e., August 3, 2015 to October 1, 2015, JRIC argues that coverage is barred for the claims of all but one of the plaintiffs in the Underlying Action. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Policy clearly states that it covers only offenses committed during the policy period. Here, the claims of four of the five plaintiffs in the underlying action, viz. Van Derham, Gibson, Saucedo and Zales, relate to Facebook posts occurring after the policy was cancelled. As noted earlier, there is no record evidence to which the Court was directed to support extending the policy period past the date the Policy was cancelled by JRIC. Thus, JRIC is entitled to dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims for coverage as to those four plaintiffs and a declaration that there is no coverage as to the claims of these four plaintiffs in the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   However, at least one of the alleged claims of Davalos, i.e., the publication of her image on Bullseye's Facebook page on September 9, 12, 13, and 14, 2015, occurred during the policy period. As to Davos' claim regarding the undated posting of her image on Plaintiff's webpage, there is at least the possibility of coverage given the lack of a publication date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As the policy coverage dates do not preclude coverage for Davos' claims, the Court will now proceed to address the remainder of JRIC's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Distribution of Materials in Violation of Statute Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Relying upon the third subpart of the exclusion entitled \"Distribution of Materials in Violation Of Statute\" (\"the Statutory Exclusion\"), JRIC argues there is no coverage for the claims asserted in the Underlying Action. According to JRIC as this exclusion \"bar[s] coverage for any advertising injury arising from a federal or state law\" and the common element of all the claims asserted in the underlying action is that their images were misappropriated for give the false impression that they worked or endorsed The Scene and as they did not and were not paid for their images, Bullseye violated federal and state laws. (Def.'s Mem. at 7-8.) The interpretation proffered by JRIC, which would preclude coverage for any violation of state or federal law, appears to be too broad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Given that this exclusion first references the TCPA and CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, a brief discussion of those statutes is in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In general, the CAN-SPAM Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207701\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., prohibits the transmission of commercial electronic mail messages to a protected computer which include header information or subject headings that are materially misleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yahoo!

Insurance Law \u00a7 3420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) an insurer may not deny coverage under a liability policy based on the failure of the insured to give timely notice of claim unless the insurer suffers prejudice as a result of the delay. An insurer is prejudiced if \"the failure to timely provide notice materially impairs the ability of the insurer to investigate or defend the claim,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Insurance%20Law%20%C2%A7%203420\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3420(c)(2)(C). If notice of the claim was given to the insurer within two years of the time required under the policy, then the burden of demonstrating prejudice lies with the insurer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Insurance%20Law%20%C2%A7%203420\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3420(c)(2)(A). General assertions of prejudice, such being deprived of the opportunity to participate in phases of an underlying litigation are insufficient to demonstrate prejudice. \"While [the insurer] need not show there would have been a different outcome, it must identify something it could have done differently in discovery, at summary judgment, or at mediation, or identify different defenses or strategies it could have pursued.\"\n   <em>\n    Harleysville Worcester Ins.

App'x 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94 (2d Cir. 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Here, JRIC claims that the \"nine month delay [measured from the time the action was commenced] in providing it with notice prejudiced it\" as Bullseye \"made no effort to preserve their records\" relevant to the claims in the Underlying Action and thus the plaintiffs in the Underlying Action \"are well positioned to move for inferences against interest due to spoliation of evidence\" prejudicing JRIC's rights. (Def.'s Mem. at 11-12.) The Court is underwhelmed by this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Initially, the Court notes that the starting point of any delay is not measured from when the Underlying Action was commenced but rather from the date Plaintiffs were served with the complaint in the Underlying Action, absent any evidence they had earlier knowledge of the suit. According to the return of service filed in the underlying action, that did not occur until March 3, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Derham v. Bullseye Restaurant Inc.,\n   </em>\n   Civil Action No. 16-490 (E.D.N.Y.) at DE 6.) It is from that date that any delay is measured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Here, there was a delay of eight months in providing notice. Such a delay is untimely as a matter of law, but the question remains as to any resulting prejudice.\n   <em>\n    New York State Elec. &amp; Gas. Corp. v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Century Indem.

No spoliation motion has been made, no less granted, in the\n   Underlying Action. Moreover, any such motion would have to be supported by, among other things, evidence that Bullseye destroyed documents at a time when it was obligated to institute a litigation hold.\n   <em>\n    See generally,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pyskaty v.

Feb. 25, 2019) (\"A party seeking spoliation sanctions must demonstrate: '(1) that the party having control over the evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the time it was destroyed; (2) that the records were destroyed with a \"culpable state of mind\" and (3) that the destroyed evidence was \"relevant\" to the party's claim or defense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that it would support that claim or defense.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"616319\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/229/422/#p430\">\n    229 F.R.D. 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 430 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) ). That the documents that Bullseye produced in this litigation came from discovery it received in the Underlying Action does not necessarily equate to Bullseye having destroyed records after it became aware of the Underlying Action. It is possible that relevant documents were disposed of before the obligation to impose a litigation hold arose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Accordingly, JRIC is not entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that the notice of claim from Bullseye was untimely to the prejudice of JRIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    V. The Fiduciary Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   JRIC maintains that the claims of misappropriation and conversion giving rise to a false endorsement fall within all three sub-parts of the \"Fiduciary Exclusion\" of the Policy. That exclusion reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   This policy does not apply to any claim arising out of\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   1. Coercion, conversion or misappropriation of other's funds or property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   2. Any dishonest, fraudulent, criminal, malicious acts or omissions of the insured, partner or employee or any person for whom you are legally responsible; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   3. Any activities or operations performed in the capacity of a fiduciary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Policy (DE 18-2 at p. 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Turning first to the \"conversion or misappropriation\" subpart, it would appear that in the event such a claim were to succeed, coverage would not exist. Other than disputing that the merits of the claim, Plaintiffs do not contend otherwise. As to the second subpart, there is a question of fact, based on the materials submitted on this motion, as to whether any of the acts or omission alleged were \"dishonest, fraudulent, criminal or malicious,\" as opposed to negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   With respect to the third and final subpart, JRIC asserts that as Abbatiello's activities were performed in the capacity of a fiduciary as he was not only \"the manager of Bullseye and a former owner, but he was acting on behalf of the sole stock holder [sic] of Bullseye when overseeing the promotions at issue in the Underlying Actions.\" (Def.'s Mem. at 9). However, it does not cite any caselaw to support that proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   To determine whether a fiduciary relationship exists between two parties, \"New York law inquires whether one person has reposed trust or confidence in the integrity and fidelity of another who thereby gains a resulting superiority or influence over the first.\"\n   <em>\n    Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Assoc. of Am. v.

Supp. 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349-50 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (citations omitted). And the law in New York is that no fiduciary relationship arises from an employment relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BGC Partners, Inc. v.
