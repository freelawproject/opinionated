Almost a year after\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   , the District updated those laws with new measures confining public carry to people with a special need for self-defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-4506\">\n    D.C.

Four non-D.C. residents arrested and charged under \u00a7\u00a7 22-4504 (before\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   struck it down), as well as 7-2502.01 and 7-2506.01 (before the District revamped its gun laws), who also had their firearms and ammunition seized under 22-4517, and (for one plaintiff) had a car subjected to civil forfeiture under 7-2507.06a bring a putative class action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   asserting claims under the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments. The District asks the Court to dismiss the case, taking aim at this Court's jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and at plaintiffs' claims under Rule 12(b)(6). Its 12(b)(1) motion misses the mark, because plaintiffs have standing and because their claims are neither moot nor precluded. But some of its scattershot 12(b)(6) motion hits the target: although a few of plaintiffs' claims are legally sufficient, most fail as a matter of law or are time barred. So the Court will deny the District's 12(b)(1) motion, but will grant-in-part and deny-in-part its 12(b)(6) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This matter began when D.C. police pulled-over Maggie Smith, a 34-year-old nurse from North Carolina without a criminal record who visited D.C. in June 2014. During the traffic stop, she told the officer-\"as she had been taught [to do] in her\n   gun ownership class\"-that she was carrying a handgun licensed in her home state. 2d Am. Comp. \u00b6 31, ECF No. 50. So police arrested her, seized her firearm under \u00a7 22-4517,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and took her to the D.C. jail, where they strip-searched and held her overnight until the U.S. Attorney charged her under \u00a7\u00a7 22-4504,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then under 7-2502.01\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 7-2506.01.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   A month later, when\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   struck down \u00a7 22-4504, the U.S. Attorney dismissed the case. But pursuant to the division of prosecuting authority outlined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2023-101\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 23-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the D.C. Attorney General recharged Smith under 7-2502.01 and 7-2506.01. Though the District dismissed those charge's seven months later, Smith's gun remains in police custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Soon after the District dropped her charges, Smith filed this suit seeking damages related to her arrest and prosecutions, an injunction expunging and sealing her criminal record, a declaration that her arrest and prosecutions violated her Second and Fifth Amendment rights, and attorneys' fees. And through successive amendments, her complaint grew to include more plaintiffs and claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Police arrested one new plaintiff, Cpl. Frederick Rouse, after housekeeping found two handguns and a scope in his D.C. hotel room. Both handguns were licensed in Maryland, where Rouse-a senior engineer at the Defense Information Systems Agency-resides. After Rouse spent two nights in jail, the D.C. Attorney General charged him with violating \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01 and 7-2506.01. The District eventually dismissed the charges without prejudice at a pretrial status conference, though it had earlier successfully opposed Rouse's motion to dismiss. Despite dismissing the charges, the District held his guns and scope-together worth $ 2050-for another two years before returning them. Thanks to his arrest, Rouse's top-secret security clearance was placed \"under review.\" 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 183.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Police pulled-over another new plaintiff, Gerard Cassagnol, after receiving a tip he had a gun in the car. He volunteered the gun's location to the officers, which was unloaded and properly contained in a locked gun-safe. But he spent two nights in jail before the U.S. Attorney charged him with violating \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504. When the United States dropped the charges post-\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Attorney General reinstated the charges for \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01 and 7-2506.01, and successfully opposed Cassagnol's motion to dismiss before\n   <em>\n    nolle prossing\n   </em>\n   the charges without prejudice. Before this incident,\n   Cassagnol had no criminal record and worked fulltime for a telecommunications company. After his arrest, he lost his job, and D.C. continues to hold his ammunition and firearm, licensed in Maryland and worth approximately $ 500, despite Cassagnol's requests for its return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Police arrested another new plaintiff, Virginia student Delontay Davis, after spotting his firearm during a traffic stop. The District confiscated his car and firearm, strip-searched him, and jailed him for four nights while the U.S. Attorney charged him with violating \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504. When the U.S. Attorney dismissed those charges ten months later, the D.C. Attorney General recharged him under \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01 and 7-2506.01, but dropped the case two months later. Even still, the year-long case against him wrought significant harm. First, police seized Davis's vehicle for civil forfeiture under \u00a7 7-2507.06a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although they returned it two months later in response to Davis's motion under D.C. Superior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Davis had already been forced to drop out of school because he lacked transportation. Second, his $ 400 firearm remains in police custody, four years (and counting) after the District dismissed his charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on these facts, plaintiffs bring ten claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1.

In\n   <em>\n    Hoyte v.

Code \u00a7 48-905.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (repealed 2015), a provision subjecting cars used to transport illegal drugs to civil forfeiture. In July 2015, Judge Cooper dismissed the Fourth Amendment claims and some Fifth Amendment claims. More recently, he allowed plaintiffs' procedural due process claims to proceed as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3), but declined to certify their challenges to the District's retention of forfeited property and to \u00a7 48-905.02 's bond requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Now, the District moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1). First, the District claims plaintiffs lack standing to challenge vehicle seizures under \u00a7 7-2507.06a. In the alternative, the District argues this Court should not consider that challenge because of\n   <em>\n    Hoyte.\n   </em>\n   Next, the District claims two other cases involving a different statute and different plaintiffs preclude these plaintiffs' procedural due process challenge to \u00a7 22-4517. Finally, the District argues the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs' Second and Fifth Amendment challenges to \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The District further moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). It argues plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment challenges fail as a matter of law. It also contends plaintiffs' challenges to \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504 are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983, and fail to state a claim under the Fifth Amendment. Next, the District argues plaintiffs' vehicle-related claims are time barred. Then it argues Rule 41(g) overcomes plaintiffs' procedural due process challenge to the District's seizure of guns and ammunition. Finally, the District argues plaintiffs cannot pursue declaratory or injunctive relief nullifying their arrests and sealing any related arrest and prosecution records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Ultimately, that motion fails: plaintiffs have standing to challenge the laws that enabled the District to seize their cars, take their guns, and subject them to criminal prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Next, the Court surveys the District's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), which a layman might deem an attempt to kill plaintiffs' complaint by a thousand cuts. Although the District successfully minces seven claims, three survive: plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment challenge to the District's continued seizure of their guns and ammunition; plaintiffs' Second Amendment challenge to \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504 ; and plaintiffs' equal protection and right-to-travel challenge to \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01,\n   7-2506.01, and 22-4504. Plaintiffs may also continue pursuing declaratory and injunctive relief nullifying their arrests and sealing related records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

First, the District claims plaintiffs lack the required injury-in-fact to confer standing to challenge vehicle seizures under \u00a7 7-2507.06a because the District did not actually forfeit any plaintiff's car. Alternatively, the District argues claim-splitting precludes this Court from considering that challenge given\n   <em>\n    Hoyte\n   </em>\n   's pending challenge to another D.C. civil forfeiture law. Next, the District claims two other cases rejecting challenges to the District's seizure of property incident to arrest * preclude plaintiffs' present challenge to the District's seizure of guns and ammunition under \u00a7 22-4517. Finally, the District argues the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs' Second or Fifth Amendment challenges to \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504, either because plaintiffs' lack standing or because their claims are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   But the District errs at each step. Plaintiffs have standing to challenge vehicle seizures under \u00a7 7-2507.06a: by temporarily seizing Davis's car under color of \u00a7 7-2507.06a, the District caused him to suffer a redressable injury. And claim-splitting does not block those challenges, since\n   <em>\n    Hoyte\n   </em>\n   concerns a different civil forfeiture law. Relatedly, because plaintiffs did not participate in other cases challenging the District's seizure of property incident to arrest, those cases do not preclude their challenge to \u00a7 22-4517. Additionally, plaintiffs have standing to challenge \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504 because their prosecutions under those statutes caused them to suffer redressable injuries. And finally, repealing \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504 did not moot plaintiffs' claims for declaratory relief since the superseded laws still harm one named plaintiff and since plaintiffs seek more than a declaration concerning the repealed laws' constitutionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Because the District intended to forfeit Davis's car under \u00a7 7-2507.06a, plaintiffs can challenge that statute.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The District argues plaintiffs lack standing to pursue Second and Fourth Amendment challenges to the District's seizure of cars used to transport guns under its civil forfeiture scheme. As the District points out, although Davis alleges the District seized his car to forfeit it, the District ultimately changed its mind, returning it sixty days later following Davis's Rule 41(g) motion. So the District narrowly argues that plaintiffs lack the requisite injury-in-fact to establish standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Not so. After all, plaintiffs allege the District seized Davis's car to forfeit it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 306-07, 313, 315. In the best case, that seizure might be temporary (if the District gets cold feet); in the worst case, it's permanent (if the District effectuates forfeiture).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3578544\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/154/118/#p124\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Davis got lucky-the District's seizure was temporary. But he suffered an injury all the same: the temporary dispossession forced him to drop out of school since he couldn't get to class for half the semester. And that injury gives him standing to challenge \u00a7 7-2507.06a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In other words, because the District's seizure of Davis's car under \u00a7 7-2507.06a caused him to drop out of school, he has an injury-in-fact sufficient to confer standing to contest \u00a7 7-2507.06a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Claim-splitting does not bar plaintiffs' challenges to \u00a7 7-2507.06a because\n    <em>\n     Hoyte\n    </em>\n    concerns a different D.C. civil forfeiture statute.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because a potentially overlapping class action is already challenging D.C.'s civil forfeiture scheme, the District argues the rule against claim-splitting divests this Court's jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs' \u00a7 7-2507.06a challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Our court of appeals has never acknowledged the rule against claim-splitting, a silence reflecting that \"dismissal on this ground\" is not a jurisdictional matter but rather a prudential \"matter of docket management\" allowing districts courts to \"dispense with duplicative litigation.\" 18 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 4406 (3d ed. 2019).

Yet regardless of whether they applied the rule in a given case, all seem to agree that courts can discretionally dismiss claims from subsequent actions for claim-splitting if the claims \"may still be advanced in the first action.\" Wright et al., \u00a7 4406 n.20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This rule does not easily scale to the class action setting. How should it work here, where plaintiffs raise claims similar-but-not-identical to claims raised in\n   <em>\n    Hoyte\n   </em>\n   , a pending, potentially overlapping class action? Plaintiffs argue Davis's ability to opt-out of any proposed settlement in\n   <em>\n    Hoyte\n   </em>\n   \"cuts through the [claim-splitting] tangle ... like Alexander's sword slicing through the Gordian knot.\" Pls.' Opp'n 2, ECF No. 56. But what if the District does not offer to settle\n   <em>\n    Hoyte\n   </em>\n   ? Alternatively, the District argues \"[w]hether the plaintiff's claim was actually raised in the [previous] action is immaterial; what matters is that the Plaintiff could have raised the claim [there].\" Def.'s Mot. 9 n.6 (alterations in original) (emphases and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Koker v. Aurora Loan Servicing, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4300653\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/915/51/#p62\">\n    915 F. Supp. 2d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62 (D.D.C. 2013) ), ECF No. 53. And true enough, Davis did briefly seek to intervene as a named plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Hoyte.\n   </em>\n   Should he have stayed the course and attempted to advance his \u00a7 7-2507.06a claim there?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court need not split that atom. Rather, the obvious differences between this case and\n   <em>\n    Hoyte\n   </em>\n   sufficiently discourage discretionarily dismissing plaintiffs' claims. First, the law at issue here (\u00a7 7-2507.06a) only subjects conveyances to forfeiture; the law at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hoyte\n   </em>\n   (\u00a7 48-905.06) prescribes forfeiture of conveyances; real estate; manufacturing equipment; \"all property which is used, or intended for use, as a container\" for controlled substances;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"books, records, and research products and materials\"; \"cash or currency\"; and anything else \"of value furnished or intended to be furnished in exchange for a controlled substance ..., all proceeds traceable to such an exchange, and all moneys, negotiable instruments, or securities used or intended to be used to facilitate any violation\" of the District's controlled substances laws. \u00a7 48-905.02(a). So even though \u00a7 7-2507.06a expressly grafts itself onto \u00a7 48-905.02 's procedural requirements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7-2507.06a(d) (\"Except as otherwise expressly provided by this section, all seizures and forfeitures of conveyances under this section shall follow the procedures set forth in \u00a7 48-905.02.\"), the latter's vastly expanded substantive scope poses constitutional questions of a different kind.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, who knows whether plaintiffs could have advanced their \u00a7 7-2507.06a challenge in\n   <em>\n    Hoyte\n   </em>\n   ? To be sure, Davis-along with several other individuals-briefly sought to intervene as named plaintiffs in that case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Intervene,\n   <em>\n    Hoyte v. Gov't of the District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-569 (D.D.C. Feb. 9, 2017), ECF No. 109. But a month later, he-but not his other co-movants-withdrew his intervention motion before the court had a chance to rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice,\n   <em>\n    Hoyte\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-569 (D.D.C. March 5, 2017), ECF No. 119. Perhaps he respected the practical concerns the District identified in opposition to his proposed intervention, not least the delay caused by further stretching a case with more than a dozen named plaintiffs already.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n 5-8,\n   <em>\n    Hoyte\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-569 (D.D.C. Feb. 23, 2017), ECF No. 115. Perhaps he thought distinctions between \u00a7\u00a7 7-2507.06a and 48-905.02 left him not sufficiently similarly situated to\n   <em>\n    Hoyte\n   </em>\n   's proposed class. Whatever the reason, this Court will not penalize him for abandoning his uncertain attempt to shoehorn his \u00a7\u00a7 7-2507.06a challenge into a case about 48-905.02. Claim-splitting does not bar plaintiffs' \u00a7 7-2507.06a challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Because plaintiffs did not participate in\n    <em>\n     Jenkins\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Melton\n    </em>\n    , those cases do not preclude their procedural due process challenge to \u00a7 44-2517.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The District further argues two prior cases with different plaintiffs preclude these plaintiffs' procedural due process challenge to the District's seizure of their handguns and ammunition without notice and a hearing. In the first,\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-118, Judge Cooper held \"due process does not require a prompt hearing ... for individuals to challenge the seizure and retention of their vehicles for evidentiary purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206211103\">\n    2017 WL 6211103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D.D.C. Mar. 28, 2017). In the second,\n   <em>\n    Melton v.

Mar. 28, 2017). Coincidentally, plaintiffs' counsel here also represented plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Melton\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   But critically, the District concedes these plaintiffs did not participate in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Melton\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In other words, the District tries to wield offensive, nonmutual collateral estoppel against a plaintiff not part of the prior case. Yet even if this Court could ignore distinctions between this case and\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Melton\n   </em>\n   (neither involved guns), the District's claim would still fail, since that's not how collateral estoppel works.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    National Black Police Association\n   </em>\n   , the D.C.

Plaintiffs ask the Court to declare their arrests and prosecutions \"legal nullities,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 328, relief helpful to avoid \"having to respond affirmatively to the familiar question, 'Ever been arrested?' on application, employment, and security forms.\"\n   <em>\n    Hedgepeth v.

Additionally, plaintiffs' vehicle-related Second Amendment challenges are time barred. And because Rule 41(g) provides adequate post-deprivation safeguards, plaintiffs' procedural due process challenge to the District's seizure of guns and ammunition stumbles from the start.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   But none are knockouts. Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment challenge to the District's continued seizure of their guns and ammunition after dismissing their criminal charges may proceed. So too can plaintiffs' Second and Fifth Amendment challenges to \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504 : both are cognizable under \u00a7 1983, and their Fifth Amendment allegations bear out equal protection and right-to-travel deprivations. And plaintiffs may continue pursuing injunctive and declaratory relief nullifying their arrests and sealing related records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

At the time, \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504 were on the books, and police had abundant probable cause to believe plaintiffs had violated them-Smith and Cassagnol each admitted they had a gun; police saw Cpl. Rouse and Davis's guns in plain sight. After all, \"[p]olice are charged to enforce laws until and unless they are declared unconstitutional,\" and \"[s]ociety would be ill-served if its police officers took it upon themselves to determine which laws are and which are not constitutionally entitled to enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    DeFillippo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179569\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/31/#p33\">\n    443 U.S. at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179569\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/31/#p33\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So to the extent plaintiffs ask whether their arrests under \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504\n   violated the Fourth Amendment, the Court answers \"no\" as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   But plaintiffs challenge more than just their arrests. They also challenge their overnight detentions (the other part of claim two); the ongoing seizure of their guns and ammunition (claims five and six); and the two-month seizure of Davis's car (claims eight and ten). The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable seizures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend. IV. So was it unreasonable for the District to seize Smith for one night, Cpl. Rouse and Cassagnol for two nights, and Davis for four nights? Was it unreasonable to seize Davis's car for purposes of civil forfeiture? Or to continue holding it after searching and processing it for evidence? Was it unreasonable to seize their guns and ammunition under \u00a7 22-4517 ? What about after dismissing the charges against them?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the first four questions, the Court still answers \"no.\" First, given the ample probable cause that plaintiffs had violated \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504, the District reasonably detained them after their arrests. To be sure, the Fourth Amendment requires a prompt \"judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    Gerstein v.

If so, the Court cannot confidently say at the motion-to-dismiss stage that whatever governmental interest \u00a7 22-4517 serves (the District never explains) outweighs such a long and significant intrusion on plaintiffs' possessory rights.

Specifically, plaintiffs argue the scheme infringes on their rights to possess a handgun for individual self-defense, to equal protection, and to travel interstate. The District counters that these claims aren't cognizable under \u00a7 1983 since plaintiffs' arrest and\n   prosecutions passed independent constitutional muster.

True enough, the laws seem generally applicable at first glance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Section 7-2502.01(a) made it unlawful to \"possess or control any firearm, unless the person ... h[e]ld[ ] a valid registration certificate for the firearm.\" Section 7-2506.01(a)(3) similarly criminalizes \"possess[ion of] ammunition in the District of Columbia unless ... [you are] the holder of the valid registration certificate for a firearm.\" And \u00a7 22-4504(a) barred everyone from \"carry[ing] within the District of Columbia either openly or concealed on or about their person, a pistol, or any deadly or dangerous weapon capable of being so concealed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   But \u00a7 7-2502.02 is the rub. That statute's subsection (a)(4)(C) decreed that a D.C. \"registration certificate shall not be issued for\" a pistol unless the registrant \"seeks to register [the] pistol for use in self-defense within that person's home.\" In other words, \u00a7 7-2502.02 did not provide an avenue for people without a home in D.C. to register guns in D.C.

So the Court will deny the District's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Additionally, plaintiffs state some legally sufficient claims under the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments. Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment challenge to the ongoing seizure of their guns and ammunition; their Second and Fifth Amendment challenges to \u00a7\u00a7 7-2502.01, 7-2506.01, and 22-4504 ; and their pursuit of injunctive and declaratory relief nullifying their arrests and sealing related arrest and prosecution records may advance. But their other Fourth Amendment challenges fail, as do their Second Amendment challenges to vehicle seizure and forfeiture, and their procedural due process challenge to the District's seizure of their guns and ammunition. So the Court will grant-in-part and deny-in-part the District's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Simply put, claims two, four, five, seven, eight, nine, and ten will be dismissed with prejudice.
