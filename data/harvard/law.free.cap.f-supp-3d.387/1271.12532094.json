After careful consideration of the law and the parties' briefs, docs. 49, 52, 59, 60, 68, 69, the court finds that BWR's motion is due to be granted in part, and Drummond's motion is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Due to the length of this opinion, a brief roadmap may be helpful to the reader. Sections I and II, which do not address the specific contentions in this case, outline the\n   standard of review and the statutory and regulatory framework, respectively. Section III outlines the factual and procedural background of this dispute. In section IV, the court turns to the parties' respective contentions, beginning in subsection A with BWR's contention that it has established that Drummond has engaged in unpermitted discharges in violation of \u00a7 402 of the CWA. After finding for BWR in part-specifically, as to the acid mine drainage (\"AMD\") discharges into Locust Fork and the point sources, the court addresses in subsections B - E Drummond's various arguments in support of its motion for summary judgment, beginning with the statute of limitations defense. Finally, subsections F and G address the parties' respective contentions in support of their motions on the RCRA claim. Ultimately, the court concludes in section V that only BWR's motion related to AMD discharges into Locust Fork is due to be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In August 1953, the Maxine Mine began operation as an underground coal mine pursuant to a contract between the Alabama By-Products Corporation (ABC), and the Alabama, Georgia, and Gulf Power Companies. Doc. 50-3 at 41-42, 50-8 at 103-24. The surface portion of this mine was on land adjacent to the Locust Fork, a navigable-in-fact tributary of the Black Warrior River. Docs. 53-6 at 24; 53-2 \u00b6 8. Over the course of its operation, the Maxine Mine site included multiple mining refuse and rock disposal areas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 50-1 at 69-73, 119. The mining refuse pile\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   at issue in this case was originally created in the early 1950s on a ridge adjacent to the Locust Fork.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 53-6 at 24, 26; 50-1 at 119. The pile is composed of coarse rock\n   refuse, coal fragments, sandstone, shale, and washer rock removed and deposited by ABC during the course of its operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 53-6 at 47; 55-2 at 16; 61-9 \u00b6 13. The pile is either geologic overburden, hence the \"GOB\" or \"GOB pile\" reference,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , consisting of rock above or below the mine coal seams, as defined by Gordon Johnson, doc. 53-6 at 26, or according to Drummond's expert Lois George, it is \"inter-burden,\" doc. 61-9 \u00b6 13; 54-14 at 18, which BWR's expert Johnson explains consists of rock \"within the mined seams,\" doc. 53-6 at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Over the course of the operation of Maxine Mine, ABC repeatedly worked with state regulators and environmental consultants to address the ongoing issue of acidic water that discharged from the refuse pile into the Locust Fork.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 55-3 at 2; 55-4 at 2; 55-5 at 2; 55-1 at 28; 53-1 at 23; 55-21 at 5. For instance, in 1979, pursuant to the SMCRA, the Alabama Surface Mining Reclamation Commission (ASMRC, later known as ASMC) issued a notice of violation (NOV) to ABC concerning discharges of water with low pH and elevated iron and manganese levels from a portion of the refuse pile. Doc. 50-2 at 78-80. ABC subsequently retained environmental consultants P.E. LaMoreaux &amp; Associates (\"PELA\") to address the NOV, doc. 50-2 at 115-17, which the ASMC ultimately vacated and referred instead to the Alabama Water Improvement Commission (AWIC) for action, doc. 50-3 at 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 1982, ABC submitted an application to ASMC for a mining permit and a supplement to this permit application, which contained a supplemental permit map featuring a portion of the refuse pile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 50-1 at 119; 50-11 at 14-16. In February 1983, ASMC approved ABC's plan for reclamation of a western portion of the refuse pile, and ordered ABC to post a bond. Doc. 50-8 at 58. The plan involved covering the surface of this portion of the refuse pile with clay, planting vegetation, and constructing a \"diversion ditch\" to carry surface-runoff from the old refuse pile through a sediment basin and into the Locust Fork.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 50-1 at 71-72. Subsequently, ABC reclaimed this portion of the refuse pile (referred to in ABC and Drummond documents as the \"post-law\" area because it post-dated the SMCRA) by capping it with clay, sloping it, and planting vegetation. Docs. 54-14 at 45; 55-1 at 45. However, the eastern portion of the refuse pile adjacent to the Locust Fork-referred to as the \"pre-law\" area-was never permitted or reclaimed by ABC or Drummond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 50-11 at 45; 54-14 at 45.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   During its operation of the mine, ABC installed or improved ditches that ran through the refuse pile, and constructed basins and dams, as part of a drainage system from the refuse pile. Doc. 61-9 \u00b6 20. Specifically, ABC built two dams, one upstream of the other, and sediment basins upstream of each dam to capture sediment from the refuse area. Docs. 53-1 at 30-32; 54-14 at 24-25;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   docs. 53-6 at 74; 55-11; 55-12. These dams and sediment basins were built over an intermittent stream that discharged into the Locust Fork, a stream that BWR refers to as \"Tributary 1\" or \"T1.\" Doc. 53-6 at 74;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   docs. 55-1 at 15, 17; 55-17 at 2; 54-14 at 24-25; 55-12. At least as far back as 1946, a slough existed at the confluence of this stream and Locust Fork and, by 1975, this stream had intermittent flow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 53-6 at 31; 54-1 at 21-22; 54-3 at 20; 61-9 \u00b6 11; 54-3 at 20; 61-9 \u00b6 11(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In September 1983, ABC ceased coal mining operations at Maxine Mine. Doc. 50-2 at 100. Thereafter, in March 1985, ASMC issued an order stating that ABC had \"substantially completed reclamation\" at the \"old coal processing waste disposal area\" and that ABC's \"corrective action and reclamation activities have effectively eliminated any contribution of non-permissible effluent\" from the area, but that \"there remains remedial corrective action necessary ... on certain areas.\" Doc. 50-8 at 52. ABC subsequently merged with Drummond, making Drummond the permittee for the mine and the \"post-law\" portion of the refuse pile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 55-1 at 29, 31-32; 50-3 at 43, 68. Finally, ASMC approved a final bond release for Drummond's permit for the mine in May 1992. Doc. 50-9 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In 1988, ADEM reissued an existing NPDES permit to Drummond, which covered an outfall in the refuse pile that discharged to an \"unnamed tributary of Locust Fork.\" Doc. 50-4 at 41; 55-24. In June 1992, ASMC granted final Phase II and III bond release for the permitted section of the mine site. Docs. 50-9 at 1-2; 50-4 at 29-30. Then, in July 1992, ADEM released Drummond from monitoring requirements under its NPDES permit. Doc. 50-4 at 27. In March 1993, ADEM inspected the mine and did not find any \"deficiencies or violations,\" stating in its reports that the \"site appears to be totally reclaimed,\" there was \"no discharge at the time of inspection,\" and that \"no deficiencies or violations were noted.\" Doc. 50-5 at 32-33. Since 1992, Drummond has not obtained a permit for the mine site, nor has it performed any maintenance or monitoring of the site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 53-1 at 39-40, 45. Since at least 2009, Drummond employees and other residents of the surrounding areas have used the site for hunting. Doc. 50-11 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The ditches, dams, and basins at the refuse pile ABC constructed still exist today. Doc. 53-6 at 73-76;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   doc. 61-9 \u00b6 20. Currently, the upper and lower sediment basins above the lower dam contain sediment, some of which originated from the refuse area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 53-1 at 29, 33; 54-14 at 17, 24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each dam has an outlet or \"spillway\": the outlet of the upper dam allows surface water to move to the lower sediment basin, and the outlet of the lower\n   dam allows surface water to discharge to the Locust Fork. Doc. 53-1 at 31, 32, 34;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   doc. 55-1 at 17. Man-made ditches drain surface runoff from both the \"post-law\" and \"pre-law\" portions of the refuse pile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 53-6 at 73-74. Surface water also percolates into sediment in the basins and flows as groundwater, where it discharges to the Locust Fork via groundwater seeps. Doc. 53-6 at 74, 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This lawsuit's origins may trace back to May 2006, when Nelson Brooke, the \"Riverkeeper\" for BWR, first identified discolored riprap at the spillway of the lower dam to the Locust Fork and took readings that revealed acidic pH levels at the site. Doc. 50-10 at 3, 25. Brooke took no further action with these samples.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 53-2 \u00b6 11. Instead, Brooke obtained additional samples of discharges at the lower dam spillway in February 2007, October 2011, and four years later in June 2015. Docs. 53-2 \u00b6\u00b6 13-15; 50-10 at 25-26. Thereafter, on June 29, 2016, BWR issued its notice of intent to sue Drummond for violations of the CWA and RCRA. Doc. 24, Ex. A. After the sixty-day notice period, BWR filed this citizen suit alleging CWA violations and, after the ninety-day notice period, amended its complaint to allege RCRA violations. Docs. 1; 21. As a result of the lawsuit, BWR conducted field investigations with Drummond representatives to obtain surface water, groundwater, and sediment samples in September 2016 and August 2017, and conducted a site inspection in June 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 56-1 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; 56-3 at 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court turns now to the parties' respective contentions. Basically, BWR pleads four claims: (1) unpermitted discharges under CWA \u00a7 402 (Count I), (2) unpermitted discharges of dredged or fill material under CWA \u00a7 404 (Count II), (3) unpermitted discharges containing both \"contaminated water\" and dredged or fill material under CWA \u00a7\u00a7 402 and 404 (Count III), and (4) a RCRA endangerment claim (Count IV). Presently before the court are Drummond's motion for summary judgment on all claims, doc. 48, and BWR's motion for partial summary judgment as to liability on its CWA \u00a7 402 claim (Count I) and RCRA claim (Count IV), doc. 51. The court addresses these motions, beginning with Count I on which both parties have moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Alleged Violation of CWA \u00a7 402-Count I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In Count I, BWR asserts that Drummond has violated CWA \u00a7 402 through unpermitted discharges to Locust Fork, \"T1,\" and the \"east\" and \"west\" ditches. To prevail on this claim, BWR must show that Drummond (1) discharged; (2) a pollutant; (3) into waters of the United States (\"WOTUS\"); (4) from a point source; (5) without a permit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9154731\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/386/993/#p1014\">\n    386 F.3d at 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This evidence includes, first, ABC's correspondence with state regulators and numerous reports produced by ABC's consultants, PELA, during the late 1970s and 1980s which describe acid water discharges from the refuse pile.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, according to BWR's expert, Gordon Johnson, the acid-based accounting analysis of his soil/sediment samples taken from various locations at the refuse pile indicate that \"[a]ll mine waste samples are acidic and acid-generating.\" Doc. 54-7 at 4. His conclusion is based, in part, on evidence showing that total sulfide concentrations in the samples were \"below the method detection limit, which indicates the acidification process is either well progressed or complete in the samples that were collected.\" Doc. 54-3 at 35. Third, BWR collected numerous surface water, sediment, and groundwater samples in 2016 and 2017 from various locations at the site, which its experts, Johnson, Anthony Brown, and Barry Sulkin, contend reveal AMD discharges based on the elevated concentrations of numerous metals and low pH in the samples.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 53-6 at 60-61, 76, 79; 54-3 at 25-30; 56-1 at 3-8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, samples of surface water taken below the lower dam that runs into Locust Fork on September 20, 2016, June 12, 2017, and August 1, 2017, contain elevated concentrations of metals and acidic pH levels that Brown and Johnson contend are associated with AMD. Doc. 53-6 at 76. Sulkin also opines that surface water samples, taken near the spillway of the lower dam in September 2016, reflect low pH and \"elevated\" levels of various metals \"far in excess of what would be coming from the unpolluted stream that once flowed there.\" Doc. 56-2 at 6-8. Finally, the water samples taken from below the lower dam in 2016 and 2017 have higher metal concentrations and more acidic pH levels than the background samples from Locust Fork. Doc. 53-6 at 75, 90, 94-96. This evidence is sufficient to establish that AMD discharged from the site into the Locust Fork in September 2016, June 2017, and August 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To no surprise, as one would expect when complex science matters are in issue, Drummond's experts Lynn Sisk, Bruce Wielinga, and Lois George disagree with BWR's experts, and contend that the data does not show AMD discharges. Specifically, Sisk contends that AMD is not discharging from the lower dam at the site because AMD \"usually has some subsurface component associated with it,\" and she asserts that only \"surface runoff\" is discharging over the lower dam. Doc. 50-14 at 17-18. This contention does not alter the court's finding because Sisk admits that she did not take any water or soil samples from the refuse pile to support her conclusion that AMD could not flow over the lower dam.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. For his part, Wielinga contends that findings that sulfide was below the analytical detection limit in Johnson's soil/sediment samples means that there are no \"sulfide-bearing minerals\" in the \"GOB [geologic overburden] waste\" that could generate AMD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 61-6 \u00b6 5; 61-32 at 27-28. Critically, however, Wielinga fails to contest Johnson's explanation that the lack of sulfide indicates the oxidation process that generates AMD is complete. Lastly, Drummond, through its expert George, contends that Brown cannot fairly and accurately testify that surface water \"with elevated concentrations of pollutants associated with AMD\" is ultimately discharged to Locust Fork, given that storm water runoff is \"driven ... by precipitation\" and BWR's samples were taken from \"essentially standing or stagnant points.\" Doc. 61-9 \u00b6 28. This contention also does not alter the court's finding because George and Drummond's other experts do not dispute the validity of BWR's data showing the presence of elevated levels of metals and acidic pH in water samples taken at the lower dam where it discharges into Locust Fork and along the banks of the Locust Fork below the dam. In that respect, while Drummond's experts have shown general weakness in their counterparts' analyses on the issue of AMD, their showing is insufficient to create an issue of fact regarding the discharge of AMD into Locust Fork, a water of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Moreover, the numerous courts that have addressed this issue reached differing results, with some finding that the unpermitted discharge of dredged or fill material under \u00a7 404 constitutes an ongoing violation for as long as the material remains in protected waters,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and others finding that the mere continuing presence of previously discharged pollutants in navigable waters does not constitute an ongoing violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Justice Scalia's concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Gwaltney\n   </em>\n   , joined by two other justices, is instructive in resolving this split.

Noting that \"[m]embers of the public are entitled to assume that public officials will act in accordance with [sic] law,\" the court held that requiring the plaintiff to obtain a \u00a7 404 permit for its work \"would be a retroactive application of the Corps regulations which would result in a 'manifest injustice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Context-Marks Corp\n   </em>\n   ., the Corps issued a cease and desist order to plaintiffs engaged in a fill operation below the MHTL, even though the Corps had not previously required such a permit to fill below the MHTL in that area. 729 F.2d at 1295. The court found that, had the Corps not intervened, the plaintiffs could have developed the land above the MHTL before implementation of the Corps' new regulations requiring permits above the MHTL, and \"thus would have been 'grandfathered' in.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1296. Again, the court held that retroactive application of the Corps' new regulations \"would not be appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Here, however, Drummond has not identified any regulations that would be retroactively applied if the court were to find for BWR on these claims. For that reason, this case-at least with respect to the \u00a7 402 and RCRA claims-is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Buccaneer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Context-Marks\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Drummond does not disagree with this general point. Rather, Drummond contends that, because it reasonably relied on state regulators' assurance that it did not need a permit for discharges to Locust Fork, a finding now by this court to the contrary would result in a \"manifest injustice.\" To support its contention, Drummond cites first to an internal ABC memo from November 1980 that indicates that, as part of a discussion about the \"Maxine runoff problem,\" a representative from AWIC discussed with an ABC executive the possibility of \"a filter dam and cutting a direct channel from the upper dam to the river.\" Doc. 50-2 at 52. Second, Drummond cites a July 12, 1983 inspection report from an ASMC inspector that appears to state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Water sample taken at rock filter dam &lt; 3.0.... Have had continuing meetings with legal division and ABC on this problem. Has also been referred to ADEM-this is not an NPDES discharge point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Doc. 50-9 at 18. Third, Drummond references handwritten comments on an internal memo on July 26, 1983 from an ABC representative that state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Bill Gibson [an ADEM inspector] insinuated that NPDES permits may be required for the limestone filter and the diversion ditch (draining recent reclaimed area) at the No. 1 dam. As I understand it, this was not part of the agreement as signed by Joe Myers [of ADEM].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Doc. 50-8 at 42. Finally, Drummond points to handwritten notes from a meeting between ABC and ADEM representatives on September 2, 1983 that indicate that the parties discussed the \"filter dam\" at the refuse pile and an earlier meeting with AWIC, where the notes state, \"filter structure to get away from point source.\" Doc. 50-8 at 54-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   To begin, these instances are distinguishable from the Corps' communications in\n   <em>\n    Buccaneer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Context-Marks\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, the record is not as clear cut as Drummond contends on this point. For example, it is not clear that ADEM, the state agency with primary authority to issue NPDES discharge permits, informed ABC that it did not need to obtain an NPDES permit for discharges from the refuse pile into Locust Fork. The July 12, 1983 inspection report, which suggests that the dam \"is not an NPDES discharge point,\" was written by an ASMC inspector with no regulatory authority under the CWA. It is also not clear what \"agreement\" is referred to in ABC's July 26, 1983 internal memo, but the fact that an ADEM inspector implied that NPDES permits might be required for the lower dam and \"diversion ditch\" in the refuse pile cuts against Drummond's reliance argument. Indeed, ADEM ultimately required ABC to obtain an NPDES permit for an outfall in the refuse pile that discharged into an \"unnamed tributary of Locust Fork,\" i.e. the west ditch in the refuse pile, which also undermines the reliance argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 55-24 at 34-35; 55-1 at 42-43. Accordingly, based on the record, Drummond has not established that it is entitled to summary judgment on the CWA \u00a7 402 and RCRA claims on a reasonable reliance theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Drummond has an arguably better argument with respect to the alleged discharges of \"fill material\" into \"T1\" and Locust Fork. Drummond points here to specific Corps regulations which, it contends, would be retroactively applied if this court were to grant relief on BWR's section 404 claims. Under CWA \u00a7 404, the Corps' pre-2002 definition of \"fill material\" excluded unpermitted discharges that were for the \"primary purpose\" of waste disposal. 42 Fed.Reg. 37,122, 37,130 (July 19, 1977). Corps regulations indicate that \"mine overburden\" and \"material such as soil, rock, and earth\" constituted \"waste\" under this prior regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   67 Fed.Reg. 31129, 31133 (May 9, 2002). Still, these facts do not establish, at this juncture of the case, a manifest injustice for multiple reasons. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Buccaneer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Context-Marks\n   </em>\n   , Drummond has not cited to documents showing any communications with the Corps concerning the drainage system, nor have they provided evidence that any ABC or Drummond representative relied on the pre-2002 regulation. Rather, AWIC, the predecessor to ADEM, approved ABC's 1976 plans to construct ditches and a dam to \"correct the siltation problem\" at the refuse pile, referring to the siltation of Locust Fork from the refuse pile. Docs. 50-8 at 25-30; 50-3 at 8. ABC appears to have conceived its plans in response to a notice from AWIC that ABC was in violation of \"AWIC permit conditions and Alabama's pollution control law,\" but there is no mention of the CWA in AWIC's notice. Doc. 50-8 at 31. Moreover, it was AWIC,\n   rather than the Corps, that approved ABC's 1981 \"pollution abatement\" plan to construct and extend drainage ditches and channels. Doc. 50-2 at 19-20. Finally, as BWR notes, its CWA \u00a7 404 claim is for ongoing discharges of sediment from the refuse pile, as well as the continuing presence of sediment and dams in \"T1.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 24 \u00b6 68-69;\n   <em>\n    Scheerer v.

Relying in part on topographic maps and aerial photographs, Brown estimates the volumes of \"GOB waste\" at the refuse pile that have eroded via a \"central channel,\" or \"east\" ditch, in the refuse pile into the sediment basins contained in \"T1\" and into Locust Fork directly. Doc. 53-6 at 71-73.

Doc. 54-3 at 25, 39, 40. However, Drummond's expert Lois George contests these conclusions, contending that Brown's analysis of the volumes of \"GOB\" placement and waste sediment is \"speculative\" and \"erroneous,\" and that Brown's interpretations of aerial photography and topography in estimating the amount of eroded waste sediment are inaccurate. Doc. 61-9 at 21. Also, George contends that Johnson's descriptions of eroded \"mine waste\" based on Johnson's field inspection are unclear and speculative because Johnson fails to define the term \"granular,\" and fails to recognize that natural soil lacks organic content and that not all \"GOB\" is rust-colored in the refuse pile.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    These opinions refuting the evidence of sediment eroding from the refuse pile directly to Locust Fork establish the existence of disputed issues of material fact on this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    The 2015 Clean Water Act Rule amended the regulatory definition of \"tributary,\" \"more precisely defin[ing] 'tributaries' as waters that are characterized by the presence of physical indicators of flow-bed and banks and ordinary high water mark-and that contribute flow directly or indirectly to a traditional navigable water.\" 80 Fed.Reg. 37054, 37058,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203930456\">\n     2015 WL 3930456\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (June 29, 2015).
