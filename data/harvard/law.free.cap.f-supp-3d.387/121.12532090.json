As the D.C.

Mr. Bundy does not explain why his claims can escape this general rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In any event, equitable tolling is available to a party \"only if he shows (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\"\n   <em>\n    Menominee Indian Tribe of Wis. v.

The District has provided-by statute-for tolling based on imprisonment in some instances. But it decided not to toll the statute of limitations when a right of action accrues\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   a plaintiff is incarcerated. Because the District has expressly provided for tolling when a plaintiff is imprisoned, the D.C. Council presumably intended that tolling based on imprisonment in other circumstances is unavailable.

Mr. Bundy does not challenge this assertion.\n     <em>\n      See generally\n     </em>\n     Pl.'s Mem. at 6-8.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-65\">\n     The Complaint alleges that Attorney General Sessions \"condoned\" the decision to prosecute by appealing the dismissal of the criminal case. Compl. \u00b6 11. But as discussed above, General Sessions enjoys absolute prosecutorial immunity for such an \"unquestionably advocatory\" decision.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Moore\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5709149,7410663\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/65/189/\">\n      65 F.3d at 194\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-66\">\n     As for the rest of the allegations, the Court finds that Mr. Bundy's claims against Attorneys General Sessions and Holder are implausible because they were even not in office when federal authorities indicted Mr. Bundy. Common sense requires the Court to reject allegations that these officials, who did not work for the Department of Justice at the time, were somehow personally involved in the decision to bring federal charges, in retaliation or otherwise.\n     <em>\n      Cf.\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Iqbal\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n      556 U.S. at 679\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n      129 S.Ct. 1937\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is \"a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\").\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
