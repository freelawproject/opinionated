BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff James Kroessler filed a putative consumer class action complaint against Defendant CVS Health Corporation on February 7, 2019, alleging false and misleading advertising of Defendant's CVS Health glucosamine joint health products. [Doc.

According to Plaintiff, however, the Products do not support or benefit the health of human joints because glucosamine, the primary ingredient\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in each of the Products, either alone or in combination with other ingredients, is not effective at supporting or benefitting joint health.

[Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 11.] Plaintiff contends that the product he purchased, like all of the Products at issue, do not provide the promised, advertised benefits. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Had he known the truth about Defendant's alleged misrepresentations and omissions at the time of purchase, Plaintiff asserts he would not have purchased the product. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Further, the complaint alleges Defendant expressly and impliedly advertises that the Products treat and provide relief from symptoms of osteoarthritis, including joint pain and joint stiffness. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.] Plaintiff contends the front labeling for each of the Products is materially identical and communicates the same advertising message of joint health benefits. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22.] In support of his allegations, Plaintiff cites to numerous clinical trials and studies which he alleges demonstrate that the Products' primary ingredients, specifically glucosamine, alone or in combination with other ingredients in the Products, are ineffective at supporting or benefiting joint health.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss on the following grounds: (1) Plaintiff's CLRA and UCL state law claims are preempted by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\") as amended by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (\"NLEA\"); (2) Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue injunctive relief; (3) Plaintiff only purchased one of the six Products identified and therefore lacks standing to assert any claims, including any putative class claims, relating to Products he did not purchase; and (4) the complaint fails to state a claim under the CLRA and UCL because it is not pled with specificity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) ; Defendant also moves to strike Plaintiff's multistate class allegations because Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts connecting non-California putative class members' claimed injuries to California, and because the multistate class definition violates due process. The Court first addresses whether Plaintiff's claims are expressly preempted under the NLEA and holds that Plaintiff's claims are expressly preempted. Therefore, the Court does not reach Defendant's motion to dismiss on its remaining grounds and Defendant's motion to strike is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Structure/function claims must meet three requirements: (1) the manufacturer has substantiation that the statement is truthful and not misleading; (2) the statement contains a prominent disclaimer that the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has not evaluated the statement and that the product \"is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease\"; and (3) the statement itself does not \"claim to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent\" disease.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20343\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (r)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant contends that the challenged Representations are all permissible structure/function claims that comply with federal labeling requirements for dietary supplements, meaning Plaintiff's state law false advertising claims are expressly preempted. [Doc. No. 9-1 at 19-20.] Plaintiff counters that (1) the Representations are not proper structure/function claims because they suggest effects on characteristic signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis ; and (2) regardless of whether the Representations are structure/function claims or disease claims, the Representations are false and misleading and therefore his state law claims are not inconsistent with the federal requirements.

The Representations at issue\n   include: \"JOINT HEALTH,\" \"Supports flexibility &amp; range of motion,\" \"Glucosamine and Chondroitin help support and maintain the structure of joints,\" \"Glucosamine and Chondroitin work to support joint comfort while helping to promote joint mobility.\" Plaintiff alleges Defendant's Representations are improper structure/function claims because they suggest effects on characteristic signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Plaintiff contends that the FDA noted that \"reduces joint paint\" is a disease claim and the FDA has issued warning letters to advertisers of glucosamine supplements who advertise their products will do things like \"improve joint mobility.\" [Doc. No. 13 at 14-15.] However, the Representations do not purport to \"reduce\" or \"improve\" anything nor do they mention \"joint pain.\" The Representations do not suggest treatment or prevention of a disease and satisfy the requirements under the NLEA for structure/function claims. Therefore, the Representations are proper structure/function claims according to the federal requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Reg.%201000\">\n    65 Fed. Reg. at 1016-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that regardless of whether the Representations are structure/function claims or disease claims, the Representations are false and misleading and therefore his state law claims are not inconsistent with the federal requirements. However, the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Dachauer\n   </em>\n   held that to the contrary it matters very much. \"Plaintiff's argument would vitiate the FDCA's distinction between disease claims and structure/function claims. The FDA allows manufacturers of supplements to make general claims ... and to substantiate them with evidence that a supplement has some structural or functional effect on a given part of the human body.\"\n   <em>\n    Dachauer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519834\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/844/#p847\">\n    913 F.3d. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   848 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Reg.%201000\">\n    65 Fed. Reg. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1012 ). Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Dachauer\n   </em>\n   , where the court held that the NLEA did not preempt plaintiff's claim that the defendant's structure/function claim about immune health was misleading because the supplements\n   <em>\n    increased\n   </em>\n   the risk of all-cause mortality, Plaintiff makes no such claim here. The FDCA regulations state that a food label \"shall be deemed to be misleading if it fails to reveal facts\" that are \"[m]aterial with respect to consequences which may result from use of the article\" under normal conditions of use or the conditions of use that the label prescribes.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.21\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff does not argue that Defendant's Representations are false or misleading because Defendant fails to reveal material facts with respect to consequences from taking Defendant's Products. While Plaintiff cites to numerous studies and clinical trials to demonstrate that glucosamine and other primary ingredients in the Products are ineffective at supporting or benefiting joint health, the federal requirements only require that the manufacturer has \"substantiation that the statement is truthful and not misleading.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20343\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (r)(6). The FDCA does not define the term \"substantiation,\" however FDA guidance advances a common sense interpretation of \"substantiation,\" as meaning \"competent and reliable scientific evidence.\" See\n   <em>\n    Kaufman v. CVS Caremark Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354916\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/88/#p93\">\n    836 F.3d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93 (1st Cir. 2016). Plaintiff's citation to studies does not equate to Defendant lacking competent and reliable scientific evidence of its own that establishes the necessary substantiation. Furthermore, California law does not allow private plaintiffs to demand substantiation for advertising claims.\n   <em>\n    Dachauer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519834\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/844/#p847\">\n    913 F.3d. at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's breach of express warranty claim is premised on the same theory that the Representations are false and misleading. However, because Defendant's Representations are proper structure/function claims as permitted by the federal requirements, Plaintiff's\n   breach of express warranty claim would also seek to impose state-law requirements that differ from the federal requirements. Accordingly, Plaintiff's state law false advertising claims under the CLRA, UCL, and breach of express warranty are preempted and therefore are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED with prejudice\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
