Plaintiffs, Helsinn Healthcare S.A. (\"Helsinn\") and Roche Palo Alto LLC (\"Roche\") (collectively, \"plaintiffs\"), are assignees of U.S. Patents No. 7,947,724 (\"the '724 patent\"), No. 7,947,725 (\"the '725 patent\"), No. 7,960,424 (\"the '424 patent\"), and No. 8,598,219 (\"the '219 patent\"). The four patents-in-suit are listed in the FDA \"Orange Book\" as covering plaintiffs' product Aloxi \u00ae, which is a pharmaceutical composition containing the active ingredient palonosetron. The version of Aloxi \u00ae currently marketed by plaintiffs is an intravenous solution with approved indications for preventing or treating cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs brought this action, and related consolidated actions, against generic\n   drug manufacturers, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Ltd., Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc. (\"DRL\"), Sandoz, Inc. (\"Sandoz\"), Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (\"Teva\"). Plaintiffs alleged that each group of defendants had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\"ANDA\") containing so called \"Paragraph IV\" certifications asserting that the claims of the patents-in-suit were invalid and/or not infringed. The asserted claims are claims 2 and 9 of the '724 patent, claim 2 of the '725 patent, claim 6 of the '424 patent, and claims 1, 2, 6, and 7 of the '219 patent. The pertinent limitations of the first three patents are \"reducing emesis...,\" the \"0.05 mg/mL\" concentration, and \"EDTA.\" The pertinent limitations of the '219 patent are \"reduce... cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,\" \"0.25 mg\" dose in \"5 mL... solution,\" and \"EDTA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant Sandoz was dismissed from the action by consent, on December 31, 2014. (Dkt. 247.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court issued a Memorandum Opinion construing certain preamble language in the '219 patent claims, on April 22, 2015. (Dkt. 290.) An 11-day bench trial was conducted in June 2015, with closing arguments presented on August 12, 2015. (Dkts. 320, 322, 324, 326, 328, 330, 331, 337, 340, 342, 344, and 353.) Defendant DRL was dismissed on stipulation on October 16, 2015. (Dkt. 355.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the current parties in this case are plaintiffs and Teva.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Teva asserts that the asserted claims of each of the four patents-in-suit are invalid as obvious under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Teva further asserts invalidity of those patents under the on-sale bar provision of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The on-sale bar issue presents not only underlying factual questions, but also a statutory interpretation question addressing the amended text of \u00a7 102(a)(1) under the America Invents Act (\"AIA\"), Pub.L. No. 112-29 (2011). Teva also raises a written description claim against those patents under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs oppose each of Teva's points on those issues, asserting that the patents are valid and enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   There is also an infringement issue. Teva filed one consolidated ANDA, seeking approval for products at two different dose levels (0.25 mg and 0.075 mg), and two different treatment indications (chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (\"CINV\") for the 0.25 mg dose, and post-operative nausea and vomiting (\"PONV\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   for the 0.075 mg dose). The concentration of both proposed Teva products is 0.05 mg/ml, because the 0.25 mg dose solution is 5 ml and the 0.075 mg dose solution is 1.5 ml. The asserted '219 patent claims only specify a 0.25 mg dose, in a 5 ml volume (i.e., concentration 0.05 mg/ml), for CINV. Plaintiffs assert that if the '219 claims are held to be valid, those claims are infringed by Teva's ANDA filing itself, according to the Hatch-Waxman Act, and therefore both generic products applied for in Teva's ANDA must infringe and be enjoined. Teva disputes plaintiffs' legal position and seeks a declaration that its 0.075 mg dose PONV product will not infringe the asserted '219 patent claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court issued a Memorandum Opinion on November 13, 2015, and entered judgment declaring that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (1) the asserted claims of the '724, '725, and '424 patents are valid and are infringed by both Teva's proposed 0.25 mg and 0.075 mg generic products;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (2) the asserted claims of the '219 patent are valid and are infringed by Teva's proposed 0.25 mg generic product; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (3) the asserted claims of the '219 patent are valid and are not infringed by Teva's proposed 0.075 mg generic product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (Dkt. 360; dkt. 361.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This Supplemental Opinion constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law on the issues of the on-sale bar under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , statutory interpretation of the on-sale bar after the passage of the American Invents Act under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), written description under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court now makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    1. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Medical treatment for emesis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Medical science has long recognized that the human body has an elaborate and multifaceted defense system against trauma and toxins. (Dkt. 328 at 29.) Part of that defense system is called emesis, referring generally to the reflexive reaction experienced as nausea and vomiting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27, 31-32.) Its purpose is essentially to get rid of toxins in the body. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The parties presented undisputed medical background information on the scientific field of the claimed inventions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   dkt. 320; dkt. 324; dkt. 326; dkt. 331; dkt. 337; dkt. 340; dkt. 342; dkt. 344.) For example, Teva's expert clinician Dr. David Frame provided a basic overview of the mechanisms in the body that lead to emesis, at least as related to chemical stimuli.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As he explained, the gastrointestinal tract and the brain are the two primary systems involved in creating emesis. (Dkt. 328 at 25-26.) If a person ingests a toxin directly into the stomach, or if a toxin is injected into the blood, the noxious substances go into the GI tract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.) The GI tract then releases certain molecules called neurotransmitters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Those neurotransmitters will bind to receptors, causing signals to transmit up a nerve called a vagal nerve that leads to a specific spot located in the brain but just outside the blood-brain barrier (the trigger zone or essentially the vomiting center). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When those neurotransmitter signals arrive there, they will activate one or more neurotransmitters\n   that will carry the signal back down the vagal nerve to the GI tract and produce the contractions of nausea and vomiting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Scientists have identified approximately 20 to 30 types of neurotransmitters that play a role in prompting the emesis reaction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.) Those neurotransmitters bind to cells called receptors, found in various places in the body. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.) In other words, several different neurotransmitters and corresponding receptors are involved in most causes of nausea and vomiting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.) Also, depending on what kind of toxic stimulus is introduced, there may be different amounts and types of neurotransmitters activated, and different locations within the body where the corresponding receptors are concentrated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.) All of this is part of that elaborate defense system against various toxic substances that is inherent in the body. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26, 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   One of the neurotransmitters known to play a role in causing emesis is serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.) It can bind to many different types of receptors, but the one that it binds to that is most responsible for nausea and vomiting is a specific \"hydroxytryptophan\" receptor, called the 5-HT3 receptor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.) Indeed, there are different types of hydroxytryptophan receptors, and the number 3 type (the \"5-HT3 receptor\") is known to be specific in binding with serotonin to release those nausea and vomiting signals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Some of the other types of neurotransmitters known to participate in prompting emesis (with corresponding varieties of receptors) are dopamine and something called Substance P that binds to neurokinin receptors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29, 33.) For this reason, among others, clinicians trying to prevent or treat emesis will often use a multifaceted approach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.) Instead of relying on just one type of drug product, they will use a combination of therapies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The pharmaceutical products used in this effort, that target various receptors and their corresponding neurotransmitters, are referred to as \"antagonists.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.) Thus, compounds directed to serotonin and the 5-HT3 receptor are called \"serotonin receptor antagonists\" or \"5-HT3 receptor antagonists.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   There are also timing and toxin factors in selecting \"antiemetic\" therapies. For example, some toxins used in medical treatment, or dosage levels of those toxins, are considered \"highly emetogenic,\" whereas others may be considered \"moderately emetogenic.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 148; dkt. 324 at 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   It is recognized that the onset and duration of emesis may vary, depending on the situation. (Dkt. 328 at 38.) So antiemetic therapy will look at effects in the immediate time period after introduction of a toxin, as well as in the succeeding hours and days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Those time periods are referred to as the \"acute emesis\" period for the first 24 hours, and \"delayed emesis\" thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39.) These time periods are a recognized feature of designing and studying antiemetic care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Another defining concept in the antiemetic field is the distinction between so-called \"post-operative nausea and vomiting,\" or PONV, and \"cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,\" or CINV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both sorts of reactions are encompassed within the general term \"emesis,\" but clinicians typically will select antiemetic therapies with that distinction in mind. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For example, the claims of the '219 patent -in-suit are directed to \"cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.B. The claims of the other three patents-in-suit are directed more broadly to \"emesis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Aloxi \u00ae is the brand name of plaintiffs' antiemetic product, listed in the FDA Orange Book as covered by the four patents-in-suit. The active ingredient in Aloxi \u00ae is palonosetron hydrochloride, which is a serotonin antagonist or so-called 5-HT3 antagonist. It is currently marketed in the United States in the form of an intravenous 0.25 mg dose in 5 ml solution (resulting in palonosetron concentration of 0.05 mg/ml). At that dosage, it has FDA-approved indications for preventing CINV in both moderately and highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including delayed CINV with respect to the moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. (DTX-1244-0002.) A later-approved additional indication is at a one-third lower dosage of 0.075 mg for prevention of PONV, but it is not currently marketed in that form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; dkt 331 at 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The compound Aloxi\u00ae, with its label information, received FDA approval on July 25, 2003, after a lengthy new drug application process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   n. 39\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . The provisional patent application to which the four patents-in-suit claim priority was filed on January 30, 2003. The parties agree that the relevant date for analyzing prior art (as well as for the on-sale bar factual issues) is January 30, 2002.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   n. 61\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . As the discussion in this opinion will demonstrate, the patent validity issues in this case focus heavily upon the history of the Aloxi\u00ae drug development process in that time frame.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The patents-in-suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The four patents-in-suit are each named \"Liquid Pharmaceutical Formulations of Palonosetron.\" They are all composition patents. (Dkt. 290 at 2.) There are other patents and patent applications in the same patent family history. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; dkt. 289.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Each of the patents-in-suit claims priority to the original provisional application date, January 30, 2003, although they have different effective filing dates. (Dkt. 289.) In chronological order of issuance, they are the '724 and '725 patents, issued on May 24, 2011; the '424 patent, issued on June 14, 2011; and the '219 patent, issued on December 3, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   All four patents are subject to terminal disclaimer, and will expire no earlier than July 30, 2024. (Dkt. 361 at 3.) The parties agree that the first three patents are subject to the patent provisions in effect prior to enactment of the AIA, and the '219 patent is subject to the AIA for purposes of this case. In fact, the '219 patent was applied for and granted during the pendency of this litigation. (Dkt. 289.) This case was filed on July 8, 2011. (Dkt. 1.) The effective application date of the '219 patent was May 23, 2013, after the pertinent effective date of the AIA.

For purposes of the obviousness analysis, the focus must be on the state of the art as publicly known; that is, the published prior art and what a skilled artisan would have known.

In sharp contrast, the legal tests for the on-sale bar require a court to look also at facts that were not public; for example, to determine whether the invention was \"ready for patenting\" more than one year before the patent application date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II.A.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   One fact that is pivotal to both the obviousness and the on-sale bar issues is that the provisional application date for all four patents-in-suit was January 30, 2003. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 289.) Therefore, the date of January 30, 2002, is the critical date for purposes of the on-sale bar.

Among the key findings from those studies was that palonosetron \"has a high affinity and specificity for 5-HT3 receptors,\" and \"[p]alonosetron is effective in animal modes of chemically induced emesis by both oral and intravenous routes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0031 to -0032.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Syntex research under its IND progressed through Phase I and Phase II clinical testing of RS-25259. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 320 at 30-32.) The Phase I clinical studies were to determine safety and pharmacokinetics of the palonosetron, by administering it as an intravenous injection to healthy human volunteers. (DTX-0293-0032.) Once the Phase I clinical studies were complete and indicated safety of the drug, Syntex obtained FDA approval and proceeded to Phase II studies, which it worked on through approximately 1995. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0032 to -0035; dkt. 320 at 31-32.) The pharmacokinetic data from the Phase I studies also indicated that \"[t]he mean plasma elimination half-life... was approximately 40 hours in subjects given single IV or oral doses.\" (DTX-0293-0033.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Generally, in a Phase II clinical study, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (\"API\") is administered to actual patients, to continue assessing safety but also to start determining effective dosage levels in humans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 320 at 31.) If Phase II studies are completed and accepted by the FDA, the applicant may request to proceed to Phase III, which is typically a large-scale study conducted with an actual pharmaceutical formulation, including excipients and packaging, involving patients in many locations. In Phase III, the safety and efficacy of the formulation is measured in the patients, and stability and manufacturing quality of the product are tested in samples. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Syntex was acquired by the Roche pharmaceutical organization (\"Roche\") at some time prior to 1995. (Dkt. 320 at 127.) Syntex was then known as Roche Syntex, or officially Roche Palo Alto LLC.

That study started in May 1994. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C202%2C333\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The Final Report of that study was dated July 1995, and signed on September 25, 1995. (DTX-0227-0005, -0016.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The Introduction section of the 2330 study Final Report stated in part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents such as cisplatin are used. Nausea and vomiting may be triggered by the release of... (5-HT) via a cascade of neuronal activation involving both the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. Emesis may be seen acutely (within 24 hours of the start of chemotherapy), after a delay (beginning 24-48 hours after chemotherapy), or even in anticipation of chemotherapy.... With repeat courses of chemotherapy, emesis becomes progressively more difficult to control, although adequate control in the first chemotherapy cycle is more likely to be associated with control of acute emesis in subsequent cycles. Therefore, antiemetic efficacy is generally studied first in chemotherapy-naive patients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   In the United States, currently available antiemetic therapies include either single-drug or combination therapy with phenothiazines, steroids, or metoclopramide (a mixed 5-HT3 and dopaminergic-receptor antagonist), or most recently ondansetron (a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist). All of these therapies must be given as multiple-dose regimens because of their short half-lives, and none is completely effective in preventing the severe nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   RS-25259-197 (hereafter referred to as RS-25259) is a novel, potent, and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. In animal models of chemotherapy-induced emesis, RS-25259 completely inhibits emesis in up to 100% of animals given high-dose cisplatin. In humans, the mean half-life of the drug is approximately 40 hours, whether administered intravenously or orally. Given the high affinity for the receptor, excellent efficacy in animals, and long half-life in humans, a single dose of RS-25259 may control acute chemotherapy-induced emesis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   This was the first randomized, double-blind trial of intravenously administered RS-25259 in chemotherapy-naive cancer patients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   (DTX-0227-0017 to -0018 (footnotes omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The stated objectives of the 2330 study included: \"(1) [to] determine the dose-response relationship among single IV doses of RS-25259 over the dose range 1-90 \u00b5pg/kg....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0014.) The Final Report of the 2330 study concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   RS-25259, administered as a single intravenous bolus injection of 3, 10, 30, or 90 \u00b5pg/kg 30 minutes prior to high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy, was effective in suppressing chemotherapy-induced emesis for 24 hours. All four doses were approximately equally effective as compared with the combined results from a cohort of 0.3 and 1 \u00b5pg/kg.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Based on the results of this study, a dose of 3 \u00b5g/kg or 10 \u00b5g/kg RS-25259 might be appropriate for further development.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0015 to -0016.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The 2330 study Final Report also noted the following pharmacokinetic observations: \"The plasma half-life was exceptionally long for this class of compound, and a few patients demonstrated very long half-lives compared with the other patients.\" (DTX-0227-0016.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   There were, however, significant questions about effective dosage levels remaining at the end of the 2330 study, as described in that same 2330 study Final Report. The Discussion section of the Report stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   A statistically supported dose-response relationship for efficacy... between the lowest dose level of RS-25259 and each subsequent higher dose level was not observed in this study. The statistical analyses, defined prior to study start, were essentially confounded by the relatively high response rate observed among patients who received the lowest dose of RS-25259, namely 0.3-1 \u00b5g/kg. This was not expected and the reasons for this response are unclear. One could perhaps speculate and perform additional statistical tests, but that would be beyond the scope of the preplanned analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   Nevertheless, based on published data that shows that almost all patients who receive high doses of cisplatin experience nausea and vomiting, the results of this study suggest that RS-25259 is an effective agent. Based on clinical observation, a single intravenous bolus injection of 3, 10, 30 and 90 \u00b5g/kg RS-25259 30 minutes prior to cisplatin chemotherapy was effective in suppressing chemotherapy-induced emesis for 12 to 24 hours.... Although no placebo control was incorporated into the design of this study, there appeared to be a step up in efficacy from the combined 0.3-1 \u00b5g/kg dose group to doses of 3 \u00b5g/kg and more. The four highest doses were approximately equally effective when compared with the results from the combined 0.3-1 \u00b5g/kg cohort, suggesting a plateau in the dose response for RS-25259 when administered at a dose greater than 3 \u00b5g/kg. RS-25259 was well tolerated in this study. No safety issues related to RS-25259 were apparent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0055.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   When Helsinn later approached the FDA for permission to commence Phase III clinical trials, these facts and the underlying data reflected in the 2330 study led the FDA to conclude that the 2330 study itself did not provide any reliable dose response data, except possibly at the much higher 30 microgram per kilogram level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.C.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The dosages measured in the Phase II 2330 study were expressed in micrograms of palonosetron per kilogram of patient\n   body weight, i.e., \"weight-based\" measurements, as stated in the above-quoted passage. At trial there was no dispute that the \"3 microgram per kilogram\" figure, expressed in that Report, is approximately the numerical equivalent of the 0.25 milligram dose actually claimed in the '219 patent for treatment of CINV. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , dkt. 322 at 121.) In the Phase III trials for CINV treatment, described below, Helsinn chose to study \"fixed-dose\" amounts of 0.25 mg dose and 0.75 mg dose.

The 0.75 milligram dose likewise corresponds to the \"10 microgram per kilogram\" figure in the 2330 study.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-0227-0014.) On the other hand, as was appropriate for such a Phase II study, it involved only a small number of patients (161 patients, of which 18 were excluded from the efficacy results for valid reasons), and the total number of patients receiving each dose level ranged between only 24 and 46. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   There was also no formulation data at all in the 2330 study, on stability or any other properties, because the palonosetron was simply diluted in saline solution and buffered for injection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0015; dkt. 324 at 86-89.) In that form, it was not stable at room temperature and required refrigeration and resupply in the course of the study. (Dkt. 322 at 102.) In fact, although the Roche Syntex formulation books contained some research on possible formulations, that work had not progressed to the actual making of any formulations, complete with excipients, that could have been used for Phase III clinical studies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103-04.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   By 1997, as described below, Roche had discontinued work on the Roche Syntex palonosetron project, deciding not to proceed with it after completion of the Phase II studies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, Roche made Helsinn aware that Roche was interested in selling a license on the rights to palonosetron and the existing development research. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80.) After a due diligence period under confidentiality restrictions, Helsinn did enter into that license agreement with Roche in early 1998, and began its work on further development of palonosetron into a pharmaceutical product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

(\"Helsinn\" or \"HHC\") is a family-owned and family-run Swiss company with headquarters in Lugano, Switzerland. (Dkt. 320 at 108; dkt. 322 at 76-77.) The Roche pharmaceutical organization is a large corporate entity that also has a headquarters in Switzerland. (Dkt. 322 at 86.) In the 1997-1998 time frame, Roche and Helsinn would periodically communicate about potential licensing arrangements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That is how Helsinn was informed that Roche had decided to terminate its palonosetron development project at the conclusion of the Phase II studies and was interested in licensing out the rights to the project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86-87.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The Helsinn organization at that time had been managed by the founder, Gabriele Braglia, who was transitioning the leadership of the company to his sons, Enrico and Riccardo Braglia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86.) Dr. Giorgio Calderari is a Ph.D. chemist and current group general manager and chief operating officer at Helsinn in Lugano. (Dkt. 320 at 106.) He is a named inventor in the four patents-in-suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He testified at length at trial, called as a witness by both sides. (Dkt. 320 at 105-225; dkt. 322 at 9-175.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Dr. Calderari recalled that when he joined the organization in 1985, it was a small company with a staff of about 20 employees at Lugano and another 15 employees at its chemical plant in Biasca, Switzerland. (Dkt. 322 at 77-78.) In the 1997-1998 time period, before Helsinn began its development of palonosetron, its organization had grown to approximately 200-250 employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78.) Its operations were located as before in Lugano and Biasca, as well as in a finished drug product plant in Ireland at a subsidiary, Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (\"Helsinn Birex\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77; dkt. 320 at 202.) At that time, its major product was an anti-inflammatory drug that was sold in Europe and South America, but sales were declining because it was going off patent, and Helsinn had no products in the United States pharmaceutical market. (Dkt. 322 at 77, 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The business plan of Helsinn, at the time it licensed palonosetron from Roche in 1998, was described by Dr. Calderari as a \"business-to-business\" model. (Dkt. 320 at 110-11.) Helsinn would take licenses from others who had developed new chemical entities and continue that development process, while simultaneously seeking partners for eventual worldwide distribution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, it was looking to in-license drug development projects and try to take them through to the marketing and distribution stage with others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Helsinn was not a drug discovery company at that time, and it did not have its own sales force. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111.) Nor did it have its own formulation research and development laboratories. (Dkt. 330 at 7-8.) It would obtain those services from contract research organizations (\"CROs\") and contract manufacturing organizations (\"CMOs\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   When Helsinn was considering the prospect of acquiring the palonosetron development rights from Roche, it had full access to Roche Syntex's laboratory and Phase II documentation, and it was able to speak with the scientists there. (Dkt. 320 at 114-15; dkt. 322 at 81.) Dr. Calderari was part of the team at Helsinn that was responsible for evaluating that opportunity. (Dkt. 320 at 114.) He testified that the Helsinn team's view of the project, after making its due diligence review, was that from a scientific standpoint it could enable Helsinn to enter a new field of research, and it could be an opportunity for Helsinn to enter the U.S. market, \"but we were also aware that there was some risk that we\n   would have to overcome in order to arrive at a successful product.\" (Dkt. 322 at 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The class of molecules known as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, commonly called setrons, had already been developed into pharmaceutical products, although none of the setron molecules covered by Roche Syntex's '333 patent had yet been developed to that point. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80.) At that time in early 1998, there were already three setron products on the market in the U.S., namely ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C202%2C333\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C202%2C333\">\n    at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) They were sold by major companies including GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92.) Those products contained different setron compounds, but Helsinn understood that they were considered interchangeable. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The palonosetron project documents reviewed by Helsinn showed that Roche itself, in view of Syntex's Phase II testing, did not see any particular efficacy advantages of palonosetron compared to the existing setron products, nor did it see market potential. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81-82.) So even if Helsinn were to succeed in developing a commercial formulation and obtaining FDA approval after Phase III clinical trials, the palonosetron product would be a fourth setron in the same class, a so-called \"me too\" compound. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82.) It would likely earn only modest sales, according to Roche's projections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83.) Furthermore, the earliest of those setrons, ondansetron, was losing its patent protection in 2005. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144.) Roche charged Helsinn a relatively modest sum, $10 million, for the license rights to palonosetron, with further royalties due only if and when a product was approved and launched. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Helsinn was also aware, from scientific publications, that at that time many companies including Roche were developing or were looking to another class of antiemetic products called NK-1, referring to neurokinin receptor antagonists. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C202%2C333\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C202%2C333\">\n    at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In fact, at a later time, in or about 2005, Roche licensed to Helsinn an NK-1 compound named netupitant, and Helsinn took it from the end of Phase I trials through FDA approval and its launch in the U.S. in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86). Also Roche, even while discontinuing its palonosetron project and licensing it to Helsinn, and while pursuing development of new NK-1 compounds, actually purchased the rights to the patented 5-HT3 product granisetron some years after 1998, paying over $1 billion for that deal as reported in the press. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Aside from predicted poor marketing prospects for the palonosetron project, there were also technical problems confronting Helsinn as it considered whether to in-license the project. (Dkt. 320 at 124-25.) Helsinn studied Roche Syntex's efficacy records at the end of Phase II, including the results of the Phase II study 2330, which was for treatment of CINV. (Dkt. 320 at 31-32.) In their internal records at the end of Phase II, the Syntex scientists themselves had recommended that for a CINV indication (as contrasted with a PONV indication, which would typically be at a lower dosage), the minimum dose to be selected for Phase III trials should be 1.0 milligram, not the equivalent of 0.25 or 0.75 milligram doses suggested in the 2330 study conclusions. (Dkt. 322 at 111-12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The Syntex scientists had also recommended (but not prepared or tested) a formula concentration level of 0.4 milligrams of palonosetron per milliliter of solution for the CINV Phase III trials. (Dkt. 322 at 111.) However, the Syntex formulation studies indicated that \"[t]he higher the drug concentration in the solution, the less stable it becomes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113.) So stability itself was an issue, but so were dosage and concentration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As Dr. Calderari summarized the situation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   The problem is that from a chemical point of view, you wish to have the lowest possible concentration... because this increased the probability of having a stable solution. On the other hand, for showing efficacy, you have to have a dose or a concentration which is enough high [sic] so that the product will be at the end efficacious in the patient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Keeping in mind all of those considerations, Helsinn did make the decision to proceed with the palonosetron project, entering into the license with Roche in early 1998. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C202%2C333\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C202%2C333\">\n    at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) As part of that deal, ownership of all the remaining developmental batches of the palonosetron API was transferred to Helsinn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104.) Roche specified that those supplies of API could be used only for developmental purposes, including Phase III clinical trials; that API could not be used for a commercial product. Helsinn complied with that restriction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104-05.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Helsinn began its work under the license agreement with Roche by building a \"project team.\" (Dkt. 320 at 109.) Dr. Calderari was in charge of the \"chemistry manufacturing and control\" (\"CMC\") part. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109-10.) He explained that involved \"developing the API... drug processes [and] quality control, up to having everything ready for the release and collecting all the necessary chemical stability data for filing a New Drug Application.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110.) Dr. Calderari was assisted in those functions by Dr. Daniele Bonadeo, whose degree was in chemistry and pharmacy and who also became a named inventor on the patents-in-suit. (Dkt. 330 at 5-6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The dose selection and clinical studies for Helsinn's project were supervised by Dr. Alberto Macciocchi, a medical doctor who was also a Helsinn employee, in consultation with Dr. Calderari and his CMC group. (Dkt. 322 at 48, 119.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   There were also chemical people at Helsinn's own API manufacturing plant, and regulatory staff, as part of the Helsinn project team. (Dkt. 330 at 9.) In addition, Helsinn engaged a former Syntex scientist, Thomas Malefyt (another named inventor on the four patents-in-suit), who had been the CMC leader of the Roche Syntex palonosetron project team. (Dkt. 322 at 99-100.) He rendered a consulting report addressing the related issues of stability, dose selection, and concentration in designing the Phase III trials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115-16.) As Dr. Bonadeo testified, \"the aim... was to have an NDA for CINV use of palonosetron.\" (Dkt. 330 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   There were substantial communications between the Helsinn project team and the\n   former Syntex researchers, as well as other specialist consultants engaged by Helsinn, during the period starting in 1998 when Helsinn licensed the palonosetron project from Roche Syntex. Much of that work involved studying the Syntex Phase II clinical data and considering what doses and concentrations of palonosetron to recommend to the FDA for Phase III clinical trials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Helsinn confidential records in that period include minutes of a week-long meeting in Palo Alto, California from July 20 to July 24, 1998 (\"1998 Helsinn Clinical Meeting Minutes\"). The persons attending that meeting included Dr. Macciocchi and Dr. Calderari from Helsinn; former Syntex researchers including Mr. Malefyt; Dr. David Gandara from University of California Davis, a prominent medical oncologist (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   dkt. 324 at 45-46); and other doctors and scientists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The summary of that meeting, as reported in the Minutes, stated in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    Overview\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   ....

The Oread agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Helsinn was aware that it would need manufacturing and testing capabilities in order to proceed to Phase III trials. (Dkt. 322 at 123-24.) The immediate need was to be able to create sufficient quantities of an actual formulated composition for use in the Phase III clinical studies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That formulation would contain the palonosetron API batch material Helsinn had purchased from Roche, if the FDA agreed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123.) It would also contain the excipients that Helsinn would select for inclusion in the intravenous formulation that would be administered to the Phase III subject patients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   That Phase III intravenous\n   formulation would be subject to FDA supervision as to manufacturing quality. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135.) It would also have to be tested for properties including quality and stability, with those results reported to the FDA before and during the Phase III process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Looking beyond the Phase III trial period, if Phase III was successful and Helsinn decided to try to market a product based on that IND in the U.S. market, Helsinn would have to file a New Drug Application. One of the many requirements of Helsinn's NDA filing would be to document how and where the applied-for product or products would be manufactured and packaged for commercial distribution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135-36.) In connection with any such NDA, sample batches of commercial product would have to be submitted to the FDA, with full manufacturing documentation. Helsinn would need to arrange for the manufacture of new palonosetron API supplies for commercialization because as noted above, Helsinn's license from Roche did not permit the Syntex-made API supplies to be used in any commercial products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Even before the license between Roche and Helsinn was finalized in early 1998, Helsinn had entered into a Confidential Disclosure Agreement, dated November 25, 1997, with a company named Oread, Inc. (\"Oread\") for the purpose of exploring a development and manufacturing relationship (\"Oread Confidentiality Agreement\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-0391-0002.) Oread was a company located in California, on the same campus as Syntex. (Dkt. 320 at 159.) It was an entirely separate company, not related to Helsinn. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C202%2C333\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Some of the personnel at Oread had come from Syntex, including Kathleen M. Lee, who later was named as one of the inventors on the patents-in-suit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-1023-0001; dkt. 322 at 170-71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   On July 13, 1998, Helsinn and Oread signed a contract entitled \"Development and Manufacturing Agreement\" (\"Oread Development Agreement\"). (DTX-0391-0001,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ) That Development Agreement expressly incorporated the confidentiality restrictions contained the Oread Confidentiality Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0002.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   There were a number of functions that Oread contracted to perform under that Development Agreement, as generally described in its Exhibit A, Part I, Statement of Work, and as explained in the testimony of Dr. Calderari. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0009; dkt. 320 at 172-176; dkt. 322 at 122-30.) Those functions included analytical and formulation development work, as well as taking the Syntex-manufactured palonosetron API owned by Helsinn (located in Boulder, Colorado, see dkt. 320 at 195), and manufacturing \"developmental batches\" of product formulation. (Dkt. 320 at 176.) That formulation would be used both for Phase III stability and quality testing, and for administration to patients in the Phase III clinical trials. (Dkt. 322 at 134-35.) The Oread Development Agreement also specified that Oread would perform the stability testing on the developmental formulation batches. (DTX-0391-0009.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The Oread Development Agreement stated that Helsinn would provide sufficient palonosetron API to Oread for the Phase III clinical formulation manufacturing; and the Oread scope of work expressly did not include any API development and manufacture. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, as Dr. Calderari explained, \"we would give our API to them, and they would use them to prepare the... formulation batches, for then giving us back to prepare to investigate\n   in the Phase III clinical trials.\" (Dkt. 322 at 123-24.) He also testified that although Helsinn and Oread had discussions about Oread's potential capacity \"in helping us in the future manufacturing commercial batches,\" no such agreement was ever reached. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   dkt. 320 at 160-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Helsinn and Oread commenced working together under the Oread Development Agreement dated July 13, 1998, and continued those activities until Oread suddenly went out of business in mid-2000, during the Phase III trials, leaving Helsinn to find a substitute contractor. (Dkt. 320 at 169-70.) The functions that Oread did perform under contract during that period, for which it was paid by Helsinn, are summarized below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <strong>\n    5. FDA meeting March 10, 1999\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Armed with all the existing Roche Syntex project information and its evaluations of that information, Helsinn notified the FDA that the Roche Syntex IND 39,797 had been transferred to Helsinn. In a December 23, 1998 submission to the FDA, Helsinn \"described plans to develop palonosetron hydrochloride injection for the prophylaxis of...

The stated purpose of the meeting was \"to get the Division's input on (1) the planned phase III development program, (2)... the adequacy of the technology transfer program of drug substance from the Syntex Boulder facility to the Helsinn Switzerland facility, and (3)... the sufficiency of the preclinical data to support a future NDA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The \"End of Phase II\" meeting was conducted at the FDA on March 10, 1999, and official minutes of the meeting were prepared by the FDA and distributed to the participants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at .0001) The meeting was attended by numerous listed FDA representatives, representatives of Helsinn including Dr. Calderari and Dr. Macciocchi, and consultants for Helsinn who were also named in the minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In preparation for that meeting, Helsinn had provided the FDA with a \"briefing package,\" and listed questions on which it sought FDA input.

They also referred to the fact that for all Phase III trials, Helsinn's proposed doses were 3 and 10 micrograms per kilogram (i.e., equivalent to 0.25 and 0.75 mg,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   n. 11\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702273\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/1358/#p1364\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 261.0007-.0008.) There were also proposed trials named PALO-99-05 and PALO-99-06 discussed in the minutes, as more particularly explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   The FDA in that meeting, as reflected in the minutes, was adamant that the Phase II study 2330, although named a \"dose-ranging, efficacy... study,\" had not produced sufficient data to establish what the minimum effective dose of palonosetron in an intravenous pharmaceutical formulation for CINV would be. In the Background section of the minutes, discussing the 2330 study, the FDA stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   <strong>\n    Study 2330\n   </strong>\n   was a single-dose, double-blind, parallel, multi-center dose-ranging study in which 161 patients (129 males, 32 females) were randomized to 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 or 90 mcg/kg of palonosetron. According to the firm, the objective was to determine dose-response over a wide range of palonosetron doses, using the low-dose levels of palonosetron for control. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with no emetic episodes and no rescue medication. When compared to the lowest doses (0.3 and 1 mcg/kg) only the 30 mcg/kg dose was statistically significant; a significant dose response trend was not evident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   (PTX-261.0002.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   This FDA minutes statement was referring to the fact that as reported in the 2330 study, at the 3 and 10 mcg/kg levels (equivalent to the 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg dosages that Helsinn ultimately proposed and selected for its Phase III trials), there was no statistical significance to any of the efficacy data in that study. Indeed, according to the FDA at that meeting, the only statistically significant dose level indicating efficacy in the 2330 study for CINV (using a highly emetogenic chemotherapy agent) was 30 mcg/kg, or ten times higher than the 3 mcg/kg dose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Additional statements in the FDA minutes of the March 10, 1999 meeting emphasized that determining the dose-related efficacy of the proposed palonosetron pharmaceutical formulations would have to abide the results of the Phase III trials. Here are some of those question and answer exchanges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   Clinical-Question 5\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   Are the two trials presented in moderate dose CINV [referring to PALO-99-03 and PALO-99-04], with repeat cycle and pediatric data, considered sufficient to support the label claim, \"Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetic cancer chemotherapy\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    \u2022 This question is premature. The program appears adequate, however, all regulatory decisions, including any labeling claims, will be data driven. (Division representatives also noted that a dose response was not shown in Phase II Study 2330, and therefore it is questionable whether the appropriate palonosetron dose has been identified.)\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   Clinical-Question 6\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   Is [Phase II study] 2330 sufficient to support the label claim \"Including high dose cisplatin\"?

The FDA had been made aware that Helsinn proposed to use the Syntex-manufactured palonosetron API in making the pharmaceutical formulations to be used in the Phase III trials, and the FDA expressed concern that for commercialization, the age of that API substance would be problematical. Helsinn replied that they did not plan to use any of that Syntex-made API in manufacturing the commercial batches. The FDA accepted that representation, but made it clear that it would require full disclosure of the planned commercial manufacturing arrangements, as well as commercial product stability data, before it would consider approving a New Drug Application for commercialization of any such product. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702273\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/1358/#p1364\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) That portion of the minutes stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   <strong>\n    \u2022 We note your plan to use drug substance manufactured by Syntex (date of manufacture: 1995) for your Phase III drug product.

The Division's chemistry representative indicated that the information to support this change should be presented clearly and completely in the NDA. He said the Helsinn drug substance manufacturing facility(ies) should be prepared to host an inspection at the time of NDA submission. He also said that three batches of drug product manufactured with Helsinn drug substance should be put on stability; at least one of those batches should be commercial scale.)\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at .0003.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Dr. Calderari testified that the Helsinn development team continued to debate internally the questions of what dosage and concentration level or levels to select for the Phase III protocols during this time period. The Helsinn group at that time recognized the fact that the Syntex scientists, at the end of their Phase II work, had recommended a single 1.0 milligram dose for Phase III CINV testing. They were also acutely aware that the FDA said the Phase II 2330 study did not contain reliable dose-related efficacy data. On the dosage issue, when asked how Helsinn ultimately decided to take the two doses that\n   it did select into the Phase III trials, he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   It was... a big debate. I mean, generally speaking, you tend to run Phase III only with one dose, but as we have seen..., the FDA was concerned about not having shown this dose efficacy relationship, so our scientists suggested that we should run the Phase III with multiple doses, and I recall that we had a long discussion because Dr. Macciocchi wanted even to have a third dose, much higher. Then at the end, we came to a compromise to use these two doses, and this what then was proposed to the FDA in the end of Phase II [March 10, 1999] meeting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   (Dkt. 322 at 119 (bracketed text added).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Dr. Calderari also explained that the stability issue was also in the forefront of Helsinn's considerations at that time. Although Syntex had recommended a formulation containing 0.4 milligrams of palonosetron per milliliter of solution for a CINV product, there was a concern about stability of the product at that concentration. The Syntex internal documents had identified that \"the higher the drug concentration in the solution, the less stable it becomes.\" (Dkt. 322 at 113, referring to DTX-0254 at 27.) The Syntex inventor Dr. Malefyt, in his September 14, 1998 consulting report to Helsinn, had similarly advised:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-242\">\n   The [P]hase [I and II] IV product required refrigeration. Stability is inversely related to [palonosetron ] concentration apparently in both solid and liquid forms. If doses around 10 mcg/kg are required to obtain efficacy for CINV and PONV (both IV or oral liquid capsules), it will be challenging to formulate an IV and oral dosage form that provides sufficient mcg dosage to provide efficacy and also be sufficiently stable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   (PTX-245.0005 (bracketed text added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Dr. Calderari summed up the problem facing Helsinn in trying to achieve a balance between efficacy and stability in creating a Phase III formulation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   So at the end, this is the dilemma we lived from the-.... So the dilemma was, me, as a chemist, I wanted-or my team wanted-a diluted as much solution, so less concentration (to make sure that at the end we would have had a product that would have been shelf stable), but of course the clinician wanted to use a dosage that was sufficient[ly] high to meet the requirement to treat emesis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   (Dkt. 322 at 117-18 (bracketed text added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Phase III protocol\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Ultimately, Helsinn decided that to balance the documented concerns about efficacy and stability, it would take two different dosages and concentration levels into its Phase III trials for CINV. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 119.) On April 7, 2000, it submitted to the FDA a set of \"safety and efficacy protocols\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   for Phase III clinical testing designated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-250\">\n   \u2022 PALO-99-03 entitled, \"A Double Blind Clinical Study to Compare Single IV Doses of Palonosetron, 0.25 or 0.75 mg and Ondansetron, 32 mg IV, in the Prevention of Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-251\">\n   \u2022 PALO-99-04 entitled, \"A Double Blind Clinical Study to Compare Single IV Doses of Palonosetron, 0.25 or 0.75 mg and Dolasetron, 100 mg IV, in the Prevention of Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   \u2022 PALO-99-05, entitled \"A Double Blind Clinical Study to Compare Single IV doses of Palonosetron, 0.25 or 0.75 mg and Ondansetron, 32 mg IV, in the Prevention of Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   (DTX-0293-0001.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   As shown in these protocol titles, all three protocols specified using both 0.25 and 0.75 mg doses of palonosetron. The 99-03 and 99-04 studies were directed to moderately emetic CINV (\"MEC\"), and the 99-05 study was directed to highly emetogenic CINV (\"HEC\"). The protocols specified that the selected concentrations of palonosetron API in the formulations for all three studies would be 0.05 mg/ml for the 0.25 mg dosage and 0.15 mg/ml for the 0.75 mg dosage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 322 at 108.) These concentrations were sharply lower than the 0.4 mg/ml that Syntex had recommended for the CINV formula. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) The low concentrations were reflective of the goal, as described by Dr. Calderari, to promote stability by decreasing the concentration of palonosetron in the pharmaceutical formulation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Dr. Calderari was asked why Helsinn chose to bring two doses into each of those Phase III CINV trials, both of which were lower than the 1.0 mg dose for CINV that had been recommended by Syntex. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 120.) He said, \"this was this compromise between increasing the chances of having a stable product from one side, and increasing the chances to have an efficacious product on the other side.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He explained that the risk that Helsinn took in selecting those relatively low doses for CINV was \"that at the end, we would end up with a product that was not efficacious enough.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Dr. Calderari testified, under questioning by counsel for Helsinn, that Helsinn did not know whether these lower doses would work for CINV efficacy, prior to receiving the results of the Phase III trials. He stated the reason was \"[b]ecause it was not tested before, and during the Phase III trial, you have absolutely no idea how the clinical trial is going in terms of results.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Helsinn itself made an apparently contrary statement, however, in its proposed Protocol No. PALO-99-03, dated November 15, 1999. There, referring to the table of data in the Phase II 2330 study summarizing patients' responses for CINV treatment with doses from 0.3/1 mcg/km to 90 mcg/kg, Helsinn stated, \"Data from this study clearly demonstrate that the 3 \u00b5g/kg dose of palonosetron is the minimal effective dose in preventing CINV.\" (DTX-0293-0035.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Chronologically, that statement was dated in late 1999 and submitted to the FDA in April 2000, despite the FDA's statements\n   to Helsinn in the March 10, 1999 meeting minutes, that \"a dose response was not shown in the Phase II Study 2330,\" and that \"only the 30 mcg/kg dose was statistically significant; a significant dose response trend was not evident.\" (PTX-261.0001, .0005). When queried about it by counsel for Teva, Dr. Calderari testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   Q. ....The term \"minimal effective dose\" is particularly important, isn't it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-260\">\n   A. Well, I am not a medical doctor, but this is standard. I mean, if you want to go to a Phase III clinical trials, it's a fact that you have to have shown some efficacy in Phase II. Otherwise, you cannot jump and you will even not get the approval to go to the Phase III. So, yes, the product was showing some efficacy clearly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n   Q. Exactly. In real human beings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-263\">\n   Q. And efficacy meaning it reduced the likelihood of CINV.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-264\">\n   A. Right. It was giving enough signal for us to take the risk to continue to the Phase III and getting approval from the FDA to move to the Phase III and show if we were really able to show a real efficacy to get an approval by the FDA, but this is standard. You finish the Phase II. You see a some signal. You go with the agency. You discuss, and then if everything is fine, you move to the next step.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   (Dkt. 320 at 142-43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   His testimony on this point was consistent, however, with the actual statements made by Syntex in the 2330 study Final Report, quoted in full in Section I.C.2, where Syntex reported, \"\n   <strong>\n    A statistically supported dose-response relationship for efficacy... between the lowest dose level of RS-25259 and each subsequent higher dose level was not observed in this study\n   </strong>\n   .... Although no placebo control was incorporated into the design of this study, there\n   <strong>\n    appeared to be\n   </strong>\n   a step up in efficacy from the combined 0.3-1 pg/kg dose group to doses of 3 pg/kg and more....\n   <strong>\n    Based on the results of this study, a dose of 3 \u00b5g/kg or 10 \u00b5g/kg might be appropriate for further development\n   </strong>\n   .\" (DTX-0227-0015, -0016 (emphasis added).) This testimony was also consistent with what the FDA had informed Helsinn at the March 10, 1999 meeting, \"\n   <strong>\n    Efficacy data for Study 2330 show that results for the 0.3-1 mcg/kg doses did not differ significantly from the proposed Phase III doses (3 and 10 mcg/kg)\n   </strong>\n   .\" (PTX-261.0008.) \"[\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    dose response was not shown in Phase II Study 2330, and therefore it is questionable whether the appropriate palonosetron dose has been identified.\n   </strong>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at .0005.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Following the March 10, 1999 FDA meeting, Helsinn continued its preparations to file proposed Phase III protocols with the FDA. The documentary evidence described below shows that as of March 24, 1999, Helsinn had already completed developing, on paper and in actual solution, the 0.05 mg/ml palonosetron concentration, with all measured excipients, that had been described in the Syntex formulation books and was later claimed in the '724, '725, and '424 patents. (The same 0.05 mg/ml palonosetron concentration (with excipient content) was also reflected in the later-issued '219 patent, as the result of dose 0.25 mg palonosetron in 5 ml solution.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 320 at 175-76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Dr. Calderari testified that Example 4 in the written description of all four patents-in-suit is an intravenous formulation description that appeared in the Syntex formulation book. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152.) Example 4 is\n   reproduced in the margin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   That same formulation, described in the Syntex research materials, had actually been made up into a bulk batch by Helsinn's contractor, Oread, before March 24, 1999. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DTX-1125-0001 to -0006.) This fact was reflected in statutory declarations with supporting documentation later filed in the USPTO during the prosecution of the patents-in-suit and related patent applications. One such example, under the application that led to issuance of the '724 patent, was a declaration of named inventors Calderari, Bonadeo, Cannella, and Enrico and Riccardo Braglia dated November 21, 2007. (DTX-0004-0001 to -0005;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DTX-1125, a similar Bonadeo declaration dated Feb. 13, 2007, containing the two-page Exhibit A documents referred to in this series of declarations.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   That declaration stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   5) This patent application is based on the discovery of liquid formulations of palonosetron with improved stability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n   6) The formulations can be stored for prolonged periods of time in a variety of conditions without significant degradation or loss of potency, and thus are considered pharmaceutically stable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-272\">\n   7) The formulations were developed by us at Helsinn in the late 1990s, and were completed sometime before March 24, 1999.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-273\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-274\">\n   14) The Example 4 formulation was developed by us sometime before March 24, 1999 and transmitted to a contract manufacturer for Helsinn, Oread Laboratories in Palo Alto California (\"Oread\") for the production\n   of commercial scale batches of palonosetron hydrochloride.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-275\">\n   15) A copy of the master batch record developed by Oread for the formulation is contained in Exhibit A hereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n   16) The master batch record describes the Example 4 formulation....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   17) As can be seen, the batch record has an effective date of March 24, 1999, and thus makes clear that we developed the formulation before this date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-278\">\n   18) In fact, we had invented and were in possession of all of the subject matter currently claimed in...

He said that Syntex's formulation book, describing various formulations including Formulation 4, was \"where they describe their attempt, their experiment to arrive to a formulation that might be suitable for clinical trial and then after for commercialization. But to my surprise, when I made the first due diligence, they had never manufactured that formulation, that they had absolutely no... data about the stability of potential formulation to be used in a clinical trial.\" (Dkt. 320 at 116.) Furthermore, he stated that the Example 4 concentration formulation of 0.05 mg/ml was recommended by Syntex to be used in Phase III clinical trials for PONV efficacy (then called \"Formulation 90\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116-17.) On the other hand, Syntex had recommended a Phase III palonosetron concentration formulation of 0.4 mg/ml for CINV efficacy (then called \"Formulation 89\"). (Dkt. 322 at 111-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   Dr. Calderari also testified that as to the written description of the Example 4 formulation, as embodied in the actual developmental formulation batches prepared by Oread, the inventor statement that he and the other inventor declarants signed, that \"the formulations... were completed sometime before March 24, 1999,\" was a true statement. (Dkt. 320 at 149.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   He stated, \"[e]xactly, and this is exactly what we have completed at that time. We have completed the selection of the formulation that we will then go and test for stability and for the clinical trial. This is what we had completed at that time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 150-51.) He had the same answer regarding the statement at the end of the inventor declaration, \"we had invented and were in possession of all of the subject matter currently claimed.\" (DTX-0004-0003.) In his words, \"we [had] completed the specification, the selection of this formulation to then be tested in stability studies and in human beings.\" (Dkt. 320 at 155.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Helsinn's decision to proceed to CINV Phase III clinical trials with fixed doses of 0. 25 mg and 0.75 mg in 5 ml vials was made following the March 10, 1999 FDA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   meeting (in which a range of doses was discussed, in the weight-based measurements (mcg/kg) used in the Phase II studies), as reflected in the Phase III protocols subsequently submitted to the FDA. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DTX-0293-0001; dkt. 322 at 132.) Dr. Calderari testified that as part of those dosage selections for Phase III, Helsinn decided on corresponding palonosetron concentrations of 0.05 mg/ml and 0.15 mg/ml, which were both lower than the 0.4 mg/ml concentration that Syntex had recommended for CINV Phase III trials. (Dkt. 322 at 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   While Helsinn was preparing to submit its completed Phase III safety and efficacy protocols to the FDA, which occurred on April 7, 2000 as described below, Helsinn was communicating with the FDA regarding stability testing of the development formulation lots that Oread had prepared (in the selected palonosetron doses of 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg and concentrations of 0.05 mg/ml and 0.15 mg/ml). A letter from Helsinn to the FDA dated August 19, 1999 stated: \"Six month stability data for development lots indicate that the Phase 3 formulation is expected to remain stable for a minimum of 18 months, when stored at 25 \u00b0C and protected from light. We commit to monitor stability of the clinical material and to resupply the drug product as appropriate, to ensure that the clinical material has the identity, quality and purity it purports to have.\" (DTX-0999-0002.) Dr. Calderari said this was \"the formulation we pick[ed] up and we improved, we optimized, and we ran at Oread, and by the time we made the submission, we have six months' stability data.\" (Dkt. 322 at 163.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   The formal Phase III safety and efficacy protocols for PALO-99-03 and PALO-9904 (two MEC studies) and PALO-99-05 (one HEC study) were submitted to the FDA by letter dated April 7, 2000, under the existing IND number 39,797. (DTX-0293.) At that time, Oread was still performing its contractual functions in support of the trials. For example, a memo from Oread to Helsinn dated April 10, 2000 described \"two phase 3 clinical lots\" manufactured by Oread in March and April 1999, containing either 0.05 mg/ml or 0.15 mg/ml palonosetron, in 5 ml glass vials according to the Phase III specifications. It reported chemical and physical stability based on up to 6 months of available data, and \"[t]he stability monitoring of these two clinical lots is continuing according to the protocol.\" (DTX-1027-0038.) Dr. Calderari confirmed that Oread did provide clinical supplies of the formulation that is covered by the patents-in-suit for Helsinn, in preparation for conducting the Phase III trials, and Helsinn paid Oread for those batches. (Dkt. 320 at 179-82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   The INTRODUCTION section of the formal Protocols for all three Phase III clinical studies, PALO-99-03, PALO-99-04, and PALO-99-05, contained the following types of statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   Results achieved in Phase II CINV studies suggest that palonosetron is safe and effective in preventing nausea and vomiting following emetogenic chemotherapy, especially during the first 24 hours after administration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-288\">\n   Given the high affinity of palonosetron for the 5-HT3 receptor and efficacy results in both animal models and in Phase II studies, a single dose of palonosetron is expected to control acute CINV following moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Furthermore, due to the long half-life of palonosetron in humans, a single dose of palonosetron may also be beneficial in controlling the delayed phase (24-120 hours) of nausea and vomiting induced by a chemotherapeutic regimen. This study is designed to support the hypotheses that palonosetron is not inferior to currently available\n   5-HT3 receptor antagonists and is effective in preventing nausea and vomiting following moderately emetogenic chemotherapy....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-0293-0030 (PALO-99-03);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at -0149 (PALO-99-04);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at -0257 (PALO-99-05, replacing \"moderately emetogenic\" with \"highly emetogenic\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Commencement of Phase III trials\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   All three Phase III clinical trials were performed by a German contract research organization named Kendle GmbH &amp; Co. (\"Kendle\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-0293-0001 to -0007; DTX-0288-0003; dkt. 322 at 54.) The April 7, 2000 protocol application specified that the \"name and title of the person responsible for monitoring the conduct and progress of the clinical investigations\" was Alberto Macciocchi, MD, Senior Manager, Product Development at Helsinn. (DTX-0293-0004.) Dr. Macciocchi was still in that position as of July 19, 2002, the date of the Clinical Study Report for the earliest-completed trial, PALO-99-03. (DTX-0288-0003 to -0004.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   n. 16\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702273\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/1358/#p1364\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702273\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/1358/#p1364\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   The patient participation in the three Phase III clinical trials began with the earliest of those trials, PALO-99-03. According to the Clinical Study Report at the end of that trial, the Study Initiation Date (\"first patient in date\") for PALO-99-03 was August 1, 2000. The Study Completion Date (\"last patient out date\") for that trial was October 2, 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0003.) Neither of the other two Phase III trials had a data \"locked\" date prior to the critical date of January 30, 2002.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.C.11. Therefore, much of the evidence in this chronology focused on the progress of PALO-99-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   In September 2000, just as the first of the three Phase III clinical trials began, Helsinn issued a press release entitled \"Helsinn Announces That Patient Enrollment For Phase III Palonosetron Trials Progresses Both in the USA and Europe.\" (DTX-1227-0001.) That publication stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-294\">\n   \"The Phase II trials demonstrated the efficacy of Palonosetron in the prevention of emesis with no significant side effects....\" said Luigi Baroni M.D., Director of Scientific Affairs. \"We are now eager to complete the data necessary for NDA filing scheduled for early 2002.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   <strong>\n    8. The SP agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   Returning to the topic of contracting, it will be recalled that Oread had suddenly closed down in or about June 2000, just before the Study Initiation Date for PALO-99-03, and with the other two Phase III clinical trials gearing up as well. As a result, Helsinn needed to find another organization to pick up Oread's functions and move forward with it in the development project. Dr. Calderari testified that Helsinn then hired SP Pharmaceuticals L.L.C. (\"SP\"), \"essentially,... to finish the work that we started with Oread....\" (Dkt. 320 at 196.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   A document later submitted to the FDA as part of Helsinn's NDA filing summarized that portion of the drug product development history as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-299\">\n   Oread... was selected as the manufacturing site for the formulation of the injectable solution for Phase 3 clinical supplies and for the manufacturing of commercial batches (reference IND amendment serial #064, 19 August 1999). A Commercialization Development Plan was agreed with the Agency during the End of Phase 2 Meeting, 10 March 99, and enacted to complete the transfer of the manufacturing technology for the optimized drug product formulation from Syntex to Oread, Inc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-300\">\n   Due to the subsequent closure of the Oread manufacturing facility in June, 2000, SP Pharmaceuticals, Albuquerque, New Mexico, was selected as the site of manufacture for future NDA commercial drug product, as well as additional Phase 3 clinical batches. No significant changes in the manufacturing process or equipment occurred with the site transfer. Reference is made to IND Amendment Serial #95, 22 Nov. 2000, which was submitted in support of SP Pharmaceuticals as the site of manufacture for commercial product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   (DTX-0310-0005, -0006 (footnotes omitted).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   Dr. Calderari stated that Helsinn's contractual relationship with Oread never advanced to the point of any serious negotiations or contracting regarding Oread as a manufacturer of any palonosetron commercial product (despite Helsinn's apparent designation of Oread to the FDA in March 1999 as the \"selected\" site for such manufacturing). (Dkt. 322 at 125-26.) Dr. Calderari characterized the Oread agreement as a \"fee for service agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122.) Nevertheless, the above-quoted FDA filing statement indicates that during the Phase III process, Oread was at least identified by Helsinn to the FDA as the \"selected\" site for future commercial manufacturing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   The first agreement that Helsinn entered into with SP, even before Oread totally stopped functioning, was a Secrecy Agreement dated April 10, 2000. (PTX-361.) It was followed by a \"Letter of Intent\" designated \"Confidential\" (\"SP Letter of Intent\"). (DTX-0258-0002.) The SP Letter of Intent was signed by SP on October 19, 2000, and was signed by Dr. Calderari for Helsinn on November 7, 2000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0004.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   The SP Letter of Intent stated that the parties were \"in the process of negotiating a Master Services Agreement for development or manufacture of pharmaceutical products,\" and they agreed that SP would begin such work, subject to the terms of the Letter of Intent and any Scope of Work documents they would mutually agree to in writing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0002.) Attached to the Letter of Intent, signed by the parties on the same dates as the Letter of Intent itself, was a Scope of Work description (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at -0006 to -0020), and an Appendix A: Pricing and Technology Transfer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0021 to -0023.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   The Scope of Work stated, among other things, that SP \"will manufacture Product meeting the Specifications... and perform such other responsibilities detailed\" therein. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0006.) It described that Helsinn would \"furnish SP with sufficiently tested and released API to guarantee filling the theoretical batch size....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It stated that SP would furnish the vials and the listed incipient raw materials (the EDTA, mannitol, citric acid, etc.), along with related documentation, and would \"manufacture the product according to the approved\n   master batch record.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0010.) It also provided that SP would do specified quality testing on the finished products, described as 0.05 mg/ml and 0.15 mg/ml (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at -0012, -0013), and would do stability testing on \"Product: Palonosetron-HCl IV injection 0.25 mg/vial &amp; 0.75 mg/vial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0013, -0014.) Among other provisions, it also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-306\">\n   <strong>\n    J. Commercial Product Validation\n   </strong>\n   . SP will perform the following process validation, manufacturing and stability activities to prepare for product commercialization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-307\">\n   1. Manufacture 3 lots of up to 50,000 vials of Palonosetron-HCl intravenous injection for commercial product validation and sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-308\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-309\">\n   2. Perform stability studies on the commercial product validation lots.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-310\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0015.) There was also an Appendix A: Pricing and Technology Transfer, describing some batches that were going to be manufactured by SP and a price for those batches, including \"[m]anufacture up to 10,000 vials of the... finished drug product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0021, -0022.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   Dr. Calderari testified that the SP Letter of Intent and attached Scope of Work document did not actually provide for SP to manufacture any commercial product for Helsinn. (Dkt. 322 at 129.) He explained that it provided that Helsinn would pay SP for each activity mentioned in the Scope of Work, including to manufacture the batch size Helsinn was requiring them to manufacture at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He said that the purpose of the SP Letter of Intent was \"a development agreement to make some batches, to test them, to put on stability, and possibly to use in clinical trials.\" (Dkt. 320 at 196.) He confirmed that SP did actually do the work of creating development batch lots and clinical lots under the SP Letter of Intent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   Dr. Calderari said that it was only after the critical date, on June 24, 2002, that Helsinn and SP entered into an agreement for future commercial manufacturing. (Dkt. 322 at 129.) That agreement is identified in the margin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed, however, that as part of its eventual NDA filing, Helsinn recounted that as of November 22, 2000, Helsinn had filed an amendment to its Phase III IND application informing the FDA that \"SP Pharmaceuticals, Albuquerque, New Mexico, was selected as the site of manufacture for future NDA commercial drug product, as well as additional Phase 3 clinical batches.\" (DTX-0310-0006.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   n. 27\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702273\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/1358/#p1364\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   and accompanying text. The NDA contained, as required, detailed descriptions of the \"Selected Manufacturing Process\" that SP would perform to make the proposed commercial product, as well as an explanation of the differences between that commercial process and the manufacturing processes SP would use to make \"registration batches,\" that is, clinical trial formulations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-0310-0241 to -0243.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   Dr. Calderari explained that as part of the Phase III clinical trial process, the FDA required Helsinn to show three batches of product formulation manufactured at the intended site of commercialization,\n   tested for at least 12 months of stability. He said the FDA would not consider the Oread stability data for that purpose because Oread was no longer the intended site of commercialization. Therefore, the FDA required three batches made at the SP site to be tested for stability, to demonstrate quality control at the SP plant before Helsinn could submit an NDA application. He recalled that process was accomplished using SP, at its manufacturing site, and Helsinn had that stability data available in approximately the second half of 2002. (Dkt. 322 at 155-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   <strong>\n    9. The MGI Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   The topic of contracting continued to be a feature of Helsinn's drug product development process after the first of the Phase III clinical trials began on August 1, 2000. Having secured, on a confidential basis, the assistance of first Oread and then SP for the functions those companies performed, Helsinn was also simultaneously in search of \"marketing partners,\" as announced in its September 14, 2000 press release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   n. 26\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702273\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/1358/#p1364\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702273\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/1358/#p1364\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   Riccardo Braglia, who succeeded his father as CEO of the Helsinn companies, testified (in deposition excerpts in evidence) that their business model is \"to licensing-in, develop, and licensing-out.\" (Dkt. 330 at 54.) He said \"we are looking to opportunities of product which are in the... early stage of development or middle stage of development, and also are good opportunities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   He mentioned two goals of the licensing-out efforts for the palonosetron project: first, to bring in license fees and thus minimize financial risk of such huge investments for Helsinn, and second, to plan for marketing and distribution of product in the United States after FDA approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-64.) He said that the \"commercial partner\" agreement that Helsinn normally did with its partners around the world would feature an up-front payment to Helsinn when the agreement was signed, as well as \"milestone\" payments (also to Helsinn) at certain points in the development or filing or approval of certain products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.) He added that for the palonosetron project, as Helsinn discovered the process was much more costly than anticipated, \"the strategy was to find as soon as possible a partner that will give us some milestones [i.e., milestone payments] for the... licensing rights to the U.S. market.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (bracketed text added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   Helsinn conducted a lengthy and arduous search for a willing \"commercial partner\" for the U.S. market, described by Helsinn employee Dr. Rachid Benhamza at trial, which resulted in written agreements with MGI Pharma, Inc. (\"MGI\"), a Minnesota company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82-149.) Those agreements, both effective on April 6, 2001, were a License Agreement between MGI and Helsinn (DTX-0115) (\"MGI License Agreement\"), and a Supply and Purchase Agreement between MGI and Helsinn Birex, the Irish subsidiary. (DTX-0261 and DTX-0311 (same) (\"MGI Supply Agreement\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Dr. Calderari, who participated in negotiating those agreements, described the general nature of the License Agreement as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-321\">\n   [I]t's our standard practice that we grant the rights to a company to explore a patent, and with this, they pay us some licensing fees, and they then will pay us for future royalties on the sales. Concomitant, but subject to this licensing agreement, we also make a supply\n   and purchase agreement that we set the stage for future supplies, once we arrive to get an approval, and also there the price is subject to the price that the company will achieve selling the product on the market. Now, of course, if the license agreement is not there because the product would have been unsuccessful in Phase III, then the supply agreement would not be there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-322\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-323\">\n   [F]or MGI, it was quite clear that this was a developmental.... product, so they were not buying a product.

The active comparator, ondansetron 32 mg, is the FDA-approved IV regimen for the prevention of nausea and vomiting following highly emetogenic chemotherapy. This dose is also used in Europe for the prevention of CINV. Implementation of published historical placebo controls will be used to validate the trial, demonstrating its sensitivity. It is anticipated that 80 investigative centers will participate in this study; 40 centers in Europe, 35 centers in the United States and 5 centers in Canada.

He is an M.D. with experience in internal medicine, pharmacokinetics and biostatistics, whose background included a six-year period as the director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (\"CDER\"), the division with responsibility for all drug applications for human administration. He also has a current \"special government employee\" consulting status with the FDA. (Dkt. 337 at 4-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   Reviewing the PALO-99-03 files in evidence and the underlying documentation, Dr. Peck described the work that was done after the clinical study with patients closed on October 2, 2001. Here is his summary of the next few steps in the PALO-99-03 process after that \"last patient out\" date:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-381\">\n   There is no fully assembled, blinded or unblinded data set at that moment. That's a milestone in the execution of a clinical trial, and if you think about it in a multi-center, multi-national clinical trial, there's a lot to do with respect to gathering the data from each site, making sure that the data has been entered properly. In this case, I have read in the protocol that all the data was collected on handwritten case report forms, so those had to be translated into a computer. They used a double entry system, meaning that two independent persons take the data from the case report form and put it into the computer. Those have to be assembled in each center, then they have to be sent to the CRO, Kendle in this case in Munich, which will assemble them all, and then...begin to evaluate the quality. This is all well articulated in the protocol, because regulatory agencies and a POSA would require that if you're going to analyze the data for this purpose, it's got to be high quality. It's got to be verified. The company was even doing site visits during that period of time at some of the sites. In fact, one collection of sites was in Russia. One was up near the border of Siberia, and there was a site visit on that very site after the last patient out in order to validate that everything had been done right at that site.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-382\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-383\">\n   The CRO is doing this, although sometimes the company will commission an independent quality assurance company to do this as well. There were actually a handful of CROs that were working for Helsinn on contract, located in different countries, who were working on the whole execution and assembling of the data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-384\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-385\">\n   What we see here or what we know about these three trials is that it took about eight weeks. That's most clearly shown in the study report for the 99-03 in which there's a meeting that's identified that happened on December 11th and 12th of 2002 [sic: 2001], in which the data quality committee got together to discuss all of the assembled data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-386\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-387\">\n   [That] whole process is called blind data review, but the meeting in December, it was sort of the final summit meeting of\n   the independent evaluators who were qualifying the data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   (Dkt. 337 at 65-67.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   Dr. Peck testified that the two-day \"blind review\" meeting was conducted independent of Helsinn, and Helsinn did not participate in any of the blind data review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-68.) Dr. Peck said that meeting resulted in a formal protocol amendment submitted to the FDA on December 13, 2001, revising the study groups that would be analyzed for efficacy, as described in the Final Study Report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-68, 165-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   The PALO-99-03 records state that after the \"blind review\" meeting, the database was closed on December 19, 2001. (DTX-0288-0056.) Dr. Peck referred to that as when the data was \"locked.\" (Dkt. 337 at 66.) Dr. Calderari testified that he did not see any of the blinded data results, and he did not know whether anyone else at Helsinn saw blinded results after the last patient out date of the PALO-99-03 study. (Dkt. 322 at 56-57 (bracketed text added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   Dr. Peck was asked whether the clinical study data could change during the period immediately after the \"last patient out\" date. He said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-392\">\n   [T]he raw data can change during that period of time, yes. Because if they discover a blunder, [if] they discover that the data was not legible, if they find that one of the patients actually got the wrong drug, there's a lot of things that can happen during the data quality evaluation that can lead to changing actually the raw data. It's only after the raw data have been qualified and the database locked, what they call locked-and that's the point in time where they have decided that, yes, we've done all of the quality control...that we possibly can and we think this data is valid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   (Dkt. 337 at 66-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   The PALO-99-03 documents list January 2, 2002 as the \"unblinding\" date, which Dr. Peck said was the first date that the sponsor, Helsinn, would have been allowed to see the data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164-65;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DTX-0288-0056.) However, the data was only in preliminary form at that time, and much analysis remained to be done on that one study alone, according to Dr. Peck's explanation quoted in the margin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   Dr. Calderari recalled that the unblinded preliminary data on PALO-99-03 were sent to Helsinn [by the CRO conducting the study] in January, 2002, and that preliminary data \"show efficacy for the product.\" (Dkt. 322 at 61.) He said that was a happy day at the company; \"we were start seeing that our effort were paying off, but, of course, we were very careful because they were preliminary data.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   Helsinn sent a letter to CDER dated February 7, 2002 (the week after the critical date of January 30, 2002), stating in part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-397\">\n   In accordance with 21 CFR 312.47(b)(2), a pre-NDA meeting is requested in preparation for the palonosetron NDA.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at -0009 to -0011.) Dr. Calderari testified that he could not recall when he first saw the data in those tables, but he would assume that he did see the data before January 15, 2002. (Dkt. 322 at 72.) Portions of two of those charts are shown in the margin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   n. 37\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   and accompanying text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   A further explanation of portions of the PALO-99-03 documents was provided at trial by Teva expert witness Dr. John Fruehauf. He is an M.D. clinical oncologist who also has a Ph.D. in pharmacology. He is a professor of clinical medicine and director of clinical pharmacology and developmental therapeutics at University of California Irvine. He has an active practice at the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, one of 43 comprehensive cancer centers in the United States. As director of developmental therapeutics, he is regularly involved in conducting Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III clinical trials. (Dkt. 324 at 5-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf and Dr. Peck testified as to their conflicting opinions on whether a person of ordinary skill in the clinical sciences would know, as of January 30, 2002, that palonosetron administered to a human reduces the likelihood of CINV, and specifically whether such person would know at that time that the 0.25 mg dosage claimed in the '219 patent was effective for CINV. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   dkt. 324 (Dr. Fruehauf); dkt. 337 (Dr. Peck).) That opinion testimony is discussed in Section II.A.4.b.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   Testifying about the PALO-99-03 study documents themselves, Dr. Fruehauf stated that it was not surprising to see that the database was \"unblinded\" on January 2, 2002, and the three summary tables attached to Helsinn's February 7, 2002 letter to the FDA were dated January 7, 2002, less than a week after the data was unblinded. He pointed out that those tables, which do include some statistical analysis, are indicated at the bottom of each page to have been prepared using SAS. (Dkt. 324 at 61-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf explained that SAS is a widely accepted statistical package that was included in the pre-planned protocol for that Phase III study, \"so before anybody went on this study, it was determined that this is what they would do.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.) On the other hand, referring to the later PALO-99-04 locked data, he did acknowledge that before the final reports of these Phase III studies were completed, \"there were other things, statistics and other things that might be done\" to analyze the locked data of those studies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 204.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   Dr. Calderari, as head of the Helsinn palonosetron development program but not himself a clinician, was asked whether, upon receipt of that data in early 2002, he formed any conclusion as to whether palonosetron\n   would definitely work for the reduction of CINV. He said no; \"that was an indication that the first preliminary data set was positive; but...we, as part of the overall plan, we have to have two pivotal trials to be completed successfully in order to show efficacy of the product, so 99-03 and 99-04.\" (Dkt. 322 at 137-38.) When asked whether this data gave him confidence that both of those trials would successfully show efficacy, he replied, \"[n]o, because unfortunately, as we know very well, drug development,...one trial is independent from the other one. You are also using different investigator, different countries, different populations, so there might be difference between two trials.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-408\">\n   Helsinn, together with its U.S. licensee and selected marketing partner MGI Pharma, issued a press release on January 16, 2002.

The clinical data from the earliest-completed study, PALO-99-03, had been \"locked\" on December 19, 2001, and had been \"unblinded\" and therefore available to be viewed by Helsinn on January 2, 2002.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.C.10. The database of PALO-99-04 was locked on February 22, 2002 and that data was unblinded on February\n   28, 2002. (DTX-0289-0054.)

Furthermore, non-inferiority of both palonosetron groups compared to ondansetron was also shown for most secondary efficacy parameters and palonosetron 0.25 mg was shown to be superior to ondansetron with regard to most of these secondary efficacy parameters. Thus, palonosetron 0.25 mg showed a better efficacy profile over ondansetron during the delayed phase of nausea and vomiting. The rate of patients with adverse events was comparable in the treatment groups and showed a similar pattern.

That was an oral presentation accompanied by an abstract, authored by Helsinn's Dr. Macciocchi and research colleagues Steven M.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 290 at 16-18.) Here we briefly summarize the basic chronology of those prosecution events, omitting record citations that are stated in that earlier Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   The first generation of patents to be issued subsequent to the January 30, 2003 provisional application date were the '724 and '725 patents -in-suit, dated May 24, 2011. Thus, the original prosecution for this patent family took approximately 8\u00bd years. The next patent-in suit, the '424 patent, was issued on June 14, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-428\">\n   The '724, '725, and '424 patents, all sharing a contemporaneous prosecution era, were approved only after appeals in all three cases to the Commissioner of Patents. Much file history was accumulated in those prosecution files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   The '219 patent, with the same provisional application date and an actual filed application date of May 23, 2013, was issued on December 3, 2013. That patent was applied for and granted during the pendency of this litigation. The application history of the '219 patent itself, albeit not as extensive as for the other three patents, includes many of the materials filed in this litigation including expert reports. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '219 patent, pages 1-6.) The other patents issued to date in this patent family tree, and abandoned applications, are listed in the chart supplied by the parties.

Those opinions were filed during claim construction proceedings in this case and in a related case, Civil Action No. 12-2867.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   The claim construction Memorandum Opinion filed in this case, on April 22, 2015, addressed the issue of whether the following portion of the preamble of claim 1 of the '219 patent constitutes claim limitation language: \"for intravenous administration to a human to reduce the likelihood of cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.\" This Court ruled that language to be limiting in its entirety. (Dkt. 290.) The discussion in that opinion included a review of portions of the prosecution history of all of the patents-in-suit, as it was recognized that the earlier patent histories can be relevant to interpreting the claims of later-issued patents in the same family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   That opinion described,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a phase early in the prosecution of the '724, '725, and '424 patents when the examiners rejected the term \"preventing emesis\" in applied-for preambles to each of those patents under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (enablement).

Applicant understood the Examiner's primary concern with the claims to be with the word \"preventing,\" recited in independent claims 1 and 11 of the '270 application. Applicant indicated that palonosetron has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for preventing emesis, and is marketed as a drug for preventing emesis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-436\">\n   The Examiners suggested that an amendment to independent Claims 1 and 11 in the '270 application, wherein Applicant includes the phrase \"reducing the likelihood\" of emesis instead of \"preventing\" emesis, would address the Office's concerns. Applicant has amended the claims in this application in accordance with the Examiners' suggestions for the '270 application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   (Dkt. 178-3 at 116 (Examiners' Summary of July 27, 2006 Telephonic Interview).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-438\">\n   This portion of the common prosecution history of the patents-in-suit may be relevant to the on-sale bar issues in this case, discussed in Section II.A.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   <strong>\n    14.

Plaintiffs argue, with respect to the Defendant's arguments that the first-inventor-to-file system has no effect on secret commercialization, that the AIA's prior-use defense allows \"secret uses of one's proprietary technology.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Plaintiffs claim that the expansion of the prior-use defense enables secret uses without \"forcing the first inventor to file a patent application\" or \"risk[ing] infringement under the 'first-inventor-to-file' system.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, Plaintiffs contend, Congress intended the different provisions of the AIA to function together such that the on-sale bar now applies only to \"publicly accessible\" prior art. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 236-3 at 84 (AIA Committee Report) (\"[T]he phrase 'available to the public' is added to clarify the broad scope of relevant prior art, as well as to emphasize the fact that it must be publicly accessible.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-503\">\n   The Court, having considered the parties' arguments on the plain language meaning of \u00a7 102(a)(1), the USPTO's guidelines, the undisputed AIA Committee Report, and the public policy considerations underlying the passage of the AIA, concludes that \u00a7 102(a)(1) requires a public sale or offer for sale of the claimed invention. The new requirement that the on-sale bar apply to public sales comports with the plain language meaning of the amended section, the USPTO's interpretation of the amendment, the AIA Committee Report, and Congress's overarching goal to modernize and streamline the United States patent system. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 236-3 at 83-84 (AIA Committee Report).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-504\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

For purposes of the pre-AIA on-sale bar, the Court finds that the MGI Supply Agreement constitutes a sale because it was a contract for a future commercial product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.C.C. \u00a7 2-105(2) (\"purported present sale of future good or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell\"). The fact that the clearly-described \"products\" had not yet received FDA approval at the time of the contracting does not\n   change this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II.A.3. Moreover, because the sale was made more than one year prior to the application date of the patents-in-suit, the MGI Agreement satisfies the pre-AIA sale prong under\n   <em>\n    Pfaff\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pfaff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076321\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/55/#p63\">\n    525 U.S. at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076321\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/55/#p63\">\n    119 S.Ct. 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Parties' arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-513\">\n   Helsinn first argues that the Oread and SP Agreements were service contracts, in which Oread and SP provided services like manufacturing, formulation development, and analytical development to Helsinn. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 353 at 96.) Helsinn analogizes this case to\n   <em>\n    Trading Technologies\n   </em>\n   , wherein the Federal Circuit held that inventors may request another entity to perform services without violating the on-sale bar. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trading Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215552\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/1340/\">\n    595 F.3d at 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Helsinn asserts that its agreements with Oread and SP were similar in that they were for the development of products embodying the '219 patent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 353 at 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-514\">\n   Helsinn also argues that the Oread and SP Agreements were for developmental batches of its product, thus falling outside the \"commercial sale\" scope of the on-sale bar. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 97.) Helsinn distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Medicines Co.\n   </em>\n   , noting that the commercial batches produced in\n   <em>\n    Medicines Co.\n   </em>\n   violated the on-sale bar because \"[t]hey were stockpiled,\" marked with commercial numbers, and ready for shipping in anticipation of a launch. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 97-98.) Helsinn notes that the Oread and SP Agreements did not contemplate the purchase and sale of commercial batches; rather, the agreements were used \"for clinical development,...stability testing,\" and other services \"en route to seeking FDA approval.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 98.) Helsinn emphasizes that a pre-AIA analysis that invalidates patents based upon these developmental supplier agreements carries dangerous public policy implications because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-515\">\n   Small companies like Helsinn rely extensively on contract manufacturing organizations during the development process of getting a pharmaceutical product to the market....

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12.) Teva notes that Helsinn's interpretation of the Oread and SP Agreements as service contracts is tantamount to \"characteriz[ing] any sale of a product as a service contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Teva relies upon the Federal Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Medicines Co.\n   </em>\n   , although as this Court has noted, the Federal Circuit vacated this opinion after the parties' closing arguments in this case. Teva also notes that\n   <em>\n    Bone Care\n   </em>\n   is instructive in this case as the court held that the supply agreement between the parties \"was not for services rendered...but explicitly set forth terms related to the sale of goods.\"\n   <em>\n    Bone Care\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201068506\">\n    2012 WL 1068506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.

Teva argues that in similar cases where the company did not have the manufacturing ability to develop its own drug product, such as\n   <em>\n    Bone Care\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Medicines Co.\n   </em>\n   , the courts found that these agreements qualified as \"sales\" under the on-sale bar.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , dkt. 353 at 99.)

There is no dispute that Helsinn and Oread, and later Helsinn and SP, entered into binding contracts for the manufacture of developmental batches of palonosetron, including \"commercial scale\" batches to satisfy NDA requirements.

The MGI Agreement defined \"Products\" as \"the pharmaceutical preparations for human use in I.V. dosage form containing the Compound as an active ingredient in the formulation that will be described in the Registration....\" (DTX-115-0007.) Helsinn analogizes this case to\n   <em>\n    Elan\n   </em>\n   , arguing that in both cases, the product was unspecified at the time the agreement was formed, and it was unclear as to whether a product actually existed at the time of the alleged offer for sale.

Helsinn argues as a threshold matter that the on-sale bar requires disclosure of the claimed invention, rather than the fact that a sale has merely occurred or will occur. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 353 at 88.) Helsinn asserts that in order for a claimed invention to become available to the public and trigger the on-sale bar, the \"very specific set of claim limitations\" must be disclosed.

Teva notes that the Federal Circuit, in\n   <em>\n    Enzo\n   </em>\n   , summarily dismissed the patentholder's vagueness argument because the contract imposed \"upon Enzo the obligation to sell and on Ortho the obligation to purchase....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enzo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928421\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/1276/#p1282\">\n    424 F.3d at 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, under a pre-AIA analysis, the Court's analysis would end here with a conclusion that the MGI Agreement constituted a contract for sale, thus satisfying the \"sale\" prong of the on-sale bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-549\">\n   However, the post-AIA on-sale bar also requires that the sale or offer for sale make the claimed invention available to the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) (barring patentability if \"the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention\").

Teva asserts that the Form 8-K and Helsinn's press releases made the existence of the agreement available to the public. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 226 at 40-41.) However, MGI's Form 8-K was redacted and indicated only that Helsinn and MGI had entered into an agreement to purchase Helsinn's product. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , dkt. 226 at 14.) Additionally, Helsinn's press releases only disclosed the existence of the agreement between Helsinn and MGI. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Insofar as these documents publicized the parties' MGI Agreement, Teva is correct. But the post-AIA on-sale bar inquiry is not focused on the public disclosure of the sale or offer for sale; rather, the \"sale\" prong of the on-sale bar requires that the sale make the claimed invention available to the public one year prior to its critical date. Teva has failed to show how MGI's Form 8-K or Helsinn's press releases on the MGI Agreement made Helsinn's\n   <em>\n    claimed invention\n   </em>\n   , i.e., its palonosetron formulation, available to the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.A.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-551\">\n   The Court finds, for the reasons stated above, that the post-AIA on-sale bar does not apply to the MGI Agreement because the sale or offer or sale did not make Helsinn's claimed invention available to the public one year prior to the critical date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-552\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

(Dkt. 324 at 4-14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-572\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf testified that in his opinion, a person of ordinary skill in the clinical sciences would know as of January 30, 2002 that palonosetron administered to a human reduces the likelihood of CINV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31.) The key documents that he discussed in support of that opinion he listed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-573\">\n   \u2022 the Phase II 2330 study records;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-574\">\n   \u2022 the July, 1998 Helsinn Clinical Meeting Minutes;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-575\">\n   \u2022 the November, 1999 proposed Phase III protocols Helsinn sent to the FDA;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-576\">\n   \u2022 the September, 2000 Helsinn press release announcing the Phase III start;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-577\">\n   \u2022 the Phase III study documents; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-578\">\n   \u2022 a declaration later filed with the USPTO [not in the same patent family\n   history] addressing invention timing issues (\"Cantoreggi declaration\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-579\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-580\">\n   Addressing the Phase II study 2330 records, Dr. Fruehauf referred to the text and a table in the Final Report of that study dated July 1995, DTX-0227-0005. He said the design of the study was \"a very strong design for a Phase II trial.\" (Dkt. 324 at 36.) He summarized that the basic objective of the study, as stated in the text, was to determine whether palonosetron, over a dose range of 1 to 90 micrograms per kilogram, given to patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy, would reduce the likelihood of CINV. The primary endpoint to be studied was complete control at 24 hours, defined as no nausea and no vomiting. A secondary endpoint studied was called \"complete response,\" meaning no vomiting but some nausea reported. He pointed to the stated conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-581\">\n   Palonosetron, administered as a single IV injection of 3, 10, 30 or 90 pg/kg...was effective in suppressing [CINV] for 24 hours. All four doses were approximately equally effective as compared with the combined results from a cohort of 0.3 and 1 pg/kg.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-582\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-583\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf discussed the Complete Control figures in the table presented with that study 2330 conclusion, which is shown here in the margin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   He stated that in his opinion, if a person of skill in clinical sciences were to see this Syntex data as of 1995, \"it would be clear that the drug at the .25 mg dose [equivalent to 3 mcg/kg in the table] reduced the likelihood of nausea and vomiting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-44 (bracketed text added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-584\">\n   He was questioned by counsel for Helsinn about that table, and acknowledged that the \"Complete Control\" line-the primary endpoint of the study-showed there was no statistically significant difference between results for the bottom doses of 0.3-1 mg and any of the higher doses, including the 3 mcg/kg [0.25 mg] dose, except the 30 mcg/kg [2.1 mg] dose indicated with an asterisk. He said, \"[t]hat is correct from a statistical perspective.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130-34.) He also confirmed his awareness that in general, the FDA will not allow an indication to be claimed for a drug without a showing of statistical significance of an outcome for the primary efficacy endpoint of a study. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-585\">\n   He was also asked if he knew that the Syntex Formulation Book, as a result of all the analyses of the Phase II studies in May of 1995, recommended a palonosetron dose of 1 milligram for Phase III CINV trials. He said he was not aware of that fact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145-46, citing DTX-0254 and DTX-1023.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-586\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf was also shown the FDA's comments and instructions in the March 10, 1999 meeting with Helsinn, where the FDA said \"[d]ue to a lack of dose response in this study, these data are inadequate to serve as pivotal efficacy support,\" and the\n   FDA allowed Helsinn to re-analyze the 2330 data using historical controls in order to offer it as \"supportive data\" for efficacy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 137-38.) He said in his opinion the FDA made a mistake about that; he said, \"I think it [the 2330 study] did have a dose response. I think it was just a misunderstanding on the part of the [FDA] reviewer....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 137-38, 198-99 (bracketed text added).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained that in his view, because the lowest doses showed low effect (albeit not in statistically significant numbers), and because the next four doses were all equivalent, that was a dose response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198-99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-587\">\n   The next document Dr. Fruehauf discussed in support of his opinion was the July 1998 Helsinn Clinical Meeting Minutes, reflecting the week-long meeting in Palo Alto, CA attended by scientists from Helsinn, the former Syntex, and consultants including Dr. Gandara.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   n. 17\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   and accompanying text. There, the outcome of the meeting was to further study doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.0 mg, and corresponding concentrations in a 5 ml solution, for possible use in the Phase III trials. (DTX-0015-0008, -0009.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-588\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf interpreted those discussions to indicate that Helsinn at the time regarded the 0.25 dose as the minimum effective dose, \"and they were going to take that with a couple of other doses that were higher into the Phase III study.\" He also said he agreed with Dr. Gandara's recommendation that \"3\u00b5g/kg was most likely the correct dose for CINV.\" (Dkt. 324 at 48-49, citing DTX-0015-0008, -0012.) His basis for that opinion was \"[b]ecause I think it's clear from the [Phase II] trial that the .25 milligram dose was the inflexion point, and after that you've saturated the receptors and that that's the minimally effective dose, and you want to avoid higher doses because, as you go up on doses, you're more likely to get side effects.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50 (bracketed text added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-589\">\n   On cross-examination, Dr. Fruehauf agreed that the stated outcome of the 1998 Helsinn Clinical Meeting was to keep the 2.0 mg dose in the selected group, and that dose was equivalent to the 30 mcg/kg dose that was shown as the only statistically significant dose in the Phase II 2330 study primary endpoint data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 154-55.) He also acknowledged that although he routinely participates in clinical trials in his medical work, he has never been personally involved in the selection of a specific dosage of a drug in a treatment that was eventually approved by the FDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-590\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf also relied upon his reading of the proposed Phase III protocols that Helsinn submitted to the FDA dated November 15, 1999. (DTX-0293.) He referred to the statement that \"[d]ata from [the 2330] study clearly demonstrate that the 3 \u00b5g/kg dose of palonosetron is the minimal effective dose in preventing\n   CINV.\" (DTX-0293-0035 (bracketed text added).) He stated that he agreed with this statement, which was based on the same data shown in the table in the 1995 Final Report (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   n. 55\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ). He said that in his opinion, if a person of skill were to see this statement to the FDA, \"[t]hey would interpret this statement as to indicate that the Phase II study showed that the .25 milligram dose could reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting.\" (Dkt. 324 at 55-56.) The version of that 2330 study table contained in the November 1999 Phase III protocols, however, carried forward the same lack of statistical significance for Complete Response for any dose except the 30 mcg/kg, equivalent to 2.0 mg, dose. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-0293-0034.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-591\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf also cited the Helsinn press release of September 14, 2000, announcing the commencement of the Phase III trials. There, the company said, \"[t]he Phase II trials demonstrated the efficacy of Palonosetron in the prevention of emesis with no significant side effects....\" (Dkt. 324 at 56-57.) He said that in his view, a person of skill in the art would understand from this statement that Helsinn knew that palonosetron reduced the likelihood of emesis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-592\">\n   He also recognized, however, that when the database from the earliest of those trials was unblinded but not fully analyzed at the other end of the Phase III trials in January 2002, the Helsinn press release on January 16, 2002 said \"[w]e are pleased to have completed all patient treatment and to have begun analysis of the data collected in the palonosetron clinical program.\" That press release said \"The Phase 2 clinical trial results were promising, and we are hopeful that the Phase 3 Palonosetron data will demonstrate that it can make a difference for cancer patients suffering from CINV.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182-83, citing DTX-0040.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-593\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf next discussed the fact that the \"preliminary\" data tables for PALO-99-03, dated January 7, 2002, which Helsinn sent to the FDA with its letter of February 7, 2002, turned out to be identical to the corresponding final data tables contained in the Clinical Study Report for that trial dated July 19, 2002. Teva's counsel asked him if it would be surprising that those results in the final report were identical to the preliminary analysis. He replied, \"[t]hey have to be because this was the pre-stipulated result of the unblinded data which had been locked so it can't change.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-594\">\n   He said that fact supported his opinion \"[t]hat we have a clear understanding from a Phase II study that .25 was the minimal effective dose that was carried forward into Phase III, and in the Phase III trial, that .25 milligram dose was very effective at reducing the likelihood of CINV in a prospective randomized trial.... Prospective is you plan it in advance, and you do what you plan to do, and you can't change what you plan to do.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He did not deny, however, that as of January 7, 2002, the figures Helsinn had in hand were preliminary figures only. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-595\">\n   The last document relied upon by Dr. Fruehauf for his opinions was a declaration filed by Helsinn in the USPTO on Sept. 2, 2010, in support of a patent application that was not part of the same patent family history as the patents-in-suit, but it did relate to a proposed method of treatment claim for acute and delayed CINV using a 0.25 mg dose of palonosetron. The first declarant listed was Helsinn executive Sergio Cantoreggi, and the other two declarants were company owners Enrico and Riccardo Braglia. (DTX-0287-0413 (\"Cantoreggi declaration\").) It stated that Alberto Macciocchi, who was the project manager for the PALO-99-03 study, was then deceased, and the purpose of the declaration\n   was \"to establish that Alberto Macciocchi, Enrico Braglia and Riccardo Braglia had conceived the idea to use palonosetron for the treatment of acute and delayed-onset CINV, and had conducted clinical trials in humans to test this idea, at least as early as October 2, 2001.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-596\">\n   Referring to the Clinical Study Report for PALO-99-03 dated July 19, 2002, attached to the declaration as Exhibit A, the Cantoreggi declaration stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-597\">\n   2) We submit this declaration to establish that Alberto Macciocchi, Enrico Braglia, and Riccardo Braglia had conceived the invention defined by claim 1 of this application, and reduced it to practice, before November 16, 2001, the date that Dr. Piraccini published abstract no. 5169 in Blood, vol. 98, no. 11 part 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-598\">\n   3) In particular, we submit this declaration to establish that Alberto Macciocchi, Enrico Braglia, and Riccardo Braglia had conceived the idea to use palonosetron for the treatment of acute and delayed-onset CINV, and had conducted clinical trials in humans to test this idea, at least as early as October 2, 2001.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-599\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-600\">\n   17) Thus, we had conceived the idea to use 0.25 mg. palonosetron for the treatment of acute and delayed-onset CINV, as described in claim 1, at least as early as August 1, 2001 (the date that the study began).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-601\">\n   18) Most important, we had successfully tested the method in human patients, and we had done so before October 2, 2001 (the date the study was completed).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-602\">\n   19) As reported on page 8 of Exhibit A,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-603\">\n   \"Pairwise testing revealed differences between palonosetron 0.25 mg and ondansetron in favor of palonosetron 0.25 mg. for...number of emetic episodes on Study Days 1, 2, 3 and the time period 0 to 120 hours....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-604\">\n   (DTX-0287-0413, -0415.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-605\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf testified that his reading of this declaration indicates that Helsinn was saying that \"they knew the result, they knew that .25 milligrams was effective to reduce the risk of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, by October 2nd, 2001.\" (Dkt. 324 at 71.) The reference to October 2, 2001 is, of course, the \"last patient out\" date, as stated on the first page of the Clinical Study Report for PALO-99-03 dated July 19, 2002, which was attached to the declaration as Exhibit A. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-0287-0418.) Dr. Fruehauf opined that in his experience, saying that they had \"successfully tested the method in humans...before October 2, 2001,\" would mean \"that they had some understanding from the result of the study and that it was successful.\" (Dkt. 324 at 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-606\">\n   He gave his theory about how Helsinn could have asked the CRO conducting the clinical trial to do some calculations of broad averages in the blinded data before that \"last patient out\" date, stating that a person of ordinary skill could do the same calculations if they had access to the data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On cross-examination, he said he himself did not know what \"reduced to practice\" meant in the declaration because it is a legal term, so he would not know how those declarants interpreted that term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 157-58.) He also said that his theory about Helsinn possibly having obtained broad efficacy information about the blinded data prior to the \"last patient out\" date of October 2, 2001 was not supported by any evidence and was just his speculation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-607\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf further testified that the inactive excipients in the Phase III formula would not impact the efficacy of the 0.25 mg dose when administered to a patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-608\">\n   Therefore, he said, if a person of ordinary skill in the clinical sciences understood that the Phase II formulation with 0.25 mg was effective for CINV, he or she would expect the Phase III formulation to behave in a similar fashion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-609\">\n   The ultimate opinion expressed by Dr. Fruehauf was stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-610\">\n   I think it would be clear to a person of skill in the clinical arts, based on the Syntex Phase II study, [and] based on unblinded data analysis of PALO-99-03 where that output was January 7th, and Cantoreggi's declaration that would potentially rely on blinded data, that it was clear that the .25 milligram dose reduced the likelihood of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-611\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89 (bracketed text added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-612\">\n   Dr. Fruehauf also stated that he disagreed with the opinions stated by Helsinn's expert, Dr. Peck, to the effect that one would need two prospective randomized blinded trials, fully analyzed, to know that the 0.25 mg dose reduced the risk of CINV as claimed in the '219 patent. He said he considered FDA criteria and Patent Office criteria to be different. He again stated that in his opinion, on the strength of the Phase II study as confirmed in the first Phase III study, it was clear that the 0.25 mg dose was effective for that purpose. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-613\">\n   <em>\n    Dr. Peck\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-614\">\n   Helsinn presented opinion testimony of Dr. Carl Peck on the \"ready to patent\" prong of the on-sale bar issue. Dr. Peck is an M.D. with board certifications in internal medicine and in clinical pharmacology who also had a Fulbright fellowship in physical chemistry and a research fellowship in clinical pharmacology focused on pharmacokinetics and biostatistics and involving clinical trials. For many years he was in the U.S. Army, practicing medicine and researching and teaching. That service included founding the division of clinical pharmacology at the Uniformed Services University of Health Services, a military medical school in Washington, D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-615\">\n   He was next recruited to become the director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, CDER, where he served for six years and was personally involved in reviewing numerous INDs and NDAs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next he went to Georgetown University as a professor of pharmacology, founding the Center for Drug Development Science and consulting with companies. He is currently consulting and is designated as a \"special government employee\" available to consult with the FDA. He was accepted to testify as an expert in scientific standards regarding determinations of the efficacy and safety of pharmaceutical drug products. (Dkt. 337 at 4-16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-616\">\n   Dr. Peck testified with reference to the asserted limitations of the patents-in-suit claiming a formulation intended for IV administration to a human to reduce the likelihood of CINV. He stated that in his opinion, a POSA in the relevant time period would require \"fully analyzed results of two adequate and well controlled Phase III studies\" in order to determine that a drug formulation would be effective for reducing the likelihood of CINV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) It was further his opinion that the pharmaceutical formulations relevant to the patents-in-suit \"were not known to work for their intended purpose of reducing the likelihood of\n   CINV in human patients\" before January 30, 2002. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-617\">\n   Dr. Peck gave three reasons for his opinions. First, the results of a single Phase III trial would not be sufficient for a POSA to know that the drug was efficacious. Second, assuming that the results of a single Phase III were sufficient, the preliminary results from such a study would provide only insufficient information. Third, under the \"impossible hypothetical\" that Phase III trials were not needed in this case, the Phase II 2330 study as reported \"provided only a signal,\" and the FDA itself said it was insufficient as a pivotal trial, so that would also not be sufficient to convince a POSA of efficacy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He added that a pharmaceutical formulation could not be used for IV administration to a human to reduce the likelihood of CINV without FDA approval, except under an active FDA-approved IND. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-618\">\n   He stated that the standards he employed were scientific standards that he thinks a POSA (as defined by plaintiffs) would embrace. He explained that \"[t]hese are standards that have been developed by a consensus of scientists over many decades. Since FDA is a science-based agency and...uses science all the time in its review and guidance and decisions,\" he referred to FDA standards in forming his opinions in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) He testified that the FDA is very highly regarded as a scientific and regulatory agency, stating, \"I think scientists in the industry and scientists in the academic community recognize that those standards are their standards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-619\">\n   Dr. Peck testified that with regard to clinical trials, the FDA sets the standards, and it provides guidance. Importantly, he said, it has \"articulated a statistical framework for being able to really know from the data, particularly data that's highly variable, that a drug is working.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-620\">\n   Addressing Dr. Fruehauf's reliance on Phase II data in his opinion testimony, Dr. Peck commented that \"Phase II studies, with a few exceptions, are never capable of permitting a POSA to really know that the drug will be effective in the broad range of patients that will be candidates for the drug if and when the drug is actually approved.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.) He explained the reasons included that those studies are typically small, they are often very limited in the type of patients, and they often produce confusing results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-621\">\n   Contrasting the purpose and structure of Phase II trials with that of Phase III trials, Dr. Peck described Phase III trials as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-622\">\n   [T]he basic standard for knowing that a drug will work, and one that you can generalize to all patients that would be candidates in the future, are the Phase III trials. These are defined as adequate and well controlled, meaning they're large. They're structured with sound statistical principles. There is a wide range of patients...so that they are representative. And they're positioned, also, to provide a much richer collection of data that will be important to the prescriber and to the patient that can be articulated in the prescribing information, the so-called drug label.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-623\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-624\">\n   He also explained the reason why two Phase III trials are generally necessary to know whether a pharmaceutical product would work for its intended purpose, which is replication. \"[S]cientists always know that one experiment is not necessarily reproducible.... [T]he basic, good science requires replication. So you need at least two.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He said that 40 to 60 percent of Phase II trials that advance to Phase III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-625\">\n   do not result in approved drugs because one or more of the trials will fail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He added that a typical Phase III program in 2003 and at present, as illustrated by the Phase III trials in this case, are done in different centers by different investigators around the world, so there is independence in the replication design. He said that a drug such as palonosetron would not qualify for a single Phase III trial to get FDA approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-626\">\n   Dr. Peck reviewed the same Phase II 2330 study documents on which Dr. Fruehauf had testified. Looking at the Final Report of that study dated July 1995, Dr. Peck testified that this was one of five Phase II studies. He said it was \"an exploratory dose-ranging study.... And the purpose of this was to evaluate graded doses to evaluate the safety and to identify a possible signal of benefit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40.) He noted that it was a small study; most of the patients were male and none had received a chemotherapeutic agent before; and \"that was quite unrepresentative of any broader population.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-627\">\n   Looking at the data in the summary table of the 2330 Final Report,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   n. 55\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Peck did point out that in the entire table there were only two findings of statistical significance, and both of them were at the 30 mcg/kg level. He also stated that there was no \"ordered dose response,\" because even the stated results for 3 to 90 mcg/kg were 46, 40, 50, and 46. He was asked whether that could indicate that an efficacy plateau was reached at the 3 mg/kg [0.25 mg] level, and he said that was only one hypothesis that could arise from that raw data. Indeed, he said, in the other Phase II studies that were done, the best dose was one of the others.

I really can't conclude anything from the 24 versus 46 because this could change in the next study.

He stated that the names of FDA representatives included the CDER division director, the medical team leader, and the medical officer (primary reviewer on the product)-all of whom were M.D.'s, as well as two pharmacologists and a chemist. He chaired many such meetings himself, he said, and has been to many more since leaving his CDER director position in 1993. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-630\">\n   He highlighted the various portions of those minutes where the FDA communicated that the Phase II 2330 study data \"did not show a convincing dose-response pattern.\" As he characterized that discussion at the meeting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-631\">\n   FDA says, well, look, first of all, there's a lack of dose response in that study, so, therefore, we really can't entertain that data set, as is, to support. However, there is a possibility-and this is implied in the future, there is a possibility-that the data itself may be useful as supportive data. So, this is basically a \"no,\" that study is insufficient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-632\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-633\">\n   He also reviewed the re-analysis report of the 2330 study data that the FDA permitted Helsinn to use as support for its pivotal Phase III study PALO-99-05, PTX-182. He said it was a lengthy report that made adjustments to the data, then constructed\n   an \"historical placebo\" comparator [the study itself was not designed with a placebo], and did a statistical analysis of all that data. \"And with those adjustments,\" he said, \"it turns out that the .25 milligram and the .75...both of them were statistically significantly different from this historical placebo, which permitted then the revised data, and analysis, to be viewed by FDA to be adequate to support the already available Phase III trial [referring to PALO-99-05, the HEC trial] that had demonstrated effectiveness.\" He noted the date of that re-analysis report in August 2002, well after the critical date of January 30, 2002. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-60 (bracketed text added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-634\">\n   Addressing Helsinn's April 7, 2000 letter to the FDA submitting the November 15, 1999 proposed protocols for the three Phase III studies, Dr. Peck highlighted the contents in those documents where Helsinn said the Phase II results \"suggested\" efficacy, and that the Phase III trials were designed \"to support the hypotheses\" that palonosetron was not inferior to existing setrons. He said, \"the key word here is 'hypothesis'. We don't know. If they knew, they would have filed a new drug application. They know that more studies have to be done and they're requesting permission to undertake three new...Phase III studies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-635\">\n   Dr. Peck described the three full-scale Phase III trials as all using an historical placebo control model, as well as two different comparators (ondansetron and dolasetron), and large numbers of patients at different centers. He said those were \"three adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials.\" Only the first of those three, the PALO-99-03 study, was unblinded before January 30, 2002. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-636\">\n   The sequence of events after the \"last patient out\" date of October 2, 2001, reflected in the Clinical Study Report for PALO-99-03, was reviewed and explained by Dr. Peck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.C.10. In response to Dr. Fruehauf's discussion of the Cantoreggi declaration and his \"hypothetical\" analysis of the pre-October 2, 2001 blinded data theorized by Dr. Fruehauf, Dr. Peck said he thought it would be impossible to try to guess what the efficacy outcomes were, even if the sponsor could get access to the data; nor were there any such requests reflected in the study records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-637\">\n   Dr. Pecks's explanation of the major analytical process necessary, according to the PALO-99-03 protocols, before and after the \"unblinding date\" of January 2, 2002, is described above in Section I.C.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-638\">\n   Referring to the Helsinn letter of February 7, 2002, transmitting to the FDA \"the preliminary data for Complete Response,\" Dr. Peck said \"the author of that letter knew exactly what he was saying. This is preliminary. This is not final. And we're just showing you a couple tables.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-639\">\n   Dr. Peck said that the tables attached to that February 7, 2002 Helsinn letter to the FDA were one of probably 300 tables that were under analysis at the time, and the table is expressly represented as preliminary data. He said that to evaluate the data reliably, one would need all of the supporting information and more statistical data, as was done for the final Clinical Study Report dated July 19, 2002. He said that although there is no indication that the raw data of the study was changed after the \"locked\" date, there was at least one amendment to the statistical analysis plan on December 13, 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 165-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-640\">\n   He also did not agree with Dr. Fruehauf that there were no potential differences in the Phase II and Phase III efficacy results based on the different formulations used in those studies, referring to the saline-based\n   solution in Phase II and the full pharmaceutical formulation in Phase III. He said the buffers differed in their constituents, and the pH was different in the two sets of studies. \"So these are fundamentally different formulations,\" according to him.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-642\">\n   Proof that a claimed formulation has been reduced to practice requires clear and convincing evidence that the inventor (1) constructed an embodiment that met all the limitations, and (2) determined that the invention would work for its intended purpose.\n   <em>\n    Z4 Techs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046404\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/1340/#p1352\">\n    507 F.3d at 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether the formulation claimed in the patents-in-suit in this case was reduced to practice hinges on the timeline of testing and the knowledge that a person of ordinary skill would have developed in light of the historical facts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046404\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/1340/#p1352\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-643\">\n   Here, the issue is whether such person would likely know that the claimed intravenous pharmaceutical formulation containing palonosetron was effective for reducing the likelihood of emesis or CINV in a human as of the critical date of January 30, 2002. The Court finds that there is not clear and convincing evidence to establish this prong of the on-sale bar test for patent invalidity. Taking in order the documents relied upon by Teva and its expert on this point, the Court makes the following factual findings. Citations to all the testimony and exhibits on these points are contained in the preceding sections of this opinion. We will use the fixed dose measure in this discussion, e.g., 0.25 mg, rather than the weight-based measure, e.g., 3 mcg/kg, shown in some of the records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-644\">\n   The Phase II 2330 study data, as reported in the Final Report of that study dated July 1995, showed no statistical significance in the stated primary endpoint of Complete Control for 24 hours for any dosage below 2 mg. While the 2330 study was a well-designed Phase II study for its purpose, it lacked the scope and controls that would make it a valid prediction of efficacy at any dose. The FDA so informed Helsinn at the March 10, 1999 \"End of Phase II\" meeting, and the Court finds that was a scientifically valid observation that a POSA would make when viewing that documentation. Syntex, which presided over all four of the completed Phase II palonosetron trials, ended its research by recommending in its Formulation Book that Phase III use a 1.0 mg dose for CINV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-645\">\n   When Helsinn took over the palonosetron development project and assembled its project team of scientists, and advisors, they struggled long and hard to predict a possible minimum effective dose to take to Phase III trials. Even the highly respected clinician Dr. Gandara, who consulted at the week-long Helsinn Clinical Meeting in July 1998, could only posit that he thought 0.25 mg was \"most likely\" the correct dose for CINV. He was far superior to being an person of ordinary skill in the art, but that is how he viewed the problem at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-646\">\n   All present at that July 1999 Helsinn Clinical Meeting recognized that Phase III testing was essential to determine the efficacy and correct dosage of palonosetron in a completed pharmaceutical formulation for CINV. The fact that the outcome of that meeting in 1998 was a decision to continue to consider doses of 0.25, 0.75\n   and 2.0 is also a reflection of the uncertainty, in their view, of the results that might be obtained in Phase III. As Dr. Calderari also testified, even when he and Dr. Macciocchi continued debating the tradeoff between dosage and likely stability, Dr. Macciocchi still wanted to include a much higher dosage than 0.25 or 0.75 in Phase III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-647\">\n   The November 1999 proposed Phase III protocols, submitted to the FDA on April 7, 2000, made numerous statements of hopeful expectation about the 0.25 and 0.75 doses proposed for the trials. Nevertheless, the fact that Helsinn elected to test the two doses, including 0.75 mg, even though it would be a more cumbersome and expensive endeavor, reflected Helsinn's concern that it had no assurance of the efficacy at the 0.25 level. Helsinn was aware, as it stated there, that its \"hypotheses\" were to be tested in Phase III. Helsinn's statement in the same document that it was \"clear\" that 0.25 was the minimum effective dose was just one among many less confident statements in the proposal. Likewise, Helsinn's press release statement, at the start of patient enrollment for the trials, that \"the Phase II trials demonstrated the efficacy\" of the drug was in the nature of a marketing piece rather than any statement of scientific knowledge. Again, in context, the fact that Phase III trials were commencing meant that Helsinn had no such knowledge at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-648\">\n   This Court is also not persuaded that the \"preliminary\" unblinded data of the earliest Phase III study, PALO-99-03, shown in the three tables dated January 7, 2002, sent to the FDA on February 7, 2002, informed Helsinn or a POSA that the 0.25 mg dose was effective for CINV, which was the only kind of emesis that was even studied at the Phase III level. Those tables were generated a mere five days after the Phase III data was \"unblinded,\" and less than three weeks after the data was \"locked\" on December 19, 2001. More than six months of additional analytical work lay ahead at that time, leading to the final Clinical Study Report dated July 19, 2002. Indeed, there had already been one amendment to the statistical design of the study on December 13, 2001, and more amendments to the analytical process were entirely possible in the months to follow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-649\">\n   The fact that the summary tables of preliminary data dated January 7, 2002 did not undergo change in their contents during that analytical period, and that data was the same in the final Clinical Study Report as of July 19, 2002, does not in the view of the Court establish that the preliminary results were final. Quite the contrary; it would seem that in view of the changes in methodology that were entirely possible during the analytical period (as experts on both sides agreed), a POSA would not have been surprised at all to see those values change between the preliminary and the final numbers. The Helsinn press release on January 16, 2002 was consistent with that understanding, saying, \"[w]e are pleased to have completed all patient treatment and to have begun analysis of the data.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   n. 36\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-650\">\n   The Cantoreggi declaration did state factual truth, based on the historical evidence that the declarants were reconstructing for that PTO submission. It was in an unrelated patent family history, but the Court has carefully considered its content as relevant to the \"ready to patent\" issue here. The factual content of that declaration states that \"we had conceived\n   the idea to use 0.25 mg. palonosetron for the treatment of acute and delayed-onset CINV...as least as early as August 1, 2001 (the date that the study [PALO-99-03] began).\" \"[W]e had successfully tested the method in human patients, and we had done so before October 2, 2001 (the date the study was completed).\" (DTX-0287-0415 (bracketed text added).) Both of those facts were literally true. But there is no evidence in this record that Helsinn knew or could have known, until the results of the study were processed, locked, unblinded, and fully analyzed, that those results were successful, nor did the declarants so state. As for the declaration statement that the invention had been \"reduced to practice\" before November 16, 2001, that was not a statement of historical fact but a use of legal language to support an ultimate factual conclusion at best, and is not binding upon this Court in analyzing the factual issues here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-651\">\n   Teva's expert, Dr. Fruehauf, opined that the results of the Phase II 2330 study, coupled with the preliminary results of the Phase III PALO-99-03 study, were sufficient to have informed a POSA that palonosetron was effective to reduce the likelihood of CINV (which is emesis, as claimed in the first three patents-in-suit), and also that the 0.25 dose of palonosetron was effective to reduce the risk of CINV as claimed in the '219 patent. This Court does not find that the evidence supports such a finding under the clear and convincing standard of proof that applies to this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-652\">\n   It is not necessary for the Court to make a further ruling as to whether, as Dr. Peck opined, fully analyzed results of two adequate and controlled Phase III studies were necessary in this particular case to establish the efficacy of the claimed palonosetron formulation. The date when the action stopped, for purposes of the on-sale bar in this case, was January 30, 2002. At that time there were no fully analyzed Phase III studies in this case. Further, as the Court has found, the Phase II data would have been wholly insufficient at that time to support any valid scientific knowledge of efficacy as claimed. Accordingly, for the reasons stated here, and based on all other historical facts described in Section I.C, the Court finds that the patent challenger has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that as of January 30, 2002, the inventor had determined that the invention would work for its intended purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-653\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Findings and conclusions on written description\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-664\">\n   Teva asserts that if the Court finds that fully complete Phase III data would be required as claim support in order for the '219 patent to be \"ready for patenting\" under the on-sale bar, then that patent is invalid for lack of written description because there is no Phase III data, or for that matter any preclinical or clinical efficacy data, in the specification. (Dkt. 312 at 34-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-665\">\n   Helsinn argues that the '219 patent specification does satisfy the written description requirement in that it does describe the claimed inventions, both as to formula and as to efficacy. Helsinn cites the formula embodiment described in the specification, \"the palonosetron is supplied in vials that comprise 5 ml. of solution, which equate to about 0.25 mg of palonosetron at a concentration of about 0.05 mg/ml.\" (DTX-0268, col. 10, lines 7-8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   dkt. 311 at 39.) The efficacy information described in the specification is further cited on this point:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-666\">\n   Recently, clinical investigations have been made concerning palonosetron, a new 5-HT3 receptor antagonist reported in U.S. Pat. No. 5,202,333. These investigations have shown that the drug is an order of magnitude more potent than most existing 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, has a surprising half-life of about 40 hours, and is effective to reduce delayed-onset nausea induced by chemotherapeutic agents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-667\">\n   (DTX-0268, col. 1, lines 43-54;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   dkt. 311 at 39-40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-668\">\n   A second point emphasized by Helsinn is that the on-sale bar \"ready for patenting\" prong is measured on the date one year prior to the patent application filing date, whereas written description information includes that intervening year and what a POSA would know from publicly available data as of the application date. (Dkt. 320 at 102.) Here, it is undisputed that between January 30, 2002 and January 30, 2003, there was at least one public disclosure of details about the clinical efficacy of the 0.25 mg dose. The PALO-99-04 study results were summarized, in an abstract presented by Helsinn's Dr. Macciocchi and researchers who worked on that trial, at a conference of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (\"MASCC\") on June 23-26, 2002 in Boston. (PTX-297.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section I.C.11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Teva's expert Dr.\n   Fruehauf agreed that the data shown in that Grunberg abstract supports the stated conclusion of the authors. (Dkt. 324 at 124-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-669\">\n   Finally, Helsinn argues that the\n   <em>\n    Allergan\n   </em>\n   decision \"slammed the door\" on the written description defense as asserted here, as the Federal Circuit held that a claim that recites a property that is necessarily inherent in the formulation is not invalid for lack of written description, even if such property is not \"explicitly described.\" (Dkt. 353 at 152.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-670\">\n   The Court finds that the specification of the '219 patent provides an adequate written description of the efficacy of the invention claimed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The specification discloses the claimed formulations, and the Court finds that as of the provisional application date of January 30, 2003, a skilled artisan \"would immediately discern the claimed formulation in that disclosure.\" Moreover, actual data from the PALO-99-04 Clinical Study was publicized by Helsinn at the MASCC conference in June 2002. The Court is also persuaded by\n   <em>\n    Allergan\n   </em>\n   , which held that a property inherent to a claimed formulation is not lacking a written description merely because the property is not \"explicitly described\" in the specification.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rather, the critical inquiry is whether the formulation itself is adequately described.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-671\">\n   Here, the Court is satisfied that Helsinn's claim for a palonosetron formulation \"to reduce the likelihood of cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting\" is adequately supported by the written description in the specification.

Moreover, Teva points out that the asserted patent claims require a formulation that has a 5 ml sterile aqueous isotonic solution, whereas Teva's 0.075 mg/1.5 ml product has a solution volume of only 1.5 ml. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lastly, Teva notes that Plaintiffs' intended use language is \"to reduce the likelihood of cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)

Teva argues that Plaintiffs misconstrued the holding in\n   <em>\n    Sunovion\n   </em>\n   , noting that \"the Sunovion court used the ANDA specification to define the product on which to base the infringement inquiry.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Teva emphasizes that its ANDA specification defines the product-0.075 mg/1.5 ml-and that \"there is no question that the 0.075 mg/1.5 ml product, as described in Teva's ANDA, does not meet the limitations of the '219 patent.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-693\">\n   Teva further distinguishes\n   <em>\n    AstraZeneca\n   </em>\n   by noting that regardless of whether the Federal Circuit established a substantive test for infringement under \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A), the court nevertheless held that the patentholder failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the ANDA applicant had infringed the asserted patent claims.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 342 at 147-48, 152 (sealed).) Dr. Amidon explained that a POSA composed of different fields was necessary because of the interdisciplinary nature of drug development. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 152.) He explained that a pharmaceutical scientist is necessary for the \"physical chemistry and preformulation science\" involved in drug development. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153.) A clinician is required to establish \"clinical parameters,\" i.e., the dose and the efficacy of the drug. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 157.) Dr. Amidon also testified that while a formulation scientist would be involved throughout the entire drug development process, it is the formulation scientist's expertise that ensures a stable product and addresses any manufacturing issues that may arise towards the end of a drug development project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 158-59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-708\">\n   Dr. Amidon's testimony also touched upon the educational qualifications of a POSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 342 at 148.) He testified that a POSA would have a degree in a chemistry-related field (\"pharmaceutical chemistry,\" \"pharmacy,\" \"medicine,\" \"clinical pharmacology,\" or \"general pharmaceutical science\") with a B.S., M.S., Ph.D., or M.D. The POSA, by way of incorporating the skill set of a pharmaceutical scientist, would have a knowledge of statistics as well.

Dr. Kirsch also testified that a POSA would \"collaborate with others of ordinary skill in the art\" and would \"draw upon the knowledge and expertise of clinicians and pharmacologists....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-710\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-711\">\n   The parties do not seem to dispute that a POSA would have an advanced degree in a chemistry-related field, or alternatively, a bachelor's degree with a greater number of years of relevant experience. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   dkt. 342 at 148 (requiring \"two, three, four years\" of relevant experience \"depending\n   on the level of education\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   dkt. 326 at 19 (testifying that POSA would typically possess a Ph.D. in pharmaceutics or a related field and have \"a couple of years of experience\" in developing I.V. formulations).) The parties also do not dispute that the POSA would include a formulation scientist. (See dkt. 326 at 19; dkt. 342 at 152.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-712\">\n   However, the parties disagree about whether the POSA also should include the knowledge and skills of a clinician or a pharmaceutical scientist, or whether it suffices that the formulation scientist \"collaborates\" with these individuals. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Helsinn contends that the POSA would take into account the interdisciplinary nature of drug development and would include both a clinician and pharmaceutical scientist into the POSA definition; Teva argues that the POSA is limited to the formulation scientist. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-713\">\n   We find merit in Plaintiffs' contention that the person of ordinary skill in the art would possess all the attributes of a multi-member drug development team. The '219 patent is not limited to formulation, but rather includes treatment-like methods as the Court has construed it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DTX-0268, col. 10, lines 1-38; dkt. 290.) The parties have stipulated to a similar construction of the claim preambles of the '724, '725, and '424 patents. (Dkt. 290 at 12.) Thus, the \"pertinent art\" of these patents includes the field of pharmaceutical science, i.e., selecting the API and using the physical chemistry of the API to match it to a delivery system, formulation, or dosage form; the field of clinical medicine, i.e., establishing the dosing, volume, safety, and efficacy of the drug product; and the field of formulation pharmaceuticals, i.e., creating stable formulations of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in preparation for manufacturing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 342 at 134-36, 152-59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-714\">\n   Dr. Amidon's testimony on defining the POSA encompasses this entire drug development process and his hypothetical POSA included the various professionals and skill sets that are required during this process. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Conversely, Dr. Kirsch's hypothetical POSA did not consider crucial parts of the drug development process, such as selecting an API or dosage forms. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 353 at 128.) As Helsinn argued at trial, Teva's POSA analysis runs afoul of\n   <em>\n    Insite\n   </em>\n   , wherein the Federal Circuit cautioned against an \"overly narrow statement of the problem,\" as this can become a \"prohibited reliance on hindsight.\"\n   <em>\n    Insite Vision Inc. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   dkt. 353 at 128.) Here, Dr. Kirsch's hypothetical POSA \"is assigned a particular formulation problem\" with issues such as \"choosing active ingredients or dosage forms\" already decided. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 128.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-715\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that a person of ordinary skill in the art pertinent to the '219 patent would include a pharmaceutical scientist, clinician, and formulation scientist. The pharmaceutical scientist and formulation scientist would have two to four years of relevant experience in their field, as well as an advanced degree in a chemistry-related field, discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The clinician would have experience in \"the therapeutic area\" that is the focus of the API, or in this case, treating humans affected by cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    PTX-261.0007, .0008.) As discussed below in this Section, when Helsinn submitted its formal proposed Phase III protocols in April 2000, it had decided to simplify the protocols by specifying dosage in fixed-dose milligrams, rather than in relative micrograms per kilograms of patient weight, thus proposing 0.25 and 0.75 mg doses for Phase III. Throughout the trial evidence, including testimony by the parties' experts, those two different measurement forms were discussed in their equivalent values. Thus the parties recognized, for example, that 3 mcg/kg is equivalent to 0.25 mg.
