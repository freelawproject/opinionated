Its presence is accordingly irrelevant for purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   SUSAN RICHARD NELSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In November 2007, Plaintiff Ma Amba Minnesota, Inc. (\"Ma Amba\") purchased a motel in Albert Lea, Minnesota, and, in so doing, took over the flood insurance policy of the motel's prior owner. Although Ma Amba did not realize it at the time, this flood insurance policy only provided coverage for one of the motel's four buildings. Unaware of this condition, Ma Amba renewed the prior owner's insurance policy on an annual basis, always through Defendant Cafourek &amp; Associates, Inc. (\"Cafourek\"), its local insurance agent. About a decade later, though, in September 2016, a flood damaged\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   of the motel's buildings. It was only then that Ma Amba learned about the policy's \"one building\" limitation. Displeased at this situation, and seeking to recover its unclaimed losses, Ma Amba decided to sue Cafourek for negligence. In essence, Ma Amba argued that Cafourek, without prompting, should have told it about the \"one building\" limitation at some point between November 2007 and September 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Cafourek now moves for summary judgment. Ma Amba opposes the motion. Because the Court finds that Cafourek had no affirmative duty to inform Ma Amba of\n   any inadequacies in the at-issue insurance policy, and because no reasonable juror could find that Cafourek otherwise acted negligently toward Ma Amba, the Court grants Cafourek's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Ma Amba is a Minnesota corporation that owns only one asset: the Countryside Motel in Albert Lea, Minnesota. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A. Patel Dep. [Doc. No. 46-1] at 11.) Ma Amba, in turn, is owned by a married, college-educated couple named Abhi Patel (the husband) and Falguni Patel (the wife). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A. Patel Dec. [Doc. No. 51] \u00b6 5 (noting that he earned a B.S. from Gujarat University in India in the 1980s with a major in physics); F. Patel. Dec. [Doc. No. 52] \u00b6 3 (noting that she earned a B.S. from Gujarat University with a major in business administration and accounting).) The Patels live in Haines City, Florida, and have worked in the motel business for decades. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A. Patel Dep. at 5, 8;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   F. Patel Dep. [Doc. No. 46-2] at 6-7.) Moreover, since 2005, the Patels have personally owned and operated at least five motels, spread across four states. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A. Patel Dep. at 9, 111-12.) Currently, the Patels own three motels, including the Countryside Motel (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 8), and have incorporated each of those motels into a separate corporation (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). Abhi Patel is \"in charge of purchasing insurance\" for the Patels' motels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) And, over the years, he has purchased insurance for a variety of properties, and through a variety of agents. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant Cafourek &amp; Associates is an insurance agency based in Albert Lea, Minnesota; it has been in business since 1989. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ryan Cafourek Dep. [Doc. No. 46-4] at 7-8.) At all relevant times, Ryan Cafourek was one of the agency's owners (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 15), and Terin Smith-Bangert was an agent/customer service representative working beneath Mr. Cafourek (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Smith-Bangert Dep. [Doc. No. 46-3] at 11-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The facts in this case are neither complicated nor disputed in any material way. From an unknown point in time until November 2007, a man named Jay Bhakta owned the Countryside Motel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A. Patel Dep. at 18-19; Cafourek Dep. at 22-24.) Mr. Bhakta maintained an Auto-Owners Insurance flood insurance policy on the motel, which he had purchased through a (former) Cafourek agent named Rajesh Bhakta (no relation). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cafourek Dep. at 21-24; Smith-Bangert Dep. at 35-36.) However, for somewhat unclear reasons, Mr. Jay Bhakta only maintained flood insurance on one of the four buildings that comprised the Countryside Motel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cafourek Dep. at 37.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Apparently, both Mr. Bhakta and Mr. Cafourek were aware of this oddity, because of flooding that damaged two buildings in the \"early 2000s.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-38.) As Mr. Cafourek recalled during his deposition, even after this \"early 2000s flood,\" Mr. Bhakta did not once \"complain\" to Cafourek about his flood insurance policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Several years later, in November 2007, Mr. Bhakta sold the Countryside Motel to Abhi Patel/Ma Amba, in what was essentially a hand-shake deal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A. Patel Dep. at 18-22 (explaining that he had \"never seen\" Mr. Bhakta before this purchase, and that he bought the motel \"without much discussion\" or \"negotiation\").) In arranging\n   this transaction, the two men discussed neither flood insurance nor the earlier flooding incident. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21 (Q: Were there any discussions with Mr. Bhakta about insurance? A: No.... Q: Did Mr. Bhakta have any conversations with you about any flooding at the motel prior to you purchasing it? A: No.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Mr. Cafourek reached out to the Patels and asked if they wanted to continue using Cafourek &amp; Associates for the Countryside Motel's insurance needs (of which flood insurance was just a part). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cafourek Dep. at 27-28.) Mr. Patel agreed to continue working with Cafourek (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A. Patel Dep. at 22-25), and, with respect to flood insurance, simply requested that Cafourek provide Ma Amba \"the same thing [Mr. Bhakta] had\" (Cafourek Dep. at 28, 44). At Mr. Cafourek's instruction, then, Ms. Smith-Bangert transferred Mr. Bhakta's flood insurance policy into Ma Amba's name. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smith-Bangert Dep. at 37-43;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. 6-8 [Doc. Nos. 46-4 to 46-7] (transfer documentation).) Importantly, all parties agree that, during these initial conversations in 2007 and 2008, the Patels did not ask Cafourek any questions about the policy, and Cafourek, in turn, did not inform the Patels that the flood insurance policy only covered one building. As best the Court can tell, the parties did not discuss the issue at all. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A. Patel Dep. at 23-26; F. Patel Dep. at 9-11; Cafourek Dep. at 28-29.) Moreover, in the ensuing years, Mr. Patel did not discuss his flood insurance with anyone employed at Cafourek in any substantive manner. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A. Patel Dep. at 25 (\"Q: Prior to the flooding and the flood claim at the motel in Albert Lea, Minnesota, were there any communications with Ryan [Cafourek] or Terin [Smith-Bangert] about flood insurance at the motel? A: No.\").) Rather, on an annual basis, Mr. Patel would simply call Ms. Smith-Bangert to renew the policy at whatever dollar amount he desired for that year, and she would follow his instructions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smith-Bangert Dep. at 50-51; A. Patel Dep. at 25-30, 106-07.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 22, 2016, nearly a decade after Ma Amba took over Mr. Bhakta's policy, a flood from the nearby Albert Lea lake caused damage to two of the Countryside Motel's four buildings: a \"structure that had the office and [some] guest rooms,\" and a \"garage/shed.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A. Patel Dep. at 34-35.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Mr. Patel called Cafourek to inquire about his insurance coverage, he learned, to his surprise, that Ma Amba's flood insurance policy would only cover one of the two damaged buildings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A. Patel Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Mr. Patel was surprised by this news because, up until this incident, he had believed that that the policy covered all four buildings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A. Patel Dep. at 54.) This belief stemmed entirely from Mr. Patel's assumption that his policy\n   <em>\n    should have\n   </em>\n   covered his entire motel (based on his interpretation of the policy \"declaration page,\" which did not address the question one way or the other), and from Cafourek's supposed \"failure\" to inform him or his wife to the contrary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   F. Patel Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) However, neither Patel alleges that anyone from Cafourek affirmatively\n   told them that the policy covered all four buildings in the motel; again, it appears that the issue was simply not discussed. (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   A. Patel. Dep. at 102 (further emphasizing that, prior to the September 2016 flood, \"nobody told [him] anything\" about his insurance policy).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As such, following the September 2016 flood, Ma Amba applied for (and received) coverage for the damage caused to the \"structure that had the office and [some] guest rooms,\" but\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   for the damage caused to the \"garage/shed.\" (A. Patel Dep. at 34-35.) This discrepancy left Ma Amba with an unpaid insurance claim of approximately $18,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 5 [Doc. No. 59-5] at 6 (\"Garage/Shed Insurance Claim\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 9, 2018 Ma Amba filed this lawsuit against Cafourek and Auto-Owners Insurance Company (the provider of the policy). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [Doc. No. 1];\n   <em>\n    see also supra\n   </em>\n   at n.1.) In Ma Amba's complaint against Cafourek, which it amended on May 31, 2018, Ma Amba asserted claims of negligence, \"reformation of flood insurance policy,\" equitable estoppel, and \"declaratory judgment.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. [Doc. No. 28] \u00b6\u00b6 45-67.) On November 20, 2018, following discovery, Cafourek moved for summary judgment. The parties then submitted full briefing on the matter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. in Support of Summ. J. [Doc. No. 45] (\"Def.'s Br.\"); Pl.'s Br. in Opp. to Summ. J. [Doc. No. 55] (\"Pl.'s Opp. Br.\"); Def.'s Reply Br. [Doc. No. 60].) Following this briefing, but before oral argument, Ma Amba withdrew its \"reformation of flood insurance policy,\" equitable estoppel, and \"declaratory judgment\" claims, leaving only the one count of negligence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 10, 2019 Letter [Doc. No. 61].) The Court then heard oral argument on January 11, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Summary judgment is proper if there are no disputed issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Although Ma Amba contends that such \"reliance\" existed here, namely, because \"the Patels always relied on their insurance agents, including Cafourek, to provide them with adequate insurance coverages for their motels\" (Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 18), that argument is unavailing. The question is not whether the Patels\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   that they were relying on Cafourek to provide them with the best insurance coverage possible, but, rather, whether\n   <em>\n    objective circumstances\n   </em>\n   could have put Cafourek on notice that the\n   Patels had placed such \"reliance\" on its agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, all Cafourek knew about the Patels was that they were out-of-state motel owners, and that they only used Cafourek with respect to their Countryside Motel insurance needs (as opposed to their other business or personal insurance needs).

Put simply, the Patels requested a certain kind of commercial flood insurance coverage - \"the same thing [Mr. Bhakta] had\" - and Cafourek provided them with that coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at 4.) That was the extent of the parties' discussion on the matter.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Under these circumstances, it is hard to see why Mr. Cafourek (or anyone working at Cafourek) should have assumed that the Patels wanted a different flood insurance policy than the one they asked for, especially since the only indication of \"underinsurance\" had arisen years prior, and without complaint from the motel's then-insurance holder.

This case is thus a far cry from\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   , in which the Minnesota Court of Appeals denied the insurance agent summary judgment on the question of \"special circumstances.\" There, an insurance agent specifically undertook the complex task of determining what kind of driver liability policy to procure for a large, nationwide trucking corporation, with which the agent had an \"ongoing [business] relationship,\" and the corporation then relied on the agent's (arguably erroneous) advice in purchasing its liability policy, over the recommendation of a different insurance advisor.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9076974\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/671/186/#p196\">\n    671 N.W.2d at 188-93, 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is no dispute that Cafourek followed Ma Amba's instructions, in that it purchased the flood insurance policy Mr. Patel requested, and then renewed that policy on an annual basis in the amount desired by Mr. Patel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) However, Ma Amba contends, a reasonable juror\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   find that Cafourek \"did not act in good faith towards Ma Amba\" because \"Ryan Cafourek had knowledge of the prior flood and flood coverage problem but failed to inform Abhi and Falguni Patel of this information.\" (Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court disagrees.

At worst, it appears, Cafourek committed an unfortunate oversight by failing to inform the Patels prior to September 2016 that Ma Amba's flood insurance policy did not cover all of the Countryside Motel's buildings.
