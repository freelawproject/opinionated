DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Vacating Entry of Default\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The instant motion presents an unusual procedural question that only a\n   handful of courts have addressed (and the parties' briefs ignore). Polli's motion to intervene was granted; he now seeks to vacate the entry of default against his co-defendant, White Pines. It is unclear whether a defendant-intervenor like Polli has standing to challenge the entry of default on behalf of the defaulting defendant. It is true that the text of Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(c) is silent on which party may move to set aside a default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(c). However, the few courts that have found that a non-defaulting defendant has standing to seek to set aside an entry of default on behalf of a defaulting co-defendant require a close relationship between those defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Uranium Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1386880\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/1248/\">\n    617 F.2d 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1256 n.32 (7th Cir. 1980) (allowing defendants, which were subsidiaries of defaulting parties, to challenge a default judgment as the non-defaulting defendants would be adversely affected by the default judgment and faced potential economic harm);\n   <em>\n    United States v. Harvey\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV. 13-4023-KES,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202455533\">\n    2014 WL 2455533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D.S.D. June 2, 2014) (finding that non-defaulting individual defendant as the owner and alter ego of the defaulting corporation could challenge the entry of default);\n   <em>\n    Diamond Servs. Corp. v. Oceanografia SA de CV\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-0177,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20312368\">\n    2013 WL 312368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (W.D.La. Jan. 24, 2013) (finding that because the defendants were part of a single business enterprise, a non-defaulting co-defendant may challenge an entry of default against defaulting defendant). Such a relationship does not exist in this case. Polli alleges that he only worked as manager for White Pines; he was not a subsidiary or parent company of White Pines, the owner or alter ego of White Pines, and was not part of a single business enterprise with White Pines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In any event, even if Polli had standing to challenge the entry of default against White Pines, the practical result would be the same. In\n   <em>\n    Frow v. De La Vega\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that in a multi-defendant case where there is an entry of default against only one defendant, the proper course of action is to permit the non-defaulting parties to litigate the case while holding the entry of default in abeyance and deferring any final default judgment against the defaulting defendant.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425971\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/82/552/#p554\">\n    82 U.S. 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425971\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/82/552/#p554\">\n    15 Wall. 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425971\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/82/552/#p554\">\n    21 L.Ed. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1872) (\"[I]f the suit should be decided against the complainant on the merits, the bill will be dismissed as to all the defendants alike-the defaulter as well as the others. If it be decided in the complainant's favor, he will then be entitled to a final decree against all. But a final decree on the merits against the defaulting defendant alone, pending the continuance of the cause, would be incongruous and illegal.\"). Courts have explained this is the proper course of action as neither the plaintiff nor the non-defaulting defendant is prejudiced; the litigation proceeds, and both parties may take discovery and present evidence and argument. However, the defaulting defendant must be sanctioned to a limited degree for its failure to appear.\n   <em>\n    U. S. for Use of Hudson v. Peerless Ins.

But, as said in\n   <em>\n    Frow v.

When that is the case, entry of judgment also should\n   await an adjudication of the liability of the nondefaulting defendants.\" 10A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R.

The\n    <em>\n     Frow\n    </em>\n    rule seeks to prevent inconsistent judgments in cases involving joint liability or joint remedies. Some courts have interpreted\n    <em>\n     Frow\n    </em>\n    more broadly to apply when defendants are 'similarly situated,' even if not jointly liable. Thus, when defendants are 'similarly situated[,]' judgment should not be entered against a defaulting defendant if the other defendant prevails on the merits.\")\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall &amp; Ilsley Tr.

The Fourth Circuit has also applied the\n   <em>\n    Frow\n   </em>\n   rule beyond scenarios where defendants are subject to joint and several liability; in particular, the Circuit found that holding an entry of default in abeyance was proper when multiple claims or multiple parties are present in a case, and one party defaults.\n   <em>\n    U.

If declaratory judgment is granted in favor of Penn-America, neither Polli nor White Pines may recover money from Penn-America under the insurance policy. If declaratory judgment is granted in favor of Polli on his counterclaim, Polli and White Pines may obtain money from Penn-America (provided that Polli actually prevails on his underlying state tort claim against White Pines).

However, if there is a duty to defend, the Court may have to stay the case or hold the issue of whether there is a duty to indemnify in abeyance pending resolution of the underlying state proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mut.

Supp. 2d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534 (E.D. Va. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The instant case is different. In addition to seeking declaratory judgment on whether Penn-America has a duty to defend or indemnify under the policy, Penn-America also seeks declarations as to whether it has a duty to defend or indemnify in relation to Virginia's worker's compensation statute. The Court may look solely at the text of the policy and determine, for instance, whether the policy covers worker's compensation. That is, the Court may grant some of the worker's compensation-related declarations sought by Penn-America,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 27(d) (\"Penn-America has no duty to defend or indemnify White Pines in connection with the claims asserted in the Lawsuit under Coverage A because they are excluded from coverage by the Policy's Workers' Compensation and Similar Laws Exclusion[.]\"). However, the Court cannot merely compare the language of the state court complaint in the underlying state tort action with the language of the policy for other declarations sought by Penn-America. For instance, Penn-America asks the Court for a declaration that worker's compensation is the exclusive avenue for Polli to seek relief. Compl. \u00b6 27(d). To grant such a declaration, the Court would have to look beyond the allegations in the \"four corners\" of the Complaint and the general liability insurance policy because the allegations of the state court complaint do not address this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under Virginia Code \u00a7 65.2, a covered employee who is injured may not bring a tort claim against the employer, as the \"exclusive remedy is found in the worker's compensation statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Napper v. ABM Janitorial Servs.-Mid Atl., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20Va.%2055\">\n    284 Va. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=726%20S.E.2d%20313\">\n    726 S.E.2d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315 (2012). However, numerous exceptions exist. If the tort, for instance, was not directed to the victim as an employee or because of his employment, the injury does not arise out of the employment and the employee may bring a tort claim.\n   <em>\n    Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Hazelwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2092387\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/249/369/#p373\">\n    249 Va. 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 373,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=457%20S.E.2d%2056\">\n    457 S.E.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58 (1995). The employee and employer must meet the statutory definitions,\n   <em>\n    Hudson v. Jarrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632265\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/606/827/#p32\">\n    269 Va. 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632265\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/606/827/#p32\">\n    606 S.E.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830 (2005) ; for instance, employers with fewer than three employees are not subject to the act,\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v. Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3186847\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/50/199/#p210\">\n    50 Va.

Employers must also comply with all the requirements of the statute to enjoy immunity from tort liability. For instance, Virginia Code \u00a7 65.2-800 mandates that every employer \"shall\" secure worker's compensation insurance. Therefore, to grant the declaratory judgment sought by Penn-America, the Court must engage in numerous factual findings: that the underlying tort arose out of the employment relationship between Polli and White Pines, that Polli is an employee as defined by the statute, that White Pines is an employer as defined, and that White Pines complied with the worker's compensation scheme. These factual findings may all overlap with White Pines' defense in the underlying state court case, raising issues of duplicative litigation and preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, the Court turns to the fourth factor of whether the case is merely \"procedural fencing.\" Unlike the vast majority of cases on this issue, evidence exists on the record that this is the type of race to bring a declaratory judgment in federal rather than state court that the Fourth Circuit sought to prevent by identifying the fourth factor of the\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   test. After Penn-America rejected both White Pines' and Polli's demands for coverage, Polli's attorney emailed Penn-America's counsel on September 11, 2018 that Polli would be pursuing a declaratory judgment action, presumably in state court. ECF No. 9, Ex. D. Penn-America then filed the instant action on September 24, 2018 without notice to Polli, and in this Court's Richmond Division. That is, Penn-America raced to file this action in federal court and beat Polli's intended state court action, which also militates against the exercise of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because at least two of the\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   factors point the Court away from exercising jurisdiction, Plaintiff Penn-America is ordered to show cause why the Court should exercise jurisdiction. If Plaintiff fails to respond, the case may be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In addition, the Court\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff to show cause within ten (10) days after the entry of this Order as to whether the Court should assert jurisdiction, and if so, how to proceed with regard to the duty to indemnify in light of the ongoing state court proceedings.
