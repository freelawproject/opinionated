The Court has reviewed the materials filed for an against the motion. Oral argument is unnecessary. For the reasons below, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case alleges the mistreatment and unsafe captivity of numerous animals kept at a roadside zoo in Sequim, Washington known to the public as the Olympic Game Farm (OGF). Theories of liability include: 1) violation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 2) violation of the Washington State Animal Cruelty Laws ( RCW 16.52.205 ), and 3) maintaining a public nuisance ( RCW 7.48.130 ). Defendants choose to isolate the Public Nuisance claim in an attempt to prune this \"Bonzai tree\" with tweezers and fingernail clippers. The first claim is the ESA action which protects federally listed and specially protected species from killing, wounding, harming, injuring and harassing animals like: endangered gray wolves, endangered lions, endangered tigers, threatened brown bears and threatened Canada Lynx. The full panoply of remedies sought in this case are available under the first two theories. Nevertheless, the Court will analyze the attack on the third theory: public nuisance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Public Nuisance in Washington.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Washington has codified the requirements for a nuisance action. Washington defines nuisance as \"unlawfully doing an act, or omitting to perform a duty, which act or omission either annoys, injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health or\n   safety of others ... or in any way renders other persons insecure in life, or in the use of property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207.48.120\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 7.48.120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Washington's nuisance statute also distinguishes public nuisances from private nuisances. A public nuisance is defined as \"one which affects equally the rights of an entire community or neighborhood, although the extent of the damage may be unequal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207.48.130\">\n    Wash.

Although Washington courts have allowed other actions or inactions to form the basis of a public nuisance claim, this enumerated list is instructive because it confirms the legislature was conforming public nuisance to accepted and known public threats.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kitsap County v.

Furthermore, the Washington legislature has expressed disfavor for nuisance claims that target farm operations, and expressed its intent that agricultural activities, including livestock management, conducted on farmland \"be protected from nuisance lawsuits,\" and that such practices are presumed not to be a nuisance. Wash Rev. Code. \u00a7\u00a7 7.48.300, .305. This zoo is no \"farm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Washington also limits the individuals who may file a public nuisance action. Generally, a nuisance claim can be brought by \"any person whose property is, or whose patrons or employees are, injuriously affected or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by the nuisance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207.48.020\">\n    Wash.
