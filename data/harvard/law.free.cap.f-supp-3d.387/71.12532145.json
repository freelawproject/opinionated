After starting in the local courts, this fight has now been brought here by dozens of former parishioners (the \"Parishioners\"). They claim that a group of current members and priests conspired to take control of the Church, its operations, and its assets.

They argue that the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause prohibits the Court from resolving this dispute, as it involves inherently religious matters. The Court agrees in part. It is barred from hearing\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the Parishioners' arguments and will dismiss these for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Current Leaders also contend that the Parishioners have failed to plead sufficiently their RICO allegations. Again, the Court agrees, and it will dismiss the Parishioners' RICO allegations for failure to state a claim. And it declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Parishioners' remaining claims. The Court will therefore grant the Current Leaders' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The origins of this dispute are unclear.

In short, the Court finds that because the Parishioners' claims include allegations of fraud, they must state the circumstances of this fraud with particularity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   They fail to do so. Count I, for example, suggests that the Current Leaders conspired to use \"false or fraudulent pretenses\" to obtain control of the Church. Am. Compl. 36. But beyond this conclusory statement, it offers no further specifics about this alleged fraud. Instead, it contends that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022 The Current Leaders \"provided broad and repeated notice to all Church Members\" of their \"intention to hold a vote to dismiss the elected members of the Board of Trustees\" and replace them with an interim Board \"until a new Board could be elected.\" Am.

Read most logically, they suggest that the Current Leaders promised the Church a vote that never occurred. But a broken promise alone is not necessarily fraudulent. And, without more specificity, the Court cannot reasonably infer that the Current Leaders had an intent to deceive or misrepresent when making statements about a forthcoming vote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Indeed, the remaining allegations in Count I only reinforce this conclusion.

Airing a grievance over the radio is not a fraudulent act. Indeed, this allegation suggests the intended takeover was open and notorious, not clandestine and duplicitous. Nor is \"scheming\" to effectuate a change in organizational leadership a fraudulent act. After all, holding meetings, publicly criticizing leaders, and discussing a change through elections-all legal acts-are forms of \"scheming.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Simply put, Count I provides ample detail about various statements, representations, meetings, and actions.
