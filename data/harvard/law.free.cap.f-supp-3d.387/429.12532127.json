For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Copaxone\n   </em>\n   , \"the many different phrasings of intended effect '[did] not change the express dosing amount or method already disclosed in the claims, or otherwise result in a manipulative difference in the steps of the claims.' \" (D.I. 429 at 10) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Copaxone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518840\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/1013/#p1023\">\n    906 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1023 ) Here, by contrast, the preambles affect who and what conditions are treated by the claimed method, through the incorporation of the preambles into the claim term \"said subject.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record does not support Defendants' assertion that \"the methods captured in the language of each claim are performed in exactly the same way regardless of the desired result recited in the claim preambles;\" instead, the claims may be performed on subjects in different stages of MS, or in need of different forms of relief. (D.I. 429 at 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.I. 479 at 8 (\"Each preamble targets a particular kind of RRMS patient, narrowing the scope of the claim to a particular need (reducing relapses (claim 1) or slowing progression (claim 5) or treating (claim 3).\"))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Novartis argues for an additional limitation, that the claims also \"require an actual effect.\" (D.I. 426 at 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26 (\"It's the discovery that there was actually a reduction in relapses, and then this separate slowing progression based on an observation that the blood vessel growth around the spinal column was reduced at these low doses of fingolimod. That is the core of the invention, and that is reflected in each of these preambles.\")) Novartis points to the specification, which reads \"there is a need for agents which are\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     effective\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   in the inhibition or treatment of ... multiple sclerosis,\" as well as references in the file history. (D.I. 426 at 18 (quoting '405 patent 9:1-4) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26-28)) Novartis asserts that the \"invention was all about efficacy,\" relying its own expert reports and portions of the patent describing the results of clinical testing. (D.I. 426 at 18) Defendants respond that \"Novartis's attempts to read ... effectiveness requirements into the preambles, to the extent they are construed as limiting, are unsupported by either the law or the intrinsic evidence.\" (D.I. 484 at 14) The Court agrees with Defendants and is not persuaded that anything in the claims, specification, or prosecution history warrant reading into the claims an efficacy limitation. While the general purpose of the invention is to achieve a safe and effective manner of treating MS, such efficacy is not a limitation of the claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. \"Daily dosage of 0.5 mg\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-43\"><strong>Plaintiffs</strong> The amount of fingolimod administered per day over the course of a multi-day treatment. <strong>Defendant</strong> No construction required, plain and ordinary meaning<sup>5</sup> <strong>Court</strong> The amount of drug that someone takes in a given day</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note:\n   </strong>\n   The preceding image contains the reference for footnote\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff argues the Court should limit the daily dosage term to a multi-day regimen of 0.5 mg dosages per day. (D.I. 426 at 19; Tr. at 55) Plaintiff's argument rests on the chronic nature of MS ('405 patent at 8:61-64) and the specification's description of clinical trials, which contrast daily dosing with \"intermittent dosing\" (defined as every other day or once a week) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:20-38). Novartis contends that \"[a] single, one-time dose is never mentioned - if it had been, then the inventors would have discovered a cure, not just a disease modifying therapy.\" (D.I. 426 at 19) Novartis cites its expert reports for support that a person of skill would have this understanding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20; Tr. at 55-56) The PTAB agreed with Plaintiff and construed the term as \"the amount of fingolimod administered per day over the course of a multi-day treatment.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IPR at 15-17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants that the claim's \"plain language recites a method of treating RRMS comprising administering a 'daily dosage of 0.5 mg,' \" and may include a single day dosage. (D.I. 429 at 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 61) \"No claim language establishes the length of the dosing regimen, and the specification of the '405 patent does not define the phrase.\" (D.I. 429 at 15) Defendants point out that when it was used in the prosecution history, \"daily dosage was used to describe each individual step occurring in a series of incremental increases,\" undermining a construction that would require \"daily dosage\" include multiple steps. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16) (citing D.I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   350-2, Ex. C (July 6, 2015 Amendment) at 3) Additionally, Defendants point out that prior art cited in the patent describes \"someone taking this dose just once, just one day and never again.\" (Tr. at 60)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court is persuaded that a person of ordinary skill in the art would likely be aware that \"RRMS is a chronic disease and fingolimod is not a single-dose cure.\" (D.I. 479 at 11) Still, nothing in the intrinsic evidence supports finding that daily dosage is limited to a multi-day regimen. \"The inventors of the '405 patent could have drafted numerous claims related to their claimed method of treatment, addressing different embodiments and dosing regimens. They did not.\" (D.I. 484 at 14) Thus, \"[a] proper understanding of the phrase ' daily dosage of 0.5 mg' is simply the amount of fingolimod given per day to a patient, which encompasses all the examples and descriptions in the specification.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court will construe the disputed terms as explained above. An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Adopting Defendants' view that the preambles are not limiting would result in the claims having broader scope than the \"broadest reasonable interpretation\" given to the claims by the PTAB.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    While the parties do not agree on the qualifications of the person of ordinary skill (\n    <em>\n     compare\n    </em>\n    D.I. 479 at 3-4\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    D.I. 484 at 17 n.6), Defendants do not object to the Court adopting the IPR's description of such a person for purposes of claim construction (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Tr. at 58-60). The Court will do so. The Court will also deny Novartis's pending motion for submission of supplemental briefing in support of its claim construction answering brief.
