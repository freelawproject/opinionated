Pa. 2011). Defendants in this action have not carried their burden. They cite no cases where being a sole member of another entity makes extension of the stay appropriate, let alone automatic. Further, their only real substantive argument is that \"in order to adjudicate any of the claims involving the entities in which LaSalle is the sole member, this Court would be forced to adjudicate matters related to debts allegedly incurred prior to LaSalle's bankruptcy petition date, involving the liability of entities entirely owned by LaSalle suggest extension of the automatic stay.\" (Doc. No. 47 at 3). This is entirely conclusory and insufficient to support extension of the stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chord Assocs. LLC v.

No. 47 at 4). In the Court's view this would accomplish indirectly what the Court has chosen not to do directly,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   place the burden on Plaintiff to establish that the stay should be extended. Instead, the Court will opt for the approach taken in\n   <em>\n    CresCom Bank v.

There,\n   <em>\n    CresCom\n   </em>\n   sued CCT Reserve to recover on four separate loans, and also sued Edward Terry as the guarantor of the loans. After CCT filed a Chapter 11 petition, Terry moved to extend the automatic stay because he was the sole member of CCT and the only one who allegedly could effectively carry out its reorganization. Unconvinced that unusual circumstances\n   existed, the court in\n   <em>\n    CresCom\n   </em>\n   concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the circumstances of this case, the Court concludes that the question of whether to extend the automatic stay to the present action is most appropriately considered by the bankruptcy court overseeing CCT's bankruptcy proceedings. Terry maintains that CCT's reorganization efforts will be harmed if he is forced to defend the instant suit and if he cannot infuse capital into the company. The bankruptcy court-with its expertise, greater access to financial facts, and jurisdiction to adopt the proposed reorganization plan-is in a superior position to assess the validity of these arguments. Accordingly, the Court will defer to the bankruptcy court's judgment on the matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chi. Title Ins. Co. v. Lerner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771421\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/435/732/#p737\">\n    435 B.R. 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 737 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (deferring to the bankruptcy court on the question of extending the automatic stay). Absent an order from the bankruptcy court extending the stay, this action shall proceed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 497-98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Likewise in this case, whether the stay should be extended is best left to the decision of the bankruptcy court, and this Court will defer to its judgment. In the interim, however, and until such a time as the bankruptcy court suggests otherwise, this case will proceed as to all Defendants, except LaSalle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff's Motion to Stay Litigation Against LaSalle and Proceed Against Remaining Defendants (Doc. No. 45) is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Pending further Order of the Court, this case is hereby\n   <strong>\n    STAYED\n   </strong>\n   solely as to The LaSalle Group, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
