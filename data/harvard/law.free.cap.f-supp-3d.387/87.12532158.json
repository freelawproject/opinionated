KELLY, United States District Judge\n   Several organizations and individuals brought this action challenging an amendment adopted by the National Marine Fisheries Service to a fishery management plan that regulates several species of fish in the mid-Atlantic region. The gravamen of their complaint was that the amendment should have added certain species-species that they assert require federal management under the applicable laws-to the plan, and that the decision to nevertheless adopt the amendment without those species was unlawful. The Court granted summary judgment for Plaintiffs on one of their claims and for Defendants as to the other two, and it then entered a remedial order requiring Defendants to undertake specific actions. Defendants represent that they have now complied with the directives in that remedial order. Plaintiffs disagree. They moved to enforce the order, and afterward the case was reassigned to the undersigned. For the reasons explained below, Plaintiffs' motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Supp. 3d 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2015). The parties' central dispute concerns Defendants' regulatory decisions about four species of river herring and shad. Plaintiffs insist that the species require \"conservation and management\" as that term is defined in the MSA. Despite consideration of the issue during the development process, however, Amendment 14 did not include those species as regulated \"stocks\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   under the MSB fishery management plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs brought three separate claims in their complaint, each alleging that promulgation\n   of Amendment 14 violated applicable law. Count I alleged that Defendants were required under the MSA to include the four species of river herring and shad as regulated stocks in the MSB fishery management plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 113-29. Count II alleged that Amendment 14 lacked sufficient accountability measures to ensure that annual catch limits for the fishery are not exceeded, as required by the MSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-45. And Count III alleged that Defendants failed to take a \"hard look\" at Amendment 14's definition of the MSB fishery in violation of NEPA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 146-54. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment on all three claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court granted in part and denied in part the parties' cross-motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46. On Plaintiffs' first count, the Court held that, in light of the administrative record, Defendants' determination that the four species of river herring and shad did not require \"conservation and management\"-and therefore that they did not need to include those species as stocks in the MSB fishery-was not arbitrary and capricious under the MSA or the APA.\n   <em>\n    Anglers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196133\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/102/\">\n    139 F. Supp. 3d at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As for Plaintiffs' second count, the Court likewise concluded that Defendants' decision not to include certain accountability measures in Amendment 14 did not violate the MSA or the APA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196133\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/102/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196133\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/102/\">\n    at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the Court explained that the environmental impact statement (EIS) prepared as part of Amendment 14 did not consider, as one of the alternatives examined, a proposed action that would\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   add river herring and shad as stocks \"with temporary conservation and management measures.\"\n   <em>\n    Anglers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196133\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/102/\">\n    139 F.

In neglecting to do so, the Court concluded, Defendants failed to \"explore and objectively evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives and the associated impacts on the environment,\" as required by NEPA when an agency undertakes a major policy proposal such as an amendment to a fishery management plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196133\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/102/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

On January 19, 2016, upon consideration of the parties' submissions, the Court entered a remedial order in which it denied Plaintiffs' request to vacate Amendment 14 in favor of ordering Defendants to \"ensure\" that the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (the \"Council\"), which develops amendments to the MSB fishery management plan, take a series of specific actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 53 (\"Rem.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims that Defendants have not complied with the Court's remedial order can be grouped into two general challenges. First, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants failed to ensure that the environmental analysis conducted by the Council conformed to the specific directives of the Court in its remedial order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69-1 (\"MTE Br.\") at 10. That analysis, they argue, was inadequate given the Court's directives and, in any event, was substantively flawed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-13. Second, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants, in responding to the remedial order, \"failed to ensure that requirements of the Magnuson Stevens Act and other applicable laws were met,\" and that the Court should \"enforce\" the remedial order accordingly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-31. The Court addresses each category of claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Compliance with the Remedial Order's Directives\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs raise a wide array of challenges to the environmental analysis conducted in response to the remedial order. They range from charges that the Council neglected certain factors in analyzing the environmental impacts of regulating river herring and shad as stocks in the fishery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, to claims that the Council's conclusions about the effect of its decision to adopt Amendment 14 were faulty,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18, to challenges to the Council's analysis of the future impacts of not adding river herring and shad to MSB fishery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. Only briefly, however, do Plaintiffs link these objections to the Court's specific instructions in the remedial order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (citing Directive 5);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (citing Directive 8);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 (citing Directive 9). Defendants, contending that Plaintiffs are seeking relief far beyond the scope of a motion to enforce that order, respond that they have fully complied with its \"plain text.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 74 at 6. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the outset, the Court notes that its task in ruling on Plaintiffs' motion is limited. Plaintiffs specifically seek to enforce the Court's remedial order, as amended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69 at 1. And thus to show that they are entitled to that relief, Plaintiffs must show that Defendants have not complied\n   <em>\n    with that order\n   </em>\n   -not with whatever remedies the Court could have adopted but elected not to order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4165153\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/61/35/#p39\">\n    61 F. Supp. 3d at 39-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore notes what its remedial order\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AT &amp; T Wireless\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9257497,5662465\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/1095/\">\n    365 F.3d at 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The court is generally the authoritative interpreter of its own remand.\"). Before issuing the remedial order, the Court recognized that the regulatory circumstances were considerably \"muddled\" and asked the parties to \"[p]resent[ ] their views as to what action taken by the court would be appropriate and\n   <em>\n    realistic\n   </em>\n   at this stage of the proceeding.\" Rem. Order at 1-2 (second alteration in original) (quoting ECF No. 46 at 3). After consideration of their respective positions, the Court expressly rejected the typical course of vacating the amendment and leaving it to the agency whether to repromulgate it, subject to applicable laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9257497,5662465\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/1095/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2 &amp; n.1. Rather, it set forth a series of specific \"\n   <em>\n    actions\n   </em>\n   which must be taken in a reasonable time,\" in what the Court described as an \"attempt[ ] to ensure that this time around, Defendants complied with NEPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (emphasis added). Those discrete actions, which constitute the directives enumerated above, are therefore the touchstones of Defendants' compliance with the remedial order. Whatever the wisdom of that remedial course may be in hindsight, Plaintiffs have not sought reconsideration of the Court's earlier conclusions as to a suitable remedy, and thus those conclusions are simply not before the Court in ruling on their motion to enforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Turning to the text of the order, Plaintiffs ground their first set of arguments in support of their motion in Directives 5 and 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTE Br. at 8, 13. As noted, Directive 5 instructs Defendants to \"ensure that the Council prepares and updates the White Paper ... to include an environmental analysis of the action that Plaintiffs prefer, namely, immediately adding River Herring and Shad to the fishery and managing it by use of proxies.\" Rem. Order at 3. And Directive 6 similarly instructs Defendants to \"ensure that the Council prepares a draft decision document on the issue of stocks in the fishery, including an analysis of the regulatory course Plaintiffs advocate,\" to be presented to the full Council prior to a vote on whether to proceed with a new amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The updated White Paper and draft decision document satisfy those directives. The 2016 White Paper, as revised by the Committee following a public meeting, includes a section specifically examining the environmental impacts of immediately adding river herring and shad to the fishery and managing it by use of proxies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69-2 at 64-72. The paper first outlines the various commercial, environmental, and social benefits that would accrue from restoring river herring and shad species to their historical levels,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-66, recognizing that the ultimate restoration\n   objective would \"likely constitute substantial value to the Nation,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 66. But the paper reasons that because of ongoing management of the species by parallel state bodies, the indirect catch caps put in place by Amendment 14 through the mackerel and Atlantic herring fisheries, and other collaborative efforts to \"engage in [river herring and shad] conservation\" outside direct management-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the \"status quo\"-the environmental impacts of immediately adding river herring and shad to the fishery would be \"minimal.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 68-69, 71-72. Indeed, the paper explains that the only significant regulatory difference between the status quo and the course Plaintiffs prefer would be the immediate implementation of \"status determination criteria\" and \"acceptable biological catches,\" as well as the potential designation of an essential fish habitat.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 71-72. The paper concludes, however, that those additional measures would be unlikely to lead to a different outcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   And it provides several bases for this conclusion, including that it was unclear whether recent catches were having \"substantial impacts\" on river herring and shad populations because those catches were only a \"small fraction of historical catches,\" that the species were being actively managed by state agencies, the uncertainties of using a proxy, the existing catch caps, and the limited agency resources available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The draft decision document presented to the Council largely repeated this analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69-3 at 15-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Though not disputing that the updated White Paper and draft decision document included an analysis of \"immediately adding River Herring and shad to the fishery and managing it by use of proxies,\" Plaintiffs argue that Defendants still failed to comply with those directives because the analysis \"d[id] not constitute a hard look at the problem.\" MTE Br. at 13-14. A hard look, they say, would involve various factors that they contend the Council should have included in that analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Yet they provide no bases grounded in the remedial order itself for their demands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15. Plaintiffs appear to assume that the Court ordered Defendants to conduct a full-scale reanalysis of its prior decision to adopt Amendment 14.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13 (arguing that the analysis \"does not meet the terms of the Court's Orders\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   cure [Defendants'] NEPA violations because it failed to ... analyz[e] a reasonable range of alternatives (\n   <em>\n    some of which were court ordered\n   </em>\n   )\" (emphasis added)); ECF No. 78 (\"Reply\") at 8 (arguing that the analysis \"is [in]consistent with the NEPA analysis ordered by this Court\"). But the Court did no such thing. Rather, the Court laid out a set of steps that, in its view, constituted an appropriate\n   <em>\n    remedy\n   </em>\n   for the NEPA violation it identified-namely, the decision not to include immediately adding river herring and shad as an alternative in the EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anglers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196133\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/102/\">\n    139 F. Supp. 3d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs have not shown that Defendants have failed to comply with the two steps outlined in Directives 5 and 6 to ensure that an analysis of that alternative was included in the updated White Paper and draft decision document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs link the remainder of their objections to the Council's environmental analysis to Directives 8 and 9.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTE Br. at 16-20. As noted, Directive 8 ordered that, \"in developing the EIS and the final draft of the Council's River Herring and Shad Committee['s] [decision document],\" Defendants must \"ensure that there is full consideration, as Plaintiffs have urged, of the earlier decision by the full Council to not add to Amendment 14 River Herring and Shad.\" Rem. Order at 3-4. And Directive 9 further provides that Defendants must \"ensure that there be full consideration\n   of the impact of failing to include [those species] in the fishery, and that there be full consideration of the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of those decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Plaintiffs argue that the analysis included in the Council's final decision document, ECF No 69-4, is faulty, they dispute some of the Council's assumptions and reasoning, and they contend that the Council failed to undertake a thorough analysis of \"cumulative impacts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTE Br. at 16-20; Reply at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Once again, however, Plaintiffs misunderstand the framework of the remedial order. As contemplated by Directive 7, at its October 2016 meeting, the full Council reviewed the updated White Paper and final decision document and voted on whether to undertake preparation of a proposed amendment and an accompanying environmental impact statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 67. The Council voted not to proceed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Accordingly, Directives 8 and 9, which address the \"full consideration\" that the Council must give to the decision not to add river herring and shad to Amendment 14, or a future amendment\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the Council determined to undertake a new amendment and new environmental impact statement, are inapplicable. Rem. Order at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In insisting otherwise, Plaintiffs again presume that the Court ordered Defendants to undertake a complete NEPA analysis\n   <em>\n    as if\n   </em>\n   Defendants were promulgating an amendment concerning whether to include river herring and shad as stocks in the fishery management plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 13-14 (relying on case law outlining agencies' obligations under NEPA to demonstrate that Defendants failed to comply with the remedial order). But the Court, in rejecting vacatur in favor of the more incremental response outlined in the remedial order, specifically declined to require as much. Indeed, this approach was precisely what Defendants proposed in their remedy brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50. They represented that the Council had at that time already planned to conduct renewed environmental analyses that could address the regulatory action Plaintiffs preferred and that, given that \"NEPA analysis can be expensive and time-consuming,\" the Council's proposal offered \"a more streamlined environmental analysis\" \"\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   [the] need to comply with the entire suite of NEPA procedural requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 (emphasis added). And they further represented that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   \"the Council vote[d] ... to undertake an amendment to consider adding river herring and shad to the fishery,\"\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   Defendants would work with the Council to ensure that a complete NEPA analysis was undertaken.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The Court endorsed that approach when it largely mirrored those proposed steps in the remedial order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Compliance with the MSA and \"Other Applicable Laws\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Besides challenging Defendants' compliance with the specific directives of the remedial order, Plaintiffs also argue that the Court should \"enforce its order because Defendants failed to ensure that requirements of the [MSA] and other applicable laws were met.\" MTE Br. at 21. Plaintiffs claim that the record shows that river herring and shad require conservation and management, and that the Council's decision in October 2016 not to proceed with a new amendment including those species as stocks in the fishery was based on erroneous analysis and incorrect factors under the MSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   These arguments are wholly untethered to the dictates of the remedial order. The Court only granted summary judgment for Plaintiffs on their NEPA claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anglers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196133\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/102/\">\n    139 F. Supp. 3d at 119-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It did not grant summary judgment for\n   Plaintiffs on either of their claims that Defendants violated the MSA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196133\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/102/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, it dismissed those claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46. For this reason alone, Plaintiffs have no basis to seek, by a motion to enforce a remedial order related to their NEPA claim, to have the Court determine that Defendants have now violated the MSA and order relief accordingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs nevertheless point to the Court's statement in its order amending the remedial order that the Service \"has the ultimate statutory responsibility for ensuring that the requirements of the [MSA] and any other applicable laws are met.\" ECF No. 58 at 1. But Plaintiffs' reliance on that language is misplaced. The Court was merely justifying its basis for ordering that Defendants \"ensure\" that certain analyses were completed by the Council. It was not, as Plaintiffs maintain, expanding the scope of the remedial order to subject any action by the Council to immediate scrutiny under the MSA and APA. Such claims are the proper subject of a new complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
