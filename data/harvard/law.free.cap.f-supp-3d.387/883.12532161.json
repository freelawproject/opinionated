Bucklo, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Denise Taylor (\"Taylor\") brought this action against Nancy A. Berryhill, Acting Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (the \"Commissioner\"),\n   for review of the denial of her applications for disability insurance benefits (\"DIB\") under Title II of the Social Security Act, and supplemental security income benefits (\"SSI\") under Title XVI of the Social Security Act. Taylor now moves to reverse the Commissioner's decision. She claims that the Commissioner's determination that she is not disabled, and thus is not entitled to DIB or SSI, was not supported by substantial evidence and is contrary to the law. For the following reasons, Taylor's motion is granted in part and denied in part. This case is remanded to the Social Security Administration for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 15, 2015, Taylor filed her applications for DIB and SSI. R. 21. In these two applications, Taylor claimed that she had been disabled since February 14, 2015, around when she underwent surgery and developed a spinal epidural abscess.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21, 71. Taylor's medical records indicated that she also had neuropathy, a fractured toe, osteoarthritis of the thumb, an ACL tear, hypertension, anemia, and depression.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. Taylor worked as an operating room technician for approximately 23 years before her February 2015 surgery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21, 51. During 2016, she worked part-time in a medical sterile processing department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Taylor's applications were denied on November 4, 2016, and upon reconsideration on January 29, 2016. R. 21. Taylor thereafter requested a hearing, which took place on January 26, 2017 before an administrative law judge (the \"ALJ\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She testified at that hearing as did a vocational expert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ALJ denied Taylor's claims on June 22, 2017, finding she was not disabled as defined in the Social Security Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In reaching her decision, the ALJ employed the five-step inquiry set out in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 416.920. That inquiry requires a determination of \"(1) whether the claimant is currently employed; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) whether the claimant's impairment is one that the Commissioner considers conclusively disabling; (4) if the claimant does not have a conclusively disabling impairment, whether he can perform his past relevant work; and (5) whether the claimant is capable of performing any work in the national economy.\"\n   <em>\n    Kastner v.

R. 23. Taylor had some earnings in 2016 but was not then employed as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1571\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 416.971\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Taylor had one severe impairment: status post spinal cord injury.

The ALJ determined that Taylor had: (1) \"no limitations in understanding, remembering, or applying information\", (2) \"no limitations in interacting with others,\" (3) \"no limitations in concentrating, persisting, or maintaining pace,\" and (4) \"mild limitations in adapting or managing oneself.\" R. 24. The ALJ explained that these determinations were not themselves an assessment of Taylor's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to perform her past work, but that her assessment at step four would reflect these determinations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1571\">\n    at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The ALJ supported these functional area determinations with a summary of Taylor's reported symptoms and relevant medical opinions.

Second, Taylor argues that the ALJ improperly found that Taylor's diagnosed major depression was not severe. Third, she argues the ALJ improperly analyzed her self-reported medication side effects and her need for a cane. Fourth, she argues the ALJ improperly evaluated opinion evidence from Taylor's treating physicians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Taylor claims that the ALJ's analysis of Taylor's RFC was in error because the ALJ failed to explain why she found that Taylor's depression caused no limitation in concentration, persistence or pace and because the ALJ did not adopt the opinion of state agency consultants that Taylor had mild limitations in that functional area. Taylor further argues that the ALJ should have found that Taylor had mild limitations in her concentration, persistence or pace. This argument thus extends beyond the ALJ's RFC analysis at step four to challenge the functional area findings made at step two.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Contrary to Taylor's assertions, the ALJ supported her functional areas findings at step two with specific citations to relevant medical evidence.

The ALJ also considered that Taylor has never been hospitalized or medicated for mental issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While the ALJ's analysis of Taylor's mental limitations at step two is admittedly \"sketchy,\" it provides a \"minimal level of articulation\" that allows me to \"trace the path of the ALJ's reasoning.\"\n   <em>\n    Stephens v.

The ALJ relied on reports from the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago that determined Taylor had met her physical therapy goals, resolved her gait defects, returned strength to her lower extremities, and was \"80% back to normal.\" The ALJ built a sufficient logical bridge from the evidence of Taylor's cane usage and ambulation issues and the physical therapist's later determination that Taylor resolved her ambulation issues, to her conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Taylor argues that the ALJ improperly evaluated treating physicians'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   opinions that Taylor could only work part-time because the ALJ failed to apply the factors listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in finding that Taylor could work full-time.

Taylor also claims that the ALJ ignored the opinion of Taylor's family medicine practitioner, Dr. Andi Arnautovic.

The ALJ listed four reasons for giving Dr. Yamini's opinions partial weight: Dr. Arnautovic's 2015 progress notes that Taylor's anemia and peripheral neuropathy were under control; Dr. Yamini's own notes that Taylor was ready for work, moved her extremities well, and was improving; Taylor's earnings from part-time work in 2016; and physical therapy records stating Taylor's ambulation status was \"complete independence.\" R. 29. The ALJ's discussion of Dr. Yamini's opinion indicates that she considered its supportability and consistency with the record, which are factors set out in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) and (4).

R. 29 (citing R. 101). But, the ALJ did not expressly rely on that opinion in giving partial weight to the opinions of Dr. Yamini. Rather, the ALJ relied on records of Dr. Arnautovic and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, both of whom provided treatment to Taylor. Taylor essentially asks that I reweigh the opinions of Dr. Yamini against the other evidence the ALJ considered in determining Taylor's ability to work, which I cannot do.\n   <em>\n    Young v.

The ALJ afforded Dr. Yamini's opinion for part-time work less weight because later medical records attested to Taylor's \"complete independence\" and ability to walk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Taylor is correct that an ALJ should not \"draw conclusions about a claimant's ability to work full time based on part-time employment....\"\n   <em>\n    Weaver v.

Setting that reason aside, I cannot say that the ALJ's assessment of Dr. Yamini's opinion is \"patently wrong\" because it is supported by other specific reasons that Taylor has not shown to be improper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=746%20F.%20App%27x%20574\">\n    746 F.

The ALJ's decision does not make any mention of or citation to this opinion. The Commissioner responds that the ALJ cited to Dr. Arnautovic's treatment records at various points in her RFC analysis. R. 27-29. The issue is not the ALJ's failure to consider any of Dr. Arnautovic's treatment records or his later opinions, it is that the ALJ's decision does not indicate how she weighed the opinion of a treating physician on Taylor's ability to return to full-time work. I cannot discern whether the ALJ considered Dr. Arnautovic's January 2016 opinion in conjunction with or apart from his other treatment notes, let alone whether she considered the requisite factors in assigning weight thereto.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   I cannot agree with the Commissioner that this error was harmless because the ALJ discussed Dr. Arnautovic's other treatment records and Dr. Arnautovic has essentially the same opinion on Taylor's ability to work as Dr. Yamini. In January 2016, Dr. Arnautovic opined that Taylor could go back to work part-time but the \"[d]ecision to go back to full duty will be determined by Neurosurgery.\" R. 2507. This seems to be a deferral to Dr. Yamini on Taylor's ability to work full-time. However, the ALJ relied on Dr. Arnautovic's November and December 2015 progress notes to partially credit (or discredit) Dr. Yamini's opinion on Taylor's ability to work. I cannot \"say with great confidence\" what weight would be assigned to Dr. Arnautovic's opinions on remand or what the ALJ would do on remand.\n   <em>\n    McKinzey v.
