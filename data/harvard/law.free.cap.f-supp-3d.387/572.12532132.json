INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this products liability case, an individual asserts both negligence and strict liability claims against a prescription medical device manufacturer. In doing so, the Court is presented with an important question of state law that has often been raised but has effectively evaded review by\n   the Pennsylvania Supreme Court: does Pennsylvania law recognize a strict liability claim for a manufacturing defect of a prescription medical device?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court predicts that the answer to this question is \"no.\" But given the growing debate among federal district courts regarding this issue, the Court certifies the question to the Third Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Sarah Rosenberg suffered from stress urinary incontinence (\"SUI\") that required surgical intervention. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7, ECF No. 1. On November 12, 2012, Plaintiff's doctors implanted Defendant C.R. Bard, Inc.'s Align synthetic mesh system in Plaintiff to treat her SUI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Following this procedure, Plaintiff began experiencing complications such as severe lower quadrant pain, dyspareunia, and mesh erosion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. According to Plaintiff, these complications required further medical care and treatment, including surgical interventions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges that she is more likely than not to need to undergo additional procedures related to complications that she attributes to Defendant's pelvic mesh system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she neither knew nor could have reasonably known that her complications were related to design or manufacturing defects of the pelvic mesh system until July 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Further, Plaintiff alleges that, despite safety communications from the FDA in 2011 observing the risks associated with pelvic mesh systems as well as various reports from physicians, patients, and the World Health Organization noting complications from pelvic mesh implantation, Defendant continued to advertise and promote its pelvic mesh system as a safe and effective treatment for SUI and pelvic organ prolapse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-15, 17. According to Plaintiff, Defendant knew that its pelvic mesh system had a defect attributable to erosion, shrinkage, and/or hardening of the mesh material and that there could be life-changing and irreversible complications from pelvic mesh removal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant failed to provide sufficient warnings of the risks of pelvic mesh implantation and concealed the known risks associated with pelvic mesh implantation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant, originally bringing thirteen causes of action, including strict liability, negligence, and fraud. ECF No. 1. Defendant then filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. ECF No. 6. In her response in opposition to Defendant's motion to dismiss, Plaintiff abandoned all but three of her original causes of action: (1) strict liability for design and manufacturing defects, (2) strict liability for failure to warn, and (3) negligence. ECF No. 10. Plaintiff's abandoned claims (Counts IV-XIII) will be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court heard argument on Defendant's motion to dismiss, and the motion is now ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Pursuant to Section 402A, a plaintiff may recover under a theory of strict liability if his or her injury was caused by a product in \"a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer.\" Restatement (Second) Torts \u00a7 402A ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

A plaintiff may establish a \"defective condition,\" and thus assert a strict liability claim, by showing that the product suffered from a design defect, failure-to-warn defect, or manufacturing defect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"458972,7880612\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/665/1167/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   There are, however, situations where strict liability is unavailable as an avenue of relief for plaintiffs alleging harm caused by a product. Specifically, pursuant to comment k of Section 402A, manufacturers of \"unavoidably unsafe products\" are exempted from strict liability to the extent that the product at issue is \"properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning, is not defective, nor is it\n   <em>\n    unreasonably\n   </em>\n   dangerous.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A cmt. k (emphasis in original). In other words, Section\n   402A defines the general scope of strict liability, and comment k sets the perimeter beyond which Section 402A may not encroach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Comment k Applies to Prescription Drugs and Prescription Medical Devices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   But where does comment k apply? To start, comment k explicitly contemplates its application to \"many ... drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which ... cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the prescription of a physician.\" Restatement (Second) Torts \u00a7 402A cmt. k.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In interpreting the scope of comment k, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that comment k applies to prescription drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hahn v. Richter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"461534\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/543/558/\">\n    543 Pa. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7865061,461534\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/673/888/\">\n    673 A.2d 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 890-91 (1996) (explaining that \"where the adequacy of warnings associated with prescription drugs is at issue, the failure of the manufacturer to exercise reasonable care to warn of dangers, i.e., the manufacturer's negligence, is the only recognized basis of liability\"). In 2014, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court further explained that it \"has declined to extend strict liability into the prescription drug arena.\"\n   <em>\n    Lance v. Wyeth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078527\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/624/231/\">\n    624 Pa. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7264601,4078527\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/85/434/\">\n    85 A.3d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 453 (2014) [hereinafter\n   <em>\n    Lance II\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But the case before the Court today is not one regarding prescription drugs. Rather, the present case involves a prescription medical device, a context in which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not addressed comment k's application. \"In the absence of a controlling decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, a federal court applying that state's substantive law must predict how Pennsylvania's highest court would decide [the] case.\"\n   <em>\n    Berrier v. Simplicity Mfg., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237780\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/38/#p45\">\n    563 F.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45-46 (3d Cir. 2009). Therefore, the Court must predict whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would expand the scope of comment k to reach prescription medical devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To answer this question, the Court first turns to the plain language of comment k. To begin, as previously observed, comment k specifically contemplates its application to prescription products such as \"drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which ... cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the prescription of a physician.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A cmt. k. Therefore, comment k's plain language appears to include prescription medical devices because \"prescription\" medical devices, by definition, are products that require a physician's prescription, just as \"prescription\" drugs also, by definition, require a physician's prescription. For the purposes of comment k, no meaningful distinction can be drawn between prescription drugs and prescription medical devices. Indeed, some prescription medical treatments include both a prescription drug delivered by a prescription medical device, e.g., an EpiPen\u00ae or an insulin pump.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, case law, too, supports this Court's prediction. Although, as noted above, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not expressly extended its comment k jurisprudence to prescription medical device manufacturers, the Pennsylvania Superior Court has done so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Creazzo v. Medtronic, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409042\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/903/24/#p31\">\n    903 A.2d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2006). In\n   <em>\n    Creazzo\n   </em>\n   , the Pennsylvania Superior Court held that the plaintiffs could not pursue a strict liability claim against the manufacturer of an implantable neurological electrical stimulation device.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409042\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/903/24/#p31\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409042\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/903/24/#p31\">\n    at 26, 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so holding, the Pennsylvania Superior Court explained that it \"[found] no reason why the same rational[e] applicable to prescription drugs may not be applied to medical devices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409042\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/903/24/#p31\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409042\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/903/24/#p31\">\n    at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Pennsylvania Superior Court concluded that comment k applied to prescription medical devices and thus\n   strict liability was not a viable basis for liability in that case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409042\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/903/24/#p31\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To that end, citing both\n   <em>\n    Hahn\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Creazzo\n   </em>\n   , the Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Civil Jury Instructions subcommittee note to \u00a7 23.00 regarding the duty to warn in the prescription drug and medical device context expressly states that \"Pennsylvania courts have declined to apply strict liability in cases involving prescription drugs and medical devices, in accordance with comment k to the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A.\" Pa. Suggested Standard Civil Jury Instructions \u00a7 23.00 (May 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, every federal district court to confront this issue has predicted that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would extend comment k's application to prescription medical devices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, like the Pennsylvania Superior Court and all of the federal district courts to confront this issue, the Court predicts that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would extend comment k to prescription medical devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Applying the Prescription Drug Jurisprudence to Prescription Medical Devices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Having predicted that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would apply comment k to prescription medical devices, the Court next turns to the types of strict liability claims that comment k precludes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To begin, the plain language of comment k precludes strict liability claims for design defects because it specifically carves out \"unavoidably unsafe\" products from the reach of Section 402A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) Torts \u00a7 402A cmt. k.

Indeed, the question continues to evade review by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court because cases are frequently brought in or removed to federal court and subsequently settled before even reaching the Third Circuit. Therefore, in this case, the Third Circuit may wish to consider whether it is appropriate to certify the question to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pa. R.
