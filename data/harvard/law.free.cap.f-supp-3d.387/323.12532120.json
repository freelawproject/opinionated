ENGELMAYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This multi-district products liability litigation involves a contraceptive product: the Mirena intrauterine device (\"IUD\") developed, manufactured, and distributed by defendants Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bayer Pharma AG and Bayer Oy (together, \"Bayer\"). The Mirena IUD is implanted in the uterus and functions by releasing a synthetic steroid hormone known as levonorgestrel (\"LNG\"). Plaintiffs claim that the hormonal component of Mirena caused them to suffer from a disease known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (\"IIH\"), also known as pseudotumor cerebri (\"PTC\"). IIH is an uncommon disease marked by increased cerebrospinal fluid (\"CSF\") pressure in the skull.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This decision resolves a defense motion for entry of summary judgment based on the limited issue of general causation. Bayer disputes that there is competent evidence to establish that the use of Mirena is a cause of IIH. And this Court, heeding the guidance of the United States Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation (\"JPML\"), prioritized discovery on that question: whether Mirena's release of LNG is capable of causing IIH. On October 24, 2018, with fact and expert discovery complete on that issue, the Court granted defense motions under\n   <em>\n    Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993), to exclude plaintiffs' seven expert witnesses on general causation. Dkt. 320.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each had proposed to opine that use of Mirena can cause IIH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mirena IUS Levonorgestrel-Related Products Liability Litigation\n   </em>\n   (No. II),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    341 F. Supp. 3d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Mirena IIH/Daubert\n   </em>\n   \"). That ruling left plaintiffs without any expert evidence as to general causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ruling, with leave of the Court, Bayer filed the present motion for summary judgment. Bayer argues that plaintiffs lack evidence sufficient to establish general causation, and that such is fatal to their claims. Bayer argues, first, as a categorical matter, that expert testimony is required to establish general causation in a products liability case involving a pharmaceutical product such as Mirena. Alternatively, Bayer argues that even if lay testimony (e.g., admissions by a product's manufacturer) could in theory establish general causation, the non-expert evidence in the record of this case is insufficient to so establish. Plaintiffs counter with a range of arguments, including that general causation is not a required element of proof, that expert evidence is not required to establish general causation, that a factfinder considering together disparate elements of non-expert evidence could reliably find general causation by Mirena of IIH, and that granting Bayer summary judgment on this element-with discovery not having been taken as to the individual cases of the approximately 920 plaintiffs comprising this MDL-would violate the Seventh Amendment and be unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court grants Bayer's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Pertinent History of This Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court incorporates by reference its decision on the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions, which sets out the background to plaintiffs' claims, and the procedural history of this litigation, in considerable detail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mirena IIH/Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    341 F. Supp. 3d at 218-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court here supplies-including by reproducing, at points, modified excerpts of that decision's chronicle of the case history-the limited background necessary for understanding the instant motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The JPML's Centralization of Mirena/IIH Cases Before This Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 6, 2017, the JPML centralized in this District pretrial proceedings in the 113 cases then pending across 17 districts nationwide in which plaintiffs had alleged IIH injuries caused by the hormonal component of the Mirena IUD. Most of these cases were at a relatively early stage of discovery or at the pleading stage, although fact and expert discovery had closed in the 10 longest pending actions.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 at 2-3 (JPML Transfer Order). The JPML had earlier, in July 2014, denied a motion to centralize the Mirena/IIH actions, at a time when nine such actions, spanning six districts, were pending. Explaining, in 2017, its decision to centralize the pending cases, the JPML emphasized several factors that made centralized proceedings more efficient. Two are relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   First, the JPML noted the heightened difficulty coordinating discovery and other pretrial proceedings given the increased number and dispersal of pending actions and of participating law firms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. \"The record,\" the JPML stated, \"demonstrates that centralization is necessary to facilitate the efficient conduct of common discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, general causation had emerged as an important issue common to all proceedings. \"[T]he records in the many actions filed since [2014] demonstrate that discovery and pretrial motions concerning the issue of general causation have been, or will be, at the center of all actions-that is, whether the hormonal component in\n   Mirena is capable of causing intracranial hypertension.\" Dkt. 1 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (\"Issues concerning general causation [and] the background science ... will be common to all actions.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Organization of This MDL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In overseeing this action, this Court has given priority to the matters that led the JPML to centralize the Mirena/IIH actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Specifically, on June 21, 2017, after appointing plaintiffs' leadership team and reviewing written submissions and eliciting counsel's input at an initial conference,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 51 (transcript of June 13, 2017 hearing), the Court issued an order stating that priority would be given to: (1) \"the process of providing common fact discovery to plaintiffs from Bayer,\" and (2) \"resolving whether plaintiffs have admissible evidence sufficient to establish general causation\" by Mirena of IIH. Dkt. 40 at 1 (June 21, 2017 Order). The Court has done so as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Outgoing discovery from Bayer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : On July 27, 2017, after receiving submissions delineating the 14 discovery disputes identified by the parties and inquiring about them at a hearing, the Court resolved these disputes in a series of bench rulings.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 51 at 10-59 (transcript of July 27, 2017 hearing). The Court ordered that Bayer broadly produce written discovery on all common issues, including electronic records from more than 50 Bayer custodians, and including broad production from Bayer's adverse-events database. Both as to custodians and as to search parameters, the common discovery ordered from Bayer extended well beyond the parameters then used in the individual cases comprising the MDL. It also substantially exceeded the discovery that Bayer had produced in an immediately prior MDL also relating to the Mirena IUD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MDL No. 2434 (the \"Perforation MDL\"). In that case, overseen by the Hon. Cathy Seibel of this District, the plaintiffs had alleged different injuries: that the hormone-release feature of Mirena had caused the IUD to migrate within the uterus after its insertion, leading to uterine perforation and related migration injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     General causation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : The Court directed that the issue of general causation be litigated in the MDL as a threshold issue. To facilitate that issue's prompt resolution, the Court ordered that all fact discovery relating to general causation-including all document and deposition discovery-be completed by December 8, 2017. Dkt. 62. Alerted by counsel that each side expected to make\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   challenges to the admissibility of each other's experts on general causation, the Court set deadlines spanning late December 2017 through late March 2018 for the submission of all expert reports on general causation, depositions of general causation experts, and reciprocal\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   briefing. The Court set for the week of April 9, 2018 a \"Science Day\" tutorial for the Court on the background scientific issues in the case, followed by a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing as to expert testimony on general causation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In prioritizing general causation, the Court was informed by, in addition to the guidance of the JPML, the representations of counsel in this case that the issue of general causation would be common and identical to all potential Mirena/IIH plaintiffs so as to make it an appropriate issue for this transferee court to resolve at the threshold.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 51 at 29. The Court was also informed by the experience of the Perforation MDL. There, Judge Seibel held that plaintiffs' proposed expert testimony as to the general causation proposition at issue-that the Mirena IUD's release of the hormone LNG was capable of causing the Mirena IUD to\n   migrate after insertion and cause uterine perforation-was not reliable under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mirena IUD Prods. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343001\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/396/#p427\">\n    169 F.

Based on that ruling, Judge Seibel later granted summary judgment for Bayer on all claims, holding that, without any admissible expert testimony, the remaining evidence was insufficient to establish general causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mirena IUD Products Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12180247\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/202/304/#p310\">\n    202 F.

The Second Circuit affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409471\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/713/11/\">\n    713 F. App'x. 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2017). The possibility of a similar outcome here, this Court determined, counseled deferring other time- and cost-intensive phases of this litigation pending resolution of the anticipated\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    Motions as to General Causation Experts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs proposed to call seven expert witnesses as to general causation. Each opined that using the Mirena IUD can cause a woman to develop IIH. The seven experts were: (1) Dr. Lemuel A. Moy\u00e9, an epidemiologist; (2) Dr. Laura M. Plunkett, a pharmacologist and toxicologist; (3) Dr. James M. Wheeler, an OB/GYN; (4) Dr. Frederick W. Fraunfelder, an ophthalmologist; (5) Dr. Philip Darney, an OB/GYN; (6) Dr. Conrad E. Johanson, a neuroscientist; and (7) Dr. Vincent Salpietro, a pediatric neurologist. Bayer, in turn, proposed to call 12 expert witnesses. Each opined that existing evidence and scholarship does not permit this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Each expert authored a report and was deposed. Each side thereafter moved to exclude the others' experts. Each of the combined 19 experts was the subject of individualized\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   briefing and oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Court's Ruling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 24, 2018, the Court issued a lengthy (156-page) decision excluding plaintiffs' seven expert witnesses. For each witness, the Court analyzed in detail the witness's stated bases for claiming general causation of IIH by Mirena and evaluated the witness' methodology against the standards set by\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. While a top-line summary inherently is incapable of capturing the Court's witness-specific analyses, the following brief overview is provided with the goal of enabling understanding of arguments made on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Characteristics of Mirena\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : The Court began by reviewing salient characteristics of Mirena, an IUD that releases LNG, a synthetic progestin. Mirena was approved by the FDA in 2000; some 45.4 million Mirena devices have been inserted worldwide, equating to 142 woman-years of use. In contrast to combined oral contraceptives, which contain progestin and estrogen and whose effectiveness among obese women has been questioned, Mirena is believed to be effective among obese women. Also commending its use among obese women, studies indicate that Mirena does not increase the risk of weight loss and blood clots and does not expose the user to potential risks associated with estrogen-containing contraceptives.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    341 F. Supp. 3d at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result of these and other factors, the Court noted, Mirena is widely believed to be preferentially,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , disproportionately, prescribed to overweight and obese women.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LNG\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : The Court next summarized LNG, the hormone Mirena releases.

These uses include LNG-releasing IUDs like Mirena ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   LNG-releasing subdermal implants such as Norplant, which was marketed in the United States from 1991 to 2002, and Jadelle, which is currently marketed in Europe; the single-dose hormone contraceptive known as Plan B; and as the progestin component of numerous combined oral contraceptives (which usually contain both LNG and an estrogen component).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IIH\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : The Court next reviewed IIH. It is a rare disease marked by intracranial pressure derived not from a tumor or lesion but from the excessive buildup of CSF. The Court noted that IIH is more likely to afflict obese or overweight women, and that scholars are divided as to the cause of IIH, with some theorizing that IIH is caused by an increase in the production of CSF, but a greater number theorizing that IIH is caused by the impaired absorption of CSF.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    at 223-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Symptoms of IIH most commonly entail headaches, a whooshing sound in the ears called pulsatile tinnitus, or papilledemia (the swelling of the optic nerves).

The Court did so because plaintiffs' seven experts, to varying degrees, drew on this literature in their reports. \"[O]utside of this litigation,\" the Court summarized, \"no medical organization, regulatory agency, article in peer-reviewed scientific literature, or other research has found that use of Mirena is a cause of IIH.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court noted that two published epidemiological studies had addressed the possibility of a causal connection between the use of Mirena and IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The first was by Mahyar Etminan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mayhar Etminan, et al., Risk of intracranial hypertension with intrauterine levonorgestrel, 6 Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safety 110 (2015) (\"Etminan\" or the \"Etminan study\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    341 F.

And the surviving half of the Etminan study (which compared Mirena with oral contraceptives) did not find any such increased risk. The other epidemiological study (Valenzuela) found a correlation between Mirena use and IIH. But it found only that. In language that warned against conflating correlation with causation, the Valenzuela study emphasized that its finding of such a correlation \"does not indicate\" that an LNG-based IUD such as Mirena is an \"independent risk factor\" for IIH.

Dkt. 321. After receiving the parties' views, Dkt. 322, the Court decided on that course and, on November 19, 2018, set a briefing schedule, with Bayer's opening brief in support of summary judgment due in December.

Accordingly, to facilitate informed briefing, the Court directed plaintiffs' counsel to file, by December 3, 2018, a letter \"identifying the alleged admissions as to general causation, made by Bayer or its experts, on which plaintiffs intend to rely in opposing summary judgment.\" Dkt. 325 (Order of November 19, 2018). The Court emphasized that plaintiffs' letter \"will not limit the range of materials on which plaintiffs may rely in their briefing,\" but stated its expectation that plaintiffs would \"make a good-faith effort to thoroughly canvas the materials and disclose, with specificity, the evidence on which they expect to rely in opposing a motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On December 3, 2018, plaintiffs filed such a letter.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court's resolution of Bayer's\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions has left plaintiffs without any expert testimony as to general causation, to wit, that Mirena can cause IIH. Bayer therefore moves for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Bayer makes three arguments. First, it argues, summary judgment for the defense in a pharmaceutical product liability case is, categorically, required where the plaintiff lacks expert evidence as to general causation. Second, it argues, to the extent the case law leaves open the theoretical alternative in which corporate admissions of general causation can substitute for expert evidence, plaintiffs lack any such admissions here. Third, Bayer argues, the alternative non-expert materials on which plaintiffs rely in opposing summary judgment (e.g., adverse event reports; the label on a different contraceptive product, Jadelle; inferences drawn from scientific literature largely addressed by plaintiffs' experts in their excluded reports; theories of possible biological mechanisms of causation; and regulatory documents) cannot support a finding of general causation. Bayer argues that, in seeking to base general causation on these materials, plaintiffs improperly seek to substitute the arguments and inferences of counsel for the expert evidence (or corporate admissions) that are required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs counter with a series of arguments. First, they argue, general causation is not a required element of the state-law causes of action on which plaintiffs in this MDL have sued. An individual plaintiff may prevail as to the element of causation they argue, solely by means of individual (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff-specific) causation, a subject as to which there has not been discovery. Second, plaintiffs argue, other forms of evidence, taken together, could permissibly lead a factfinder to find general causation of IIH by Mirena. These building blocks include alleged admissions by Bayer, components of the witness reports by Bayer's and plaintiffs' experts; portions of the Valenzuela study; adverse event reports; viable theories of a biological mechanism by which Mirena might cause IIH; and statements by the FDA. Taken together, plaintiffs argue, these materials give rise to a material dispute of fact as to general causation. Fourth, plaintiffs argue, the Court procedurally erred in directing plaintiffs, prior to Bayer's filing of its summary judgment motion, informally to identify the purported admissions by Bayer on which plaintiffs then anticipated relying. Fifth and finally, plaintiffs claim that granting summary judgment to Bayer on the issue of general causation, without any discovery having been taken as to individual plaintiffs, is unconstitutional-a breach of the Seventh Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court addresses these arguments in turn, after first reviewing the governing legal standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

As a federal district court in Ohio, supervising a products liability MDL in which the use of an anti-obesity medication was alleged to cause certain cardiovascular and cerebrovascular injuries, aptly observed, proof of general causation plays a vital role in complex cases where the capacity of a product to cause a species of injury is not intuitively obvious-where the causation inquiry \"is more complicated because the injuries themselves are usually not immediately obvious and the connection between exposure and injury is not a matter of common sense or everyday experience.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Meridia Prods. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190882\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/328/791/#p798\">\n    328 F. Supp. 2d 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 798 (N.D. Ohio 2004). To assure reliable outcomes in a circumstance where the origins of an injury are not obvious or within the scope of a lay juror's everyday experience, and to avoid the risk that juries would equate correlation (the fact that a given plaintiff used a product and developed injuries) with causation, it is imperative that the factfinder be presented evidence that the product was capable of causing the injury of which a plaintiff complains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Tellingly, plaintiffs' bold present claim that the law does not require proof of general causation in cases such as this is of recent vintage. Plaintiffs only made that argument after the Court, in its October 2018\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   decision, excluded plaintiffs' proposed expert witnesses on general causation as unreliable. Plaintiffs earlier had effectively acknowledged the opposite. When plaintiffs asked the JPML to consolidate the pending cases in an MDL, for example, they stated that the foundational issue of general causation was common to all member cases and that this common issue supported consolidation of these cases for pretrial proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 331-2 (Pl. Mot. for Transfer) at 7 (noting that plaintiffs all alleged that their \"injuries were caused by levonorgestrel released from the Mirena LNG-IUS through the exact same mechanism of action\" and representing \"there are common questions of science that will be presented in each of these cases\"). Heeding this point, the JPML determined that \"[i]ssues concerning\n   <em>\n    general causation\n   </em>\n   , the background science, and Mirena's labeling and regulatory history with respect to the alleged injury will be common to all actions.\" Dkt. 1 at 4. Later, after consolidation, plaintiffs' counsel, in a letter to this Court, \"agree[d] that 'general causation' refers to the question of whether or not Mirena can cause [IIH].\" Dkt. 96 at 2. It was based on the JPML's guidance and the parties' identification of general causation as a gating issue that the Court, as noted, prioritized fact and expert discovery, and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   litigation,\n   on this issue. Before the adverse\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ruling, plaintiffs had never suggested that it was unnecessary to show general causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court holds, therefore, that to withstand Bayer's motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs must produce admissible evidence from which a jury could reliably conclude that Mirena is capable of causing IIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, as to this point, the Court rejects an argument by plaintiffs that is tantamount to a claim that proof of general causation is unnecessary. Plaintiffs argue that Bayer's motion for summary judgment is premature because, although discovery as to general causation is closed, there has not yet been discovery as to the individualized circumstances of the approximately 920 plaintiffs. Plaintiffs represent that \"[m]any Plaintiffs have had their own doctors determine, through differential diagnosis, that the Mirena was the cause of their intracranial hypertension and that other plaintiffs could obtain expert witness testimony of the same.\" Pl. Mem. at 18. The premises of this argument are that (1) general causation is not an element of plaintiffs' claims, and (2) the causation element could be established through the testimony of an individual patient's physician to the effect that, after excluding other potential causes for IIH symptoms, the doctor was left with the conclusion that the patient's Mirena use must be the cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   There is of course a proper place for testimony about the causes of an individual plaintiff's symptoms. That is the essence of the\n   <em>\n    specific causation\n   </em>\n   inquiry undertaken if there is competent evidence of general causation. But plaintiffs' bid here to erase the threshold general causation requirement is at odds with the uniform holdings of the cases canvassed above that general and specific causation present separate inquiries, and that in complex medical products liability cases, the cause of an individual plaintiff's injuries is properly reached only where a plaintiff can first adduce competent evidence that the product is capable of causing the condition at issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Norris v.

At the threshold, the Court considers whether, as Bayer argues, a plaintiff is required to establish general causation in a medical products liability case such as this through expert testimony, or whether, as plaintiffs argue, alternative forms of evidence, for example, a corporate admission, can establish general causation. The Court declines to hold that expert testimony is categorically required. The Court therefore considers whether the alternative evidence to which plaintiffs point here is sufficient to establish general causation. In considering these questions, the Court is mindful that these are questions of state law.

Is Expert Testimony Required to Establish General Causation?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Bayer argues that expert testimony is legally\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to prove general causation in medical products liability cases such as this, and therefore, here, that Mirena is capable of causing IIH. Thus, Bayer argues, because the Court has excluded plaintiffs' proposed general causation experts, the Court must enter summary judgment for the defense. Plaintiffs respond that the law does not rigidly require proof of general causation by expert testimony. And here, plaintiffs argue, general causation can be established through a collection of lay evidence. This largely consists of items on which plaintiffs' excluded experts relied: inferences drawn from scientific literature (e.g., the Valenzuela study); the label used on a different LNG-based contraceptive product, Jadelle; adverse event reports; theories of possible biological mechanisms of causation; and regulatory documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   There is much force to Bayer's argument.

For purposes of this decision, the Court assumes\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , following the Second Circuit's lead, that it is possible for general causation in complex medical products liability cases to be established other than by expert evidence. And, insofar as plaintiffs here (although suggesting otherwise) do not identify any admission by Bayer that Mirena use is a cause of IIH, the Court further assumes\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that other forms of lay evidence could in theory establish general causation. The Court therefore turns to consider whether the particular evidence offered by plaintiffs-much of which the Court addressed in its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   decision-is, considered separately or together, equal to that task.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Previously-Excluded Testimony from Plaintiffs' Proposed Expert Witnesses Regarding the Cause of IIH\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs first propose that although the Court has excluded their expert witnesses as to general causation and although \"no definitive mechanism for PTC/IIH has been established,\" Pl. Mem. at 37, they can draw on aspects of their proposed experts' excluded testimony to \"establish 'pieces of the larger specific causation puzzle.' \" Pl. Mem. at 27 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ferguson v. Riverside Sch. Dist. No. 416\n   </em>\n   , No. CS-00-0097-FVS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%2034355958\">\n    2002 WL 34355958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D. Wash. Feb.6, 2002) (internal alteration omitted)). Plaintiffs urge that a lay factfinder could, by connecting snippets of this excluded expert testimony, conclude that Mirena is a cause of IIH. Specifically, plaintiffs propose to resurrect aspects of the expert reports of (1) Dr. Plunkett, a pharmacologist and toxicologist, regarding the pharmacokinetics of LNG; (2) Dr. Darney, an OB/GYN, reprising the majority of his pharmacology and pharmacokinetics opinions; (3) Dr. Johanson, a neuroscientist, regarding cerebrospinal fluid regulation and the interactions of hormones in the relevant regions of the brain; and (4) \"non-disclosed experts from whom th[e] Court sought background knowledge on these matters on Science Day.\" Pl. Mem. at 26-27. Components of this proposed testimony, plaintiffs urge, are not significantly disputed. Plaintiffs assert that a jury could find general causation by connecting and extrapolating from the disparate propositions it proposes to extract from this excluded expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court, however, has excluded as unreliable plaintiffs' general causation witnesses. The Court did not carve out, and hold admissible, snippets of these experts' proposed testimony. And, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that various scientific propositions nestled within plaintiffs' experts' reports were, largely, scientifically uncontested, the Court did not hold that these stray propositions could be revived as fodder from which a lay jury could speculate about and derive a theory of general causation. Yet plaintiffs, having failed to put forward reliable expert testimony consistent with\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , now propose just that. They propose to put shards of its various experts' reports before the jury, to serve as the basis for a lay conclusion as to a highly complex proposition of general causation as to which no expert has yet reliably opined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   This end-run around Rule 702-and this Court's\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ruling-is unsustainable. Even assuming that some species of lay evidence (e.g., an explicit corporate admission that its product is a cause of a disease) could theoretically establish general causation, the propositions here that plaintiffs propose to use as building blocks for a lay finding as to Mirena's capacity to cause IIH are complex, scientific in nature, and highly technical. They patently require expertise to decode and apply.

The Federal Rules of Evidence do not afford any charter for such a venture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs' bid to establish general causation by mixing and matching from the reports of their excluded experts instead is properly viewed as,\n   <em>\n    sub silentio\n   </em>\n   , a backdoor means to revive the excluded expert analyses themselves. In its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   decision, the Court found that plaintiffs' proposed experts, notwithstanding their qualifications in their respective fields, did not\n   articulate a methodologically rigorous and reliable theory of how Mirena causes IIH. The Court so held after performing the role that\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , applying Rule 702, envisioned for a trial court: to serve as a \"gatekeep[er]\" charged with \"ensuring that an expert's testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, various of these excluded witnesses proposed to find general causation based on concatenating scientific propositions-precisely the exercise plaintiffs now suggest that a jury conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs' notion that a jury examine and draw conclusions from subsets of excluded expert testimony is all the more problematic in that the testimony on which plaintiffs now rely largely concerns biological mechanisms by which Mirena, theoretically, might cause IIH.

Consistent with common practice in MDLs implicating complex medical issues, the Court set aside April 9, 2018, prior to argument on the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions, as a day on which scientists other than the parties' general causation experts could give the Court a tutorial on background scientific concepts. These included the nature and history of the IIH disease, the chemistry of LNG and its use in various contraceptives, and the history and operation of the Mirena IUD. Dkt. 250 (March 30, 2018 Order) \u00b6 1.

The Bradford Hill factors are the province of epidemiologists. Where reliably applied by a qualified epidemiologist, they may support an expert opinion that a causal\n   relationship exists between statistically correlated phenomena.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zoloft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276556\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/787/#p796\">\n    858 F.3d at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Bradford Hill criteria are metrics that epidemiologists use to distinguish a causal connection from a mere association.\"). But as the case law reflects, Bradford Hill, like other multi-factor epidemiological inquiries, is not a mere box-checking exercise. Sophisticated judgments instead must be made about the existence and probative value of each constituent scientific factor and its relationship to the others. The case law addressing Bradford Hill underscores the considerable risk (inherent in a multi-factor inquiry) that this methodology will be misapplied, or applied strategically to favor a predetermined outcome. As the Court therefore noted in its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   decision, where an expert fails to rigorously explain how he or she has found or weighted the Bradford Hill criteria, the criteria are rendered \"virtually standardless and their applications to a particular problem can prove unacceptably manipulable.

Dr. Wheeler's application of Bradford Hill suffered from similar flaws to those of Drs. Moy\u00e9 and Plunkett, plus flaws unique to his analysis.

This concession fatally undermined Dr. Wheeler's conclusion that Bradford Hill supported a finding of general causation, because the Bradford Hill criteria are \"a methodology for evaluating whether a demonstrated epidemiological association is, or is not causal, [and] absent such a[ ] [statistical] association, there is no basis to apply the Bradford Hill criteria.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   A lay jury without a grounding in science or epidemiology, notified of the nine Bradford Hill factors and invited to assess and weigh these scientific factors, could easily make similar methodological errors-or ones far more egregious. Plaintiffs' notion that a jury, taught by Bayer's experts what the nine criteria are, could then reliably apply them badly misapprehends-indeed, it trivializes-this mode of epidemiological inquiry. If qualified expert epidemiologists can misapply the Bradford Hill factors, a lay jury certainly cannot be counted on to individually evaluate and\n   collectively weigh these factors in a suitably scientifically rigorous manner, one that avoids the risk of conflating correlation with causation. Notably, plaintiffs do not supply any examples in which any court has permitted the delegation to a lay audience of the application of a complex epidemiological methodology such as Bradford Hill.

Far from concluding that Mirena is a cause of IIH, Dr. Langer opined,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Mirena is a safe contraceptive device that is the preferred option for overweight and obese women. Dkt. 127-1 (\"Langer Rpt.\") at 2-3, 9-12.

Dr. Langer pointedly criticized the methodology of plaintiffs' epidemiology expert, Dr. Moy\u00e9, opining that Dr. Moy\u00e9 ignores existing literature citing body weight as a strong and consistent predictor of IIH, selectively cites literature regarding IIH incidence rates, erroneously relies on the Valenzuela study, and ignores evidence that other products with much higher LNG exposure have no known association with IIH.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In painting Dr. Langer as supporting their thesis of general causation, plaintiffs seize on a small portion of his deposition, in which plaintiffs' counsel questioned Dr. Langer about Bayer's adverse events database\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and about the methods for performing a \"disproportionality analysis,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , assessing the extent to which there are a disproportionate number of adverse events in that database associated with IIH for women using Mirena. Plaintiffs' counsel asked whether a \"proportional recording ratio\" (\"PRR\") \"greater than 40 would suggest or be supportive\n   of causal association.\" Dkt. 171-2 (\"Langer Dep.\") at 18. In response to this proffered PRR figure, and over an objection that the proffered figure was hypothetical, Dr. Langer responded, \"it would not be anything near sufficient evidence for a causal association. It would be one of the triggers to look for additional supporting evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' counsel then clarified, \"I don't mean on its own. I mean when you're looking at the totality of the evidence, and if you added to that a PRR greater than 40, would that be supportive of finding a causal association, or would it have no effect, or would it be opposing finding a causal association?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 188-89. Dr. Langer replied, \"[i]t would be consistent, but it would really only serve as a starting point to look for evidence from much cleaner study designs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189. And when asked about a hypothetical figure for use in a second method of analyzing disproportionality, Dr. Langer reiterated, \"in these hypothetical numbers that you're throwing out here, they would be consistent with a causal association. They would not be any major element of evidence absent more appropriate study designs to assess the question of causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiffs seize on a single line in Dr. Langer's deposition testimony, in which he stated that certain hypothesized adverse reporting rates would be \"consistent\" with a causal association.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs claim that this statement is sufficient record evidence of general causation. But, when read in context, it is clear that Dr. Langer's statement does nothing of the sort. Dr. Langer was explicit that the hypothesized reporting rates would not permit the conclusion that Mirena caused IIH. To the contrary, he testified that the hypothesized reporting rates for Mirena \"would not be anything near sufficient evidence for a causal association,\" and such rates would, at most, \"serve as a starting point to look for evidence from much cleaner design studies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 188-89. In any event, even if plaintiffs' characterization of this excerpt were fair-and it is not-Dr. Langer's statement that hypothetical reporting rates could be \"consistent\" with a causal association at most supports the bare\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   of general causation. That falls far short of what is necessary for plaintiffs to sustain their burden on this element.

In making this argument, plaintiffs must clear a meaningful bar: Courts have cautioned that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   there were cases in which\n   complex general causation issues could be proved by corporate admissions, such cases would be \"rare indeed.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lipitor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517254\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/624/#p647\">\n    892 F.3d at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Supp. 3d at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , so as to be comparable to admissible expert testimony in terms of reliability. Plaintiffs do not point to any statement by Bayer admitting general causation, or anything close to it. Quite the contrary, Bayer, in this litigation, consistently has disputed Mirena's causation of IIH. And the biomechanical chain that plaintiffs posit is subject to debate and challenge-as this Court's\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   analysis of plaintiffs' three proposed \"mechanism\" experts underscores.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mirena IIH/Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    341 F.

To choose one example, although LNG is known to bond with mineralocorticoid receptors (\"MR\"), as plaintiffs note, it is disputed whether LNG is an MR agonist (meaning it binds to receptors and activates them) or antagonist (meaning it binds to receptors and blocks them). One of plaintiffs' excluded mechanism experts, Dr. Salpietro, opined that \"[a]ctivation of the choroid plexus MRs and their downstream\n   pathways more likely than not stimulates the generation of Na+ (sodium) / K+ (potassium)-ATPase pumps, leading to greater movement of sodium ions at the choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPEC) apical membrane into the cerebral ventricles, thereby actively creating an osmotic gradient to drive secretion of CSF.\" Dkt. 98-11 (\"Salpietro Rpt.\") at 17. His model of causation, therefore, depended on LNG being an MR agonist, because the model was based on \"activation of the choroid plexus MRs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs do not, however, identify any instance in which Bayer itself ever admitted this point. On the contrary, Bayer, successfully challenged Dr. Salpietro's mechanism theory, built in part on this proposition, as unproven and unreliable.\n   <em>\n    Mirena IIH/Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    341 F.

Simply put, defendants have not admitted general causation. And plaintiffs' proposal that a jury reason that a series of purported admitted scientific propositions (some not squarely admitted by Bayer) ineluctably leads to the outcome of general causation (very much disputed by Bayer) is not viable. Like other of plaintiffs' proposals for establishing general causation without expert evidence, it would ultimately task a lay factfinder with an assignment well beyond its competence to resolve unaided and invite impermissible conjecture and unscientific guesswork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Regulatory History of Other Products Containing LNG\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that the FDA has concluded that LNG can cause IIH, and this conclusion gives rise to a genuine dispute on the material fact of general causation. Pl. Mem. at 39. To support this claim, plaintiffs point to an FDA warning approved in connection with a separate LNG-based contraceptive product, Jadelle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   As the Court reviewed in its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ruling, Jadelle is a contraceptive implant inserted beneath the skin and placed in the arm. It is the successor product to a product called Norplant, which between 1991 and 2002 was marketed in the United States; Jadelle is currently sold in Europe.\n   <em>\n    Mirena IIH/Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    341 F. Supp. 3d at 222, 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Jadelle bears the following warning: \"[IIH] has been reported on rare occasions in users of levonorgestrel implants. Consider this diagnosis if persistent headache and or visual disturbances occur in a woman with JADELLE, particularly if the patient is obese or has recently gained weight. Remove JADELLE if [IIH] is diagnosed.\" Dkt. 331-12 (\"Jadelle Label\") \u00a7 5.9. The Jadelle label is FDA approved, although the product has not been distributed in the United States. Relying on this warning, plaintiffs argue that the FDA has necessarily determined that LNG is capable of causing IIH, and that a jury could find, based on the FDA's such finding, that Mirena, which also utilizes LNG as its hormonal component, can cause IIH. Pl. Mem. at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   For multiple reasons, plaintiffs' reliance on the Jadelle label is misplaced. First, plaintiffs wrongly equate Jadelle with Mirena. But the fact that Jadelle contains LNG does not establish it as tantamount to Mirena. Jadelle is a subdermal implant, unlike Mirena, which is inserted into the uterus. And Jadelle produces substantially higher systemic levels of LNG than Mirena.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 135-6 (\"Mirena Label\") \u00a7 11.1 (total implanted dose of 52 mg)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Jadelle Label at \u00a7 2.1 (total implanted dose of 150 mg).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Moreover, Jadelle's label quite clearly does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   reflect a determination by the FDA that LNG causes IIH. The warning\n   states only that \"[IIH] has been reported on rare occasions in users of [LNG] implants.\" The label encourages women using Jadelle and experiencing IIH symptoms to consider these reports, and directs Jadelle users to discontinue using Jadelle if IIH is diagnosed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jadelle Label \u00a7 5.9. This Court in its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ruling addressed an analogous argument by one of plaintiffs' experts that the Jadelle label, and a similar label on Norplant, another LNG-releasing contraceptive device, revealed a determination of general causation. Rejecting as baseless the claim that the \"Jadelle and Norplant labels bespeak a predicate finding of causation,\" the Court wrote, \"on their face, these labels ... establish nothing of the kind.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n    341 F.

Absent a factual basis to assume that the manufacturer's decision to include the Norplant or Jadelle labels reflected evidence bearing on causation-as opposed to a prudent means of guarding against legal risk by a manufacturer alerted to case reports\"-there was no basis for plaintiffs' proposed expert to \"rely on these labels as supporting [a] finding of causation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528003\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That the Jadelle label describes-accurately-the fact of \"rare\" reports of IIH by Jadelle users simply does not address, let alone reflect a FDA finding on, the issue of causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In any event, even if the Jadelle label could be read to reflect an FDA determination of Jadelle's or LNG's capacity to cause IIH-and it clearly cannot-\"[i]t is widely recognized that, when evaluating pharmaceutical drugs, the FDA often uses a different standard than a court does to evaluate evidence of causation in a products liability action.

None comes remotely close. The Court has separately considered whether this result is different considering these pieces in combination. It is not.

Dkt. 321. On November 9, 2018, the parties filed a joint letter setting forth their views. Plaintiffs asked the Court to certify its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ruling for an interlocutory appeal, whereas Bayer argued that the case should proceed to a defense motion for summary judgment on the issue of general causation, as had the Mirena Perforation litigation after Judge Seibel excluded plaintiffs' expert witnesses on that point. Dkt. 322. The Court agreed with Bayer's proposed course as the most efficient, and directed the parties to jointly propose a briefing schedule. Dkt. 323.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   On November 16, 2018, the parties submitted a proposed schedule, but stated that they disagreed as to page lengths. Based on plaintiffs' representation that they intended to oppose summary judgment by relying on purported admissions of general causation, Bayer sought an enlargement of its reply brief to address those admissions. Dkt. 324. Bayer noted that in the Perforation MDL, the plaintiffs had agreed to set out the alleged corporate admissions of causation in a letter to the Court, whereas plaintiffs in this case had declined to do so. This, Bayer argued, made it hard for Bayer's opening brief in support of summary judgment to anticipate plaintiffs' concrete bases for asserting that Bayer had admitted general causation, and justified an expanded reply to accommodate purported admissions that plaintiffs' opposition brief had revealed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   To facilitate informed and efficient briefing, the Court, on November 19, 2018, directed plaintiffs' counsel to submit a letter previewing the admissions on which it then intended to rely in opposing Bayer's motion for summary judgment. Dkt. 325. The Court emphasized, however, that while it expected plaintiffs to make a good-faith effort to disclose the specific evidence on which they expected to rely in claiming corporate admissions, plaintiffs' letter to this effect \"will not limit the range of materials on which plaintiffs may rely in their briefing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' counsel thereafter filed such letter, while protesting that the Court's order \"turns the summary judgment standard on its head.\" Dkt. 326.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Plaintiffs are wrong. The Court's approach of attempting informally to identify early the evidence on which a motion for summary judgment would most likely turn was modeled on the Mirena Perforation MDL. This approach did not in any respect relieve Bayer of its burden, as movant, to demonstrate the absence of a question of material fact. It served merely to assure orderly briefing, by enabling the Court to receive, in Bayer's opening brief, a fuller and more informed discussion of the evidence on which plaintiffs expected to rely in opposing summary judgment. The Court's Order did not limit the universe of materials on which plaintiffs were thereafter permitted to rely in opposing Bayer's motion. Plaintiffs cite no authority that this sensible case-management device infringed any legal right of theirs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Seventh Amendment and Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In a final argument, plaintiffs argue that granting Bayer summary judgment would be unconstitutional. Such an order, plaintiffs claim, would violate the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial in cases in\n   which the value in controversy exceeds $ 20. Although plaintiffs appear to suggest that summary judgment is inherently unconstitutional,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 44, they state that they are not seeking a global ruling that \"summary judgment is unconstitutional in all cases,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 45. Rather, plaintiffs argue, this case is distinct because Bayer's motion was made after the close of discovery as to general causation, but before plaintiff-specific discovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   This argument is easily dispatched. It is long established that \"summary judgment does not violate the Seventh Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v.

This result is not changed by the Court's decision to stage discovery, consistent with the guidance of the JPML, so as to front-load discovery on the potentially dispositive issue of general causation. The alternative-in which summary judgment motions practice on this global issue would have been deferred until fact and expert discovery as to the facts and circumstances attendant to each of the approximately 920 plaintiffs in this MDL-would have consumed enormous resources of the parties, without adding to the pool of evidence adduced here on the gateway issue of general causation. Plaintiffs have not identified any authority to the effect that staging discovery to permit efficient summary judgment motions practice on a potentially dispositive threshold issue abridges a party's Seventh Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Nor, to the extent plaintiffs imply that the Court has made a factual determination that LNG could not have caused plaintiffs' IIH, has the Court done so. Rather, the Court held in its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ruling, as a legal matter, that plaintiffs' experts have failed to offer reliable, admissible testimony of general causation, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   . And the Court now holds, also as a legal matter, that the remaining evidence also fails to supply a basis on which a jury could reliably find the required element of general causation. In the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact as to causation, summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McClamrock v.

Bayer cites this authority to support both the argument addressed above, that general causation is an element of complex products liability tort claims, and its argument addressed\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , that general causation in such cases requires proof in the form of expert testimony. The Court has reviewed the cited authority, which includes cases from state courts and federal courts applying state law. The Court is persuaded that every jurisdiction requires a showing of general causation in cases, like this one, in which a plaintiff alleges that the use of a product gave rise, through a complex causal mechanism, to a medical injury or impairment.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     McClain v.
