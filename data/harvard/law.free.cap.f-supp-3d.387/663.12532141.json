(\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8.) The spill required clean up and remediation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Apollo had this work performed \"by appropriate outside vendors\" for the cost of $ 143,643.64. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Apollo reported this to QBE through its agent on November 1, 2016-about one hundred and fifty-three days (153) after the oil spill. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The agent told Apollo there was no coverage under the policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Apollo disagreed. (\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9.) On May 5, 2017-or about three hundred, thirty-eight days (338) days after the spill-Apollo informed Defendant of the claim by letter through the Claims Department of Burnett &amp; Company, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Apollo contended that there was coverage and provided \"appropriate documentation of proof of loss.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, Apollo stated that the Seepage and Pollution Buyback Endorsement applied, for a number of reasons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Critical to this ruling, Apollo specifically alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Apollo conceded that it had not met the 90-day reporting period, but noted that the report of November 1, 2016, occurred within 150 days of the occurrence and within the policy period, and further pointed out the lack of prejudice to QBE by the delay because the cleanup and remediation was timely performed. The invoices indicate cleanup began on June 1, 2016, as soon as the leak was noted. The only claim made by Apollo was for reimbursement of the cleanup and remediation costs of $ 143,643.64, for which it provided all invoices and documentation as satisfactory proof of loss to QBE. Clearly, there was no prejudice to QBE. It would have been no different to QBE had the spill and clean up been reported on the 89th day, rather than the 150th day, because all of the cleanup and remediation work had already been done. QBE could have taken no steps to alter those actions. Therefore, QBE was not prejudiced by the delay in reporting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10.) Apollo again alleges that \"QBE was not prejudiced by the late reporting because the cleanup and remediation was timely and properly performed, and the reporting occurred within the policy period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   QBE denied the claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) QBE stated that Apollo could not meet the requirements of the Buyback because it failed to satisfy the 90-day reporting requirement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant also cited the fact that Apollo \"failed to follow Form BEP-808 (11 15) that notice of an incident be reported immediately to Burnett &amp; Company, Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiff, QBE had the burden of investigating and showing prejudice after getting notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff asserts that the Buyback provision applies: (1) because the main case Defendant relies upon-\n   <em>\n    In Re: Matter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    of Complaint of Settoon Towing, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057421\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/268/\">\n    720 F.3d 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2013) -is distinguishable with respect to the policy language; and (2) an oil spill is not a \"pollutant\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14), so the TPE at issue here is not applicable. (\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 13-16.) With respect to this second argument, Plaintiff further alleges that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The applicability of a TPE is determined by the following considerations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) Whether the insured is a \"polluter\" within the meaning of the exclusion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (2) Whether the injury-causing substance is a [\"]pollutant[\"] within the meaning of the exclusion; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (3) Whether there was a [\"]discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape[\"] of a pollutant by\n   the insured within the meaning of the policy.[ ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Plaintiff concludes: \"Apollo is not a 'polluter' and the oil that 'escaped' is not a pollutant. Nor was its 'escape' intentional.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff brings three claims for relief. First, Apollo seeks coverage under the Policy and reimbursement for the clean-up and remediation costs of $ 143,643.64 (\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19.) Plaintiff urges that the TBE doesn't apply because of the Buyback. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Second, Plaintiff claims damages, penalties, and attorney's fees under La. R.S. 22:1892(A)(3) for failure to initiate loss adjustment and to pay the claim within the statutorily mandated deadlines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) And third, Plaintiff seeks damages, penalties, and attorney's fees under La. R.S. 22:1973 and La. R.S. 22:1892 for Defendant's alleged breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to timely pay Plaintiff, all without cause (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Relevant Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant previously moved to dismiss this case on the same grounds currently advanced: failure to provide timely notice under the Buyback. (Doc. 7-1 at 6-8.) In ruling on the motion (Doc. 16), the Court did not go so far as to dismiss Plaintiff's claims, but the Court did find that the original complaint did not \"provide fair and adequate allegations concerning the initial inapplicability of the total pollution exclusion.\" (Doc. 16 at 7.) On the record before the Court, dismissal was not appropriate, but the Court gave Plaintiff leave to amend to clarify its allegations. (Doc. 16 at 6-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently filed the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 17), which attached the relevant Policy provisions. (Doc. 17-1.) Defendant then filed the instant motion (Doc. 18) and attached the entire Policy (Doc. 18-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendant argues that (1) contrary to Plaintiff's position, it is well established in Louisiana law that oil is a \"pollutant,\" and (2) Plaintiff failed to satisfy the Buyback's requirements because it admitted in the\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   that it failed to give timely notice to Defendant of the occurrence. As to this second argument, Defendant primarily relies on a recent Fifth Circuit case-\n   <em>\n    In re Matter of Complaint of Settoon Towing, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057421\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/268/\">\n    720 F.3d 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2013) -where the buyback language was allegedly identical and the appellate court found that failure to give notice precluded recovery, even where there was no prejudice shown. Defendant also distinguishes Plaintiff's case about notice on the grounds that it involved an automobile policy, not a pollution exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff responds that this Court previously held that deciding whether a pollution exclusion applies depends on the facts and policy language in each case. Here, the Fifth Circuit case is distinguishable because the language in that case was \"stronger\" than it is in this case. As a result, Defendant had to show prejudice, and he has failed to do so. Additionally, the party in the Fifth Circuit case was a sophisticated user, whereas, here, the plaintiff is a small Louisiana business. Plaintiff thought it was acting properly when it immediately retained a cleanup company and then gave notice later. In the alternative, Plaintiff seeks leave to amend to plead that it was an \"unsophisticated business\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendant replies that Plaintiff's arguments are misplaced. Contrary to Plaintiff's opposition,\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   and other cases have excluded coverage even where the terms \"condition\" and \"intent and effect\" are not in the policy. All that is required is that the Buyback have a notice provision, and, here, Plaintiff failed to comply. Second, Fifth Circuit law finds that businesses are sophisticated (particularly oil companies), whereas consumers are not. According to Defendant, denying the motion to dismiss would essentially mean rewriting the policy. Lastly, since two prior\n   amendments have been allowed, the Court should dismiss with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

For example, under pollution exclusions similar to the one at issue here, courts have found \"pollutant\" to include everything from asbestos, carbon monoxide, gasoline, lead paint, and some pesticides; on the other hand, some courts have found that \"pollutants\" do not include muriatic acid, styrene resins, and other forms of pesticide. See Russ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00a7 127:12 (collecting authorities). Consequently, when making this determination, the trier of fact should consider the nature of the injury-causing substance, its typical usage, the quantity of the discharge, whether the substance was being used for its intended purpose when the injury took place, whether the substance is one that would be viewed as a pollutant as the term is generally understood, and any other factor the trier of fact deems relevant to that conclusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Doerr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11159977\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/119/#p124\">\n    774 So. 2d at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Fifth Circuit then found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Turning to the insurance contracts at issue, we hold the umbrella insurers are not liable to Settoon regardless of prejudice to the umbrella insurers. First, it is clear that the notice condition in the endorsement is a \"condition precedent\" despite not using the precise phrase \"condition precedent.\" The buyback clearly indicates the notice provision is a condition precedent to recovery under the endorsement. The absolute pollution exclusion states, \"It is ... agreed that the intent and effect of this exclusion is to delete from any and all coverage's ... any ... claim ... in any way arising out of [pollution].\" The buyback states, \"It is hereby agreed that the above Absolute Exclusion shall not apply provided that the Named Assured established that all of the following conditions have been met....\" Settoon must \"establish\" that the \"conditions\" have been met in order for the absolute pollution exclusion not to apply. Short of the exact phrase \"condition precedent,\" there is almost no stronger language that could establish a \"condition precedent\" to recovery. Further, Settoon is a sophisticated business, not an ordinary consumer.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Joslyn Mfg.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527031\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/630/#p633\">\n    30 F.3d at 633-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we analyze the notice provision in the buyback as a condition precedent directed at a sophisticated business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   The bargain here \"delete[s] from any and all coverage [ ]\" pollution liability unless the insured gives notice within 30 days of the occurrence. Pollution liability is not stripped away because of a violation of the notice provision; rather, non-compliance prevents the exception to the exclusion from taking effect in the first instance, meaning the pollution exclusion remains in effect. In Louisiana a violation of a provision mandating notice within the policy period allows the insurer to avoid liability,\n   <em>\n    Hood\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

Therefore, holding the umbrella insurers liable where the conditions of the buyback were not met would alter the terms of the parties' bargain. Because Settoon did not comply with the 30-day notice provision, which is a condition precedent to recovery under the buyback, the umbrella insurers are not liable under the Bumbershoot 2 and Bumbershoot 3 policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374463\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/420/#p426\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Turning to the instant case, the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   applies to\n   preclude coverage.\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   based its holding on three grounds: (1) the strong language in the pollution exclusion; (2) the notice provision of the buyback; and (3) the vessel owner's status as a sophisticated user. Here, all three go toward dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   As to the first, while the language of the instant Policy is not as strong as the pollution exclusion in\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   , it does clearly state that \"This insurance does not apply to: ... 'property damage' which would not have occurred in whole or part but for the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of 'pollutants' at any time.\" (Policy,\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A, Doc. 17-1 at 16.) Thus, the TPE is strong in its own right and unambiguously excludes coverage for pollution events not covered by the Buyback.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridgefield Cas. Ins. Co. v.

Compl.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10), and the Court finds that this is enough under\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   for this exception to the TPE not to apply. Defendant is right that the language of the buyback notice provision in\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   is virtually identical to the one in this case; like the policy in\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   , the Buyback requires Plaintiff to \"establish\" that certain \"conditions,\" such as timely notice, are met for the TPE not to apply. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy,\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   , Ex.

The 'occurrence' became known to the insured within 30 days after its commencement and is reported to the Company within 90 days thereafter.\") This is particularly important because, as in\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   , \"Pollution liability is not stripped away because of a violation of the notice provision; rather, non-compliance prevents the exception to the exclusion from taking effect in the first instance, meaning the pollution exclusion remains in effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057421\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/268/\">\n    720 F.3d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, as in\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   , \"the notice provision in the buyback reflects the allocation of risk the parties bargained for. Therefore, holding the umbrella insurers liable where the conditions of the buyback were not met would alter the terms of the parties' bargain.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057421\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057421\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/268/\">\n    at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Lastly, as to the sophisticated user question, the Court finds that this issue also weighs in Defendant's favor. Plaintiff fails to allege in his\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   anything that would indicate that it was a consumer rather than a sophisticated user, as\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Settoon Towing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057421\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/268/\">\n    720 F.3d at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Where policy holders are 'consumers unlikely to be conversant with all the fine print of their policies,' \" strict adherence to notice provisions that are conditions precedent is not as important as when 'both parties are sophisticated businesses, which are expected to be conversant with the terms of their contracts.' \").

Comp.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8.) Even construing the facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that Apollo's operation of multiple wells necessarily means it is not a consumer but rather a sophisticated user.
