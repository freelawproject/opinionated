(Reagan)'s Response [#29], Cedar Park's Reply [#30] in support, Reagan's Sur-Reply [#31] in opposition, and Cedar Park's Sur-Sur-Reply [#35] in support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having reviewed the documents, the relevant law, and the file as a whole, the Court now enters the following opinion and orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a First Amendment case. Reagan is a commercial billboard company in the business of outdoor advertising. Am. Compl. [#18] at 2. On March 8, 2017, Reagan submitted five sign permit applications to the City. Am. Mot. Summ. J. [#24-2] (Sign Permit Applications). Three of these applications requested permission to install digital sign faces on existing outdoor signs (the Digital Conversion Applications).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 2-16. The other two applications sought permits for the construction of two new signs (the New Sign Applications).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 17-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To receive approval, permit applications must demonstrate proposed signs meet the requirements of the City's Sign Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These requirements are contained in two articles. The first article-Article 13.01-is entitled \"On-Premises Sign Standards and Permits.\" Am. Mot. Summ. J. [#24-5] Ex. 5 (Sign Code) at 1. The second article-Article 13.03-is entitled \"Off-Premises Sign Standards and Permits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both Article 13.01 and Article 13.03 contain provisions which rely upon a distinction between on-premises and off-premises signs. An \"on-premises sign\" is defined as a \"sign identifying or advertising the business, person, activity, goods, products, or services located on the site where the sign is installed, or that directs persons to a location on that site.\" Sign Code at 4. By contrast, an \"off-premises sign\" is defined as a \"sign referring to goods, products or services provided at a location other than that which the sign occupies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. All five of Reagan's permit applications relate to off-premises signs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 14, 2017, the City denied Reagan's permit applications. Am. Mot. Summ. J. [#24-4] Ex. 4 (Denial Letters). Among other reasons, the New Sign Applications were denied because they proposed using light-emitting diode (LED) displays in off-premises signs and because they proposed to erect \"pylon signs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Sign Code \u00a7 13.01.007(i)(4) (\"Electronically controlled changeable messages signs shall not advertise goods or services not offered on the premises on which the sign is located.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13.03.006(d) (\"No light emitting\n   diode (LED) displays or signs shall be permitted.\"). The City also denied the Digital Conversion Applications because, like the New Sign Applications, the Digital Conversion Applications proposed installing LED displays in off-premises signs. Denial Letters at 1-6; Sign Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.01.007(i)(4), 13.03.006(d);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 13.01.016(a), 13.03.007(a) (\"[N]o change or alteration shall be made [to existing signs] that would increase the degree of nonconformity [with the Sign Code].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the City denied Reagan's permit applications, Reagan filed this action in state court arguing that the Sign Code's differing treatment of on-premises and off-premises signs constitutes content discrimination and that this content-based distinction cannot survive constitutional scrutiny. Notice Removal [#1-1] Ex. 1 (Original Pet.) at 4. On this basis, Reagan seeks to invalidate the entire Sign Code. Reply [#31] at 3. The City removed the action to this Court and now moves for summary judgment. Notice Removal [#1]; Am. Mot. Summ. J. [#24]. This pending motion is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court first considers whether Reagan has standing to challenge the denial of its New Sign and Digital Conversion Applications. Because the Court concludes Reagan possesses standing to challenge the denial of its Digital Conversion Applications, the Court then turns to consider whether the City is entitled to summary judgment as to the constitutionality of the Sign Code provisions relied upon to deny those applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Reagan argues the City's denial of the New Sign and Digital Conversion Applications relied on Sign Code provisions that draw unconstitutional, content-based distinctions between on-premises and off-premises speech. The Court first considers whether Reagan possesses standing to challenge the denial of its New Sign Applications. It then considers whether Reagan possesses standing to challenge the denial of the Digital Conversion Applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. New Sign Applications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The City suggests Reagan lacks standing to challenge the denial of its New Sign Applications because Reagan has not shown this denial is redressable. Am. Mot. Summ. J. [#24] at 5, 17; Reply [#30] at 1-2. In part, the New Sign Applications were denied because they sought to erect \"pylon signs\" prohibited by Sign Code \u00a7 13.01.006(e) (the \"Pylon Provision\"). Reply [#30] at 1-2. The City argues the\n   Pylon Provision does not depend on the challenged distinction between on- and off-premises signs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If, as the City suggests, the Pylon Provision does not depend on the challenged distinction, then Reagan's injury is not redressable because the Pylon Provision will provide a basis for denying the New Sign Applications regardless of how the Court rules in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Reagan does not argue the New Sign Applications comply with the Pylon Provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sur-Reply [#31] at 2-3. Instead, Reagan argues the City erred in relying on the Pylon Provision to deny the New Sign Applications because the Pylon Provision does not apply to off-premises signs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reagan believes the Pylon Provision does not apply to off-premises signs because it is located in Article 13.01, which is entitled \"On-Premises Sign Standards and Permits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Reagan, this title conclusively demonstrates the provisions of Article 13.01 apply only to on-premises signs. Sur-Reply [#31] at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In most circumstances, one would expect the title or heading of a statutory or regulatory provision to reflect the scope and purpose of that provision. But in some instances, a statutory or regulatory provision possesses a heading at odds with the provision's operative text. Perhaps for this reason, headings are just one of several considerations taken into account by Texas courts when interpreting statutory and regulatory provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. GOV. CODE \u00a7 311.023 (listing considerations that may be weighed by courts when interpreting statutory provisions);\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fla.

[n]onetheless, statutory titles and section headings are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, the heading of Article 13.01 suggests the article applies only to on-premises signs. But the operative text of Article 13.01 does not contain such a limitation. To the contrary, Article 13.01 contains a number of provisions that appear to be of general applicability and do not depend on a distinction between on- and off-premises signs. For example, \u00a7 13.01.004 establishes that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, move or convert\n   <em>\n    any sign\n   </em>\n   within the city ... without first obtaining a sign permit ....\" Sign Code \u00a7 13.01.004(a) (emphasis added). As another example, Sign Code \u00a7 13.01.019, entitled \"Repairs and Maintenance,\" provides that \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   signs in the city must be properly maintained at all times\" and then sets out extensive procedural requirements\n   for reporting and removing signs in violation of the Sign Code.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677251\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/33/#p47\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13.01.019 (emphasis added). And as a third example, Sign Code \u00a7 13.01.007(i) regulates the structural integrity of \"[a]ny sign as defined in this article.\" None of these provisions contain textual limitations restricting their application to on-premises signs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sign Code \u00a7 13.01.002 (defining \"sign\" as \"[a]ny surface, display, design, or device visible from a public right-of-way on which letters, illustrations, designs, figures, or symbols are painted, printed, [or] stamped ....\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Sign Code \u00a7 13.01.002 (establishing distinct definitions for \"signs,\" \"on-premises signs,\" and \"off-premises signs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   If Article 13.01 only applied to on-premises signs, then the provisions highlighted above-and many other provisions contained within Article 13.01 that appear to be of general applicability\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   -would not apply to off-premises signs. This would leave off-premises signs relatively unregulated, since Article 13.03-which does regulate off-premises signage-does not establish a comprehensive scheme for regulating off-premises signs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sign Code \u00a7 13.03.001-.011. Yet it is unlikely the City intended to closely regulate on-premises signs while leaving off-premises signs comparatively unregulated, especially given the disfavored status of off-premises signs within the City's regulatory scheme. More plausibly, in the Court's view, the City intended Article 13.01 to regulate both on- and off-premises signs and intended Article 13.03 to supplement Article 13.01 with specific regulations addressing only off-premises signs. The Court thus concludes Article 13.01 applies to both on- and off-premises signs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because the Court concludes Article 13.01 applies to both on- and off-premises signs, the application of the Pylon Provision-which is located in Article 13.01-does not turn on the challenged distinction between on- and off-premises signs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sign Code \u00a7 13.01.006(e) (\"No pylon signs shall be permitted ....\"). As a result, the Pylon Provision will remain unaffected if the Court invalidates the Sign Code's distinction between on- and off-premises signs, and Reagan's New Sign Applications will still be denied for failure to comply with the Pylon Provision. The Court therefore concludes Reagan has not demonstrated redressability because it has not shown the denial of the New Sign Applications will be affected by the Court's ruling in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    KH Outdoor, L.L.C. v.

Consequently, Reagan lacks standing to challenge the denial of its New Sign Applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Digital Conversion Applications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The City also suggests Reagan lacks standing to challenge the denial of the Digital Conversion Applications because Reagan cannot show redressability as to those applications, either. Reply [#30] at 1-2. Specifically, the City contends the Digital Conversion Applications will be denied regardless of how the Court rules in\n   this lawsuit because the applications propose sign modifications that would violate two Sign Code provisions-\u00a7 13.01.006(g) and \u00a7 13.03.006(d)-that are not dependent on the challenged distinction between on- and off-premises signage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047071\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/886/#p895\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court concludes Reagan possesses standing to challenge the denial of the Digital Conversion Applications. Notwithstanding the City's argument to the contrary, \u00a7 13.01.006(g) and \u00a7 13.03.006(d) are dependent on the challenged distinction between on- and off-premises signs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 13.01.006(g) prohibits \"electronically controlled changeable copy signs ... \"except as specifically allowed by section[ ] 13.01.007.\" In turn, \u00a7 13.01.007(i) allows such signs subject to certain restrictions, including that such signs \"shall not advertise goods or services not offered on the premises on which the sign is located.\" Thus, the approval of electronically controlled changeable signs under \u00a7 13.01.006(g) and \u00a7 13.01.007(i) turns, in part, on whether such signs qualify as on- or off-premises signs. Similarly, and somewhat redundantly, \u00a7 13.03.006(d)(4)-which applies only to off-premises signs\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   -emphasizes that \"[n]o light emitting diode (LED) displays or signs shall be permitted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   If the Court holds the distinction between on- and off-premises signs is unconstitutional, then \u00a7 13.03.006(g) and \u00a7 13.03.006(d)(4) can no longer be relied upon as a basis for denying the Digital Conversion Applications. Absent any further argument from the City as to why or how the Digital Conversion Applications might still be denied for reasons independent of these provisions, the Court concludes that Reagan has standing to challenge the denial of these applications because their denial would be redressed by an order invalidating the application of the challenged provisions to off-premises signs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes Reagan has standing to challenge the denial of the Digital Conversion Applications but not the New Sign Applications. Because Reagan has standing to challenge the denial of the Digital Conversion Applications, the Court proceeds to consider Reagan's claim that the denial of those applications violated the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As the Court previously noted, the Sign Code contains several restrictions which apply to off-premises speech but not on-premises speech.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section I.B.2. What's more, these restrictions are content-based restrictions, and because they are content-based, they must survive strict scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section I.B.2. Thus, the burden is on the City to demonstrate the restrictions further a compelling interest and are narrowly tailored to\n   achieve that interest. The City has not met this burden here-indeed, the City has not even attempted to argue the restrictions further a compelling interest or are narrowly tailored.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Am. Mot. Summ. J. [#24] at 10. The Court therefore denies summary judgment on Reagan's claim that the Sign Code imposes unconstitutional, content-based restrictions on noncommercial, off-premises speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court dismisses Reagan's claim that denial of the New Sign Applications violated the First Amendment on the ground that Reagan lacks standing to assert that claim. By contrast, the Court concludes Reagan does have standing to challenge the denial of the Digital Conversion Applications. Because the Court concludes the denial of the Digital Sign Permits must be evaluated under strict scrutiny and because the City has not carried its burden under that standard, the Court denies summary judgment as to Reagan's claim that denial of the Digital Conversion Permits violates the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that the City's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment [#24] is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as described in this opinion; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the City's claim that denial of the New Sign Applications violated the First Amendment is DISMISSED for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Cedar Park's Motion to Strike Sur-Reply or, in the Alternative, Motion for Leave to File Sur-Sur-Reply [#32] is DISMISSED AS MOOT because Cedar Park has already filed its sur-sur-reply, which the Court considers herein.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The City enacted a new sign code the day after Reagan submitted its permit applications.

Gov't Code \u00a7 245.002.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Reagan also argues the City is not entitled to summary judgment on this argument because the City \"presented no argument either as to the applicability of [the unchallenged provisions] or to the validity of the grounds\" the City relied upon in seeking summary judgment. Sur-Reply [#33] The Court rejects this argument. The argument put forward in the City's motion for summary judgment was sufficient to put Reagan on notice that the City disputed Reagan's standing to challenge the denials of its applications.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Am. Mot. Summ. J. [#24] at 17. Further, although the Court agrees the City might have better briefed its standing argument, this Court is nevertheless obligated to dismiss claims over which it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) (\"If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the Court must dismiss the action.\").
