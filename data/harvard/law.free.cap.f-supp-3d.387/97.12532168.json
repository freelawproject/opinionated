Horsey alleges that he was a \"remarkable employee\" who amassed numerous awards to reflect his \"outstanding\" employment record throughout his decades-long tenure as an employee with Defendant United States Department of State (\"State\"). (Am. Compl., ECF No. 22, \u00b6 24.) Still, after Horsey engaged in a work-related altercation with a co-worker in 2011, State required Horsey to undergo a mental evaluation, and when Horsey refused to be evaluated without a union representative present, Horsey's security clearance was suspended and he was placed on administrative leave. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) State later suspended Horsey indefinitely without pay and revoked his security clearance altogether. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39.) In the instant legal action, Horsey maintains that State undertook those employment actions because he is African American (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 22); indeed, his two-count complaint claims that State discriminated against him on the basis of his race and subjected him to a hostile work environment, both in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-54; 55-59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court at present is the State Department's motion to dismiss Horsey's amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss Am. Compl. (\"Defs.' Mot.\"), ECF No. 28.) For the reasons explained below, this Court agrees with State that Horsey's amended complaint misses the mark, primarily because\n   the pleading does not allege that Horsey suffered an adverse employment action\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   his race, nor does it describe discriminatory conduct that is severe or pervasive enough to make his hostile work environment claim remotely plausible. Consequently, Horsey's amended complaint fails to allege facts that, if true, would support his claim that State discriminated against him on the basis of his race. As a result, the agency's motion to dismiss must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Horsey's amended complaint must be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .

Alleged Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Horsey worked for the State Department as an Information Technology Specialist in the Information Resource Management Bureau until his \"Top Secret\" security clearance was revoked in June of 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 39.) According to the amended complaint, Horsey was involved in a workplace dispute with Shane Wardle, a Caucasian male co-worker, on February 3, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Wardle allegedly sent an email to his and Horsey's first and second line supervisors \"moments after the alleged incident occurred,\" and in that email, Wardle allegedly \"reported a false claim/allegation\" about Horsey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The complaint contends that the two supervisors met with Wardle and Horsey the following day to discuss the incident, but \"Wardle would not repeat the claims made in the email[ ] in the presence of [Horsey][.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Horsey \"adamantly denied the allegations\" from Wardle's email, and one of the supervisors \"deemed the meeting a 'stalemate' \" and referred the incident \"to Diplomatic Security for investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The complaint alleges that the supervisor who referred the matter for investigation knew that Wardle had \"fil[ed] several false allegations against other U.S. Department of State employees with impunity[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the amended complaint, \"[b]etween February 4, 2011 and February 23, 2011,\" a Diplomatic Security Special Agent \"interviewed Mr. Wardle's witnesses as a part of his investigation, but did not interview any witnesses on [Horsey's] behalf.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) The complaint further alleges that none of the witnesses interviewed \"were present or witnessed the alleged February 3, 2011 event.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Special Agent conducting the investigation allegedly \"ran a background check on Mr. Wardle ... and was aware of [Wardle's] history of filing false claims[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Special Agent interviewed Horsey on February 18, 2011, and asked Horsey \"if he would be willing to speak with a Department[-]provided mental health professional concerning what may be an anger management problem.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Horsey allegedly \"said he wanted to think about it\" and thereafter sought advice from his union, which told him \"that he should not voluntarily meet with anyone in the medical unit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) According to the amended complaint, on May 6, 2011, Horsey received a letter from the Office of Personnel Security and Suitability Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which stated that Horsey was being referred to the Office of Medical Services \"for review and evaluation\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27), and that \"[p]ursuant to retention of [Horsey's] continued security clearance eligibility,\" Horsey would have to schedule such an evaluation (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The letter also included an advisory \"that non-compliance with this directive could have negative consequences with regard to [Horsey's] security clearance eligibility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The amended complaint alleges that Horsey requested that any evaluation be conducted with a union representative present, but this request was allegedly denied. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 30.) Horsey then \"continued to receive requests/demands to undergo the mental evaluation\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31), and he \"continued to invoke his right to have a representative present for any interview relating to the matter under investigation\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Horsey's amended complaint states that the investigation into the incident with Wardle \"was determined to be 'inconclusive' \" and \"was closed on March 12, 2011.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) However, Horsey's \"Top Secret Security Clearance was suspended and [Horsey] was placed on administrative leave with pay on November 29, 2011[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) On December 9, 2011, Horsey received a \"Proposal for Indefinite Suspension Without Pay\" letter (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35), and was \"suspended indefinitely on Mar[ch] 16, 2012\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37). Between receiving the letter and his indefinite suspension going into effect, Horsey had \"attended an appeal hearing on January 17, 2012\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36), and his indefinite suspension without pay was later rescinded (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38). However, on June 6, 2012, Horsey was notified \"that his Top Secret [Security] Clearance ha[d] been revoked[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) His initial complaint included three counts: (1) discrimination on the basis of race, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-53); (2) retaliation for engaging in protected activity, in violation of Title VII (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-56); and (3) hostile work environment, also in violation of Title VII (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-59). State filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on January 9, 2015 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Orig. Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 11), and Horsey filed a motion for summary judgment on December 16, 2015 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 17). On March 22, 2016, this Court issued a written opinion that granted State's motion to dismiss and denied Horsey's summary judgment motion as moot, but that also gave Horsey leave to file an amended complaint.

The Court then dismissed the claims that were \"based on the three alleged instances in which Horsey was referred to a medical/psychological evaluation and denied union representation at that evaluation ... for lack of administrative\n   exhaustion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343503\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/256/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343503\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/256/\">\n    at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court further dismissed Horsey's claim \"that the revocation of his security clearance was an act of unlawful retaliation\" on the grounds that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Department of Navy v. Egan\n   </em>\n   barred any such claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343503\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/256/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 267-69 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601280\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/518/\">\n    484 U.S. 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601280\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/518/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601280\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/518/\">\n    98 L.Ed.2d 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Notably, this Court also dismissed Horsey's hostile work environment claim, because Horsey's complaint was \"conspicuously devoid of any allegation that Horsey himself was subjected to intimidation, ridicule, or insult on the basis of his race, much less race-based affronts that were so severe or pervasive that the conditions of his employment were altered.\"\n   <em>\n    Horsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343503\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/256/\">\n    170 F.

Count Two alleges that State subjected Horsey to a \"hostile and abusive work environment\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56), because it \"ignored [Horsey's] rights ..., [Horsey] was required to undergo an evaluation, and his white counterpart was not\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57), and Horsey \"endured discrimination that was pervasive and regular[ ] (in the form of emails, phone calls, and letters, threatening [Horsey's] employment)\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58). Horsey attached 75 pages of exhibits to the amended complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22-1), and the pleading seeks both damages and equitable relief (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot.) On September 6, 2016, this Court advised Horsey that he had an obligation to respond to State's motion, at the risk of having the motion deemed conceded. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Order of Sept. 6, 2016). Horsey did not respond as directed, and on October 28, 2016, the Court granted State's motion as conceded, and dismissed Horsey's case without prejudice.

On November 16, 2016, Horsey moved to reopen the case (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Reopen Case, ECF No. 32), and the Court granted his motion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Min.

In the motion, State contends that Horsey's amended complaint \"suffers the same factual and legal deficiencies as his initial complaint.\" (Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. (\"Defs.' Mem.\"), ECF No. 28-1, at 1.) In particular, State argues that the amended complaint's discrimination count must be dismissed because the pleading fails to allege that Horsey suffered an adverse employment action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8.) State further maintains that, to the extent that Horsey's amended complaint challenges employment actions taken pursuant to the suspension or revocation of his Security Clearance, any such claim necessarily fails on\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   grounds, because the\n   <em>\n    Rattigan\n   </em>\n   carve-out does not apply.

State further maintains that even if the\n   <em>\n    Rattigan\n   </em>\n   doctrine applies in a case such as this one, Horsey's amended complaint fails to allege \"unity in the same person who allegedly made the false referral and the employee who reported [Horsey][.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (internal quotation marks, citation, and alterations omitted).) Finally, State insists that Horsey's amended complaint does not state a plausible hostile work environment claim, because it contains only \"conclusory allegation[s]\" that \"fail[ ] to specify the contents of the emails, phone calls or threatening letters and whether those communications were infested with racial overtone[s][,]\" and \"further fail[s] to identify the author(s) of those communications and the frequencies of those emails, letters, and phone calls.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Horsey responds to State's motion to dismiss by insisting that he \"had a right to have a [union] representative present during\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   interviews concerning this matter\"; that \"this specific right was denied\"; and that the officials who investigated Horsey \"were fully aware\" of the complaining co-worker's \"history of [i]nitiating and filing [f]alse [r]eports and [i]nitiating [u]nfounded [c]laims against other fellow [f]ederal and [c]ontractor [e]mployees.\" (Pl.'s Response to Defs.'

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Horsey has filed an amended complaint that alleges, primarily, that the State Department revoked his security clearance after he refused to undergo a mental evaluation without his union representative\n   present. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52, 57.) The pleading suggests that racial discrimination motivated State's employment decisions, simply and solely because Horsey is African American and the Caucasian co-worker with whom he had an altercation was not required \"to partake in a meeting with medical personnel as a part of the investigation into his false allegations against [Horsey][.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) But the amended complaint also plainly alleges that Horsey's own refusal to consent to the allegedly discriminatory mental evaluation was the reason that his security clearance was revoked and he was ultimately suspended. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 57;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Surreply at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, as explained fully below, even if the allegations in the amended complaint are taken as true, they establish that the cause of the critical adverse employment action (Horsey's suspension) was Horsey's own declination, not race discrimination. In addition, the complaint's bald assertion that Horsey \"endured discrimination that was pervasive and regular[ ] (in the form of emails, phone calls, and letters[ ] threatening [his] employment)\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 58)-without further description or discussion-is manifestly insufficient to support any reasonable inference that State subjected Horsey to a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. Therefore, both Title VII counts in Horsey's amended complaint fail to state a claim as a matter of law and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Horsey's Amended Complaint Does Not Allege That Horsey Suffered An Actionable Adverse Employment Action \"Because Of\" His Race\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Liberally construed and fairly read, Horsey's amended complaint alleges that he endured seven distinct workplace slights arising out of the conflict with his co-worker, each of which Horsey might have intended to present as an actionable adverse employment action in support of his intentional discrimination claim: (1) his co-worker's allegedly false report to supervisors about him (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 6); (2) his supervisor's referral of the altercation incident for investigation (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7); (3) the investigation itself (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-17, 24-25, 31); (4) State's request, and ultimately its requirement, that Horsey undergo a mental evaluation (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 19, 26-28); (5) the denial of Horsey's request to have union representation present at the mental evaluation (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-31, 33, 41); (6) the subsequent suspension and revocation of Horsey's security clearance (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 39); and (7) Horsey's being placed on administrative leave and eventually indefinitely suspended (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 37). Significantly for present purposes, the only one of these potential adverse actions that the amended complaint attributes to race discrimination is State's requirement that Horsey undergo a mental evaluation, and as it turns out, this circumstance is a fatal flaw with respect to Horsey's Title VII claim of intentional discrimination (Count I), for the reasons explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    A Mental Evaluation Requirement Is Not An Adverse Employment Action, And Even So, Horsey Has Not Exhausted Any Discrimination Claim Based On This Requirement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The amended complaint explicitly suggests that State's requirement that Horsey undergo a mental evaluation was racially discriminatory. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53 (\"[Horsey's co-worker] (white male) was not asked to partake in a meeting with medical personnel as part of the investigation into his false allegations against [Horsey] (black male), and remains employed with Defendants.\").) But State's requirement that Horsey undergo a mental evaluation does not appear to qualify as an\n   adverse employment action for Title VII purposes. Such a requirement does not, in and of itself, impact or alter an employee's working conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3935627\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/952/85/#p91\">\n    952 F.

For example, in laying out Horsey's discrimination claim, the amended complaint alleges that \"[Horsey] was suspended from his position indefinitely when [Horsey's] security [c]learance was revoked\n   <em>\n    because he refused [to] participate\n   </em>\n   in an unlawful [evaluation] and meet with medical personnel without a representative present[.]\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 52 (emphasis added).) And the complaint further acknowledges that Horsey received a letter from Diplomatic Security requiring that he undergo a \" 'mandatory evaluation'[ ] as part of the security clearance process[,]\" and that the letter notified Horsey \"that non-compliance with this directive could have negative consequences with regard to your security clearance eligibility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 29.) Thus, the amended complaint's own allegations establish that State's decisions to suspend and later revoke Horsey's security clearance; to place him on administrative leave; and to indefinitely suspend him occurred not because of Horsey's race but because of his own recalcitrance with respect to the mental evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Townsend v.

Horsey has included the \"knowingly false and discriminatory\" language in his amended complaint, and thus attempts to chart this course, but his allegations are otherwise insufficient in at least two significant respects: first, there are no allegations of fact that give rise to a reasonable inference that Horsey's referral to the security\n   clearance authorities was\n   <em>\n    discriminatory\n   </em>\n   ; and, second, the complaint does not even conceivably allege that the same individual was motivated both by falsity and discrimination, as the D.C.

And while the amended complaint alleges that Wardle (Horsey's co-worker) made a false report to his supervisors about Horsey, the pleading contains no allegations that Wardle was motivated by Horsey's race (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7); or that their supervisor's decision to refer the incident to Diplomatic Security for investigation was racially discriminatory (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8); or that Diplomatic Security conducted its investigation because of racial animus or in a manner that was racially discriminatory (with the exception of the referral for mental evaluation (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sec.

With respect to Horsey's initial complaint, this Court explained that \"[a] plaintiff seeking to advance a\n    <em>\n     Rattigan\n    </em>\n    -based Title VII claim related to an agency's revocation of his security clearance must show that: (1) the agency employee had a discriminatory or retaliatory motive to report the plaintiff or to refer false information about him, and (2) the reporting employee knew that the report or referral of information was false.\"\n    <em>\n     Horsey\n    </em>\n    , 170 F.
