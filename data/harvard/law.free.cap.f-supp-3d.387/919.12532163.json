Stadtmueller, U.S. District Judge\n   On November 1, 2018, Plaintiffs in the above-captioned case filed a motion to appoint a receiver or, alternatively, a motion for an order to permit inspection and copying of the Defendant Companies' accounting records. (Docket #3). In their supporting brief, Plaintiffs explained at length their arguments for both forms of relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Docket #4 at 11-17) (arguing for order permitting inspection and copying of records);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-31 (arguing for order appointing a receiver). On January 14, 2019, Defendants filed their brief in opposition to Plaintiffs' motion, in which they failed to address Plaintiffs' arguments for an order to permit inspection and copying of the Defendant Companies' accounting records. (Docket #33). Following Plaintiffs' reply, the Court issued an order denying Plaintiffs' motion for a receiver and granting, in part, their motion to inspect. (Docket #54). Defendants quickly filed a notice of appeal, claiming that the Court's order amounted to an injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Docket #55). They also filed a motion to stay the Court's order, and an accompanying brief, the bulk of which reads like an unsanctioned sur-reply to Plaintiffs' motion. (Docket #57 and #59). The Court will deny the Defendants' motion to stay for the reasons explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The Court takes this opportunity to provide Defendants with the legal analysis for which they now\n   clamor, despite the fact that they did not address any of these issues in their opposition to Plaintiffs' motion, where some form of legal analysis would have been most appropriate. It is worth remembering that at the time the Court drafted its order partially granting Plaintiffs' motion, Defendants had not contested\n   <em>\n    a single argument\n   </em>\n   associated with Plaintiffs' motion for the order to inspect.

Moreover, Plaintiffs informed Defendants that they might demand additional information. Therefore, Defendants knew that Plaintiffs sought at least 26 categories of documents pertaining to the accounting records of all five companies. Plaintiffs subsequently attempted to detail their requests with\n   <em>\n    greater particularity.\n   </em>\n   (Docket #5-4). For example, unlike their prior demand, which generally applied to all five companies, Plaintiffs' current demand has adapted their requests to each of the five companies, such that, for example, they request 29 categories of documents from Northeast Asphalt, Inc. and Subsidiaries, but only 19 categories of documents from Timber Stone of Richfield, Inc. (Docket #5 at 4). Additionally, Plaintiffs have broken down their request for \"auditor workpapers\" (which they originally demanded) into detailed subparts. Since the \"reasonable particularity\" requirement operates to put the other party on notice of the types of documents sought, the Court cannot fault Plaintiffs for attempting to be more specific. Presently, Defendants contend that the original demand was narrower than the documents currently sought. The Court disagrees that the demand and the documents now sought are so different as to render the order improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Some categories, such as the request for management representation letters provided to accounting firms, are new, but they are directly connected to the Plaintiffs' attempts to accurately value their shares. Plaintiffs also request additional information regarding the companies' organizational structure and taxes, the former of which would shed light on the companies' accounting department and practices; the latter of which bears on the companies' revenue and expenses. It appears that Plaintiffs had previously requested similar types of documents in prior demands (Docket #6-1, #6-5, and #6-9). None of the newly requested categories are outside the scope of what Plaintiffs originally requested, and Defendants would not be unduly prejudiced by their inclusion. To the extent that Plaintiffs' requests now include categories of documents related to accounting and valuation-but not specifically included in the original demand-the Court finds that Defendants would have been sufficiently apprised that these are the sorts of documents that Plaintiffs sought, and are now (and have been, since early November), on notice about what they are expected to produce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In addition to questioning the categories of documents that Plaintiffs have requested, Defendants take issue with the fact that many of the requests in Exhibit D do not impose a time limit on the documents sought. The original demand requested documents for the years ending in December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017. (Docket #6-15 at 3). To the extent that any of the new requests require a time limit, the Defendants are ordered to refer back to the original demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2.1.1.1.3 Directly connected\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, the request must be \"directly connected\" to the proper purpose.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20180.1602\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 180.1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(b)(5). Defendants take issue with the Court's equation of \"directly connected\" with \"reasonably related,\" which the Court concedes was unsuitable phrasing. (Docket #54 at 7). Neither the statute nor Wisconsin caselaw shed light on the term \"directly connected,\" but the term is not ambiguous. A record is \"directly connected\" to the purpose of determining the book value of a share if the record assists in valuing the company. That is, a record is \"directly connected\" to the determination of book value if an analyst would need the record in order to conduct a valuation. Plaintiffs provided a declaration from Joel Nettesheim, an experienced accountant, who explained that the records sought\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   are needed to determine and verify the book value of the recorded assets and liabilities, to evaluate the calculation of the book value represented in the limited financial information provided to Plaintiffs, and to evaluate if there are additional assets or liabilities that have not been factored into the book value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Docket #5 at 5). In Defendants' motion to stay, they suggest that the Court should have engaged in fact-finding regarding whether the documents are \"directly connected\" to the proper purpose. Yet Plaintiffs adequately demonstrated that the items sought were directly connected to their quest to accurately value the shares, and Defendants failed to timely or persuasively dispute the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Docket #33 at 10) (indirectly and broadly contesting inspection of Exhibits D\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   E). In their motion to stay, Defendants seem to believe that mere disagreement with the Court's conclusion warrants a reversal. Not so. Defendants' related argument that the order was overly broad will be discussed in Section 2.1.1.2, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2.1.1.2 \"Accounting Records\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants contend that the Court issued an overly broad order that required them to give more material than is necessary for Plaintiffs to value their shares. Specifically, Defendants argue that the documents contained in Exhibit D are not \"accounting records\" that fall under the statute. Separately, they have also suggested that audited financial statements are \"the only accounting records to which the statute entitles [Plaintiffs].\" (Docket #6-17 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that \"accounting records\" are comprehensive and refer to more documents than just recent \"financial statements\" because shareholders are entitled to the latter upon mere written request pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20180.1620\">\n    Wis.

It further held that under Section 180.43(2), the statute at issue, \"books and records of account\" should be narrowly construed for two reasons. First, the statute's subsections treated \"books and records of account\" and \"financial statements\" as distinct from one another, so construing \"books and records of account\" to include \"financial statements\" would render a portion of the statute \"effectively meaningless or superfluous, a circumstance to be avoided whenever possible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674783\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/117/48/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the phrase \"books and records of account\" was modified by the word \"relevant,\" which created a \"limitation on the right\" to inspect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674783\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/117/48/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither of those considerations are at play here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The statute has been changed considerably, such that it no longer handles \"books and records of account\" and \"financial statements\" in the same section as two distinct and unrelated items. To the contrary, the canon of construction that requires the Court to avoid surplusage now points strongly in favor of reading the statute's definition of \"accounting records\" to be broader than, and inclusive of, \"financial statements.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   pp. 14-15,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, \"accounting records\" is no longer limited by the word \"relevant,\" which obviates the conclusion that \"accounting records\" must be read as narrowly as Section 180.43(2)'s \"relevant books and records of account.\" To the contrary, the statute now allows shareholders to inspect \"any of the following records,\" including \"accounting records of the corporation,\" as long as they have demonstrated that the records are directly connected to a proper purpose.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20180.1602\">\n    Wis.

As discussed above, the Court does not believe this to be the case-but even if it were, the Court's order does not prevent Defendants from litigating the validity of the transfer restriction. Defendants might even prevail on that issue. And if they did, Plaintiffs would need to see the accounting records to value their shares at book value. There is no way around disclosure of the records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Relatedly, Defendants seem to believe that if the Court does not stay its order, their appeal will be moot. As Plaintiffs point out, their appeal is already moot-the documents ordered are subject to discovery on the claims of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. Defendants should be prepared for discovery in light of the Court's trial scheduling order, which issued in January. (Docket #40). Defendants contend that once these documents are\n   released, Plaintiffs will never be able to \"unsee\" them. The Court fails to see why this would cause Defendants irreparable harm. Assuming Defendants have heretofore carried out their business lawfully and in good faith, there is no reason why they could not arrange for Plaintiffs to obtain the necessary records while protecting Defendants' interests. If Defendants have any privacy concerns, the parties can avert them through protective orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Docket #71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   If the Court were to stay its order, the case would remain partially un-litigated while Defendants pursued a meritless appeal. The Court fails to discern a single public policy goal that would be served by allowing Defendants to retroactively frame an issue as injunctive and use a motion to stay as a vehicle to compensate for their shortcomings in a prior brief, all with the goal of avoiding a court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    3. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court will deny Defendants' request for a stay. Not only did Defendants fail to oppose the inspection order in their original brief, thereby waiving the issue, but, as the foregoing detailed analysis demonstrates, they would have lost on the merits. Additionally, there is no plausible irreparable harm that would befall the Defendants if they comply with the order, nor any public policy consideration that warrants a stay. Defendants may not so easily use their resources to bludgeon the litigation process into a form that favors them.

Defendants frame the Court's order as injunctive because it purports to grant some of the final relief that Plaintiffs seek in the action as to their Second Claim for Relief and argue that inspection orders are not discovery orders, therefore they are appealable.\n    <em>\n     See e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Am.

The Court declines to reach a conclusion on the issue of whether the inspection order is injunctive or part of discovery because Defendants miss the point. In this particular case, the documents subject to the inspection order also happen to be properly within the purview of discovery for\n    <em>\n     other claims\n    </em>\n    in the complaint, such as fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. It does not matter that Plaintiffs have not sought these documents in their initial discovery requests-discovery does not need to be complete until \"30 days before the date on which trial is scheduled.\" Civ. L.R. 26(c). Therefore, in this particular case, even if the Seventh Circuit found in their favor, Defendants would need to disclose the materials later in the litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Defendants' argument that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(2) required the Court to hold an evidentiary hearing as to the motion for inspection order is waived.

The issue of fact in the original motion was whether Plaintiffs had a proper purpose in making the motion for an inspection order. Plaintiffs submitted affidavits supporting the conclusion that the purpose for inspection was to value their shares. (Docket #5). Defendants utterly failed to respond to this. To the extent that Defendants' reference to their motion to dismiss could be construed as an objection to the motion for an inspection order (which is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    how it was presented in the opposing brief;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    (Docket #33 at 10)), Defendants-in the most charitable reading of their brief-\n    <em>\n     might\n    </em>\n    have taken issue with Plaintiffs' proper purpose,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    (Docket #30 at 34).

The mere fact that Plaintiffs lack a potential purchaser at the moment and have engaged in litigation with Defendants on another issue does not, as a legal matter, negate their proper purpose. Moreover, assuming-as Defendants believe-that Plaintiffs\n    <em>\n     are\n    </em>\n    subject to the transfer restriction, they would still need access to the corporation's accounting records in order to value their shares.

The\n    <em>\n     Townsend\n    </em>\n    case dealt with \"an appeal from an order...requiring the defendant to permit the plaintiff and his agents to inspect and make copies of books, records, and files belonging to the defendant corporation, pursuant to sec[tion] 269.57(1),\" which was a discovery statute.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20N.W.2d%20325\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20N.W.2d%20325\">\n     at 326\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But\n    <em>\n     Townsend\n    </em>\n    did not deal with \"discovery\" in the conventional sense of the word-its posture is pre-litigation (i.e., no complaint had been served), and its object was, pursuant to the statute, to provide plaintiff with sufficient information to enable him \"to plead his alleged causes of action and to define the issues.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20N.W.2d%20325\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20N.W.2d%20325\">\n     at 328\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Townsend\n    </em>\n    court ordered the defendant to provide sufficient information to allow the plaintiff to determine whether \"the book value on the financial statement was represented at a depressed figure.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20N.W.2d%20325\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The\n    <em>\n     Townsend\n    </em>\n    court held that such a detailed analysis of the companies' records was not \"a fishing expedition, nor a ransacking of defendant's books, but only necessary to determine the book value.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20N.W.2d%20325\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Thus, as it pertains to Plaintiffs' ability to go behind the financial statements in order to determine book value of their shares,\n    <em>\n     Townsend\n    </em>\n    is perfectly apt.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
