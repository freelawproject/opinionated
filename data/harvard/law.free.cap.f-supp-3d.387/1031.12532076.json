CARNEY, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The eleven named Petitioners are Indonesian nationals and citizens seeking to challenge the Government's authority to detain and remove them and other supposedly similarly situated individuals. Petitioners assert eight counts, six of which are brought on behalf of four putative classes. (Dkt. 30 [Operative First Amended Complaint, hereinafter \"FAC\"].) They generally allege that the Government cannot detain or remove noncitizens subject to a final order of removal where the noncitizen has applied for or requested, or might apply for or request, a variety of immigration benefits. They also challenge the Government's authority to detain and remove a noncitizen subject to a final order of removal after the noncitizen is placed under an order of supervision. Before the Court is the Government's motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 41 [hereinafter \"Mot.\"].) For the following reasons, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioners, none of whom are currently detained, challenge the Government's alleged treatment of noncitizens who are subject to final orders of removal. The eleven named Petitioners consist of two families. Six of the Petitioners are subject to final orders of removal, whereas four are not. The remaining named Petitioner, Jeremiah Michael Probodanu, was removed to Indonesia before this action was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Santosa Family\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioners Ferdinandus Santosa, his wife, Anneke Palar, and the couple's two children, Jeremiah Michael Probodanu and Daniella Auningputri, are natives and citizens of Indonesia who were admitted to the United States on tourist visas. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 13-16.) Ms. Palar's parents, Petitioners Albert and Adelena Palar, have resided in the United States as lawful permanent residents since 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Petitioners Ferdinandus Santosa, Anneke Palar, Jeremiah Probodanu, and Daniella Auningputri remained in the United States without permission, the Government initiated removal proceedings against each of them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-35.) Mr. Santosa then applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Palar, Mr. Probodanu, and Ms. Auningputri were derivative beneficiaries of Mr. Santosa's asylum application. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   An immigration judge denied Mr. Santosa's application and ordered him and his immediate family removed to Indonesia.\n   <em>\n    Santosa v.

App'x 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644 (9th Cir. 2011). The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"Board\") dismissed Mr. Santosa's appeal of the immigration judge's decision, and on March 21, 2011, the Ninth Circuit denied a petition for review of the Board's\n   decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073408\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/422/643/#p644\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") placed Mr. Santosa and Ms. Palar under orders of supervision on July 18, 2013. (FAC \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Santosa and Ms. Palar sought an administrative stay of removal until February 15, 2018, which ICE granted on October 1, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Prior to the February 15, 2018 expiration, Mr. Santosa and Ms. Palar sought another administrative stay, which ICE allegedly \"refused to accept.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) According to the First Amended Complaint, Mr. Santosa and Ms. Palar attended a check in with ICE on June 21, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) An immigration officer allegedly confirmed that a motion to reopen was pending and instructed them to appear again on April 10, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Santosa and Ms. Palar allegedly \"fear that they will be arrested and detained at their 10 April 2019 check-in date or at any time Defendants so decide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) However, they do not claim that they were arrested or detained at the April 10, 2019 check in. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42 [Opp'n].) The Santosa family allegedly submitted a \"combined motion to reopen\" and an \"Amended Request and Restated Motion to Reopen Based on Country Conditions and a Request for a Stay of Removal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) It is unclear when either were filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As for Ms. Auningputri and Mr. Probodanu, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") granted them deferred action under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\"), a federal immigration policy that allows individuals who entered the United States as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) USCIS granted Mr. Probodanu's DACA renewal request on July 27, 2015, effective until July 26, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) On December 21, 2016, ICE placed Mr. Probodanu under an order of supervision instructing him to appear before an immigration officer in December 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Probodanu did not submit a DACA renewal request before it expired on July 26, 2017. At his December 12, 2017 check in, Mr. Probodanu was arrested and issued a written warning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) His wife, Tatiana Ayhuan-Probodanu, submitted a Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) on December 22, 2017 to initiate a family-based status adjustment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) While in detention, Mr. Probodanu submitted a DACA renewal request, which USCIS denied for lack of jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 53.) Days later on March 20, 2018, ICE removed Mr. Probodanu to Indonesia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) On September 20, 2018, USCIS approved his wife's Form I-130. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) USCIS has purportedly \"refuse[d] to transmit\" the approved Form I-130 to the National Visa Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Auningputri appeared at a check in with ICE on December 7, 2018, and was instructed to appear again in November 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) She likewise alleges that she fears she will be detained \"at any time Defendants so decide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Woy Family\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Eldridge Woy, his wife, Lora Londa, and the couple's son, Echglene Woy, are citizens and nationals of Indonesia who were admitted to the United States on tourist visas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-67.) When the Woy family remained in the United States without permission, the Government initiated removal proceedings against each of them.\n   <em>\n    Woy v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862281\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/361/725/\">\n    361 F. App'x 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2009). Like Mr. Santosa, Mr. Woy applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862281\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/361/725/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862281\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/361/725/\">\n    at 725-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An immigration judge denied Mr. Woy's application and ordered each member of the Woy family removed to Indonesia.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862281\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/361/725/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Board dismissed the family's appeal and on December 28, 2009, the\n   Ninth Circuit denied a petition for review of the Board's decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862281\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/361/725/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Echglene Woy applied for deferred action under DACA, which USCIS granted. (FAC \u00b6 68.) According to the First Amended Complaint, his DACA and employment authorization expire in June 2021. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In March 2018, the Woy family \"made a second application requesting that ... ICE join in a motion to reopen based on a newly acquired eligibility for relief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) ICE allegedly has not responded to this request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And if ICE declines to join in such a motion, the Woy family claims they \"will file an opposed motion to reopen based on changed country conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Lora Londa's parents, Petitioners Alex Londa and Kristina Limbong, are both U.S. citizens. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.) They allegedly are \"in the process\" of filing a Form I-130 on behalf of their daughter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Petitioners filed this action on May 22, 2018. (Dkt. 1 [Complaint].) The initial Complaint asserted fourteen counts, eleven of which were on behalf of four putative classes and three of which were on behalf of Mr. Probodanu only. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862281\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/361/725/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) On October 5, 2018, the Government moved to dismiss all fourteen counts for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. (Dkt. 19.) After the December 10, 2018 hearing on the Government's motion, the Court dismissed all fourteen counts in the Complaint with fourteen days' leave to amend. (Dkt. 29.) Petitioners filed the operative First Amended Complaint on December 27, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC.) The First Amended Complaint removed six of the fourteen counts and added a few new allegations in support of the remaining eight counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In Counts One and Two, Mr. Probodanu individually alleges that the Government violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") by failing to provide a reasoned explanation for the denial of his DACA and employment authorization renewal request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 136-54.) Mr. Probodanu seeks declaratory relief stating, among other things, that the Government's denial was arbitrary and capricious and in violation of his due process rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154.) Counts One and Two mirror Counts One and Three of the initial Complaint. The Court had dismissed both of these counts for failure to state a plausible claim on which relief could be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In Count Five, all of the named Petitioners allege that the Government violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution when it detains noncitizens under an order of supervision without first providing notice, a reasoned explanation, and an opportunity to respond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 170-76.) Count Five is nearly identical to Count Thirteen of the initial Complaint, which the Court previously dismissed with prejudice as preempted by the INA. However, Count Five now asserts a constitutional violation under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, whereas Count Thirteen was premised on a violation of the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In Counts Three, Seven, and Eight, all of the named Petitioners allege that, pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), Due Process Clause, and APA, the Government lacks the authority to detain or remove a noncitizen who is in the process of applying for a provisional unlawful presence waiver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 156-58, 182-84, 186.) According to Petitioners, \"[d]etaining and threatening to detain and remove noncitizen [Petitioners] ... without allowing them to follow the 2016 provisional waiver procedures violates all [Petitioners'] rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 184.) Counts Three, Seven, and Eight are nearly identical to Counts Five, Eleven, and Fourteen of the\n   Initial Complaint, which the Court dismissed for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In Counts Four and Six, all of the named Petitioners raise arguments under the INA and Due Process Clause regarding the Government's authority to detain and remove a noncitizen subject to an order of removal who has moved to reopen his or her removal proceedings based on changed country conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 160-68, 178-80.) Petitioners contend that the Government has \"a mandatory duty ... to determine for each [Petitioner] ... whether the individual will face persecution, torture, or death if deported to Indonesia.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168.) Counts Four and Six are nearly identical to Counts Six and Eight of the initial Complaint, which the Court likewise dismissed for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In their prayer for relief, Petitioners seek (1) an injunction ordering the Government not to arrest or detain any noncitizen under an order of supervision without a finding that the noncitizen violated a condition of release, (2) an injunction ordering the Government not to arrest or detain any alien seeking a provisional unlawful presence waiver or applying to reopen removal proceedings based on changed country conditions, (3) an injunction prohibiting the Government from terminating a noncitizen's DACA solely because he or she is subject to a final order of removal, and (4) an injunction prohibiting the Government from removing Petitioners to Indonesia without providing them an opportunity to establish that they would be persecuted or tortured there. (FAC at 53.) Mr. Probodanu also seeks an order requiring the Government to \"adjudicate [his] DACA renewal application on its merits and order his return\" to the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Government moves to dismiss the majority of Petitioners' claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) on two grounds. First, the Government asserts that Petitioners lack standing to challenge the Government's authority to detain or remove noncitizens who have moved to reopen proceedings or who intend to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver (Counts Three, Four, Six, Seven, Eight). Second, the Government contends that the INA expressly deprives this Court of jurisdiction to consider Petitioners' claims arising from the Government's decision to execute a final removal order (Counts Three through Eight).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Government argues that Petitioners do not have standing to bring Counts Three, Four, Six, Seven, and Eight because they have not plausibly alleged an injury in fact. \"[T]hose who seek to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts must satisfy the threshold requirement imposed by Article III of the Constitution by alleging an actual case or controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    City of L.A. v.

Noncitizens who have been ordered removed have the statutory right to file a motion to reopen their removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7). When the noncitizen seeks asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under CAT based on changed conditions in the country of removal, the statute permits the noncitizen to file a motion to reopen at any time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). The Court previously dismissed these claims for lack of standing because not a single Petitioner claimed that he or she had moved to reopen proceedings based on changed country conditions, let alone that he or she was detained after filing a motion to reopen. (Dkt. 29 at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Petitioners have still failed to cure the defects outlined in the Court's prior order. While Petitioners now allege that the families have filed joint motions to reopen, there are still no allegations that suggest Petitioners face any actual or imminent threat of detention or removal. To the contrary, Mr. Santosa and Ms. Palar appeared before an immigration officer on March 23, 2018, and the officer told them to check in again on April 10, 2019. Mr. Santosa and Ms. Palar do not contend that they were arrested or detained at their check in. Ms. Auningputri appeared before an immigration officer on December 7, 2018 and was told to appear again in November 2019. Although Mr. Santosa, Ms. Palar, and Ms. Auningputri claim that they fear they will be arrested and detained \"at any time Defendants so decide,\" they offer no allegations in support of this contention. To the extent Petitioners claim that Mr. Probodanu's detention makes their detention more imminent, they fail to explain how his experience has any bearing on their own. Fear of some hypothetical, future harm is insufficient to satisfy standing's injury-in-fact requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clapper v.

A noncitizen who is ineligible to apply for an adjustment of status generally cannot apply for such a waiver until after he has departed the United States and has appeared for his or her immigrant visa interview.

Mr. Probodanu claims that he was detained and deported while his Form I-130 petition was pending. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 54, 57.) The Government subsequently approved his petition but allegedly has not transferred it to the National Visa Center for processing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) Because Mr. Probodanu could not use his approved Form I-130 to seek an immigrant visa, he could not apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver.

In Count Five, Petitioners seek to prevent the Government from redetaining and removing a noncitizen under an order of supervision without notice and an opportunity to be heard. In their prayer for relief, they ask the Court to issue injunctive relief ordering the Government not to detain any noncitizens released under an order of supervision unless he or she has violated the conditions of release.

In light of those decisions, the Government published updated guidance on DACA on February 14, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government stated that noncitizens whose DACA expired on or after September 5, 2016 could submit a DACA renewal request. However, it would not accept requests from noncitizens who had never before been granted deferred action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Mr. Probodanu applied for and received deferred action under DACA not long after October 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 40.) On July 27, 2015, the Government granted his DACA extension request and issued him an employment authorization that was valid from July 27, 2015 until July 26, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) On December 21, 2016, the Government placed him under an order of supervision and directed him to appear in December 2017, noting that his DACA status was due to expire in July 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Mr. Probodanu did not submit a DACA renewal request before it expired. When he appeared for his check in on December 12, 2017, the Government arrested and detained him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) A little more than a month later, he submitted a DACA renewal request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) The Government denied that request on March 16, 2018, based on a \"lack of jurisdiction\" and its \"exercise of discretion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) The Government removed Mr. Probodanu to Indonesia four days later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In Count One, Mr. Probodanu contends that the Government's \"termination\" of his DACA status and denial of his late renewal request were arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion in violation of the APA. The APA permits judicial review of agency actions where \"there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the APA precludes review of agency decisions that are \"committed to agency discretion by law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), this bar does not extend to agency decisions when, like here, there are \"statutes, regulations, established agency policies, or judicial decisions that provide a meaningful standard against which to assess\" an agency's action.\n   <em>\n    Mendez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102412\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/340/865/#p868\">\n    340 F.3d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 868 (9th Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court previously dismissed Count One for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. 29 at 20-21.) It reasoned that Mr. Probodanu's DACA and employment authorization expired because he failed to timely submit a renewal request, not because of any action on the part of the Government. Accordingly, the expiration of Mr. Probodanu's DACA and employment authorization, caused by his own inaction, could not constitute \"arbitrary\" or \"capricious\" agency action. To the extent Mr. Probodanu challenged the denial of his DACA renewal request, the Court found that the denial was based on the Government's published guidance that expressly stated that a noncitizen may not request consideration for DACA while in immigration detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The First Amended Complaint fails to cure these deficiencies. Mr. Probodanu\n   was placed under an order of supervision on December 21, 2016. In December 2017, months after he failed to timely file a DACA renewal request, the Government detained him. While in detention, he requested to renew his DACA. The Government denied that request in accordance with the Government's published guidance that expressly stated \"[i]ndividuals who are currently in immigration detention and believe they meet the [DACA] guidelines may not request consideration of deferred action from USCIS.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This guidance was in effect both before and after the Government rescinded DACA on September 5, 2017. While Mr. Probodanu disagrees with the substance of that guidance, he offers no new statutes, regulations, agency policies, or judicial decisions demonstrating that USCIS's decision to deny his renewal request was arbitrary or capricious. Indeed, DACA guidance at the time of Mr. Probodanu's removal made clear that DACA confers no substantive right on its recipients, and that the Government retains the authority to revoke it at any time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Count One is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In Count Two, Mr. Probodanu seeks a declaration stating that the Government's denial of his renewal request \"failed to adhere to the DACA Memo, was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\" (FAC \u00b6 154.) As noted above, Mr. Probodanu has failed to allege facts indicating that the Government's action was arbitrary and capricious or that he has a protected property or liberty interest in continued DACA status. Accordingly, Count Two is likewise\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Government's motion to dismiss Petitioners' First Amended Complaint is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .
