McFADDEN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Charles Roberson invited Oscar Rodriguez to perform a then-controversial flag-folding speech at his Air Force retirement ceremony. Because of its religious content, Rodriguez sometimes referred to his flag-folding speech as \"the God speech.\" During the ceremony, when Rodriguez began to speak, a group of airmen-apparently acting at the behest of the commanding officer-grabbed and physically ejected him from the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Air Force later changed its policy on such speeches but refused to apologize for the incident. So Roberson and Rodriguez (the \"Retirees\") sued the Department of the Air Force and five of its service\n   members (collectively \"the Air Force\") for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages. The Air Force moved to dismiss the Complaint. The Court finds that the Retirees lack standing for the prospective relief they seek, and the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the individual defendants. It, therefore, will grant the Air Force's Motions to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rodriguez served in the U.S. Air Force from 1980 to 2013, retiring as a Senior Master Sergeant. Compl. \u00b6 4, ECF No. 1. In 2001, he began participating in Air Force flag-folding ceremonies as a member of the Travis Air Force Base Honor Guard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. He \"was inspired and began to develop his own flag-folding speech to capture his personal sentiments toward the flag.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, he said, \"[l]et us pray that God will reflect with admiration the willingness of one nation in her attempt to rid the world of tyranny, oppression, and misery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the time, the Air Force provided no set script for these ceremonies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   But in 2005, the Air Force promulgated Air Force Instruction 34-1201, which provided a specific flag-folding script.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. It required that \"when a flag folding ceremony is desired and conducted by Air Force personnel at any location, on or off an installation, this script is the only one that may be used.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, Roberson continued performing his own flag-folding speech at various events, including retirement ceremonies at the request of individual Air Force retirees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. After he retired, he continued to perform this speech upon request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After hearing Rodriguez's speech, Master Sergeant Roberson invited Rodriguez to perform at his own upcoming retirement ceremony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Roberson's retirement coordinator told him that Rodriguez might be barred from attending his retirement ceremony and told Roberson to contact Senior Master Sergeant Joe Bruno.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Bruno, in turn, advised Roberson that then-Lieutenant Colonel Michael Sovitsky, commander of the 749th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, \"had banned\" Rodriguez from the ceremony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Rodriguez had heard in the past that Sovitsky \"did not appreciate\" his unique flag-folding speech and its religious overtones.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   But Roberson told Rodriguez to proceed as planned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46-47. Family members, friends, and co-workers gathered for his retirement ceremony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. After a slideshow celebrating Roberson's career, patriotic music played, and Rodriguez stepped onto the stage to begin his speech.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. While he was speaking, an Air Force service member approached Rodriguez and told him to sit down.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. He refused.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, a group of uniformed airmen grabbed him, while he was still speaking, and forcibly removed him from the stage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Eventually, additional service members physically removed Rodriguez from the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response to this incident, the Air Force reversed its policy about flag-folding speeches at retirement ceremonies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. It explained, by official statement, that \"Air Force personnel may use a flag folding ceremony script that is religious for retirement ceremonies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Still, the Air Force refused to issue a written admission of wrongdoing or an apology for incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. So the Retirees sued the Air Force and five Air\n   Force service members: Sovitsky, Bruno, and three others allegedly involved in the incident, both in their individual and official capacities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Against the Air Force, the Retirees brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), alleging violations of the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-24. They also brought a Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\") claim against both the Air Force and the individual Air Force servicemen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-26. And they brought First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment claims against the individual servicemen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Air Force has now moved to dismiss the Retirees' Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

The Retirees Have Not Met Their Burden to Establish Standing for Prospective Equitable Relief.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As the Retirees admit, the Air Force has amended its flag-folding policy and made clear that \"Air Force personnel may use a flag folding ceremony script that is religious for retirement ceremonies.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. In fact, the Retirees allege that the Air Force \"clarified\" its policy \"in response to the incident involving\" the Retirees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   So the Air Force argues that Rodriguez lacks standing to seek prospective equitable relief because he has not alleged a future harm. Defs.' Supp. Mem. at 2; ECF No. 28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Retirees counter that prospective relief is necessary for Rodriguez to perform \"without fear or arbitrary\n   (and potentially violent) repercussion.\" Pls.' Supp. Mem. at 4; ECF No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Haase\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit distilled the threshold standing test for the type of prospective equitable relief that the Retirees seek: plaintiffs must allege (a) the existence of a policy; and that (b) they are likely to be subjected to that policy again.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332453,10549974\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/902/\">\n    835 F.2d at 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At times, the Retirees' briefing seems to suggest that they are challenging the old Air Force Instruction 34-1201. For instance, they claim that the Instruction was an \"unconstitutional prior restraint, enabled unconstitutional content- and viewpoint-based discrimination, and established an unconstitutional preference for the absence of any religious faith.\" Pls.' Mem. at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   But the Retirees clarified at the motions hearing that they are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   challenging the Air Force's official policy, past or present. Transcript of Motions Hearing (\"Tr.\"), ECF No. 31, at 8 (\"We are not challenging the policy.\"). Instead, the Retirees complain that Rodriguez was indefinitely banned from giving his flag-folding speech at Travis Air Force Base.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. The Retirees have suggested that this ban was because of Sovitsky's \"misguided anti-religious view or some view that a religious flag-folding speech was not appropriate and not permitted even by a civilian at a personal retirement ceremony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. So their quarrel is with an alleged unofficial policy that targets Rodriguez alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Complaint's allegations about any such ongoing ban are sparse.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 40 (\"Bruno ... indicated that Rodriguez would be unable to attend Roberson's retirement ceremony because Sovitsky had banned Rodriguez from the building....\"). And the Retirees allege no facts to support a claim that such a ban exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Consider\n   <em>\n    Haase\n   </em>\n   by way of contrast. There, the plaintiff alleged that the Government had \"a policy of subjecting travelers returning from Nicaragua to intrusive border searches for intelligence-gathering purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332453,10549974\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/902/\">\n    835 F.2d at 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the plaintiff\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   supported this allegation with the following material: (1) an affidavit of his attorney that recounted the experiences of other travelers who claimed they had been subjected to intrusive border searches upon returning from Nicaragua; (2) a number of newspaper articles that described similar searches; and (3) an affidavit in which he explained his plans to return to Nicaragua, and the chilling effect that his fear of future border searches would have on his journalistic activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332453,10549974\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/902/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even so, the Circuit called the plaintiff's \"allegations and supporting submissions pleading a policy of intelligence-gathering border searches ... exceedingly weak.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332453,10549974\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/902/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332453,10549974\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/902/\">\n    at 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, the Retirees allege no facts to show that a \"ban\" exists. For instance, the Retirees do not allege that anyone in the Air Force has prevented Rodriguez from speaking since the incident. In fact, the opposite: the Retirees admit that Rodriguez has since performed his flag-folding speech at Travis Air Force Base \"without incident.\" Tr. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   What's more, the Retirees do not plausibly allege that Rodriguez is \"likely to be subjected to the policy again.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haase\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332453,10549974\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/902/\">\n    835 F.2d at 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, all evidence points in the other direction. The Air Force has changed its policy to allow religious\n   speeches like Rodriguez's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Rodriguez implies that this change in policy is unimportant because the old Air Force policy never applied to him since he was performing at a private event. Pls.' Supp. Mem. at 8;\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 15 (Policy stated \"when a flag folding ceremony is desired and conducted by Air Force personnel\n   <em>\n    at any location\n   </em>\n   , on or off an installation, this script is the only one that may be used.\") (emphasis added). Even so, Sovitsky or other Air Force service members may have tried to stop Rodriguez from speaking based on an-however misguided-attempt to enforce the old policy. That policy is now defunct. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   And even if Sovitsky's alleged anti-religious animus was the true catalyst for this incident, he is no longer stationed at Travis Air Force Base, nor does he continue to supervise either Retiree. Tr. at 27. The Complaint makes no allegation, plausible or otherwise, that he can continue to enforce the alleged ban from afar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   More still, by amending its official policy, the Air Force has communicated to Sovitsky and other Air Force service members that these types of religious speeches are acceptable. In sum, \"past injuries alone are insufficient to establish standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Dearth v.

The First Amendment protects our right\n   to speak freely even when that view may be unpopular. While the members of our armed forces may face necessary limitations on their First Amendment rights in some contexts, this was not one of them, and the Air Force does not argue otherwise.
