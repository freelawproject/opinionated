INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 6, 2018, the administration of President Donald J. Trump began implementing the so-called \"zero tolerance policy\" on unauthorized immigration. Under the new policy, the administration ended its earlier practice of funneling most aliens apprehended at the border through civil immigration proceedings, and instead started systematically detaining and criminally prosecuting suspected illegal immigrants for unlawful entry into the country. Because minor children could not be held in criminal custody with adults, component agencies of the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") also began systematically\n   separating families apprehended together when attempting to enter the country. While adult family members were sent to criminal custody, DHS placed the minor children in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"), in a poorly-documented interagency process that often had the practical result of parents and family members being completely cut off from, and unable to communicate with, their separated children, for weeks-sometimes months-at a time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The significant public backlash in response to the zero tolerance policy, and particularly to the thousands of family separations the Trump administration conducted in just a few months, eventually led President Trump to issue an executive order on June 20, 2018, directing DHS to stop separating families apprehended at the border. In response to a class-action lawsuit by parents of separated children, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered a preliminary injunction the same month ordering the administration to reunite currently separated children with their alien parents. But the fallout from the zero tolerance policy did not stop there. Reports prepared by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (\"GAO\") and DHS's Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\") following the end of mandatory separations brought to light a wide range of deficiencies in DHS's implementation of the policy, including in the agency's recordkeeping practices associated with family separations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although they spend much of the amended complaint and of their briefs discussing the botched implementation and consequences of the zero tolerance policy, it is those recordkeeping practices that Plaintiffs Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (\"CREW\") and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, Inc. (\"RAICES\") challenge in this suit. Plaintiffs bring three claims against DHS and the Secretary of Homeland Security for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 06. Plaintiffs allege that DHS violates the Federal Records Act (\"FRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202101\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 20, 2901 - 11, 3101 - 07, 3301 - 14, by 1) maintaining a deficient records management program, 2) failing to create records sufficient to link migrant children to adult companions with whom they are apprehended at the border, and 3) failing to create records of agency policy and decisions. Plaintiffs have moved for a preliminary injunction as to claim two, while Defendants have moved to dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As detailed below, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and grants Defendants' motion to dismiss. The Court is sensitive to the significant harms Plaintiffs allege families apprehended at the border faced-and still face-as a result of the zero tolerance policy. But it does not believe that Plaintiffs' FRA claims, as pled, are a proper vehicle for challenging those harms. First, the Court determines that it only has subject matter jurisdiction over claims one and two. And second, while CREW and RAICES point to a number of individual failures in DHS's recordkeeping procedures, and make arguments for changes to the agency's recordkeeping they contend are required by the FRA, none of their claims point to a final agency action pursuant to the APA. Independently of standing, all three claims therefore fail to state a claim under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiffs first allege that DHS failed to establish and maintain an FRA-compliant records management program. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 62-70. Plaintiffs' second claim is that DHS is violating the FRA by failing to create records sufficient to link separated children from adults with whom they were apprehended.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-80. And finally, Plaintiffs claim that DHS failed to create records of agency policy and decisions in connection with the implementation and rollback of the zero tolerance policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-87. Plaintiffs have moved for a preliminary injunction on their second claim, while Defendants have moved to dismiss all three claims for lack of standing and failure to state a claim under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because Plaintiffs can only establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their second claim if that claim survives the motion to dismiss, and their entitlement to a preliminary injunction hinges on defeating that motion, the Court addresses it first. The Court first reviews whether Plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims. It concludes that, at the very least, RAICES has standing as to claims one and two, but that neither RAICES nor CREW has standing as to claim three. Next, the Court reviews the motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Because it finds that Plaintiffs do not challenge a final agency action on any of their claims-a prerequisite for an APA claim-the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the APA. The Court accordingly denies Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and grants Defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Mem. Supp. 31 n.14. The Court finds this argument unpersuasive. As Plaintiffs point out in their opposition, they need only show that there is \"a causal connection between the injury and [DHS's] conduct,\" and that it is \"likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\" Pls.'

Cir. 2003) ). As to causation, it is true that Plaintiffs point to an attenuated link between DHS's alleged recordkeeping failures and RAICES's alleged increased difficulties in providing legal representation-as it is true that the zero tolerance policy likely itself led to increased constraints on RAICES's ability to pursue its mission.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply 20. But simply because RAICES's alleged harm may in part be caused by the zero tolerance policy does not mean that it cannot be also caused in part by DHS's recordkeeping failures. Plaintiffs have alleged facts in the amended complaint that point to harm specifically\n   caused by the failure to\n   <em>\n    link\n   </em>\n   separated children to family members, rather than by an increase in workload generally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 57, 60. And as to redressability, Defendants do not respond to Plaintiffs' argument that RAICES would in fact be able to access information relating to third parties from whom the unaccompanied children are separated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. Opp'n 36 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(B) ). The Court finds both the causation and redressability elements of standing met, and therefore concludes that RAICES has standing to bring claim two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   2. Claim One\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As to claim one, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have made \"no factual assertions ... regarding concrete, particularized harms\" caused by the alleged overall failure of DHS's records management program, \"aside from Plaintiffs' asserted injuries in regard to recordkeeping with respect to family separations.\" Defs.' Mem. Supp. 39. The Court disagrees that these asserted injuries are insufficient to establish standing as to claim one. The Complaint identifies multiple deficiencies existing in DHS's records management program prior to the implementation of the zero tolerance policy, and alleges that the harms caused by improper documentation as part of the implementation of the policy were linked to the records management program's overall deficiencies.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-65;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23 (noting DHSs \"history of failing to comply with ... statutory records management obligations\" and pointing to the NARA DHS Inspection Report);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26 (\"DHS's culture of non-compliance with its FRA obligations manifested acutely, with disastrous results, in its implementation and rollback of the Zero Tolerance Policy.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-40 (noting continued, systemic failure to record documents in multiple DHS component agencies even after the end of zero tolerance). The Court sees no reason why the concrete injury RAICES alleges it suffered because of DHS's improper recordkeeping in connection with family separations, which the Court found sufficient to establish standing as to claim two, is not also sufficient to establish standing as to claim one. It accordingly finds that RAICES has standing to bring claim one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   3. Claim Three\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, the Court reviews Defendants' arguments as to claim three, the claim challenging DHS's creation of records of agency policy and decisions during the implementation and rollback of zero tolerance. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not have standing to seek injunctive and declaratory relief when their claim centers around injuries allegedly caused in the past, with no allegations of\n   <em>\n    ongoing\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. Supp. 40-41. Plaintiffs retort that claim three is not just directed at recordkeeping failures during the implementation of the zero tolerance policy, but rather at an overall DHS practice of failing to document agency policy and decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. Opp'n 45. Here, the Court must part with Plaintiffs. On the basis of the allegations in the Complaint, it agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs do not point to an ongoing injury and therefore lack standing to bring their third claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As a general rule, \"where the plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, past injuries alone are insufficient to establish standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Dearth v.

As discussed above in part IV.A.3., the additional allegations Plaintiffs point to fall short of stating a claim that DHS has adopted a policy of refusing to document agency decisions. Plaintiffs point to a single paragraph in the amended complaint alleging that DHS's failures during its implementation of the zero tolerance policy was \"consistent with [its] overall agency culture.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 43. That same paragraph identifies two instances where \"CBP's policymakers rebuked prior efforts by its own policy office and the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to issue employees meaningful guidance\" on two issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p62\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the fact that CBP refused to \"issue employees meaningful guidance,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p62\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , does not mean that unwritten oral guidance already existed that the agency refused to put in writing.
