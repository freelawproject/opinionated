Plaintiffs Mingfeng Cai, Jinglin Chen, Yue Li, Maohong Lin, Xiangnan Liu, Zhengri Song, Yujie Wang, Pengbo Xiao, Lihong Xu, and Xu Zhao (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") oppose. Dkt. #44. Defendant Feast Buffet has requested oral argument, but the Court does not feel that oral argument is necessary. Having reviewed the motion, Plaintiffs' response, Defendant's reply, and all documents submitted in support thereof, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Feast Buffet, Inc. (\"Feast Buffet\") is a Chinese restaurant located in Renton, Washington. The restaurant's management completes its own bookkeeping and hires Chinese-speaking waitstaff that can communicate with Feast Buffet's owners and managers, who primarily speak Chinese. Dkt. #44-1, Ex. B, Li Dep. 12:4-25. To find Chinese-speaking waitstaff to hire, Feast Buffet's owners relied on employment agencies to seek out potential employees outside the Renton, Washington area. Dkt. #41, Li Decl. \u00b63. Feast Buffet hired Plaintiffs, most of whom relocated to Washington from states such as California or Texas.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. #40-1, Ex. A, Cai Dep. 21:20-23; Ex. B, Chen Dep. 15:19-20; Ex. D, Liu Dep. 30:18-25; Ex. E, Song Dep. 35:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Feast Buffet offered Plaintiffs at least $ 3,500 per month in wages and tips, plus free meals and free lodging. Dkt. #41, Li Decl., \u00b64. During the interview process, Feast Buffet agreed to compensate at least two plaintiffs for travel costs to relocate to Renton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b69. Feast Buffet did not pay its waitstaff hourly wages or overtime compensation-Plaintiffs' income came exclusively from tips.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. #40, Ex. B, Chen Dep. 26:8-12, 37:1-38:16; Ex. D, Liu Dep. 55:5-13. To receive their bi-weekly paychecks, employees were required by Feast Buffet to bring the cash they earned from tips to the front counter and exchange the cash for a paycheck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition to completing its own bookkeeping, Feast Buffet relied minimally on written contracts, rules or guidelines to outline the employer-employee relationship. Dkt. #44-1, Ex. J, Def. Interrog. No. 10 at 49. Feast Buffet manager Xiaoling Jiang described his past practice of trashing employees' timecards that recorded the number of hours that waitstaff worked. Dkt. #44-1, Ex. B, Jiang Dep. 44:15-45:17, 57:12-22. To the extent that Plaintiffs signed any paperwork, Plaintiffs claim they were not sure what they signed, nor the purpose of their signatures. Dkt. #40-1, Ex. D, Liu Dep. 31:17-23; Ex. G, Xu Dep. 46:6-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Feast Buffet claims that the restaurant's management genuinely believed that it fully and fairly compensated Plaintiffs and did not willfully violate FLSA wage requirements. Dkt. #41, Li Decl., \u00b6 5, 6. Dequn Li, one of Feast Buffet's owners and managers, states that Plaintiffs \"seemed satisfied with their substantial compensation,\" noting that none complained about pay, minimum wages, overtime pay or any pay practice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Likewise, he claims that management never received any complaints, warnings or notices during Plaintiffs' employment that Feast Buffet was not complying with FLSA wage requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs describe the restaurant's management as enforcing a zero-tolerance policy against complaining about wages, overtime, or rest breaks, wherein waitstaff knew that breaking their silence would result in immediate firing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. #44-1, Ex. C, Cai Dep. 82:9-23. Plaintiff Zhengri Song claimed that the number of waiters fired for complaining numbered in the teens, and that waitstaff had no way to\n   make a complaint anonymously.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. G, Song Dep. 50:15-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Most of Plaintiffs state that they remained silent on wage issues out of fear of Feast Buffet firing them.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. #44-2, Chen Decl. \u00b65; Dkt. #44-4, Li Decl. \u00b65. However, plaintiff Pengbo Xiao claims that (s)he complained once about overtime work and once about time off.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. H, Xiao Dep. 41:23-25, 42:1-21. Similarly, Mingfeng Cai complained about working too late into the night.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A, Cai Dep. 15:12-25, 16:1-13. Plaintiffs also allege an incident in which a Chinese-speaking customer asked a waiter if Feast Buffet paid them hourly wages or overtime. When the waiter replied that Feast Buffet only paid them tips, the customer left a tip of twenty-five dollars. Dkt. #40-1, Ex. E, Song Dep. 41:13-25. Plaintiffs claim that Feast Buffet's management brought up this incident in a meeting that night and fired the waiter involved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. #44-5, Cai Decl. \u00b610; Dkt. #44-3, Xu Decl. \u00b65. In addition to fear of losing their jobs at Feast Buffet, Plaintiffs also claim that because managers at Feast Buffet knew other restaurant managers in the Renton, Washington area, they worried that complaining to Feast Buffet management would hurt them if they later tried to find work at another Renton restaurant.

Dkt. #44 at 6. Defendant Feast Buffet pleaded the FLSA's two-year statute of limitations in its Answer with both a general citation to \"defenses, protections, and limitations of the Fair Labor Standards Act,\" Dkt. #26 at 10, \u00b62, as well as specific responses denying Plaintiffs' willfulness allegations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n    at 4, 5, 7, 9, \u00b6\u00b619,29, 47, 65, 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires a party to \"affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense\" in its responsive pleading.

Defendants argue that Feast Buffet management did not willfully violate the FLSA. Dkt. #39 at 6. For that reason, Defendants contend, any claims by Plaintiffs that accrued more than two years prior to the filing of this complaint are outside the statute of limitations period and must be dismissed as not timely filed. Because Plaintiffs filed this action on October 24, 2017, the statutory look-back period under the FLSA will commence on either October 24, 2015, or October 24, 2014, depending on the issue of willfulness. Only three of the ten plaintiffs-Xiangnan Liu, Pengbo Xiao, and Xu Zhao-were employed by Defendant earlier than October 24, 2015 and would be affected by this distinction. Dkt. #39 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Willfulness requires knowledge or reckless disregard of a FLSA violation.\n   <em>\n    Alvarez v.

Here, Plaintiffs have introduced evidence of Feast Buffet's practice of forbidding employees from telling restaurant patrons that waitstaff were not paid hourly wages or overtime compensation and punishing any employees who broke this rule. Dkt. #44-3, Xu Decl. at \u00b65; Dkt. #44-5, Cai Decl. at \u00b610; Dkt. #44-8, Zhao Decl. at \u00b65; Dkt. #44-9, Xiao Decl. at \u00b64. Several plaintiffs allege an incident where a waiter, responding to a customer's inquiry about their pay, informed the customer that Feast Buffet only paid its waitstaff in tips without hourly wages or overtime, and was fired that night by management. Dkt. #40-1, Ex. E, Song Dep. 41:13-25.; Dkt. #44-5, Cai Decl., \u00b610; 44-3, Xu Decl. at \u00b65. Feast Buffet also contends that its management \"had not received any complaints, warnings or notices during Plaintiffs' employment that Feast Buffet might not be complying with FLSA wage requirements.\" Dkt. #41, Li Decl. \u00b6 6. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, claim that anyone who complained to management about Defendant's pay practices was promptly fired.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. #44-1, Ex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   C, Cai Dep. 82:9-23; Ex. D, Chen Dep. 32:3-10. Claims that Feast Buffet has sought to shield its labor practices from public view while internally suppressing any complaints about wages and hours raises a sufficient factual dispute as to whether Defendant genuinely believed its practices satisfied FLSA's wage and hour requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Furthermore, Feast Buffet has admitted to wage and hour disputes raised by other former employees. Qiang Chen allegedly worked as a waiter from February 2016 to mid-year 2017 and, after hiring legal counsel, required Feast Buffet to pay him what-in Defendant's own words-\"he should have got during the time he worked for us.\" Dkt. #44-1, Ex. A, Jiang Dep. 32:1-35:5. Feast Buffet has also stated that it required several former employees-Chenxia He, Jian Nu and Pan Zhu-to sign confidentiality statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:22-37:17. The fact that Feast Buffet has been subject to similar labor law disputes and has secured confidentiality statements from former employees likewise raises a factual dispute as to Feast Buffet's genuine belief that its practices were lawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, a jury could conclude that Feast Buffet knowingly or recklessly violated FLSA. Accordingly, this Court finds that the issue of willfulness is an issue of material fact to be determined at trial and denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the timeliness of Plaintiffs' FLSA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Feast Buffet counters that only two plaintiffs, [Xiangnan] Liu and [Pengbo] Xiao, alleged that Feast Buffet orally promised reimbursement for travel expenses, Dkt. #39 at 8, and both Liu and Xiao confirmed during their depositions that Defendant ultimately paid those costs.

The requirement that both parties show \"mutual intention\" to contract with each other \"may be deduced from the circumstances, including the ordinary course of dealings between the parties or a common understanding within a commercial setting.\"\n   <em>\n    Meeks,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836552\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/139/854/#p870\">\n    139 Wash.App. at 870-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=170%20P.3d%2037\">\n    170 P.3d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacob's Meadow Owners Ass'n,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833929\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/139/743/#p765\">\n    139 Wash.App. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 765,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20P.3d%201153\">\n    162 P.3d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs have not produced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether parties manifested mutual assent to form a contract. Plaintiffs' claims are limited to their own declarations, wherein they claim that Feast Buffet promised to reimburse Plaintiffs for travel expenses during the interview process and failed to do so. Dkt. #44-3, \u00b68 (\"When I was being interviewed to work at Feast Buffet, Feast Buffet agreed to reimburse me for my travel expenses. Our boss promised to reimburse me and my husband for travel expenses. Neither one of us was ever reimbursed.\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. #44-8, \u00b68; Dkt. #44-10, \u00b67 (citing promised reimbursement for travel). Plaintiffs have not provided receipts or other evidence indicating the date or amount of the plane tickets. Moreover, they have failed to offer evidence demonstrating Defendant's \"mutual intention\" to contract through these phone conversations. The Court therefore dismisses Plaintiffs' claims for breach of oral contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Having reviewed the relevant briefing, attached declarations, and the remainder of the record, the Court hereby finds and ORDERS that Defendant Feast Buffet's Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. #39, is GRANTED IN PART for (1) Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims relating to travel costs; and (2) breach of oral contract. The remainder of Defendant's Motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
