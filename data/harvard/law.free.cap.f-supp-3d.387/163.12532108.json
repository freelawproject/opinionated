Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 17, 2015 PRHTA brought suit against TransCore. (Docket No. 25-1.) In its complaint, PRHTA asked the Court to issue a provisional restraining order to prevent TransCore from removing the CSC equipment. (Docket No. 25-1 at p. 22.)

(Docket No. 25-8.) TransCore argued that both the contract and the parties' behavior demonstrate that TransCore owns the CSC equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 27-33. TransCore sought a declaratory judgment stating that the CSC equipment belongs to it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 38.

(\"[T]he terms of the contract must be read together and harmonized to arrive at the intention of the parties.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, PRHTA and TransCore signed a contract that consists of several documents: (1) Master Agreement; (2) Special Provisions; (3) Statement of Work; (4) Functional Specifications; (5) Contractor Plan(s); (6) Contractor Proposal, and (7) Contractor Design Documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 1-8 at p. 47.) PRHTA claims that these documents\n   <em>\n    clearly\n   </em>\n   provide that TransCore has no stake over the CSC equipment. (Docket No. 66 at p. 1). Similarly, TransCore argues that the terms of the contract undoubtedly establish TransCore's ownership of the CSC equipment. (Docket No. 7 at pp. 24-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Neither party challenges PRHTA's ownership of the NTCS. The parties disagree, however, on the ownership of the CSC. PRHTA interprets the contract as establishing that the CSC is a component of the NTCS thus making PRHTA the CSC's owner as well. (Docket No. 66 at p. 9.) Conversely, TransCore contends that the CSC is a separate entity from the NTCS and that the parties never agreed that PRHTA would acquire the CSC. (Docket No. 77 at p. 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There are four main areas that the parties argue differing interpretations of specific contractual provisions. Both parties present compelling arguments that are well supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Allocation of Taxes on the CSC Equipment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, Article 5.3 of the Special Provisions provides that \"[TransCore] shall be responsible for timely identifying and paying all taxes assessed with respect to any services, materials, equipment, processes or operations under, incidental to, or involved in, the performance of the CSC Services.\" (Docket No. 1-9 at p. 13.) TransCore argues that its payment of taxes for the CSC equipment is an indicator of ownership. (Docket No. 77 at p. 37.) PRHTA counters that Article 12.9 of the Master Agreement contemplates a compensation for the taxes paid by TransCore. (Docket No. 1-8 at p. 71 (providing that \"[t]he Contract Price includes full compensation to [TransCore] for all such taxes in force as of the Final proposal Submission Date.\")) PRHTA, thus, interprets that any payment of taxes for the CSC equipment by TransCore does not allocate ownership, but rather it is simply a business expense\n   assumed by TransCore and included in the overall price that TransCore charged PRHTA for the goods and services provided. (Docket No. 66 at p. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Definition of Service Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Next, Appendix I of the NTCS Master Agreement defines TransCore's property as the \"[p]ersonal property owned or leased by [TransCore] that is not part of the Service Property or the NTCS.\" (Docket No. 1-8 at p. 114.) \"Service Property\" is then defined as \"[t]he fixed facilities and the NTCS including but not limited to plazas, CSCs,\" and other equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 119. PRHTA argues that if TransCore owns what is not part of the service property, and the service property includes the CSC, then these definitions logically suggest that TransCore cannot own the CSC. (Docket No. 66 at pp. 9-10.) TransCore argues, however, that these definitions merely establish the inventories of the NTCS and do not allocate any type of ownership. (Docket No. 77 at pp. 34-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Definition of Electronic Toll Collection System\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties then argue that Article 1.1.1 of the NTCS Master Agreement establishes that the NTCS is \"more fully described in the Statement of Work.\" (Docket No. 1-8 at p. 46.) The Statement of Work provides that the NTCS \"shall consist of an electronic toll collection system (ETC) that operates simultaneously with, but independent of, existing toll operations at the Authority's facilities.\" (Docket No. 77-7 at p. 3.) The ETC is then described in the Functional Specifications with the following ill illustration:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Docket No. 77-8 at p. 3.) TransCore argues that if the NTCS consists only of an ETC, then, as it can be appreciated from the diagram, the NTCS does not include the CSC and thus, PRHTA is unable to claim ownership of the CSC. (Docket No. 77 at pp. 26-27.) PRHTA counters that the ETC, like the CSC, is just one component of the NTCS and the CSC may be part of the NTCS without being part of the ETC. (Docket No. 83 at p. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Acquisition of the NTCS v. Operation of the CSC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the parties disagree on their interpretation of several provisions of the NTCS Master Agreement read together. The NTCS Master Agreement reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Article 1.1.1 The NTCS\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [PRHTA] has undertaken the development and installation of a stand-alone electronic toll collection system (the \"NTCS\"), for certain plazas on the toll highways owned and operated by\n   [PRHTA] and more fully described in the Statement of Work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    Article 1.1.2 Acquisition of the NTCS\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [PRHTA] wishes to acquire the NTCS from [TransCore] and [TransCore] wishes to develop and provide the NTCS to [PRHTA], upon the terms and conditions of the Contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Article 1.1.3 NTCS Maintenance and Customer Service Center Management &amp; Operations\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The Contract also includes the maintenance of the NTCS installed, as well as management and operation of [the] Customer Service Center (\"CSC\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Docket No. 1-8 at pp. 46-47.) TransCore argues that a reading of this section suggests that the CSC is an independent entity from the NTCS because it establishes the\n   <em>\n    acquisition\n   </em>\n   of the NTCS, but it only alludes to the\n   <em>\n    management\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    operation\n   </em>\n   of the CSC. (Docket No. 77 at p. 25.) PRHTA, nevertheless, claims that other contract documents contradict this conclusion. (Docket No. 66 at p. 10.) PRHTA cites the Special Provisions, which has the purpose of delineating the development, installation, maintenance and operation of the NTCS. (Docket No. 1-8 at p. 136.) This document has a section that includes the CSC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 146. PRHTA interprets that if the Special Provisions' scope is for the installation of the NTCS and it includes a section regarding the CSC, it can be concluded that the CSC is a part of the NTCS and thus owned by PRHTA. (Docket No. 66 at p. 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Reading the contract as a whole, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%2031%2C%20%C2%A7%203475\">\n    P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, \u00a7 3475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court is unable to conclude that the language of this contract is clear.

TransCore argues that, by accepting these inventory reports without objections, PRHTA indicated that it understood that the CSC equipment belonged to TransCore.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"770\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/49/#p52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, TransCore indicates that the subsequent course of dealings between PRHTA and Gila, LLC (\"Gila\") further supports TransCore's ownership of the CSC. (Docket No. 77 at p. 31.) In its contract with Gila, PRHTA requested that Gila provide CSC equipment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"770\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/49/#p52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   TransCore argues that if PRHTA owned the existing CSC, then it would not have asked Gila to provide a new CSC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"770\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/49/#p52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court finds that, although these pieces of evidence may support TransCore's argument of ownership, they do not exclude any other possible argument that may provide for PRHTA's ownership. In other words, the extrinsic evidence is not \"so one-sided that no reasonable person could decide to the contrary.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fiestas\n   </em>\n   , 170 F.Supp.3d at 275. Thus, resolution of the ambiguity should go to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The contract between PRHTA and TransCore is ambiguous and the extrinsic evidence is not susceptible to only one interpretation. Accordingly, extrinsic evidence of the true meaning of the contract should go to the factfinder, here the jury, in order to determine who owns the CSC equipment. Because TransCore has a plausible claim, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   PRHTA's motion for judgment on the pleadings, (Docket No. 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Although PRHTA titled their motion as a motion to dismiss, the Court considers it as a motion for judgment on the pleadings because PRHTA has answered TransCore's counterclaim.
