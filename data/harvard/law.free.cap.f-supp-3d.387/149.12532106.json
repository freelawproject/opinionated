United has filed counterclaims against Jette, seeking to recover $15,745.99 it allegedly overpaid to Jette due to her receipt of disability benefits under the Social Security Act. Jette has moved to dismiss United's counterclaims. Docket No. 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court heard oral argument on July 10, 2019.

In each case, ERISA beneficiaries suffered injuries in car accidents and the ERISA plans paid for their medical care. When the beneficiaries later obtained monetary settlements from tortfeasors, the ERISA plans demanded reimbursement from the settlement proceeds. After the beneficiaries refused, the ERISA plans brought claims\n   under Section 502(a)(3) to enforce reimbursement provisions in their plan documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, in\n   <em>\n    Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins.
