LEITMAN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Allure Medical Spa, PLLC (\"Allure\") has filed a Motion for Recusal or\n   Disqualification of Judge (the \"Recusal Motion\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF #45.) For the reasons explained below, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this diversity action, Plaintiff Victoria Hewitt alleges that she suffered serious injuries as a result of medical malpractice committed by Defendant Ruthie McCrary, M.D. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF #1.) Hewitt further alleges that at the time of Dr. McCrary's alleged negligence, Dr. McCrary was an agent or employee of Allure and that Allure is therefore vicariously liable for Dr. McCrary's malpractice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June of 2018, Hewitt settled with Dr. McCrary but not with Allure. On or about June 29, 2018, Hewitt and Dr. McCrary submitted a proposed stipulated order dismissing with prejudice Hewitt's claim against Dr. McCrary. The Court then entered that stipulated order (the \"Stipulated Dismissal Order\") and dismissed the claim against Dr. McCrary with prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF #28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 23, 2018, Allure filed a motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Summ. J., ECF #30.) Allure argued that the dismissal with prejudice of Hewitt's claim against Dr. McCrary compelled the dismissal of Hewitt's vicarious liability claim against Allure. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Allure relied upon the Michigan Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Al-Shimmari v. Detroit Medical Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5684828\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/477/280/\">\n    477 Mich. 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=731%20N.W.2d%2029\">\n    731 N.W.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 36-38 (2007). In that case, the state court held that an order dismissing a plaintiff's claim against an agent\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   prejudice precludes the plaintiff from pursuing a vicarious liability claim against the agent's principal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al-Shimmari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=731%20N.W.2d%2029\">\n    731 N.W.2d at 36-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    D\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 20, 2018, Hewitt filed a response to Allure's motion for summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. to Mot. for Summ. J., ECF #32) and a motion under Rule 60(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to set aside the Stipulated Dismissal Order (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Relief, ECF #33). In Hewitt's response to the motion for summary judgment, she acknowledged that if the Stipulated Dismissal Order remained in place, she could not continue to litigate her vicarious liability claim against Allure. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. to Mot. for Summ. J. at \u00b64, ECF #32 at Pg. ID 510.) In the Rule 60(b)(1) motion, Hewitt urged the Court to vacate the Stipulated Dismissal Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Relief, ECF #33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hewitt argued that she was entitled to relief from the Stipulated Dismissal Order under Rule 60(b)(1) because a \"mistake[ ]\" led to the entry of that order. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b66, ECF #33 at Pg. ID 531.) Hewitt contended that her attorney made an error when he agreed to dismiss her claim against Dr. McCrary\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   prejudice rather than insisting upon a dismissal\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   prejudice - which would not have barred\n   Hewitt from proceeding against Allure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grimmer v. Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363548\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/310/95/\">\n    310 Mich.App. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=872%20N.W.2d%20725\">\n    872 N.W.2d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 729 (2015) (explaining that \"a dismissal without prejudice is not a dismissal on the merits\" that precludes \"a further action based on the same facts\"). Hewitt insisted that she and her attorney had consistently expressed her desire to continue litigating against Allure after settling with Dr. McCrary and that her attorney never would have agreed to the Stipulated Dismissal Order if he had understood that the entry of that order would extinguish her claim against Allure. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Relief, ECF #33 at Pg. ID 540-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As support for Hewitt's claim that her counsel made a mistake in agreeing to the Stipulated Dismissal Order, Hewitt directed the Court to settlement correspondence between her counsel and Dr. McCrary's counsel. In that correspondence, Hewitt's attorney asked Dr. McCrary's attorney if \"a covenant not to sue\" Dr. McCrary - as opposed to a release of claims against the doctor - would be \"acceptable\n   <em>\n    so that [Hewitt] can continue against Allure\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Email dated June 4, 2018, ECF #33-4 at Pg. ID 558; emphasis added.) Dr. McCrary's counsel responded: \"yes.\" (Response email dated June 4, 2018, ECF #33-4 at Pg. ID 557.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As further support for Hewitt's claim that her attorney erred in approving the Stipulated Dismissal Order, Hewitt attached to her motion the Covenant Not to Sue that she executed to resolve her claim against Dr. McCrary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF #33-2.) The Covenant Not to Sue provided that (1) the parties' settlement resolved \"only\" Hewitt's claim against Dr. McCrary and (2) Hewitt intended to \"preserve\" her claim against Allure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   WHEREAS, Victoria Hewitt, and Ruthie McCrary, M.D., only, have reached an amicable compromise of their differences and desire to resolve and put to rest their differences; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   WHEREAS, Victoria Hewitt wishes to reserve all rights, claims, and causes of action she may have against Allure Medical Spa, PLLC, a Michigan corporation, and all agents, and/or employees thereof, including the right to proceed to trial and possible judgment against those individuals and their respective corporations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 551.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. McCrary did not file a response opposing Hewitt's motion to vacate the Stipulated Dismissal Order within the time period allowed under the Court's Local Rules. But the Court did not feel comfortable ruling upon the motion without hearing from Dr. McCrary. Accordingly, the Court ordered Dr. McCrary to file a written response to the motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF #36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In Dr. McCrary's response, she \"[a]mit[ted] that Plaintiff intended to continue [her] case against Defendant Allure.\" (Dr. McCrary's Response, ECF #37 at Pg. ID 608.) She insisted, however, that the entry of the Stipulated Dismissal Order was \"not a mistake\" because Hewitt's counsel agreed to the entry of the order after reviewing it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She further argued that she would suffer prejudice if the\n   Court vacated the Stipulated Dismissal Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=872%20N.W.2d%20725\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Allure also responded to Hewitt's motion to vacate the Stipulated Dismissal Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Allure's Response, ECF #35.) Allure argued that Hewitt's counsel's stipulation to the entry of the Stipulated Dismissal Order did not rise to the level of a \"mistake\" justifying relief under Rule 60(b)(1). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 584-86.) Allure cited a number of Sixth Circuit decisions in support of its position. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=872%20N.W.2d%20725\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    E\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court held a hearing on Hewitt's motion to vacate the Stipulated Dismissal Order on October 22, 2018. During that hearing, the Court asked counsel for Dr. McCrary a lengthy series of questions concerning whether the Stipulated Dismissal Order was consistent with the terms of the settlement between the doctor and Hewitt, and counsel acknowledged at least some inconsistency:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: You do a reasonably substantial amount of medmal defense, isn't that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: And it's not unusual, is it, for you to be in cases where you represent a medical professional in a suit where there's claims against your client and against an entity with which your client is affiliated like in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   THE COURT: And I have to believe that as somebody experienced in this field, you are aware of the, is it\n   <em>\n    Al-Shimmari\n   </em>\n   case from the Michigan Supreme Court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE COURT: And you know that what that case says, if a plaintiff dismisses with prejudice a claim against the agent, the claim against the principal is extinguished, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE COURT: All right. So what I'm struggling with when I think about this from your perspective is, it seems quite clear that Mr. Weiner tells you, my intention is to resolve this in a way that allows me to continue my claim against Allure and he sends that over in an e-mail, and you say that that is -- that's fine with you. And a covenant not to sue for that reason is okay with you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   That's in the attached e-mails, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: All right. So at that point, knowing that Mr. Weiner's intent is to preserve the ability to pursue his claim against Allure, and that you've agreed with that, isn't it a mutual mistake that you -- that this would result here in a dismissal with prejudice?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In other words, with your knowledge of the\n   <em>\n    Al-Shimmari\n   </em>\n   case and knowing what Mr. Weiner wants and agreeing to it, how could I find that your sending the dismissal with prejudice over was anything other than kind of a mistake on your end?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: Well, it wasn't a mistake, your Honor, and it wasn't a gotcha at all. It was what I normally do under these circumstances, whether I know of\n   <em>\n    Al-Shimmari\n   </em>\n   or not. It is my habit and custom in cases like this, even with a covenant not to sue, to send over a stipulation and order of dismissal with prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Clearly, clearly, Mr. Weiner was aware of the fact that this was with prejudice. I was not trying to trick him. I was not trying to pull\n   <em>\n    Al-Shimmari\n   </em>\n   and say, hey, guess what, I gotcha, and do a favor for Allure. This is what I normally do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: But help me understand that. I'm trying to put myself in Mr. Weiner's shoes, okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: I understand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: And you say that's what you normally do and you have a fine reputation in the community, one that I knew before I took the bench and I still know now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: But if I was in Mr. Weiner's shoes and we had just agreed to resolve it with a covenant not to sue for the precise purpose of allowing my client to proceed against Allure, and you sent me this, and I knew of\n   <em>\n    Al-Shimmari\n   </em>\n   and I knew that you knew of\n   <em>\n    Al-Shimmari\n   </em>\n   , I would call you up and say, hey, Lee, you're better than this. What in the world are you doing trying to send this over?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   You're telling me you're not trying to pull a fast one and I don't disbelieve you but I'm having trouble understanding how, having just agreed to settle on terms that allow him to pursue Allure, you send over a document that blocks him from suing Allure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: I don't think it was a mistake and again, I don't think it was a gotcha. I was not trying to do that. I have great respect for Mr. Weiner. I'm not trying to play games with anybody in this situation. Again, this is what I normally do under these circumstances. I was not thinking, oh, there is\n   <em>\n    Al-Shimmari\n   </em>\n   , I'm going to send over this stip and order with prejudice and therefore, he won't be able to pursue his claim against Allure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: But how does this even make sense? In other words, you say this is what you normally do. I'm trying to wrap my head around this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Step one of what you normally do is agree to resolve a case on terms that allow somebody to move ahead with the claim against the principal. And step two is, send them an order that precludes them from doing that. How does that even make sense as a normal course of practice?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: It probably doesn't make sense in the normal course of practice. What it does is, I agreed to a stip -- or I agreed to the covenant not to sue and it was then my position and what I normally do, is send out -- tell my assistant, we have a case dismissed now, send over a stipulation and order of dismissal with prejudice, which I normally do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   I wasn't thinking, well, I've agreed to this, now I'm going to trick him into that. It's just what I say, your Honor. It's my normal -- what I normally do. I wasn't thinking that, oh, if I send over the stipulation and order of dismissal with prejudice, I'm going to really take his case out of play.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   THE COURT: Isn't another way to say this, I also -- that you also weren't intending to get a dismissal with prejudice, right? Because you knew that Mr. Weiner didn't want to give that or you had to assume that. Wouldn't you assume that he knows\n   <em>\n    Al-Shimmari\n   </em>\n   , you know\n   <em>\n    Al-Shimmari\n   </em>\n   , he just told you he wants to continue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Isn't the most rational view here of -- that maybe it wasn't a mistake that it went out from your office but it couldn't really have been your intent to get a dismissal with prejudice, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: Well, it would have been my intent to get that but I understand the Court's position and inquiring as to why that was even sent. Again, I don't mean to be redundant. I don't mean to be disrespectful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   What I said and what I mean is that, we had a covenant not to sue that came over. We signed that. We agreed to it. Clearly, he can continue his case against Allure. By my sending a stip and order of dismissal with prejudice, I was not trying to eliminate his position as it relates to Allure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   THE COURT: Did you believe that you had negotiated for your client a dismissal with prejudice? Did you believe that was implicit in the deal you had made with Mr. Weiner? Or was that implicitly not part of the deal you had with Mr. Weiner?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: Usually -- I don't know if that was agreed to or not agreed to, to be very candid. Like I say, we agreed to the covenant not to sue. We agreed to the amount. I then dictated a stipulation and order of dismissal with prejudice and all of that documentation went forward. I don't think there was a thought one way or the other, other than the fact that I typically, as I said before, do this for my clients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   THE COURT: Isn't it fair to say, as Mr. Weiner does, that the agreement that was reached was this -- the claim from Hewitt to McCrary will be settled on terms that allow Hewitt to continue against Allure?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: I don't think that's unfair to say that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   THE COURT: All right. If that's -- if that was the agreement that was reached between the parties, isn't the entry of the dismissal with prejudice inconsistent with the parties' agreement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: I don't know if it was an agreement between the parties. I think that was the intent of Mr. Weiner. I don't know if I agreed that you go forward with this case.\n   <em>\n    I presumed that that was what we do in a covenant not to sue, that clearly, he would have the right to continue. And if that's the case, that would be inconsistent with the stipulation and order of dismissal with prejudice. I don't disagree with that.\n   </em>\n   I think I even indicated that I knew that he was going to continue against Allure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   THE COURT: Yeah. Here is -- the exchange was, in an e-mail from Mr. Weiner to you, June 4th of this year, at 2:10 on my record, page I.D. 558. He writes:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"Lee, not agreeing to accept yet but will a covenant not to sue be acceptable so that my client can continue against Allure?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   And your answer is: \"Yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: Mm-hmm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   THE COURT: If I try to make this argument in the strongest terms for Mr. Weiner, the argument goes, the agreement between the parties, between Hewitt and McCrary, was a settlement that allows the claim to go forward. So the entry of the dismissal with prejudice is inconsistent with the deal the parties reached.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Do you interpret your \"yes\" e-mail differently?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: No, I don't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <em>\n    So you acknowledge the inconsistency between the intent of the parties when the deal was reached and then the entry of the order?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER:\n   <em>\n    Well, it -- I don't disagree with that. I sort of disagree with the intent of the parties. I was aware that he wanted to continue with his case against Allure. The stipulation and order of dismissal, again, with prejudice, was not an attempt at gotcha. It was what I normally do. I can see the Court's concern about the inconsistency and I'm not denying it.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   THE COURT: But I'm saying, even if that's what you normally do, that might be what you -- there is nothing underhanded about saying these two things. One, at step one, the parties reached an agreement where their shared intent was that the case will be settled on terms that allow the plaintiff's claim to move forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Do you agree with step one?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   THE COURT: And step two, you say, you know what, that may have been the agreement but I'm going to send this order over and see if, notwithstanding what we already did, it's acceptable. It's not hiding the term \"with prejudice.\" It's not in Greek. Here it is. I'm sending it over. And he signed it. It seems to me that may be what happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Do you agree with that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   MR. WULFMEIER: I don't disagree with that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   (Tr. 10/22/18, ECF #50 at 1-8, 12-15, Pg. ID 846-53, 857-60; emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court had serious concerns about whether the Stipulated Dismissal Order fairly and accurately reflected the parties' agreement and about whether to leave the order in place. But the Court was not yet convinced that Hewitt had demonstrated a right to relief under Rule 60(b)(1). The Court therefore directed the parties to file supplemental briefs. The Court explained to Hewitt that in order to obtain the relief she requested under Rule 60(b)(1), she would have to cite the strongest federal authority in support of her position. Hewitt filed a supplemental brief on October 29, 2018 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF #41), and Allure filed its response to Hewitt's supplemental brief on November 5, 2018 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF #42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   After the Court received and reviewed the supplemental briefs, the Court felt the need to conduct its own additional research with respect to Rule 60(b)(1). The Court was seeking a more comprehensive understanding of the background and purpose of the rule as well as additional examples of how federal courts had applied the rule in practice. During this research, the Court learned that Rule 60(b)(1) applies only to final orders and does not cover interlocutory orders like the Stipulated Dismissal Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(Recusal Motion, ECF #45 at Pg. ID 680.) In Allure's words, the Court's statement of its inclination is the \"most troubling\" aspect of the Court's conduct.

In the context of these additional statements by the Court, the Court's expression of its \"inclination\" - which, by definition, falls far short of a firm conviction - does not reflect that the Court had prejudged Hewitt's right to relief from the dismissal with prejudice. On the contrary, when the Court voiced its \"inclination,\" it was merely expressing a\n   <em>\n    preliminary\n   </em>\n   view of the matter - a view that was based upon the prior proceedings before, and the submissions to, the Court.

In that case, the district court had entered an order restraining the defendants from transferring certain assets. The plaintiff later presented to the court evidence that the defendants had violated the order, and the court issued an order requiring the defendants to personally appear and show cause why they should not be held in contempt. The defendants did not appear as directed. Instead, two attorneys who had not yet been formally retained by the defendants appeared and asked for more time to review the file. In response, the court expressed its preliminary view that the defendants had \"violated\" its earlier order and said that it would take a \"preventative measure\" to prevent \"further flouting\" of its orders. That measure was the issuance of bench warrants for the defendants' arrest. The court also permitted the plaintiff to execute against other property held by the defendants. On appeal, the defendants argued that the district judge should have recused because his statements on the record \"demonstrate[d] prejudgment of the contempt charge.\" The First Circuit rejected as \"frivolous\" the defendants' argument that the district judge was required to recuse based upon his \"express[ion] of preliminary views inside the court, based upon knowledge acquired in court proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9454082\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/124/#p130\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   initially won a jury verdict of $1,500.00 in compensatory damages and nothing in punitive damages. The district judge thereafter granted the plaintiff's motion for a new trial on damages. At a later off-the-record status conference, the judge said that he \"would try the instant case as many times as necessary until the jury reached a verdict of at least $9,000.00,\" and the judge also told defense counsel that the judge had learned from a law school dean that there was legal authority allowing the judge to award attorneys fees in excess of an apparently-applicable statutory cap. The defendants moved to disqualify the district judge based upon his statements. The district judge denied the motion, and the case proceeded to a re-trial at which the jury awarded a total of $34,000 in damages. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the denial of the recusal motion and stressed that the judge's statements concerning his views of the case did not warrant recusal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   An opinion on the merits of the case, resulting from a judge's experience with the case in the course of his or her official duties, is not sufficient to justify \u00a7 455 recusal unless it demonstrates a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible. Such is manifestly not the case here, where the district judge both had substantial experience with the case and expressed an opinion clearly justified by the evidence presented at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9017109\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/404/997/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9017109\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/404/997/\">\n    at 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Court's statements here that so \"troubl[ed]\" Allure are much like those in\n   <em>\n    Goya Foods\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   . The statements expressed a\n   <em>\n    preliminary\n   </em>\n   opinion - an \"inclination\" - that was based upon information contained in filings with the Court and statements made by counsel on the record during proceedings in open court. And the Court's concerns about whether the Stipulated Dismissal Order fairly reflects the parties' agreement were certainly \"justified by the evidence presented\" to the Court in the parties' filings and on the\n   record. Indeed, as noted above, Dr. McCrary's lawyer acknowledged the legitimacy of the Court's concerns. Under these circumstances, the Court's statement of its inclination - especially when coupled with the Court's assurance that it had not reached any final decision and that it was giving Allure a \"full opportunity\" to present its arguments - is not a basis for recusal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    D\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Next, Allure argues that recusal is required because the Court \"[1] conducted [its] own independent research to\n   <em>\n    find\n   </em>\n   a legal vehicle under which [it] might be able to vacate the stipulated order and [2] invited Plaintiff to file a motion under this specific rule, with instructions on the depth of the motion needed....\" (Recusal Motion, ECF #45 at Pg. ID 682; emphasis added.) This argument mischaracterizes the actions taken by the Court and fails to understand that those actions demonstrate that the Court had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   pre-judged whether to vacate the Stipulated Dismissal Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Court did not attempt to \"find\" a procedural mechanism through which it could vacate the Stipulated Dismissal Order. On the contrary, as described above, as the Court was conducting research into Rule 60(b)(1) - the rule under which Hewitt originally sought relief from the Stipulated Dismissal Order - the Court found a case explaining that that rule does not apply to interlocutory orders. That case further explained that Rule 54(b) governs whether a district court may modify or vacate such orders (like the Stipulated Dismissal Order). Simply put, the Court learned about the applicability of Rule 54(b) while trying to understand the scope of Rule 60(b)(1), not as part of a concerted effort to find a way to rule for Hewitt. And the fact that the Court conducted additional legal research in an effort to better understand the issues raised in Hewitt's motion under Rule 60(b)(1) is not evidence of bias (or potential bias). On the contrary, it demonstrates the Court's desire to reach the correct result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Moreover, the fact that the Court gave Hewitt an opportunity to file a motion for relief under Rule 54(b) and told her that the motion had to be well-supported by federal law confirms that the Court had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   reached any firm conclusions as to whether to vacate the Stipulated Dismissal Order. Indeed, if, as Allure claims, the Court had already pre-judged the issue, the Court could have and would have exercised its authority - under both its inherent powers and under Rule 54(b) - to vacate\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   the interlocutory Stipulated Dismissal Order.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Leelanau Wine Cellars, Ltd. v. Black &amp; Red, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1417238\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/118/942/#p945\">\n    118 F. App'x 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 945-46 (6th Cir. 2004) (affirming district court's decision to vacate\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   an interlocutory order).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the Court offered Hewitt a chance to seek relief from the Stipulated Dismissal Order by filing a motion. That course of action ensured that the Court would receive full briefing on\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   sides of the issue before reaching any final decision. And the Court's desire to have a full adversarial presentation of the questions presented under Rule 54(b) demonstrates that the\n   Court had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   resolved in its own mind whether Hewitt was entitled to relief under the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Finally, the Court's direction to Hewitt's counsel that he file a substantial brief with persuasive federal authority likewise underscores that the Court was not unfairly biased in Hewitt's favor. Indeed, the point of that admonition to counsel was that his client would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   win unless her position was well-supported by federal law. Simply put, telling a lawyer that he should demonstrate an entitlement to the relief he seeks is not evidence of bias (or potential bias).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   For all of the reasons explained above, recusal of the Court is neither required nor appropriate in this action. Therefore, the Recusal Motion (ECF #45) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Having denied the Recusal Motion, the Court is now prepared to address the remaining motions: Allure's motion for summary judgment and Hewitt's motion to vacate the Stipulated Dismissal Order under Rule 54(b). Allure recently responded to Hewitt's Rule 54(b) motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF #49.) Hewitt shall file a reply addressing Allure's arguments by not later than\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     February 21, 2019\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Upon the filing of Hewitt's reply, the Court will review and decide both pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Hewitt's Complaint does not use the words \"vicarious liability\" when setting forth the basis of Allure's alleged liability.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. at \u00b632, ECF #1 at Pg. ID 8-9.) And in response to Allure's motion for summary judgment, Hewitt admitted that the theory asserted against Allure is, at least in part, one of \"vicarious liability.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. for Summ.
