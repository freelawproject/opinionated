JUNG, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action concerns a contractual dispute over insurance coverage. The matter comes to the Court on Plaintiff's motion to remand the case to Florida state court. Dkt. 5. Defendant has filed an opposition to the motion. Dkt. 12. The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the Complaint filed in the Circuit Court of the Thirteenth Judicial\n   Circuit in and for Hillsborough County, Florida, Plaintiff's parents have an insurance policy through Defendant as a supplement to their Medicare plans. Dkt. 1-2 at 6. The Evidence of Coverage, which includes the terms of the policy, provides for services related to home health agency care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. As long as relevant conditions are met, an insured must pay a $0 copayment for in-network services and 50% coinsurance for out-of-network services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. That out-of-network service provider must be \"eligible to participate in Medicare.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. This is in contrast to other provisions in the Evidence of Coverage that require providers to be \"certified\" by Medicare.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Though Plaintiff's parents satisfy the conditions for coverage, Defendant has not identified in-network home health agencies that could provide listed services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Plaintiff's parents eventually received services through DS In Home Services, Inc. as an out-of-network provider that is \"eligible to participate in Medicare.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Plaintiff submitted to Defendant medical reimbursement request forms for the cost of services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant denied payment because the services were a \"Medicare non covered service\" and \"[t]he provider is not listed as a certified CMS provider.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. After extensive communication between the parties, Defendant informed Plaintiff there were no in-network or out-of-network providers that were \"eligible to participate in Medicare\" that could provide services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Though Defendant has partially reimbursed some of the services Plaintiff's parents received, Defendant has \"failed and refused to provide the Insureds with complete, consistent, and continuous coverage and/or reimbursement for the Home Health Aide Services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment declaring Defendant's obligations under his parents' insurance policy, namely relating to the distinction between \"eligible\" or \"certified\" service providers and Defendant's failure to identify available providers of home health care services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.
