Hargrove was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, but a retroactive amendment to the sentencing guidelines lowered his applicable guidelines range from 120 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment to simply 120 months. We hold that a defendant subject to a statutory mandatory minimum is eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief when he was sentenced above that minimum and a retroactive guidelines amendment lowers the high-end of his applicable guidelines range. Because the district court erroneously concluded it lacked the authority to consider Hargrove\u2019s motion, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for the court to determine whether to exercise its discretion to reduce Hargrove\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">Hargrove was convicted in 2010 of four counts of distributing crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(iii), and (b)(1)(C) (2009). At sentencing, the district court held Hargrove responsible for 16.4 grams of crack cocaine, resulting in a guidelines range of 100 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment under the drug quantity tables in place at the time. But because Hargrove had a prior felony drug conviction, he faced a mandatory 120-month statutory minimum, which changed his guidelines range to 120 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) (2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2). The district court then departed upward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, increasing Hargrove\u2019s guidelines range to 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court sentenced Hargrove to 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">In 2012, Hargrove requested a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court found Hargrove ineligible for relief because his guidelines range was based on a statutory mandatory minimum. This is Hargrove\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). That statute allows a district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence when a retroactive amendment to the sentencing guidelines lowers his applicable guidelines range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n.l(A)). A sentence reduction is not authorized, however, when \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of [a] ... statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n.l(A)). Hargrove argues that he was entitled to a reduction because his sentence was not based exclusively on a statutory mandatory minimum. He asserts that Amendment 750 to the sentencing guidelines, which revised the drug quantity tables, lowered his applicable guidelines range, making him eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-12\">We agree that Amendment 750 lowered Hargrove\u2019s applicable guidelines range. The Sentencing Commission defines \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d as \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n. 1(A)). Hargrove\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d before Amendment 750 was, therefore, 120 to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>The low-end of that range, 120 months, was based on the statutory mandatory minimum, but the rest, up to 125 months, was derived from the drug quantity tables.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-4\">After Amendment 750, Hargrove\u2019s initial guidelines range would be 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. But because Hargrove remains subject to a 120-month statutory mandatory minimum sentence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his final guidelines range would be simply 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) (2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Amendment 750, therefore, \u201clower[ed] [Hargrove\u2019s] applicable guideline range\u201d by reducing the high-end from 125 to 120 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n. 1(A)); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Although we express no view on whether Hargrove should receive a sentence reduction, the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked the authority to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1202-03 (11th Cir.2012). We accordingly vacate the denial of Hargrove\u2019s motion and remand to permit the district court to decide the motion on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">. Hargrove's \u00a7 4A1.3 departure is not included in his \"applicable guideline range\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In Amendment 759, the Sentencing Commission made explicit that \u00a7 4A1.3 departures are not part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>\"applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Amend. 759, app. C, Vol. III, at 421; <em>see also United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 541 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. June 12, 2013) (No. 12-10828).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">. Hargrove argues that he is no longer subject to the 120-month mandatory minimum as a result of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). But the FSA applies only to defendants sentenced after August 3, 2010, the date it took effect. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377-78 (11th Cir.2012). Because Hargrove was sentenced on June 29, 2010, the FSA does not apply to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
