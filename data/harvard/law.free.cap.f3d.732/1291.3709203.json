McKinley maintains the district court erred by (1) violating his Sixth Amendment rights by imposing a seven-year mandatory minimum sentence on Count 2 based on the judicially-found fact that he brandished a firearm; (2) assessing him a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice; and (3) imposing an above-guidelines sentence as to Count 1. After a thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">On September 23, 2011, a man wearing a black mask and carrying a gun entered the convenience store at a Chevron gas station in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida. Mohammad Khan, the manager and part-owner of the station who was working that day, immediately tried to close himself in the store\u2019s cashier\u2019s booth using a bulletproof door. The robber, however, prevented the door from closing with his left hand. Using his right hand, the robber pointed his gun at Khan and ordered him to open the door. After Khan obeyed, the robber emptied two cash registers and exited the booth. Khan then succeeded in locking himself inside the booth, but, in the process, also locked the robber inside the store. Unable to leave, the robber pointed his gun at Khan and screamed at him to open the door. Khan unlocked the door using a button beneath the cash register, and the robber kicked the door open and exited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-13\">While Khan was waiting for the police to arrive, he noticed several blood stains inside the store. Once the police arrived, an officer collected blood samples from around the exit door, the door inside the cashier\u2019s booth, and the floor inside the cashier\u2019s booth. The officer also collected a fingerprint from the door inside the cashier\u2019s booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-14\">A federal grand jury subsequently returned a two-count indictment charging McKinley with interfering with commerce by threats or violence and using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. In relevant part, Count 2 specifically charged that McKinley \u201cdid knowingly use and carry a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, and did knowingly possess a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence.... \u201d However, the indictment cited 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1) (A) (ii), the statutory provision that prescribes a seven-year mandatory minimum sentence for brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-15\">At trial, the Government presented evidence that McKinley\u2019s fingerprints positively matched the fingerprint taken from the door in the cashier\u2019s booth, and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>DNA matched that in the blood samples obtained from the crime scene. While testifying in his own defense, McKinley explained he was a regular visitor at Khan\u2019s Chevron station, but repeatedly denied robbing the gas station. He also denied that his blood was present in the convenience store, and maintained the Government\u2019s DNA analysis was inaccurate. McKinley similarly denied his fingerprint was found inside the cashier\u2019s booth. The jury convicted McKinley on both counts. The verdict form provided that the jury found McKinley guilty as to Counts 1 and 2 \u201cas charged in the Indictment.\u201d The form, however, did not include any specific findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">In preparing McKinley\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSI), the probation officer assigned him a base-offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(a). McKinley received an additional two points under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) because the crime involved threats of death, as well as a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice, yielding a total adjusted offense level of 24. Based on a 1990 state conviction for grand theft, McKinley was assessed three criminal history points resulting in a criminal history category of II. The PSI also enumerated McKinley\u2019s numerous other state convictions for offenses dating from 1972 through 1999\u2014 including robbery, grand theft, burglary, drug offenses, and resisting an officer without violence \u2014 but those offenses did not figure into his criminal history score because of their age. Given a total adjusted offense level of 24 and a criminal history category of II, McKinley\u2019s guidelines range for Count 1 was 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment, with a statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. The PSI further noted that McKinley brandished a firearm during the robbery, so his guidelines range for Count 2 was the statutory minimum sentence of seven years\u2019 imprisonment enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) which was to run consecutive to his sentence for Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">Prior to sentencing, the district court issued a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) notice that it was contemplating departing upward from McKinley\u2019s advisory guidelines range pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, or varying upward pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), because his criminal history category of II substantially underrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history and the likelihood he would commit future crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-7\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court explained to McKinley that, while the jury convicted him of using a firearm during a crime of violence, the court was authorized to increase his mandatory minimum sentence if the court found that he brandished the firearm during the commission of the robbery. The district court clarified, \u201cI can give you a five-year mandatory minimum consecutive [sentence] if I think you just carried [the firearm] or used it. If I think that you brandished it, then I can give you a seven-year mandatory minimum.\u201d Before imposing McKinley\u2019s sentences, the court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-8\">I think that Mr. McKinley has unscored stale convictions that the Court can and should take into account ... If you score all of those convictions, had they not been stale, he would come up with, I think, 17 criminal history points, which is a category six criminal history. I think that\u2019s the appropriate way under the Guidelines to have scored Mr. McKinley. So, under the Guideline rules, I depart upward to an offense level 24, criminal history category six, for a range of a hundred to ... 125 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-9\">The court further explained that, considered as an upward variance, an above-guidelines sentence would be appropriate to protect the public, promote respect for the law, and to deter others. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>the district court sentenced McKinley to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 1, and a consecutive 84 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 2, for a total of 209 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">A <em>Seven-Year Mandatory Minimum Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">McKinley argues for the first time on appeal that the district court unconstitutionally increased his statutory mandatory minimum sentence as to Count 2 based on a fact not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, he maintains that, under the Sixth Amendment, the jury was required to find he brandished a firearm rather than simply used or carried one in the commission of his offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response, the Government argues only that, at the time McKinley was sentenced, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), squarely foreclosed his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">While McKinley\u2019s appeal was pending before this Court, the Supreme Court decided <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), which explicitly overruled <em>Harris </em>and held that any fact that increases a defendant\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence is an element of the offense that must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. It is by now well established that \u201c[t]he relevant time period for assessing whether an error is plain is at the. time of appellate consideration.\u201d <em>United States v. Bane, </em>720 F.3d 818, 830 (11th Cir.2013) (quotation omitted); <em>see also Henderson v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1121, 1130-31, 185 L.Ed.2d 85 (2013). As such, we must address the impact of <em>Alleyne </em>on McKinley\u2019s seven-year sentence for brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-16\"><em>Alleyne </em>affords McKinley minimal relief, however, because he failed to preserve his argument that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the district court\u2019s imposition of an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Pielago, </em>135 F.3d 703, 708 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe plain error rule places a daunting obstacle before [the appellant].\u201d). McKinley did not raise a constitutional objection to his sentence before the district court. We have explained that \u201cnot every objection is a constitutional objection,\u201d and have held that to preserve a claim of error under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), a defendant must raise an objection framed in constitutional terms. <em>See United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, because <em>Alleyne </em>was an extension of <em>Apprendi, see </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160, we adopt the same rule and hold that to preserve a claim of <em>Alleyne </em>error, a defendant must make a timely constitutional objection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>We further hold that, as with other alleged constitutional errors, specifically errors of the <em>Apprendi </em>variety, the failure to make a timely objection results in this Court\u2019s application of plain error review. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2005); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">Under the plain error standard, \u201cbefore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (quotations and brackets omitted). If all three conditions are met, we may then exercise our discretion to correct the error, \u201cbut only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">In pertinent part, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) provides a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for any person who, during and in relation to a crime of violence that may be prosecuted in federal court, uses or carries a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae. However, if the defendant brandishes the firearm during the commission of the crime, the mandatory minimum sentence is increased by two years, to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). The statute defines \u201cbrandish\u201d to mean \u201cwith respect to a firearm, to display all or part of the firearm, or otherwise make the presence of the firearm known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the firearm is directly visible to that person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that, \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Subsequently, the Supreme Court held in <em>Harris </em>that a fact increasing a defendant\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence, specifically brandishing a firearm under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), was not subject to the <em>Apprendi </em>rule and could be found by a sentencing judge rather than a jury. <em>Harris, </em>536 U.S. at 556-57, 568-69, 122 S.Ct. at 2414, 2420. As noted, the Supreme Court overruled <em>Harris </em>in <em>Alleyne, </em>concluding that the \u201cdistinction between facts that increase the statutory maximum and facts that increase only the mandatory minimum\u201d was inconsistent with <em>Apprendi. </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155. Instead, the Court held that \u201cany fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">In <em>Alleyne, </em>a jury convicted the defendant of, <em>inter alia, </em>robbery affecting interstate commerce, and using or carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). <em>Id. </em>at 2155-56. As the Supreme Court explained, \u201c[t]he jury indicated on the verdict form that <em>Alleyne </em>had used or carried a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, but did not indicate a finding that the firearm was brandished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2156 (quotations and alterations omitted). Over Alleyne\u2019s objection, the district court imposed a seven-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), and the Fourth Circuit affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">In vacating the Fourth Circuit\u2019s judgment and remanding for resentencing, the Supreme Court held that, \u201c[wjhile <em>Harris </em>limited <em>Apprendi </em>to facts increasing the statutory maximum, the principle applied in <em>Apprendi </em>applies with equal force to facts increasing the mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2160. The Court explained, \u201c[i]t is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>indisputable that a fact triggering a mandatory minimum alters the prescribed range of sentences to which a criminal defendant is exposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201cbecause the legally prescribed range <em>is </em>the penalty affixed to the crime, ... it follows that a fact increasing either end of the range produces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The Court reasoned that \u201cthe core crime and the fact triggering the mandatory minimum sentence together constitute a new, aggravated crime, each element of which must be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2161. Because there was \u201cno basis in principle or logic to distinguish facts that raise the maximum from those that increase the minimum,\u201d the Supreme Court expressly overruled <em>Harris </em>as inconsistent with <em>Apprendi. Id. </em>at 2163. The Court then held that the district court\u2019s finding by a preponderance of the evidence that <em>Alleyne </em>brandished a firearm violated his Sixth Amendment rights, and remanded for resentencing consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 2163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">In this case, we will assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that McKinley demonstrated error that is plain under <em>Alleyne. </em>We will also assume for the sake of argument that the alleged error affected his substantial rights. Nevertheless, McKinley is not entitled to correction of the alleged error because he has not satisfied the fourth prong of plain error review. <em>See Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 631, 122 S.Ct. at 1785. The Supreme Court has explained that where the evidence of a statutory element of an offense is overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted, there is no basis for concluding the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 632-33, 122 S.Ct. at 1786. In the instant case, the evidence that McKinley brandished a firearm was overwhelming. Khan testified that, after the gas station robber prevented the bulletproof door on the cashier\u2019s booth from closing, the robber pointed his gun at Khan and ordered him to open the door. Similarly, after Khan inadvertently locked the robber inside the store, the robber again pointed his gun at Khan and screamed at him to open the exit door. Another witness who observed the robbery from his parked car outside the store testified that he saw the robber waiving a gun and shouting. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(4) (defining the term \u201cbrandish\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">Although McKinley repeatedly denied committing the robbery, and objected to the PSI on that same basis, McKinley\u2019s testimony was convincingly controverted by DNA and fingerprint evidence establishing his presence inside the cashier\u2019s booth. In fact, his denial of any involvement in the offense was so implausible as to amount to perjury, as discussed below. Accordingly, given such evidence, there is no basis for us to conclude the alleged <em>Alleyne </em>error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, and we affirm McKinley\u2019s 84-month sentence on Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">\n<em>B. Obstruction of Justice Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">McKinley also argues that the district court erred by assessing him a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. He maintains that he did not provide materially false testimony and simply exercised his constitutional right to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">The district court did not clearly err in imposing an enhancement for obstruction of justice. <em>See United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1254 (11th Cir.2010). Section 3C1.1 provides for a two-level increase to a defendant\u2019s base offense level if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The commission of perjury under oath on material matters, not due to confusion, mistake, or faulty memory, is grounds for an obstruction enhancement. <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>627 F.3d 839, 845 (11th Cir.2010); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">The record fully supports the district court\u2019s finding that McKinley perjured himself because his testimony that he had no involvement in the robbery was material to the issue of his guilt, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6), and was expressly contradicted by DNA and fingerprint evidence from the scene of the crime. Furthermore, while a defendant has a right to testify on his own behalf, the Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that \u201ca defendant\u2019s right to testify does not include a right to commit perjury.\u201d <em>Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. at 96, 113 S.Ct. at 1117.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">\n<em>C. Upward Departure or Variance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">McKinley further asserts the district court erred in imposing an above-guidelines sentence on Count 1. The district court, however, did not abuse its discretion in imposing McKinley\u2019s above-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\u201cRegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-10\">Under \u00a7 4A1.3, a district court may depart from the advisory sentencing range \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). The extent of the departure should be determined by reference to the criminal history category \u201capplicable to defendants whose criminal history or likelihood to recidivate most closely resembles\u201d that of the individual being sentenced. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-11\">On this record, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in departing upward based on McKinley\u2019s extensive criminal history, as expressly contemplated by \u00a7 4A1.3(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> McKinley had numerous prior convictions that were not counted in computing his criminal history score. His offenses spanned most of his adult life, ranging from the time he was 18 years\u2019 old until he was at least 45 years\u2019 old. With more than 25 years of criminal history encompassing crimes from burglary and robbery to grand theft and reckless driving, we agree with the district court that the assessment of only 3 criminal history points substantially underrepresented McKinley\u2019s criminal history and likelihood of recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>In the alternative, McKinley\u2019s 125-month sentence was appropriate as an upward variance. As the district court found, the sentence was appropriate in order to protect the public, to promote respect for the law, and to deter others. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Early, </em>686 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir.2012). We also note that McKinley\u2019s sentence was well below the statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, which is a further indicator the sentence was reasonable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we affirm McKinley\u2019s 125-month sentence on Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">For the foregoing reasons, McKinley\u2019s sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1313-11\">. McKinley also argues the imposition of an enhanced sentence violated his Fifth Amendment rights, by which we understand him to be attempting to raise a challenge to the adequacy of his indictment. McKinley, however, did not elaborate any argument regarding the indictment in his initial brief or cite any authority relevant to such an argument. Accordingly, we deem any Fifth Amendment argument abandoned. <em>See United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2004). Even if the issue is not abandoned, we note the indictment cited the correct statutory provision, which was likely sufficient. <em>See United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 n. 5 (11th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Fern, </em>155 F.3d 1318, 1325 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1313-18\">. A defendant may make such an objection by, for example, (1) invoking <em>Alleyne </em>or its direct predecessors; (2) objecting that a fact relevant to an increased mandatory minimum should be submitted to the jury; or (3) arguing that such a fact must be proved beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>430 F.3d 1357, 1374 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">. Because we may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record, <em>United States v. Hall, </em>714 F.3d 1270, 1271 (11th Cir.2013), we need not consider the district court\u2019s alternative holding that the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement was also warranted because McKinley made phone calls following his arrest purportedly instructing his daughter to destroy physical evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1316-12\">. McKinley does not argue the district court erred by failing to first explicitly consider whether a criminal history category of III was appropriate, <em>see United States v. Valdes, </em>500 F.3d 1291, 1292 n. 1 (11th Cir.2007), and the issue is therefore waived or abandoned, <em>see Curtis, </em>380 F.3d at 1310 (explaining the \"long-standing rule in this circuit, as well as in the federal rules themselves, that issues not raised by a defendant in his initial brief on appeal are deemed waived\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
