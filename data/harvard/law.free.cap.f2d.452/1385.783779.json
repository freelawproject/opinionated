We begin our consideration, then, with a brief summary of the salient facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-5\">The appeal, already under submission, brought under review the District Court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 complaints seeking, <em>mter alia, </em>to enjoin on grounds of federal unconstitutionality Section 401(2) of the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1968<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and requesting the convocation of a three-judge court to assay their claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That section prohibits, with certain exceptions, the expenditure of \u201cfunds appropriated for the government of the District of Columbia * * * for the cost of education (including the cost of transportation) of any individual in an elementary or secondary school located outside the District of Columbia * * \u00bb Basic to appellants\u2019 challenge was the assertion that Section 401(2) imperiled an arrangement by which small groups of District children have attended Bannockburn Elementary School in Montgomery County, Maryland.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1444-7\">The Bannockburn project was initiated cooperatively in 1968 by District and County school authorities and extended briefly into the current school term. It has enabled the attendance, on a voluntary basis, at the almost exclusively white Bannockburn School of a few randomly-selected Negro children who otherwise would have enrolled in the almost all-black Meyer Elementary School in the District. From inception of the enterprise its expense \u2014 principally tuition and transportation costs \u2014 has been absorbed by the District\u2019s Board of Education from its Federal Impact Aid funds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Very recently, however, the Board voted to terminate the offering and the instant motion followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-16\">The objective of the motion, as previously indicated, is maintenance of the status quo \u2014 the continuing attendance of the District group at Bannockburn\u2014 pending disposition of the appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The factual predicate for the motion is the allegation that financial considerations, including the Section 401(2) restrictions, spelled the doom of the Bannock-burn plan. Our scrutiny of the record reveals, however, that Section 401(2) played no significant role in the Board\u2019s decision to end the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-17\">That decision followed a lengthy, vigorous in-meeting debate during which a number of factors associated with the Bannockburn venture were discussed. Close review of the transcript of the discussion identifies a variety of reasons advanced by members who favored cessation of the Board\u2019s undertaking. Among those expressed were the nonparticipation of Montgomery County in the expense, the nonattendanee reciprocally of Bannockburn children at the Meyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number><em>School,\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the non-inclusion of children from District schools other than Meyer, and the lack of a thorough evaluation of the program. Conspicuously absent was any opposition to the program stemming from the prohibition Section 401(2) made with respect to the Board\u2019s use of appropriated monies. It goes without saying that we are not at liberty to ignore the Board\u2019s determination or the grounds ostensibly inducing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-5\">To be sure, the financial aspects of the Bannockburn offering were canvassed as the Board pondered its fate. As stated, there -was objection that the entire cost, though small, <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had fallen upon the District; there was protest, too, that the expenditures the plan entailed should be made instead for the academic betterment of children who in any event would remain in District schools. But the Superintendent of Schools gave the Board virtual assurance that funding would be available;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> indeed, he pointed out that discontinuance of the project might work to the Board\u2019s financial detriment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A fair reading of the transcript of the Board\u2019s deliberations isolates plainly enough the central concern that the Bannockburn arrangement had not cultivated a two-way educational experience<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but rather a one-way passage of pupils and funds. And the fact crucial to a ruling on appellants\u2019 motion is that no one suggested\u2014 much less advocated \u2014 dissolution of the plan because of the restrictions Section 401(2) lays on the Board\u2019s appropriated funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-12\">We are unable, then, to discern a nexus between Section 401(2) and the demise, for the time being at least, of the Bannockburn project. Instead, we perceive a Board decision predicated on grounds distinct from the issues presented on the appeal. Appellants postulated, both in the District Court and here, the Board\u2019s desire to continue the Bannockburn program and the concomitant possibility that Section 401(2) would frustrate efforts to implement it financially. The requested injunction, on the other hand, would in practical effect compel the Board to maintain an arrangement which upon an evaluation of factors essentially unrelated to Section 401(2) it has decided to halt. Such a transformation cannot permissibly serve to introduce what in essence would be a new case on appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Still less can it support the sought-after injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"Azck\">Motion denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1444-8\">.
