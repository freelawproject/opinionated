Rhay, 431 F.2d 880 (9th Cir. 1970), we reversed an order denying petitioner\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to determine if the prosecutor\u2019s comment on petitioner\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right \u201cwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d That court found the comment harmless. Petitioner appeals from the order entered on this finding. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">At petitioner\u2019s trial for robbing a supermarket, six store employees positively identified him as the robber. The robbery took place in a well lighted store; all the witnesses were within a few feet of the robber; the robber\u2019s disguise was amateurish. Each of the witnesses remained unshaken in his identification of petitioner as the robber in the face of extensive cross-examination. Petitioner\u2019s defense was alibi. His uncorroborated testimony was that he was \u201cin hiding\u201d on the night in question because of his recent escape from a California prison. The comment which we found objectionable on the prior appeal concerned petitioner\u2019s failure to relate his alibi to the arresting officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">On a review of the record before us, we agree with the district court that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner\u2019s uncorroborated alibi was weak, while the evidence supporting his conviction was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969). The case against him is not \u201cwoven from circumstantial evidence,\u201d <em>id., </em>but rests upon the uncontradicted and unshaken testimony of eyewitnesses to the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Denial of the writ is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
