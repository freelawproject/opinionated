Rule 4(a) F.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-21\">By the order of November 24, the district court affirmed the referee\u2019s denial of a discharge in bankruptcy to Watkins and additionally affirmed his determination and judgment that Watkins and several other persons were jointly liable to the trustee for rent accruing on their use of real property belonging to the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-22\">We agree with the district judge that, on the record made, the referee was acting well within his discretion in refusing to grant Watkins a discharge; that the evidence was sufficient to support the award of money damages, and that those orders should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-23\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
