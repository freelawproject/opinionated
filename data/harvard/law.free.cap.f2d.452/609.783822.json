He appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-25\"> Although stated in two parts, appellant\u2019s sole contention is that the trial court erred in denying his pre-trial motion to suppress evidence which was seized by police officers. The contention is without merit. Certain of the seized property was observed by an officer in plain view through an open doorway. The door was not opened by an officer. This evidence was admissible. Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 43, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963). The remainder of the evidence was discovered after appellant\u2019s joint tenant consented to an apartment search. It is well established that such a consent is valid. United States v. Cataldo, 433 F.2d 38 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied 401 U.S. 977, 91 S.Ct. 1200, 28 L.Ed.2d 326, rehearing denied 402 U.S. 934, 91 S.Ct. 1523, 28 L.Ed.2d 869 (1971); Wright v.

United States, 292 F.2d 460, 464 (9th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">We need not reach the issue of appellant\u2019s standing to object to the introduction of the challenged evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
