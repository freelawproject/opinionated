On a previous appeal, this court had remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration and redetermination of the wife\u2019s claims for alimony and counsel fees. See Poe v. Poe, 409 F.2d 40 (3d Cir. 1969). At that time, this court said at pp. 43-44 of 409 F.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHKN\">\u201cIt is the circumstances surrounding the parties, the wife\u2019s necessities and the husband\u2019s financial ability, the physical condition of the parties, the nature of their life together, and in these modern times the wife\u2019s independence and ability to earn her own way, which, must all be considered by the court in the exercise of its discretion in awarding or denying alimony. . It is well settled that a husband may not diminish his earnings and thereby reduce or destroy a wife\u2019s right to alimony. In such a case his earning capacity rather than his actual earnings will be employed as the standard in determining the award of alimony to his wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-14\">At the hearing on remand, the evidence supported the court\u2019s findings that the husband-plaintiff owned stock of undetermined value and was owed over $182,524. by business corporations, but that \u201cit is highly problematic when plaintiff will be able to collect these monies due him, and whether he will collect in full.\u201d Under these circumstances,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the above-mentioned awards will be sustained. A lump sum award of alimony is authorized by 16 V.I.C. 109(3). We have carefully considered husband\u2019s contentions and have concluded that the awards are within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>discretion of the district court in view of this record. See Burch v. Burch, 205 F.2d 115, 116 (3d Cir. 1953); cf. Viles v. Viles, 316 F.2d 31 (3d Cir. 1963); Clark, Law of Domestic Relations, 442-443.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">The decree of September 25, 1970, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">. The wife is in poor health, heavily in debt, and \u201ccompletely without assets.\u201d The husband has attended college for three years and has worked in the advertising and promotional divisions of firms engaged in the military-industrial field. Neither party has bright employment prospects for the future in their former fields of endeavor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1059-16\">. Clark uses this language at p. 442:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjSd\">\u201cHis property is also to be considered whether or not it produces income, although if it is not productive, the courts will be reluctant to order it sold to pay alimony. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8L\">\u201cAlimony need not be limited by the husband\u2019s income as of the time of the trial. If he is not earning as much as he might, either deliberately or through poor management, alimony may be calculated on the basis of what the court thinks he could and should earn.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
