App. \u00a7 462. He seeks reversal on two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">1. The regulations provide that \u201cA local board of three or more members shall be appointed . . ..\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.52(a). It is stipulated that only two of the normal complement of three members had been appointed to appellant\u2019s local board when his claim for student deferment was rejected and he was classified I-A. Since both members joined in the action, however, appellant can suggest no prejudice. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Gasca, 449 F.2d 1288 (9th Cir. 1971); United States v. Reeb, 433 F.2d 381, 383-84 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-19\">2. On August 21, 1967, appellant filed an SSS form \u201cRequest for Undergraduate Student Deferment.\u201d On January 25, 1968, the board rejected appellant\u2019s request and classified him I-A. A week later, on February 22, the board received a second \u201cRequest for Undergraduate Student Deferment\u201d from appellant dated January 31. The board took no action on this communication. Appellant contends that the board should have treated it as a notice of appeal from the order rejecting appellant\u2019s claim for a student deferment and classifying him I-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-20\">The regulations provide that a notice of appeal \u201cneed not be in any particular form\u201d and \u201cshall be liberally construed in favor of the person filing the notice so as to permit the appeal.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.11(a). A related Operation Memorandum issued by the California head<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>quarters of the Selective Service System on April 8, 1964, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\">\u201cIf a local board receives within the time to appeal a letter from the registrant . . . expressing dissatisfaction with the classification, that letter should be regarded as a letter of appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">In short, any doubt whether an appeal is intended if the letter is filed within the period allowed for an appeal, should be resolved in favor of the appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">It is needless to point out that a registrant could successfully claim erroneous induction if an appeal taken by him is not acted upon by the appeal board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Here the form submitted by appellant within the allotted appeal period stated, \u201cI am pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college . . . and do hereby request that I be granted an undergraduate student deferment in Class II-S.\u201d The local board could not reasonably take the notice at its face value as a request for student deferment and nothing more. \u2022 Obviously it was a reaction to the board\u2019s order rejecting just such a request only six days before. There was nothing to indicate that the facts upon which appellant based his claim had changed in any way. The certificate from appellant\u2019s college confirming his admission and satisfactory pursuit of a full-time course of instruction was very recent: it was dated January 3, 1968, and was received by the board January 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The only possible message appellant could have meant to convey by the notice was that he was dissatisfied with the board\u2019s order rejecting his claim for student deferment and classifying him I-A, and that he wished to have it reviewed. Under the Selective Service System\u2019s own policy of liberal interpretation, this should have been enough to alert the board to forward the file to the State Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b528-12\">WEICK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AbC\">(dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">I am unable to agree that SS Form 104 (Request For Undergraduate Deferment), filed by the registrant with his Local Board, constituted a notice of appeal from his I-A classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">The Local Board did not consider the Request as a notice of appeal and did not forward registrant\u2019s file to the Appeals Board, which it normally would have done if Schmall had only indicated that he desired to appeal. The District Judge did not regard the Request as a notice of appeal; neither would I, for it plainly is not. All that the form purported to be was a request for student deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">A chronology of the proceedings before the Local Board follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">A request for an undergraduate student deferment was filed by Schmall with the Local Board on August 21, 1967, and was accompanied by a current information questionnaire indicating that Schmall at that time was enrolled at Solano College. Under date of December 8, 1967, the Board wrote to Schmall as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-17\">\u201cYour file does not contain an SSS Form No. 109 indicating that you have or will reenter college and are or will be pursuing a full-time course of instruction. Request your school to file a Form No. 109 within 30 days after the beginning of the school year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-18\">On January 8, 1968, the Local Board received a Student Certificate (SS Form 109) from California State College at Hayward, to the effect that Schmall had entered upon and was satisfactorily pursuing a full time course of instruction in the first year class commencing 1/68 and will end on 3/68 and is expected to receive a degree 3/71. This form provided: \u201cSubmission of this form does not constitute a request for deferment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-20\">The Board classified Schmall in I-A on January 25, 1968. The notice of classification which was sent to him was ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>companied by a form letter signed by the Clerk of the Board, entitled \u201cAdvice of Right to Personal Appearance and Appeal\u201d, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u201cEnclosed is your Notice of Classification (SSS Form 110). Your right to ask for a personal appearance or an appeal within 30 days is prescribed on the reverse side of that Notice of Classification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201cEach local board has available a Government Appeal Agent to aid you with a personal appearance, an appeal, or any other procedural right. The Appeal Agent or his representative will give you legal counsel on Selective Service matters only at no charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">\u201cIf you should desire a meeting with him, this office will arrange a time and place for such meeting upon request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">These instructions should be clear to anyone, particularly to a college student.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Instead of appealing, Schmall completed and filed on February 2, 1968, SS Form 104 (Request for Undergraduate Deferment), in which for the first time he requested deferment because of his attendance at California State College at Hayward. It is this request which Schmall contends constituted a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Schmall relies on an Operation Memorandum issued by the California Selective Service state headquarters, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\">\u201cIf a local board receives within the time to appeal a letter from the registrant . . . expressing dissatisfaction with the classification, that letter should be regarded as a letter of appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-13\">\u201cIn short, any doubt whether an appeal is intended if the letter is filed within the period allowed for an appeal, should be resolved in favor of the appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-14\">\u201cIt is needless to point out that a registrant could successfully claim erroneous induction if an appeal taken by him is not acted upon by the appeal board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">I submit that this Memorandum was fully complied with by the Local Board for it never received any letter from Schmall expressing dissatisfaction with his classification. All that it received was Form 104 (Request for Undergraduate Deferment) which it could well have regarded as being made in connection with SS Form 109 filed by California State College at Hayward. The SS Form 104 previously filed by Schmall was in connection with his enrollment at Solano College. Until the Board received the second SS Form 104, there was no request for deferment based on his enrollment in California State College at Hayward.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">It would appear that Sehmall\u2019s contention that he was not permitted to appeal from his I-A classification was raised for the first time in his criminal trial. One would normally think that if a registrant\u2019s right to appeal were wrongfully thwarted by his Local Board, he would complain long and loud to his Local Board. Schmall never advised the Board, either when he received the order to report for induction on August 21, 1969, or at any other time, that he considered his Request for Undergraduate Deferment as a notice of appeal. He never requested the Board to forward his file to the Appeals Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">The record does not disclose what Schmall was doing in the long interval which elapsed between the dates of his I-A classification and his order to report for induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-18\">In the classification of registrants, Local Boards are bound by applicable provisions of the regulations, one of which provides for the filing of a notice of appeal. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-19\">There is nothing in the regulations requiring a Local Board to treat a Request for Undergraduate Deferment form as a notice of appeal, and insofar as the Operation Memorandum of the Selective Service State Headquarters is concerned, it was literally complied with by the Local Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>It should be pointed out, however, that these Operation Memoranda issued by the state headquarters constitute opinions and are advisory only. They have no legal effect and are not binding on Local Boards. United States ex rel. Lawrence v. Commanding Officer, 58 F.Supp. 933 (D.Neb.1945); Goodwin v. Rowe, 49 F.Supp. 703 (N.D.W.Va.1943); Ex parte Stewart, 47 F.Supp. 415 (S.D.Cal.1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">I would not impose on Local Boards duties and responsibilities not contained in either the statute or the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">One point further should be mentioned, which was commented upon by the District Judge. Schmall was not an illiterate; he was a college student. We ought not to indulge in a presumption that he could not read or write and did not know what he was doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">It is clear to me that Schmall did not exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">I would affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
