The record discloses substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that the company\u2019s discharge of employee Braden was motivated by the employer\u2019s dislike of his union activities. Braden had testified against the company in several grievance hearings, and his manager considered him a troublemaker. The company claimed his work was faulty, but the Board found this to be a mere pretext. We will not disturb a Board finding of motive drawn from conflicting evidence unless a clear preponderance of evidence convinces that the Board\u2019s conclusions are incorrect. NLRB v. Winkel Motors, 443 F.2d 38 (9th Cir. 1971); Santa Fe Drilling Co. v. NLRB, 416 F.2d 725 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
