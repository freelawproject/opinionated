None of his assignments has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-20\">The government\u2019s evidence provided ample support for the jury\u2019s implied finding that Foreman deliberately refused \u201cto present himself for and submit to registration,\u201d that being the crime charged against him. (50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 453, 462).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\"> His letter to his local board\u2014 in which he declared his intention not to register \u2014 did not oblige the board to effect his registration, for he did not meet the precondition of 32 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1613.-11 and 1613.13 that he \u201cpresent himself for and submit to\u201d registration. Neither the Act nor the Regulation make any provision- for a \u201cconstructive\u201d registration. Likewise, Foreman cannot urge that the board failed to comply with 32 CFR \u00a7 1613.16; the operation of that regulation is likewise limited to those instances where a candidate has presented himself to his local board. United States v. Bigman, 429 F.2d 13 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied 400 U.S. 910, 91 S.Ct. 141, 27 L.Ed.2d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
