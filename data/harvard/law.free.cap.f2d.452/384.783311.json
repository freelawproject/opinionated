Defendant, in its answer, denied that it violated the Act, claiming that prior to February 1st, 1967, the effective date of the 1966 amendments to the Act, its employees were employed at a restaurant and motel establishment coming within the statutory exemption provided by \u00a7 13(a) (2) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, therefore, exempt from the minimum wage and overtime regulations, and that for the period subsequent to February 1, 1967, defendant complied with the requirements of the 1966 amendments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The district court, following a trial, rejected defendant\u2019s claim to exemption and entered judgment enjoining both future violations and the withholding of $37,669 in unpaid wages for the period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The relationship of the parties was largely stipulated. Defendant Brand Names, Inc., operates the Nautilus Congress Inn and Surfside Restaurant in Cape Coral, Florida. Defendant is a wholly owned corporate subsidiary of Gulf American Corporation, a real estate developer of Cape Coral and other communities. Defendant\u2019s motel and restaurant, built by Gulf American in 1958, provide rooms, meals, beverages and public accommodation to members of the general public (including transients, guests, tourists, etc.), but more than 25% of their annual dollar volume of business is from providing food and lodging to travelers who have prepaid Gulf American under its so-called \u201cFly and Buy\u201d program.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">Under this program resident and nonresident buyers or prospective buyers of homesites are encouraged by Gulf American to inspect its properties in Cape Coral on a three day visit. Gulf American\u2019s representatives advise these customers of the flat rate price for the visit, which is collected in advance and includes the entire cost of meals and lodging. Brand Names\u2019 representatives are informed in advance of the number of persons expected on the flight. When the prospective buyers arrive, they are routinely registered at defendant\u2019s motel. They receive a number of meals at the defendant\u2019s restaurant and often as many as 110 are fed essentially the same menu at one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-16\">On checking out the customers pay only for phone calls, room service and miscellaneous items. Defendant Brand Names gathers all the bills, attaches them to a master tally and sends them to Gulf American\u2019s computerized accounting office. There is a reduced rate of billing because of the method of \u201cconsolidated accounting\u201d used.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Gulf American, upon receipt of the tally and bill, credits defendant\u2019s account in the amount so charged. A similar method is followed for meals served under the program at defendant\u2019s restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">On this appeal, defendant argues principally that (1) where the defendant-employer serves goods to the ultimate consumer, but receives payment from a third party, such transaction is not \u201ca sale for resale\u201d within \u00a7 13(a) (2) of the Act, and (2) that the sale of the goods to the ultimate consumer is controlling and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>precludes the Secretary\u2019s \u201cresale argument\u201d by virtue of the statutory definition of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The court below, relying heavily upon Mitchell v. Sherry Corine Corp., 264 F.2d 831 (4th Cir., 1959), rejected defendant\u2019s contentions and ruled in favor of the Secretary. After this ruling this court decided Hodgson v. Crotty Brothers Dallas, Inc., 450 F.2d 1268 (5th Cir., 1971) [opinion on petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc, October 19, 1971], a case which compels us to reverse the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In <em>Crotty Brothers Dallas </em>the appellee Crotty operated the dining facilities at St. Stephen\u2019s, an Episcopal Church boarding and day preparatory school. Crotty did not collect money directly from the students, faculty or guests, but submitted a monthly statement showing its operating costs and received from the school the amount of its costs plus $750 per month.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The court viewed the food service operation there as a catering service, but this did not bar the operation from asserting its status under the Act as a restaurant. The contractual relationship was described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">\u201cIn the broad category of services classified as \u2018catering,\u2019 one of the most common forms of contractual arrangements relating a caterer, the party managing the catered event, and the consumer of the catered food is substantially identical to the contractual setup relating Crotty, St. Stephen\u2019s, and the students in this case. The caterer contracts with the party managing the catered event to provide food service to third parties, and he is paid by the manager out of funds collected in advance from these third parties. In turn the manager of the catered affair contracts with his \u2018customers\u2019 to provide not only food but also a range of other services, for example, hotel or club accommodations, entertainment, or educational seminars. From the \u2018customers\u2019 \u2019 collective point of view, they have no direct contact with the caterer; they normally pay their fees directly to the managing party for the entire range of services to be provided.\u201d Hodgson v. Crotty Brothers Dallas, Inc., April 30, 1971, at page 1280.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">This analogy clearly applies to Brand Names\u2019 Fly and Buy program, i. e., the \u201ccaterer\u201d would be Brand Names, the party managing the event would be Gulf American Corporation, which collects the funds or fees in advance from the consumer of the goods, the traveller.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">The court in <em>Crotty Brothers Dallas </em>held that the tests and definitions of \u00a7 13(a) (2) are not the exclusive method by which the retail nature of sales and establishments is to be determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-12\">\u201cTherefore, regardless of the fact that, in the abstract, it might be possible to characterize the dealings of a caterer like Crotty as sales for resale than as direct sales to the consumer, the result inevitably flowing from such characterization, <em>i. e., </em>loss of exemption due to failure to satisfy the general definition of \u2018retail or service establishment\u2019 of \u00a7 13(a) (2), is averted by Congress\u2019 specific classification, evidenced in \u00a7 13(b) (18), of establishments providing catering services as retail establishments.\u201d April 30, 1971, at page 1281.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">The <em>Crotty </em>opinion requires that we look to the entire statutory scheme to determine whether defendant is entitled to exemption from the Act. The court in its original opinion and its supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>opinion on rehearing went into an extensive study of congressional history and intent, a portion of which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APc\">\u201cThus the Senate understood that the bill it passed in the 86th Congress exempted <em>all </em>restaurants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">\u201cThere is nothing in the bill introduced in the 87th Congress or in its legislative history to indicate that this understanding changed. The committee report accompanying the bill in the 87th Congress contained only patently neutral reference to the restaurant exemption it provided, and Senator McNamara stated to the Senate that this exemption was \u2018similar\u2019 to the one provided in the previous bill. Moreover, debate proceeded on the presumption that all restaurants were excluded. Any remaining doubt that the Senate bill of the 87th Congress might have signalled in its wording an intent to subject restaurants to the \u2018sale for resale\u2019 and \u2018recognition in the industry\u2019 tests of \u00a7 13(a) (2) prior to granting exemption is laid to rest by the statement of the managers on the part of the House in the conference committee report, which, in comparing the House and Senate versions of the bill, said</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">The Senate amendment provides both a minimum wage and overtime exemption for employees of the following: hotels, motels, restaurants, . The House bill <em>reaches the same result </em>as the Senate amendment since under the bill\u2019s definitions these are service establishments <em>and therefore not covered </em>by the House bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-16\">\u201cIn harmony with the scheme of the House bill, which excluded from coverage <em>all </em>restaurants and caterers, the Senate bill excluded <em>all </em>restaurants, including caterers. This scheme was preserved in the compromise bill agreed upon in conference and ultimately enacted into law as the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, since that bill retained unaltered in sense and in form \u00a7\u00a7 13(a) (2) (ii) and 13(a) (20), the exemption provisions of the Senate bill specific to restaurants and caterers.\u201d October 19, 1971, on Petition for Rehearing, at pages 1285-1287.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">The clear import of this language is that Congress intended special treatment for the food service industries. In the instant case we broadly view the relationship between the \u00a7 13(a) (2) (ii) exemption under the 1961 amendments and \u00a7 13(b) (8) and \u00a7 13(b) (18) [formerly \u2014 13(b) (20)] under the 1966 amendments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The Court in <em>Crotty </em>considered that a <em>restaurant </em>as well as a caterer, could fall within the ambit of \u00a7 13(b) (18), which uses the same wording as former \u00a7 13(a) (20) under the 1961 amendments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The rationale of the <em>Crotty </em>opinion extends to a restaurant under the circumstances involved in the case at hand, i. e., because former \u00a7 13(a) (20) served a dual purpose as explained in <em>Crotty </em>the requirements and percentage tests of \u00a7 13(a) (2) are not the sole basis for determining what is a \u201cretail or service establishment.\u201d Thus defendant\u2019s restaurant is entitled to its claimed \u00a7 13(a) (2) exemptions for the period prior to and after the 1966 amendments. Consequently, we reverse the district court ruling with respect to defendant\u2019s restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-18\">However, the <em>Crotty </em>decision is limited to restaurants, caterers, lunch counters and similar food service establishments,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and defendant\u2019s motel does not fit into any of these categories. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>district court, even under <em>Crotty,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was correct in its application of the law as far as the motel was concerned and its decision in this regard is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">As previously indicated, the district court enjoined the defendant\u2019s withholding of $37,669 in unpaid wages. Because of our divergent treatment of defendant\u2019s restaurant and motel operations, we remand to the district court for a supplemental determination of the amount of unpaid wages due.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 et seq.

Hodgson v. Crotty, Brothers Dallas, Inc., April 30, 1971, at page 1271. The court, in its supplemental opinion, distinguished Mitchell v. Sherry Corine Corp., because there the restaurant operator sold food to an airline engaged in interstate commerce, which then resold and served the food to its passengers. In other words, the food was delivered to the airline, which then took possession of it. The restaurant operator had no contact with the consumers. Hodgson v. Crotty Brothers Dallas, Inc., October 19, 1971, on Petition for Rehearing, at page 1292. This distinction is germane to the instant case and we need not further consider Mitchell v. Sherry Corine Corp.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\">. Crotty Bros. Dallas, at page 1274, note 14, sets out the statutes applicable to the case at bar as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">14. After the 1961 amendments, \u00a7 13 (a) (2) read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">The provisions of sections 6 and 7 shall not apply with respect to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">* * % *</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">(2) any employee employed by any retail or service establishment, more than 50 per centum of which establishment\u2019s annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services is made within the State in which the establishment is located, if such establishment\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">s-s sH &amp; :Jt sfc</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">(ii) is in such an enterprise and is a hotel, motel, <em>restaurant, </em>motion picture theater; or is an amusement or recreational establishment that operates on a seasonal basis, or</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">* }&gt;c ^ s{&lt;</p>\n<p id=\"b445-18\">(iv) is in such an <em>enterprise </em>and has an <em>annual dollar volume of sales </em>(exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level which are separately stated) <em>which is less than $250,000.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-19\">A \u201cretail or service establishment\u201d shall mean an establishment 75 per centum of whose annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services (or of both) is <em>not for resale and is recognized as retail sales or services in the particular industry; </em>or . (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-21\">And the \u00a7 13(a) (20) exemption said:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-22\">The provisions of sections 6 and 7 shall not apply with respect to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b445-23\">;{: Hs \u2756 sfc s{c</p>\n<p id=\"b445-24\">(20) any employee of a retail or service establishment who is employed primarily in connection with the preparation or offering of food or beverages for human consumption, either on the premises, or by such services as eater<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ing, banquet, box lunch, or curb or counter service, to the public, to employees, or to members or guests of members of clubs; or ... .</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In 1966, Congress amended \u00a7 13(a) (2) to remove from the aegis of enterprise exemption, \u00a7 13(a) (2) (ii) relating to restaurants and the like, and added \u00a7 13(b) (8), exempting from only \u00a7 7, i. <em>e., </em>the overtime provisions of the Act, all restaurants, etc., regardless of their inclusion in an enterprise. This section now reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">(b) The provisions of <em>section </em>7 shall not apply with respect to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">(8) any employee employed by an establishment which is a hotel, motel or restmvrant; or any employee who (A) is employed by an establishment which is an institution (other than a hospital) primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, or the mentally ill or defective who reside on the premises, and (B) receives compensation for employment in excess of forty-eight hours in any work-week at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed; . . . (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Likewise, Congress replaced \u00a7 13(a) (20) with \u00a7 13(b) (18), reading:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">(b) The provisions of <em>section </em>7 shall not apply with respect to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">(18) any employee of a retail or service establishment who is employed primarily in connection with the preparation or offering of food or beverages for human consumption, either on the premises, or by such services as catering, banquet, box lunch, or curb or counter service, to the public, to employees, or to members or guests of members of clubs; or . (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"AXk\">As a result, \u00a7 13(a) (2) became:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-20\">Sec. 13. (a) The provisions of sections <em>6 and </em>7 shall not apply with respect to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b446-22\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b446-23\">(2) any employee employed by any retail or service establishment (except an establishment or employee engaged in laundering, cleaning, or repairing clothing or fabrics or an establishment engaged in the operation of a hospital, institution, or school described in section 3(s) (4)), if more than 50 per centum of such establishment\u2019s annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services is made within the State in which the establishment is located, and such establishment is not in an enterprise described in section 3(s) or such establishment has an annual dollar volume of sales which is less than $250,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level which are sejmrately stated).

(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-24\">None of these amendments, which became effective 1 February 1967, affected the substance of the 1961 version of \u00a7 13(a) (2) relating to the exemxstion of retail or service establishments <em>in enterprises. </em>Under both the 1961 and 1966 versions of \u00a7 13(a) (2), it is necessary to show that a retail or service establishment <em>in an enterprise </em>has an annual dollar volume of sales which is less than $250,000, more than 50% of which dollar volume of sales is made in the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b446-26\">.
