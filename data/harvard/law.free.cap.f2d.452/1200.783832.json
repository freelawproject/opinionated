Beyond question, the statements were helpful to the government\u2019s case. On the record before us, the question of whether the judge abused his discretion is a close one. However, we need not answer the question. The evidence of the guilt of the appellant is otherwise so overwhelming that the error, if any, is harmless and did not affect his substantial rights. See, Rule 52 F.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-26\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
