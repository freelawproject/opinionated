On its merits the appeal would present an issue as to whether petitioner had refused to bargain with a union certified by the Board as representative of its employees, but on consideration of the record on appeal, the briefs,of the parties and the oral arguments of counsel, the Court concludes that petitioner\u2019s failure to seek a pre-election review of the Board\u2019s unit placement determination precludes judicial review of that determination. N.L.R.B. v. Rod-Ric Corp., 428 F.2d 948, 950 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 937, 91 S.Ct. 922, 28 L.Ed.2d 216; <em>see </em>N.L.R.B. v. Richard W. Kaase Co., 346 F.2d 24, 28-29 (6th Cir. 1965). Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-12\">It is ordered that the petition for review be and it hereby is denied, and enforcement of the Order of the National Labor Relations Board is hereby ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
