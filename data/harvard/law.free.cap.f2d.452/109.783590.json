On February 2, 1971, we reversed the district court\u2019s order denying the petition and remanded the case on procedural grounds. People v. Pobuta, 9 Cir., 1971, 437 F.2d 1200. At a \u201cHearing on Filing and Spreading Judgment of Court of Appeals,\u201d it appeared that petitioner was a member of the Marines and was then in Viet Nam. The State\u2019s Deputy Attorney General assured the court that petitioner could not be prosecuted in absentia. The court entered an order that the petition \u201cbe dismissed without prejudice to renewal if and when petitioner returns from military duty in Viet Nam.\u201d Petitioner again appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Assuming, without deciding, that the order is appealable, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the petition to await resumption of the state court\u2019s jurisdiction over petitioner. In effect, the order simply-stayed the federal proceedings until such time as they may be necessary. Considering \u201cthe power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants,\u201d we find no misuse of that power. Landis v. North Am. Co., 1936, 299 U.S. 248, 254-255, 57 S.Ct. 163, 81 L.Ed. 153. See Chronicle Pub. Co. v. N. B. C., 9 Cir., 1961, 294 F.2d 744. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(c), a \u201cpetition for removal of a criminal prosecution may be filed at any time before trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
