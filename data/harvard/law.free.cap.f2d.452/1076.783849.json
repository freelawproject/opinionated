Avey, 428 F.2d 1159 (9th Cir. 1970); United States v. Miranda, 426 F.2d 283 (9th Cir. 1970); Fernandez v. United States, 321 F.2d 283 (9th Cir. 1963).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s remaining points need not be discussed, since they rest upon the unsound premise that the search was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1135-11\">. The facts are undisputed. Appellant, Mienke, was driving a large van truck in a northerly direction upon and along U. S. Highway 395, and had reached an immigration check station at Temecula, California, approximately 60 miles north of the Mexican border. There the immigration authorities stopped the vehicle for the purpose of making an inspection to ascertain whether it contained aliens. The search revealed some 32 such persons inside the van.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"At3T\">. Immigration Regulation 287.1, 8 CFR \u00a7 287.1(a) (2) (1967), defines a reasonable distance, as used in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a) (3), as \u201cwithin 100 air miles from any external boundary of the United States. * * <em>*\u00bb</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AOLD\">. The bellwether ease in this context is Kelly v. United States, 197 F.2d 162 (5th Cir. 1952). The Fifth Circuit states, \u201cFrom practically the beginning of our government the courts have repeatedly pointed out that it is only unreasonable searches and seizures that come within the constitutional interdict. And the Fourth Amendment has never been held to require that every valid search and seizure be effected under the authority of a search warrant.\u201d 197 F.2d at 164. The court there held that a search without a warrant within a reasonable distance from the border, for the sole purpose of ascertaining whether a vehicle contained aliens, was reasonable, in view of the \u201csovereign right of the United States to protect its own boundaries against the entry of aliens,\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"AbG\">Border searches rest upon the same foundation. As this court pointed out in Alexander v. United States, 362 F.2d 379, 381 (9th Cir. 1966), \u201cIn conferring upon Customs officers such broad authority, circumscribed only by Constitutional limitations of the Fourth Amendment, the Congress has in effect declared that a search which would be \u2018unreasonable\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, if conducted by police officers in the ordinary case, would be a reasonable search if conducted by Customs officials in lawful pursuit of unlawful imports.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1135-17\">Judge BROWNING</author>\n<p id=\"ApN\">dissents for the reasons stated in his dissent in United States v.
