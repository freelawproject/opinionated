ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1406-19\">This is a contest between the United States (the Government) and Blake Construction Company, Inc. (Blake), intervenors during the tenure of this litigation in the District Court. Both are creditors of Fox-Greenwald Sheet Metal Company (Fox-Greenwald) with competing claims to monies paid into the registry of the court in satisfaction of a judgment in favor of Fox-Greenwald against Markowitz Brothers (Markowitz) and Continental Casualty Company (Continental). The District Court awarded the fund in issue to the Government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Blake, on this appeal, protests that it held the superior claim. We agree, and accordingly reverse the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-21\">Blake was the prime contractor selected by the General Services Administration for construction in the 1960s of a building complex for the National Bureau of Standards at Gaithersburg, Maryland. Blake engaged Markowitz as its mechanical subcontractor for the project and Markowitz, in turn, contracted with Fox-Greenwald for the performance of the sheet metal work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-22\">In August, 1963, facing difficulties in meeting its payroll,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fox-Greenwald asked Blake for a $50,000 loan. To this Blake agreed, but on condition that it be given a $50,000 promissory note to evidence the transaction and, as security for payment of the note, an assignment of all monies due and to become payable to Fox-Greenwald under its contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>with Markowitz.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aware that FoxGreenwald had covenanted in the contract against such an assignment without Markowitz\u2019 prior written consent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Blake contacted Markowitz in order to ascertain its position. Over the telephone, Markowitz\u2019 president gave an unqualified consent to the assignment, and in reliance thereon Blake consummated the loan. It is clear from the evidence that but for that conversation, Blake would not have made the loan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-4\">Blake remitted $20,000 to Fox-Greenwald on August 15, and the remaining $30,000 on August 27, 1963. On the latter date, Fox-Greenwald delivered to Blake a promissory note in the sum of $50,000 payable 60 days thereafter, and executed an assignment of all monies forthcoming from Markowitz under the contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Markowitz, however, never reduced its previous oral consent to writing. After closing the loan Blake repeatedly requested Markowitz to do so, and after two months discontinued what seemed to be an exercise in futility. The note matured on October 26, 1963, and Fox-Greenwald had paid only $500 on it. In 1964, Blake brought an action<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the note in the District Court to recover the balance of principal and interest due.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That suit remained pending at the time the court resolved the conflicting claims of Blake and the Government to the fund arising in the case at bar.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-16\">In February, 1964, Markowitz terminated its contract with Fox-Greenwald and refused to make further payments on it. Shortly thereafter, FoxGreenwald filed suit in the District Court against Markowitz and Continental, its surety, for breach of contract. A jury awarded Fox-Greenwald a verdict and the judgment entered on the verdict was affirmed by this court on appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Continental, on August 20, 1968, paid the amount of the judgment into the registry of the District Court,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and three claimants promptly intervened.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> One was paid in full,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and because the residue of the fund is too small to satisfy the aggregated claims of the other two, the dispute now before us ripened.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-17\">The two claimants remaining are Blake, asserting the assignment from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>Fox-Greenwald of the amounts due it from Markowitz, and the Government, endeavoring to enforce unsatisfied tax liens filed against Fox-Greenwald after the assignment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under the law then in force,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the tax liens took precedence over Blake\u2019s claim if the assignment did not elevate it to a secured status;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> otherwise, as the Government appears to concede, the claim outranked the subsequently-filed tax liens.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus priority between the Government and Blake to the fund depended upon the validity and enforceability of the assignment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The District Court held that the antiassignment clause in Markowitz\u2019 contract with Fox-Greenwald, coupled with Markowitz\u2019 refusal to furnish a written consent, rendered the assignment ineffective against the Government, and that in any event the statute of limitations barred its enforcement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We think the District Court erred on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-11\">In asserting its claim of priority to the in-court fund, Blake does not challenge the validity of the nonassignability clause contained in Markowitz\u2019 contract with Fox-Greenwald.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Blake ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>gues, rather, that as a matter of proper interpretation of the clause, only Markowitz could insist upon its observance. In that position Blake finds solid support in the decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-4\">Judicial holdings sustain overwhelmingly the proposition that a contractual ban on assignment ordinarily serves to protect the obligor alone, and in no way imperils the transaction as between assignor and assignee.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cWhere a term in a contract prohibits assignment and is not rendered ineffective by statute or otherwise, the term is to be construed, unless a different intention is manifested, * * * to be for the benefit of the obligor, and not to prevent the assignee from acquiring rights against the assignor. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The obligor, of course, may gain from a valid and unwaived nonassignability provision the prerogative to resist or even nullify the assignment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> That does not mean, however, that the assignee cannot compel the assignor to stand by his bargain where the obligor has not seen fit to interfere.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> And perhaps nowhere has the rule that an assignment offending such a provision normally binds the assignor to the assignee seen greater application than where the assigned claim was for monies due or to become due under a contract.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-11\">The District Court recognized these principles for the most part. \u201cIf,\u201d said the court, \u201cthis proceeding were merely to decide any claim to the fund as between Blake and Fox-Greenwald, the rights, so far as the assignment is concerned, would be with Blake, notwithstanding failure of Markowitz to execute a written consent to it.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Referring to some of the precedents, however, the court felt that \u201c[t]hese cases are authority to sustain the validity <em>between the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number><em>parties </em>of the assignment in question,\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> but that \u201c[t]hey do not sustain a priority claim against a subsequent judgment lien.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201cIn this case,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cthe rights of the United States have intervened by reason of the tax liens which were filed\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and \u201cthe lien of the United States is superior to the claim of Blake and must be enforced by payment from the registry of the court to the extent that such fund is available in amount.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-4\">We cannot readily share the District Court\u2019s view that the Government\u2019s tax lien on the monies due Fox-Greenwald by Markowitz prevails over the security lien which the assignment purported to confer upon Blake. Surely that view encounters formidable difficulties when examined in light of the principles which underlie the canon favoring inter-parties validity of assignments contractually forbidden. There is not the slightest whisper in the record of an intention to benefit anyone but Markowitz by insertion of the antiassignment provision in its contract with Fox-Greenwald. By the same token, Fox-Greenwald\u2019s assignment to Blake, though in contravention of that prohibition, was not void on that account; it was, as we have said, valid and binding as between Blake and Fox-Greenwald, subject at most to such rights as Markowitz had and might assert under the nonassignability clause.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The important consideration is that only Markowitz could avail itself of that option; third parties could gain naught from it. That is evident from cases wherein the offending assignment was upheld, not only as between the assignor and the assignee, but against creditors of the assignor as well.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> But the District Court\u2019s decision permitted the Government, as a creditor of Fox-Greenwald, to upset a transaction Fox-Greenwald itself was powerless to disturb, and to defeat an assignment indefeasible at the instance of Fox-Greenwald. It likewise permitted the Government, whose rights to the monies were derivative through Fox-Greenwald, to gain priority over Blake to whose rights by assignment Fox-Greenwald\u2019s own interest in the monies was subordinate.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-13\">Were we called upon to make an independent determination of the effect of the antiassignment clause upon the assignment to Blake, we would unhesitatingly follow the course of judicial decision heavily prevailing across the Nation. The canonical rule that, absent manifestation of a broader purpose, such a clause will be construed as protection for the obligor only, appeals to us as an accurate reflection of what the parties very probably intended. Obligors naturally shy away from the prospect of conflicting claims and the specter of double liability; they may well be interested in the obligee\u2019s personal performance and apprehensive about any material change in duties in that regard. These are the concerns usually dictating inclusion of a nonassignability provision; the realities of everyday business experience militate against any unsupported presumption that the parties had the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>terests of anyone but the obligee in mind. Consequently, \u201cas assignment has become a common practice, the policy which limits the validity of restraints on alienation has been applied to the construction of contractual terms open to two or more possible constructions,\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and that makes good sense to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-4\"> It is not, however, our mission, as we conceive it, to resolve the issue as a matter of either federal or District of Columbia law. For while \u201c[t]he effect of a lien in relation to a provision of federal law for the collection of debts owing the United States is always a federal question,\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> the efficacy of particular transactions to generate nonfederal rights in property, including liens, is not.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Federal law, of course, furnishes the standard by which the relative priority of federal tax liens and state-created liens is ascertained,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> that is, whether the state lienholder falls within the class shielded against the federal lien <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> But the question whether given events are effective to give rise to a nonfederal lien is clearly one of state law; <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> obviously, the transaction must pass muster under state law before a federal question is reached. Here the question is whether, in view of the nonassignability provision and Markowitz\u2019 refusal of consent, the assignment to Blake was effective at all.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> That aspect of the case, we think, must be left to state law: \u2014 the applicable state rule fixing the consequences to be attached to that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-14\">By that we do not mean the District of Columbia law. For although the District was the forum chosen for FoxGreenwald\u2019s suit against Markowitz, so far as the record discloses it had little or no connection with the contract between them, into which the antiassignment clause was incorporated.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Manifestly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>then, we are not to draw upon District law, but instead upon the law of the jurisdiction having the more essential contacts with the contract trans\u00e1etion.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">Preliminarily, we note that it is the locus of that transaction, and not the assignment transaction,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> that is vital in the choice-of-law process. The controversy does not emanate from the events by which Fox-Greenwald undertook to assign to Blake, but from the contract between Markowitz and Fox-Greenwald containing the nonassignability provision. The Government\u2019s challenge is not based on alleged deficiencies in the assignment itself, but on the claim that the antiassignment clause disabled FoxGreenwald from making any sort of assignment of rights under the contract. The question thus arising is the construction properly to be given to that clause, and that question is referable to the law governing the interpretation of the contract.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-14\">The constructional problem, in our view, is to be treated under the law of Maryland, where the contract called for performance.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> It was, as we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>said, a contract to do the sheet metal work in a five-building complex; it was, too, a contract requiring a performance of substantial size and duration.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> There is nothing before us to indicate that the parties had any expectation that the contract might be construed by reference to any other law, nor to suggest that any other state bore a more significant relationship to the contract. We turn, then, to the Maryland law for such guidance as it may afford in the interpretation of the antiassignment clause.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-8\">The validity of contract provisions prohibiting assignment has been upheld in Maryland,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and the Maryland approach to construction of such provisions does not seem to differ essentially from that prevalent in other parts of the country. While Maryland holds an assignment inoperative in the face of a nonassignability clause intended for the protection of the assignor,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> its highest court has recognized the effectiveness of assignments between assignor and assignee where, as here, the prohibition is not so designed.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The pains the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>has taken to sharply distinguish the two situations<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> make it evident that interpretation of antiassignment provisions is an integral part of the decisional process. And the court\u2019s constructional preference is sufficiently indicated by its declination in Rubberoid Company v. Glassman Construction Company<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> to extend the scope of a nonassignability clause beyond its plainly apparent purpose.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> We note also, as a reflection of state policy, that shortly after the assignment in suit Maryland adopted the Uniform Commercial Code,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> which goes to the extent of outlawing restrictions on the transferability of accounts receivable in security transactions.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> With these circumstances, and the absence of a more definitive ruling, we are unwilling to assume that Maryland would fashion and apply to the situation at bar a constructional rule at variance with the strong current of judicial opinion elsewhere.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">Statutes of limitation are statues of repose; their purpose is to quiet stale controversies, the evidence as to which may be eroded by time.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Neither of the two debtors here involved\u2014 Fox-Greenwald or Markowitz \u2014 has itself urged a time barrier to Blake\u2019s resort to the fund held in the registry of the District Court. The Government, however, as a creditor of Fox-Greenwald, invoked such a limitation<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> against Blake, another Fox-Greenwald creditor,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> on the basis of the long interval between the accrual of Blake\u2019s cause of action on Fox-Greenwald\u2019s note and Blake\u2019s effort to enforce the assignment securing it. In the interest of clarity, we recount the relevant events.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-13\">By its terms, the note matured on October 26, 1963,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and only $500 had been paid on it. It was secured by FoxGreenwald\u2019s assignment to Blake of all monies due and to become due from Markowitz pursuant to the contract for the sheet metal work. Markowitz\u2019 liability under the contract was the subject of earlier inquiry in this case, begun in 1964, and the monies Markowitz was found to have owed comprised the in-court fund in original amount. Blake did not intervene to assert an interest in the litigation or the resulting fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>until August, 1968.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The District Court held, and the Government argues here, that by then the statute of limitations had barred all rights in the fund which Blake may have derived by virtue of the assignment. This view we cannot accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-4\">The parties\u2019 transactions generated two claims, each susceptible to a statutory time bar, and it is important to carefully differentiate them. One was Blake\u2019s claim against Fox-Greenwald on the note evidencing the loan. The other was Fox-Greenwald\u2019s claim against Markowitz on the contract, which was assigned to Blake as security for the payment of the note. They were separate claims with separate origins, involving different debtors and different obligations. They were interrelated only in the sense that Blake\u2019s derivative claim against Markowitz secured Blake\u2019s original claim against Fox-Greenwald. And they were unrelated, in the sense that prosecution of each claim presented its own problems in terms of the statute.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1415-14\">The District\u2019s general statute of limitations<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> as the law of the forum, governed the litigation in which the parties have engaged <footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The statute specifies enforcement periods of twelve years for contracts under seal<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and three years for all other contracts.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The three-year period applied to suit on Fox-Greenwald\u2019s note <footnotemark>68</footnotemark> and, we may assume with the record devoid of anything to summon the longer period, to suit on the assigned debts of Markowitz as well.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> As to each, the statute started running when the cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>arose,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> subject to arrest upon commencement of appropriate litigation.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> With these basic principles in mind, we turn to a consideration of each of the two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">Blake\u2019s cause of action on its principal claim, attested to by FoxGreenwald\u2019s note, ripened on October 27, 1963, the day after the note matured without payment.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Blake\u2019s suit against Fox-Greenwald on the note<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> was brought during 1964, well within the three-year period. The action tolled the statute on the note,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> and the action was still pending when the District Court passed its decision on the parties\u2019 conflicting claims to the fund. Thus Blake\u2019s right to enforce, in that action, Fox-Greenwald\u2019s obligation on the note was then still preserved.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">Blake\u2019s suit against Fox-Greenwald, however, did not interrupt the running of the statute as to Blake\u2019s claim against Markowitz on the obligations assigned by Fox-Greenwald. The creditor\u2019s causes of action on the principal debt and on an assigned chose securing it are independent.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> A suit halting the statute on one debt does not automatically have the same effect on another debt comprising its security.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Nor could Fox-Greenwald\u2019s assignment of Markowitz\u2019 debts to Blake <em>ex proprio vigore </em>extend Markowitz\u2019 liability beyond the enforcement period set by the statute.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> We must, therefore, investigate further to ascertain whether the statute foreclosed Blake\u2019s claim for the monies due Fox-Greenwald by Markowitz before Blake sought to litigate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-15\">As we have stated, Fox-Greenwald undertook an assignment to Blake not only of accounts already due by Markowitz but also of accounts to become due. The statute, of course, would not begin to run on any obligation of Markowitz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>until it fell due,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> and the record leaves fuzzy the extent to which the in-court fund might represent debts maturing subsequent to Fox-Greenwald\u2019s default on the notes. In any event, Blake\u2019s cause of action against Markowitz accrued in toto during February, 1964, when Markowitz repudiated its contract with Fox-Greenwald and refused further payments on it.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Measuring the three-year limitation period from that point, it follows that the statute, absent some circumstances suspending it, would have completed its run during February, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-4\">The statutory bar did not, however, fall so soon. Fox-Greenwald instituted suit \u2014 the case at bar \u2014 against Markowitz in 1964, well within the limitation period, on the selfsame claim that had previously been assigned to Blake as security for the payment of the note. With legal title and security rights to the assigned dioses,<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Blake could, and indeed properly should, have joined in the action as a real party in interest.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> But though Blake did not collaborate in the bringing of the suit, Blake did gain party status therein, and rightly so,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> through intervention by leave of court, during the course of the supplemental proceedings directed toward disposition of the in-court fund, which arose in satisfaction of the judgment on the already-assigned claim. It is well settled that, even after the expiration of the statutory period, an assignee may be admitted to an action commenced by his assignor after the assignment but before the statute has run.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Here, Blake\u2019s intervention introduced no new cause of action but facilitated a terminal ruling on the old.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Fox-Greenwald\u2019s suit against Markowitz, we hold, arrested the statute, not only for itself, but upon Blake\u2019s intervention for the benefit of the latter as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">We conclude, then, that the assignment to Blake was valid and effective against Fox-Greenwald, that the statute of limitations did not proscribe Blake\u2019s access to it, and that Blake\u2019s claim on the balance of the fund deposited in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>registry of the District Court has priority over the Government\u2019s.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> We accordingly reverse the judgment appealed from, and remand the case to the District Court for distribution of the fund consistently with this opinion.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1406-13\">.

Section 6321 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321 (1958), imposed \u201ca lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to\u201d the delinquent taxpayer. Section 6322 of the Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6322 (1958), provided generally that the lien \u201cshall arise at the time the assessment is made. * * * \u201d However, Section 6323(a), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(a) (1958), specified that the lien \u201cshall not be valid as against\u201d certain classes of persons until notice thereof was filed. See United States v. Leventhal, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 340, 342, 316 F.2d 341, 343 (1963).

As we have pointed out, <em>supra </em>note 15, Blake\u2019s loan and Fox-Greenwald\u2019s assignment antedated the assessments of the taxes and the filing of the liens.

The Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws \u00a7 196 (1971), declares that \u201c[t]he validity of a contract for the rendition of services and the rights created thereby are determined, in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties, by the local law of the state where the contract requires that the services, or a major portion of the services, be rendered, unless, with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship * * * to the transaction and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state will be applied.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b1413-6\">. The contract price for the sheet metal work to be done by Fox-Greenwald was $1,050,000, and the record indicates that Fox-Greenwald engaged in performance over a period of about a year before Markowitz terminated the contract. As stated in the Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws \u00a7 196, comment 6 (1971), \u201c[t]he importance in the choice-of-law process of the place where the services, or a major portion of the services, are to be rendered depends somewhat upon the nature of the services involved. This place enjoys greater significance when the work is to be more or less stationary and is to extend over a considerable period of time. This is true of a contract for employment on the ordinary labor force of a particular factory or of a contract with an independent contractor who will provide labor on a construction project.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b1413-7\">. \u201cSeveral factors serve to explain the importance attributed by the rule to the place where the contract requires services, or a major portion of the services, be rendered. The rendition of the services is the principal objective of the contract, and the place where the services, or a major portion of the services, are to be rendered will naturally loom large in the minds of the parties. Indeed, it can often be assumed that the parties, to the extent that they thought about the matter at all, would expect that the local law of the state where the services, or a major portion of the services, are to be rendered, would be applied to determine many of the issues arising under the contract. The state where the services are to be rendered will also have a natural interest in them and indeed may have an overriding interest in the application to them of certain of its regulatory rules. The rule of [Section 196] also furthers the choice-of-law values of certainty, predictability and uniformity of result and, since the place where the contract requires that the services, or a major portion of the services, are to be rendered will be readily ascertainable, of ease in the determination of the applicable law.\u201d Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws \u00a7 196 comment c (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b1413-10\">. <em>E. g., </em>Bimestefer v.

The note bore Fox-Greenwald\u2019s corporate seal but did not indicate, by recital or otherwise, that the execution of a sealed instrument was intended.

The record does not reveal whether Markowitz\u2019 obligation to pay Fox-Greenwald for the sheet metal work was embodied in a sealed contract, which would invoke the 12-year limitation. See text <em>supra </em>at note 66. Since in either event our conclusion would be the same, we act on the assumption that it did not. And since an assignee stands in the shoes of his assignor, deriving the same but no greater rights and remedies than the assignor then possessed, see, e. <em>g., </em>3 S.Williston, Contracts, \u00a7 432 (3d ed. 1960) ; Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 167(1) (1932), the statute of limitations continues to run against the assignee as it had against the assignor before.

We hasten to add, however, that even if this were not so Blake\u2019s right to enforce Markowitz\u2019 liability on the assigned obligations would not be impaired.
