William Richard Meek, a Private in the United States Army, brought a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, seeking release from the custody of the Army. In this petition Meek alleged that he had been unlawfully denied a conscientious objector discharge because the Army had failed to properly process his application for this discharge. In denying the petition on jurisdictional grounds, the district court concluded that Meek was not \u201cin custody\u201d within the Eastern District of Pennsylvania at the time that suit was brought. For the reasons stated below, we disagree with this conclusion and find that there was jurisdiction in the district court to consider Meek\u2019s claim for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-20\">Meek was inducted into the United States Army on June 20, 1969. After completing basic and advanced training, he was assigned to the Overseas Replacement Station, Fort Lewis, Washington. The petition avers that at this point petitioner\u2019s feelings against violence and the use of force crystalized into a fixed belief and, as a result, in January 1970 he applied for discharge as a conscientious objector pursuant to Army Regulation 635-20.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This application was denied on March 18, 1970. On April 13,1970, Meek submitted a second application for discharge in which he challenged the denial of the first application on the grounds that he had not received fair interviews from the chaplain and the hearing officer. In connection with this second application, Meek was interviewed by a chaplain, a hearing officer, and his unit commander, all of whom recommended that his second application be approved. On June 16, 1970, however, Meek\u2019s commanding officer returned this second application and refused to process it further.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-21\">At this point Meek determined to take the matter out of the hands of the Army. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>On June 19, 1970, allegedly fearing immediate shipment overseas, Meek went absent without leave from his duty station at Fort Lewis, Washington. On June 24, 1970, while he was still absent without leave, his attorneys filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a motion for a temporary restraining order in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. The motion for a temporary restraining order was denied after a hearing, and petitioner did not prosecute that suit for a writ of habeas corpus any further.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Meek, however, was still absent without leave from the Army and he remained so until August 5, 1970. On that date he voluntarily surrendered himself to the military authorities at Valley Forge General Hospital, Phoenixville, Pa. Also on August 5, 1970, Meek\u2019s attorneys filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a motion for a temporary restraining order in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The motion for a temporary restraining order was granted by the district court on August 5, 1970, pending a hearing on the merits on August 19, 1970. After this hearing and the filing of briefs by the parties, however, the district court denied the writ on the ground that it had no jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a) because petitioner was not \u201cin custody\u201d within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. The district court concluded that under the relevant Army regulations the commanding officer at the Valley Forge General Hospital had no authority to accept \u201ccustody\u201d of petitioner when he turned himself in on August 5, 1970; instead, the Army regulations were interpreted to place Meek under the command of the commanding officer of Fort George G. Meade, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">The terms under which a writ of habeas corpus may be issued are controlled by federal statute. Section 2241 (c) (1) of Title 28, U.S.C., provides that the writ may be extended to \u201ca prisoner\u201d who is \u201cin custody under or by color of the authority of the United States.\u201d Thus, in any petition for habeas corpus, the court is confronted with a threshold question whether the petitioner is \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of establishing the subject matter jurisdiction of the court. It is clear, however, that a member of the armed services who is unlawfully detained, restrained or confined in the service is \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) (l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore we conclude that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction of the petition filed by Meek on August 5, 1970.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>The provision of section 2241(a) limiting the power of a federal court to grant the writ of habeas corpus to cases \u201cwithin their respective jurisdictions\u201d necessitates consideration of these two issues: whether there existed jurisdiction over the person of the petitioner and whether there existed jurisdiction over the person of petitioner\u2019s custodian. The first issue was discussed explicitly in Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U.S. 188, 68 S.Ct. 1443, 92 L.Ed. 1898 (1948), in which the Supreme Court held that as a prerequisite to a court\u2019s jurisdiction to issue a habeas writ the petitioner must be confined or detained within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. In the instant case, the district court reasoned that Meek was not in custody within the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, notwithstanding the fact that at the time that suit was brought he had turned himself in and was physically confined at an Army installation located in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because the officer having ultimate administrative responsibility for his disposition was in Maryland.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"> In <em>Ahrens </em>the Court held that the District Court for the District of Columbia had no jurisdiction to consider the application of persons detained at Ellis Island, New York,-even though they were held by order of the Attorney General, who was amenable to service in the District of Columbia. The Court reasoned that it \u201cwould take compelling reasons to conclude that Congress contemplated the production of prisoners from remote sections, perhaps thousands of miles from the district court that issued the writ\u201d;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the \u201copportunities for escape afforded by travel, the cost of transportation, the administrative burden of such an undertaking negate such a purpose\u201d ; <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and finally that the jurisdictional limitation was originally included in the Act of 1867 to allay fears that the habeas statute would allow a \u201cdistrict judge in Florida to bring before him some men convicted and sentenced and held under imprisonment in the State of Vermont or in any of the further States.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the time that his petition was filed, Meek was physically confined within the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If his actual presence at the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>trict court hearing was required,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> he did not have to be transported many miles into another jurisdiction, with the attendant costs and opportunities for escape. We conclude, therefore, that the district court had jurisdiction of the person of the petitioner within the terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We also find that the district court had personal jurisdiction over the \u201ccustodian,\u201d since the Commanding Officer of the Valley Forge General Hospital was within the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.S. 487, 91 S.Ct. 995, 28 L.Ed.2d 251 (1971), an Air Force enlisted man assigned to Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, was given permissive temporary duty to attend Arizona State University for study. Shortly before his graduation and while he was still in Arizona, he filed an application for habeas corpus in Arizona. The Court held that the Arizona District Court had no jurisdiction over the habeas petition because, while his custodian \u2014 the Commander of Moody Air Force Base \u2014 was a respondent in the action, he was not subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Court appears to have considered a controlling question to be whether a respondent such as the Commanding Officer at the Valley Forge Hospital was \u201cin the chain of command.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Accepting this as an appropriate standard in the circumstances of this case, we find that under the applicable Army Regulations, the Commanding Officer of the Valley Forge General Hospital was in petitioner\u2019s chain of command at the time that the application for the writ of habeas corpus was made on August 5, 1970,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that, therefore, a proper custodian was within the territorial jurisdiction of the court when the petition for habeas corpus was filed on August 5, 1970.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the district court had jurisdiction of Meek\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We therefore remand the case to the district court to consider whether petitioner\u2019s conduct and the factual situation render it appropriate for the district court to grant him the relief he seeks and, if so, whether petitioner is entitled to relief on the merits. We express no opinion on the above-mentioned matters, since they are not now directly before us. We note, however, that the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus by the federal courts is governed by equitable principles and that a petitioner\u2019s conduct may disentitle him to the relief he seeks. See Sanders v. United States, 378 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963); Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 438, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963); <em>cf. </em>Johnson v. Laird, 432 F.2d 77, 79 (9th Cir. 1970).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">One final issue remains. In his original pleading filed with the court below on August 5,1970, Meek made an alternative claim for a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to accept and process his second application for a conscientious objector discharge pursuant to the provisions of DOD 1300.6 and AR 635-20. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>Jurisdiction was alleged to exist under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The district court made no mention of this claim. Although the parties have presented arguments on the jurisdictional<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and substantive<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> issues involved in this claim, we do not consider it appropriate at this time to express an opinion. The matter can be fully explored and decided in the first instance by the district court on remand if the claim becomes relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Accordingly, the district court. order filed September 15, 1970, will be vacated and set aside, and the case will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-16\">. This Army, Regulation was promulgated pursuant to a Defense Department directive (DOD No. 1300.6) requiring each branch of the Armed Services to establish a procedure for dealing with conscientious objector discharge requests.

On August 24, 1970, the respondents in the Washington action filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. On September 8, 1970, the petitioner filed a motion to withdraw the action without prejudice. On September 11, 1970, this motion was granted by the District Court for the Western District of Washington. It does not appear, however, that the Pennsylvania district court was aware of these facts at the time that its Memorandum and Order was filed on September 15, 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Schlanger v.

When Meek surrendered to the military authorities at Valley Forge General Hospital on August 5, 1970, the Hospital Judge Advocate, Michael Briggs, acknowledged his surrender and he was Confined at the Office of the Provost Marshal there. Sometime later, Meek was transferred to the brig at the Philadelphia Naval Base, where he was confined until September 16, 1970, the day after the district court had dismissed his petition, when he was transferred to Fort Meade, Maryland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b819-18\">. The district court relied upon an Army Regulation (AR 630-10, \u00a7 51) and three First Army Regulations (1A Reg. 11-6, Appendices A, B, Map #A-17; 1A Reg. 190-2, \u00a7 25; 1A Reg. 190-5, \u00a7 6). But see AR 630-10, \u00a7 52, note 15, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b819-19\">. 335 U.S. at 191, 68 S.Ct. at 1444.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b819-20\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b819-21\">. 335 U.S. at 192, 68 S.Ct. at 1445.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b819-22\">. On September 16, 1970, the day after the district court dismissed his petition, Meek was physically transferred to Fort Meade, Maryland, and placed under the authority of its Commanding Officer. This transfer, however, does not deprive this court of jurisdiction over the appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Appellate Procedure; Ex Parte Endo, 323 U.S. 283, 65 S.Ct. 208, 89 L.Ed. 243 (1944). The matter is not entirely free from doubt inasmuch as it is not clear that a suitable respondent with custody remained in this jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 243-244, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963); <em>see also </em>Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U.S. 188, 193, 68 S.Ct. 1443, 92 L.Ed. 1898 (1948). However, Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure makes it clear that the transfer of petitioner to another\u2019s custody may not be a means of depriving the court of jurisdiction once it has attached. <em>See </em>Hudson v. Hardy, 137 U.S,App.D.C. 366, 424 F.2d 854, 856 n. 5 (1970); <em>cf. </em>United States ex rel. Meadows v. State of N.

Most courts have reached the same result on similar facts. <em>See e. g. </em>Davish v. Commanding Officer, Civ.Action No. 7CM:97 (E.D.Pa., Aug. 21, 1970) (Marine who had gone AWOL from Camp Pendleton and turned himself in to the Naval Station in Philadelphia); United States ex rel. Crane v. Laird, 315 F.Supp. 837 (D.Or.1970) (Army enlisted man assigned to the Overseas Replacement Station, Oakland, Cal., who was AWOL and turned himself in to civilian authorities at his home in Eugene, Oregon). <em>But see </em>Morales Crespo v. Perrin, 309 F.Supp. 203 (D.P.R.1970) (Army enlisted man assigned to Oakland, Cal., who was AWOL and turned himself in to military authorities at his home in Puerto Rico).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Respondents rely upon the decisions in United States ex rel. Rudick v. Laird, 412 F.2d 16 (2d Cir. 1969), and Jarrett v. Resor, 426 F.2d 213 (9th Cir. 1970). These cases are, however, distinguishable on their facts, since both involved habeas petitions submitted by soldiers while on authorized leave between duty stations, rather than petitions filed by AWOL soldiers who had turned themselves in to military authorities. In the former case the soldiers arguably are not in custody within the court\u2019s jurisdiction, since they were free to depart during the period of their leave. <em>But see </em>United States ex rel. Lohmeyer v. Laird, 318 F.Supp. 94 (D.Mary.1970). But Meek was not free to leave the Valley Forge General Hospital after he had turned himself in to the military authorities there on August 5, 1970. He was apparently in actual physical custody and if he had left he might have been charged with the offense of breach of arrest or escape from custody (see Article 95, Uniform Code of Military Justice) or been considered absent without leave (see Article 86, Uniform Code of Military Justice).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b820-12\">. <em>See </em>401 U.S. at 487-489, 91 S.Ct. 995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b821-5\">.

See note 11, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b821-11\">. In <em>Sanders </em>the Court made it clear that a federal court may refuse to consider the merits of a second or successive application for the writ of habeas corpus if the petitioner\u2019s conduct has. amounted to \u201can abuse of the writ,\u201d notwithstanding the fact that the grounds presented in the earlier writ were not adjudicated on the merits. See 373 U.S. at 17-18, 83 S.Ct. 1068. The Court also stated that the federal trial judge has the primary responsibility in this area:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-12\">\u201cThe principles governing * * * justifications for denial of a -hearing on a successive application are addressed to the sound discretion of the federal trial judges.

Noia, <em>supra, </em>the principle of comity may also apply, to foreclose habeas corpus relief in a federal district court to a petitioner who has been denied preliminary relief in a habeas corpus action which is pending in another federal district court. <em>See </em>Birnbaum v.

S. District Court for the Western District of Washington presumably advised him of all the consequences of instituting suit there, principles of equitable election may have some application to Meek\u2019s subsequent attempt to sue in Pennsylvania, with the resultant waste in judicial time.
