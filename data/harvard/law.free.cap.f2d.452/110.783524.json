It was stipulated that the mortgagor had a reputation of at least five years\u2019 duration for dealing in nontaxpaid liquor, that this reputation was known to the A.B.C. Law Enforcement Office for the county of mortgagor\u2019s residence, that the reputation was not known to Treasury agents having jurisdiction, and that the reputation was not known to the County Sheriff\u2019s office but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>an inquiry to it would have been referred to the A.B.C. Law Enforcement Office. It was further stipulated that Graham, before becoming mortgagee, made no inquiries of any law enforcement office with respect to the record or reputation of the mortgagor, in compliance with 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3617(b).<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">For noncompliance with 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3617(b), the district court denied Graham\u2019s claim, and ordered forfeiture of the vehicle.
