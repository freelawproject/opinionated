F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1641.3, 1642.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-14\">On appeal, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to demonstrate guilty intent. The evidence was ample. Appell\u00e1nt registered with his local board in January, 1966, listing his parents\u2019 address as his own. He never notified his draft board of a change in his address. His board sent him a delinquency notice and an induction order in December, 1967, but neither reached him. In response to board inquiries his mother said: \u201cHe left home last year and I have no idea where he is. I have not heard from him in at least a year.\u201d Appellant\u2019s duty to keep his local board informed of his whereabouts was conspicuously set forth on his draft card and on a classification questionnaire he completed in February, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-15\">Appellant also contends that the evidence does not support a finding that he committed the offense within the time period covered by the terms of the indictment. The indictment charged appellant with failure to notify the board of address changes from January 17, 1968, to July, 1970. The board sent nothing to him during that period, apparently because its attempts to reach him in December, 1967, had been futile. Appellant\u2019s duty, however, was a continuing one and his dereliction continued into the specified period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-16\">Appellant argues additionally that his board failed to follow a regulation requiring it to attempt to locate a delinquent registrant before turning his name over to the United States Attorney. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1642.41(b). The board did send letters of inquiry to every person whom Buckley had listed as a relative or person who would know his whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
