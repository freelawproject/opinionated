Services performed by an attorney in connection with a lawsuit do not constitute action under color of state law. Dyer v. Rosenberg, 434 F.2d 648 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-30\"> As to the remaining claims, the finding of the District Court that appellant was a citizen of California was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, diversity of citizenship did not exist. Nor was it error to refuse to defer determination until the issue could be submitted to a jury. The trial court has discretion to determine the jurisdictional facts itself. Har-Pen Truck Lines, Inc. v. Mills, 378 F.2d 705 (5th Cir. 1967); Seideman v. Hamilton, 275 F.2d 224 (3d Cir. 1960). <em>See </em>Gilbert v. David, 235 U.S. 561, 568, 35 S.Ct. 164, 59 L.Ed. 360 (1915). <em>See also, </em>5 J. Moore, Federal Practice fl 38.36 (1971). We find no abuse of discretion under the facts of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-31\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
