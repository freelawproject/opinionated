The commissioner has done so in an opinion and report filed on May 17, 1971. Exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report were filed by plaintiff and the case has been submitted to the court on oral argument of counsel and the briefs of the parties. Since the court is in agreement with the opinion, findings and recommendation of the trial commissioner, with minor modifications, it hereby adopts the same, as modified, as the basis for its judgment in this case as hereinafter set forth. Therefore, plaintiff is not entitled to recover and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-17\">Commissioner Gamer\u2019s opinion, with minor modifications by the court, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-18\">Plaintiff sues to recover alleged over-payments on her individual income taxes for the years 1959 and 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-19\">During such years plaintiff was an apartment tenant stockholder in a New York corporation (the 120 East 81st Street Corporation) which she contends was a \u201ccooperative housing corporation\u201d as defined in Section 216(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 216 (1964)). As such a stockholder, plaintiff would enjoy certain tax advantages, <em>i. e., </em>in the computation of her in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>dividual income tax, she would be allowed as a deduction amounts paid to the cooperative to the extent that such amounts represented her proportionate share (based on the total shares outstanding) of the real estate taxes and mortgage interest allowable as a deduction to the cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Under Section 216(b) (1) (D), however, a corporation can gain status as a \u201ccooperative housing corporation\u201d only if at least 80 percent of its gross income (for the taxable year for which the tenant-stockholder claims the real estate and interest deductions) is derived from tenant-stockholders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that, for the years in question, the cooperative in which plaintiff was a tenant-stockholder did not so qualify, the deductions which plaintiff took for her pro rata portion of the mortgage interest and real estate taxes paid by the cooperative during such years were disallowed. Plaintiff here sues to recover the increased taxes she was obliged to pay as a result of such disallowances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-24\">In determining that 80 percent of the cooperative\u2019s gross income was not derived from its tenant-stockholders, the Commissioner treated three items in a manner which plaintiff contests. Had these items been treated as plaintiff contends they should have been, the cooperative would have met the 80-percent requirement. The three items are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-25\">1. Each tenant was required to sign a \u201cproprietary lease.\u201d This lease entitled the tenant to live in a specified apartment. In addition, the lease set forth, in certain respects, the manner in which the cooperative would be operated and the rent for the apartment would be determined. The annual rent (commonly referred to as \u201cassessments\u201d on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>tenant-stockholders) was to be calculated as the tenant\u2019s proportionate share of the aggregate amount of the cooperative\u2019s \u201ccash requirements\u201d for the year, including mortgage interest and amortization payments. The lease then provided :</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Any sums which the Lessee may pay hereunder which are allocated, used or to be used to meet cash requirements of the Lessor for mortgage amortization payments, or any other mortgage principal payments or for capital improvements or any other capital expenditure, shall not be deemed income to the Lessor but shall be credited by the Lessor upon its books as \u201cPaid in Surplus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">The 1959 and 1960 rental payments made by the tenant-stockholders totaled $400,000.08 for each year. In 1959, the cooperative paid $93,588.33 for reduction of the principal on its mortgage, and $97,871.41 for such purpose in 1960. The cooperative also credited equivalent amounts for such years to its \u201cPaid-in Surplus\u201d account and excluded such sums from its income accounts. Its corporate income tax returns similarly excluded these sums from gross income. The Commissioner did not object to these exclusions and there was and is no controversy between the cooperative and defendant with respect to these returns.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">In making his determination that during both 1959 and 1960, the cooperative did not meet the requirements of Section 216(b) that 80 percent or more of its gross income be derived from tenant-stockholders, the Commissioner similarly excluded from the cooperative\u2019s gross income from tenant-stockholders sums equal to the mortgage amortization payments made by the cooperative, these amounts being the same as the cooperative had credited on its books as \u201cPaid-in Surplus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">Plaintiff challenges this exclusion by the Commissioner. She contends that the full amount received by the cooperative each year from its tenant-stockholders should be treated as income. Such treatment would, of course, result in a higher figure for the \u201cgross income *- * * derived from tenant-stockholders\u201d referred to in Section 216(b) (1) (D), and thus help it to meet the 80-per-cent requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-11\">2. In 1957, a New York corporation, the 1186 Lex Corporation, was in the process of constructing the apartment building here involved. The president and one-third stockholder of this corporation was Mr. Nourollah Elghanayan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-12\">The cooperative was organized on June 13, 1957, by the Lex Corporation for the specific purpose of having the cooperative purchase the land and apartment house being constructed thereon (the Lex Corporation sometimes being referred to by the parties as the \u201csponsor\u201d of the housing project), and on July 1, 1957, by a Plan of Organization and a Seller\u2019s Agreement, the cooperative, subject to various terms and conditions, agreed to purchase the land and completed building for $4,875,000. The cooperative had an authorized capital stock of 40,000 shares, all of which were allocated to the apartments in the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-13\">The Plan provided that, upon its consummation <em>(i. e., </em>at the time of the closing, which was to take place promptly after the completion of the building), all of the 40,000 shares would be fully paid for by stockholders who would lease the apartments. The sale of all of such stock (by the leasing of the apartments) would permit the cooperative, at such closing time, to take over the property with no debts or obligations except for a permanent mortgage in the principal amount of $2,600,000. Thus, the leasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>of all of the apartments and the sale of the stock allocated to such leases were prerequisites to the enabling of the cooperative to take over the property at the purchase price, the proceeds of the sale of all the stock producing the difference between the purchase price and the amount of the permanent mortgage. As assurance to the cooperative-purchaser that, at the time of the closing, all of such stock would be sold, the Plan provided that if, at such time, all of the stock had not been sold (to proprietary lessees), the Lex Corporation would provide \u201cindividual purchasers for such unsold stock and they will enter into proprietary leases for the apartments to which such shares are allocated * * <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Seller\u2019s Agreement similarly provided.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">At the closing date of September 22, 1958, 21 apartments remained unleased, and the Lex Corporation provided Elghanayan as the purchaser of the shares allocated to such apartments. As such purchaser, he executed 21 separate leases for the apartments, and the shares allocated thereto were all registered in his name. The value of such shares was credited against the purchase price paid by the cooperative for the building.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">For the years 1959 and 1960, the Commissioner excluded from the gross rentals which the cooperative received from its tenant-stockholders the rental amounts with respect to the apartments carried in the name of Elghanayan\u2014 $15,962.64 for 1959, and $3,200.04 for I960.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commissioner did not feel that such payments could properly be considered as rental income from bona fide \u201ctenant-stockholders.\u201d Such figures were instead added to the cooperative\u2019s other income. These reductions in the \u201cgross income derived from tenant-stockholders\u201d figures and additions to the cooperative\u2019s \u201cother income\u201d figures for such years further contributed to the imbalance between them and the prevention of the former figures reaching 80 percent of the cooperative\u2019s gross income. Plaintiff, of course, contends that the Commissioner erred in not considering such rental payments from Elghanayan to be properly includable as rental income from \u201ctenant-stockholders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-14\">For many years after the enactment of Section 23'(z) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which was the forerunner of Section 216 of the 1954 Code, many persons associated with cooperative housing projects in New York State adopted the practice under which the sponsor corporation was required to provide individuals to execute, as lessees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>proprietary leases on all apartments unsold as of the date of closing title and to purchase the shares allocated to such apartments, with the sponsor guaranteeing that such persons would pay the required rentals. Such individuals were referred to as being \u201cnominated\u201d by the sponsor to carry out such obligations of purchasing the shares, executing the leases and paying the rentals until the stock was resold as an incident of a transfer of the lease. It was pursuant to such practice and the aforementioned provisions of the Plan and Seller\u2019s Agreement that Elghanayan was \u201cnominated\u201d as the purchaser of the unsold shares. In disallowing the Elghanayan rental payments as receipts from \u201ctenant-stockholders,\u201d the Internal Revenue Service referred to him as the \u201cNominee of 1186 Lex Corporation,\u201d and the parties here frequently refer to this issue as \u201cthe Elghanayan \u2018Nominee\u2019 Issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABT\">3. The apartment building also contained some commercial space, consisting of a garage and stores. The agreement between the Lex Corporation and the cooperative for the sale of the property provided that, at the time of closing title, the Lex Corporation would deliver to the cooperative leases, of at least three years\u2019 duration, of such commercial space which would \u201cprovide for an average <em>aggregate </em>rental of not less than $80,000 per annum over the three year period or a total of not less than $240,000 over said three year period.\u201d The agreement further provided that, if such leases were not provided at the time of closing, the Lex Corporation would, for three years thereafter, pay to the cooperative \u201cthe difference between the average annual rentals provided in such leases and $80,000 * * <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">During each of the years 1959 and 1960, the commercial income failed to reach the $80,000 guaranteed amount. In 1959, the Lex Corporation paid the cooperative $14,675 to fulfill its guarantee obligation, and in 1960 similarly paid $2,587.50. The cooperative treated such payments as commercial rental income, the amounts being described in its accounts as \u201cMinimum average rental guarantee of Sellers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">In calculating the income from sources other than tenant-stockholders, the Commissioner similarly included these amounts as commercial rental income. However, as with the mortgage amortization issue, plaintiff says that both the cooperative and the Commissioner erred. She argues that such amounts should not properly be regarded as \u201crent\u201d since the Lex Corporation was not a lessee of any commercial space. It was, she maintains, only the seller of real property and, as such, the payments made by it under its guarantee should be regarded as an adjustment of the selling price. Accordingly, she argues that such amounts should not be regarded as any kind of \u201cincome\u201d at all to the cooperative. The removal thereof from the amounts received by the cooperative as income from sources other than tenant-stockholders, with the consequent lowering of such figure, would make it easier for the amount of income received from tenant-stockholders to meet the 80-per-cent requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">\n<em>The Mortgage Amortization Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">Plaintiff argues that the full amount of the moneys received by the cooperative from the tenant-stockholders out to be treated as \u201cincome\u201d to the cooperative because, regardless of the ultimate application of any part of such moneys, they are all first \u201creceived\u201d by the cooperative, and thereby necessarily become part of its \u201cgross receipts.\u201d Plaintiff adduced expert accounting testimony to the effect that under generally accepted accounting principles, all receipts by a corporation should be entered into its \u201cgross receipts\u201d account despite the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>that one of the debts to be paid therefrom is mortgage principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Although such accounting principles might well be applicable as a general proposition, the particular situation and facts must control.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The fact is that in this instance plaintiff\u2019s general proposition would directly contravene the terms of her proprietary lease. In that instrument, she specifically agreed, as a lessee-stockholder, that such portions of her rental payments \u201callocated\u201d or \u201cused\u201d to meet the mortgage amortization requirements of the lessor-cooperative \u201cshall not be deemed income to the lessor\u201d and, instead, \u201cshall be credited by the lessor upon its books as \u2018Paid in Surplus.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">Considering the purpose of this lease provision and of the cooperative itself, no impropriety is shown in the manner in which the amortization payments were treated. Defendant is making no attempt to upset the provision as a tax avoidance scheme or otherwise. Even in the case of an ordinary corporation, there is no reason why it and one of its stockholders cannot validly agree that a payment or a part of a payment made by the stockholder to the corporation should be used only for the specific, designated purpose of a capital contribution, and therefore not be treated as general income funds of the corporation. Paducah &amp; Illinois R.R., 2 B.T.A. 1001 (1925). Whether payments are excludable from ordinary income as contributions to capital depends, as shown by the facts of the individual case, upon the intent of the parties and \u201c[t]he substance of the whole transaction * * James Hotel Co., 39 T.C. 135, 141 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">The cooperative itself strictly abided by its lease agreement. It did not regard such amounts as \u201cincome\u201d and credited them on its books as additional paid-in capital. It did not report the amounts as \u201cincome\u201d on its income tax returns and the Commissioner did not object \u2014 despite the fact that for 1959 the inclusion of such amount as corporate income would result in the corporation\u2019s showing a taxable profit rather than a loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">Under the doctrine of Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Danielson, 378 F.2d 771 (3rd Cir.), cert denied, 389 U.S. 858, 88. S.Ct. 94, 19 L.Ed.2d 123 (1967), the Internal Revenue Service has the right to accept at face value, if it wishes, the parties\u2019 contractual provisions with respect to characterization of items, unless the taxpayer attacking the contractual provision (for tax purposes) shows that it is unenforceable between the parties because of mistake, undue influence, fraud, duress, etc. No such proof has been made here and there is no reason to disavow the plaintiff\u2019s specific agreement in her proprietary lease as to the characterization of the amortization allocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">Moreover, the existing law supports the contractual characterization. In 874 Park Avenue Corp., 23 B.T.A. 400 (1931), the facts were substantially similar. There, however, it was the Commissioner who attempted to have the portion of the tenant-stockholders\u2019 assessments used for the amortization of the housing cooperative\u2019s mortgage indebtedness included in the cooperative\u2019s taxable gross income on the same grounds that plaintiff asserts here, <em>i, e., </em>that such portion should be treated as part of the total rent received from the tenants for the operation of the building. The Board of Tax Appeals rejected the attempt. The proprietary leases there involved contained a provision that \u201cso much of such [rent] assessments collected by the Lessor as shall be devoted to the payment of the principal of a mortgage or mortgages or to other capital expenditure shall be credited by the Lessor upon its books to the account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>\u2018paid-in surplus.\u2019 \u201d (at 407) The cooperative did in fact so use such payments for mortgage amortization purposes, did not include such amounts in its income statements, and added them to its capital account. Although such lease language is less explicit than that here involved because it does not contain the specific provision that such portion of the rental payments \u201cshall not be deemed income to the Lessor,\u201d the Board nevertheless held that \u201cthe assessments so made and employed were contributions of capital to the [cooperative] and as such nontaxable.\u201d (at 405) The Board analogized the situation to its previous holding in <em>Paducah &amp; Illinois R.R., supra, </em>where two railroads organized a third corporation to provide bridge facilities. A contract between the railroads and the bridge company provided that the railroads, as the sole stockholders, would pay the expenses of the bridge company and would make contributions to a sinking fund for the retirement of the company\u2019s bonds. The payments made by the railroads were earmarked partly for the bridge company\u2019s ordinary expense's and partly for the capital contributions. The Board held that insofar as the payments were to be used (and were actually used) for the bridge company\u2019s ordinary expenses, the railroads were paying for services rendered, which payments constituted expenses to themselves and income to the bridge company, but to the extent that the contract required the payments to be used for debt retirement, they constituted capital contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">In Cambridge Apartment Building Corp., 44 B.T.A. 617 (1941), where the Commissioner assessed deficiencies against a housing corporation on the theory that the part of the assessments collected from the tenant-stockholders for the purpose of retiring bonded indebtedness constituted income to the corporation, the Board, relying on the <em>Paducah </em>and <em>87 U Park Avenue </em>cases, again held that such amounts paid by the tenant-stockholders did not constitute income to the corporation. And in Lake Forest, Inc., 22 TCM 156 (1963), which involved the question of whether a housing cooperative could both exclude from income mortgage amortization payments made by its tenant-stockholders and take depreciation deductions, the court again reaffirmed <em>87U Park Avenme Corp., Cambridge Apartment Building Corp., </em>and <em>Paducah &amp; Illinois R.R. </em>In rejecting the Government\u2019s argument that, since the tenant-stockholders were only tenants and not the owners of the building, all payments made by them should be treated as rent for the use of the cooperative-landlord\u2019s property and be included in taxable gross income of the corporation, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">It seems clear that if petitioner\u2019s members had contributed the entire purchase price at the time petitioner bought the property * * * then petitioner could both exclude the contributions from income and deduct depreciation on the depreciable property purchased with such contributions. We fail to see a significant difference where petitioner\u2019s members made their capital contributions in installments instead of all at once. <em>Id. </em>at 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">The holdings in <em>874 Park Avenue Corp., Cambridge Apartment Building Corp., </em>and <em>Lake Forest, Inc., </em>in effect affirmed a ruling of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, promulgated as long ago as 1922, the amounts paid by tenant-stockholders under proprietary leases which were to be used for mortgage amortization and credited to paid-in surplus were contributions to capital and did not constitute income to the corporation. The ruling stated</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">* * * that that portion of the assessment payments credited to the \u201cpaid-in surplus\u201d account and devoted to the reduction of the corporation\u2019s mortgage indebtedness or for other capital purposes is in the nature of a voluntary assessment upon the stock held by the individual proprietary lessees, which * * * represents additional cost of such stock, and does not constitute income to the corporation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>I.T. 1469, 1-2 Cum.Bull. 191, 192 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Section 118(a) of the 1954 Code (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 118(a) (1964) ) specifically provides that \u201c[i]n the case of a corporation, gross income does not include any contribution to the capital of the taxpayer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">Plaintiff points to the provision in her lease which includes \u201cmortgage amortization payments\u201d in the various \u201cexpenses\u201d of the cooperative which may be included in its \u201ccash requirements\u201d for the purpose of the annual computations to be made by the cooperative\u2019s board of directors of the amounts to be paid by the tenant-stockholders as rent. Therefore, says plaintiff, the full amount of such \u201crent\u201d must necessarily be considered as gross receipts of, and income to, the cooperative, even though a portion of it is used for mortgage principal payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">This contention fails to give consideration to the later explicit provision in the lease that the portion of the rental payments allocated or used to meet the mortgage amortization requirements is to receive special treatment. In <em>87k Park Avenue Corp. </em>the same contention was made, <em>i. e., </em>that because the mortgage amortization contributions were referred to as \u201crent\u201d in one part of the lease, \u201cthey were in fact payments of rent.\u201d 23 B.T.A. at 407. However, the Board held that \u201cthis contention is completely refuted, it seems to us, when the lease is read as a whole and the purpose \u2022 of the individual corporators of [the cooperative] in creating the corporation are taken into account.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">The fact that the cooperative kept the tenant-stockholders\u2019 payments in a single bank account from which both the general expenses and mortgage indebtedness were paid is of no significance. <em>874 Park Avenue Corp., id. </em>at 405. It is the \u201csubstance of the whole transaction\u201d (James Hotel Co., 39 T.C. at 141) that is determinative, not the bank account mechanics the cooperative employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">The income from the commercial space went into the same general bank account. Due to such commingling of funds and the consequent impossibility of tracing specific dollars, plaintiff urges that at the least the amortization payments made from such account should be deemed to have been composed of both the rent from the tenant-stockholders and from the commercial space, the amount from each calculated on a basis proportionate to their contributions to the total in the account. Plaintiff says there was nothing to prevent the use of the commercial income for any of the cooperative\u2019s needs, including principal payments on the mortgage. Thus, even if the portion of the rents from the tenant-stockholders used to make the amortization payments is excluded from the cooperative\u2019s gross income, the contribution to such payments from the commercial income would result in a lesser amount being contributed by the tenant-stockholders and excluded from such income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">This argument too lacks merit. The inability to trace specific dollars as between the commercial space rental income and the tenant-stockholders\u2019 rental payments, is unimportant, as is the fact that the board of directors of the cooperative did not provide for an actual segregation of the commercial receipts from the tenant-stockholders\u2019 assessments. On the facts there can be no question that, for the years here involved, the cooperative intended that only the tenant-stockholders\u2019 rental payments would constitute the source of the mortgage principal installments due, and that it therefore must be deemed to have \u201cused\u201d or \u201callocated\u201d such portion of their rents as was necessary to completely liquidate such installment indebtednesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">Just prior to the September 22, 1958 closing of title, the stockholders and directors, at a special meeting held on September 4, 1958, adopted a resolution that the amount to be paid by the cooperative \u201cand needed to make payments on account of or for amortization of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness * * is to be deemed a contribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>of capital and shall be added to the paid-in surplus of the Corporation * * It would be most unusual, indeed, for the commercial tenants to make a \u201ccontribution\u201d to the capital of the corporation. They would have no interest in so contributing. It is normally the stockholders who make \u201ccontributions\u201d to the capital of a corporation, for they would be the ones to benefit thereby. Unlike the tenant-stockholders\u2019 proprietary leases, the commercial leases made no mention of mortgage amortization. In view of the \u201ccontribution of capital\u201d language in the resolution, the only rational conclusion is that, for the years in question, the directors and stockholders considered these capital contributions as coming only from the tenant-stockholders. The cooperative\u2019s accounting statements for these years leave no room for doubt concerning this point. The statement for 1959 attributed the full amount of the mortgage principal installments paid in such year ($93,588.33) as having been \u201cappropriated\u201d from the \u201c[assessments on tenant-stockholders.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And the statement for 1960 similarly attributed the full amount of the mortgage amortization payments made during such year ($97,871.41) to the \u201c[p]ortion of assessments allocated\u201d for such purpose.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The balance sheets included in such statements show the identical full amounts which had been \u201cappropriated\u201d and \u201callocated\u201d for the amortization payments as \u201cAdditional paid-in capital\u201d under the caption \u201cStockholders\u2019 equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQL\">As further proof that the tenant-stockholders\u2019 assessments constituted the sole source of the mortgage amortization payments during such years is the fact that subsequent thereto, the board of directors, on August 30, 1961, adopted a resolution specifically providing that the portion of the assessments which would be allocated to the payment of mortgage principal during any period, would be the percentage which the total of the assessments bore to the total income of the cooperative for such period. This is the alternative formula which plaintiff urges should be adopted for the two years here involved. Plainly, however, the adoption of the resolution marked a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>change in the cooperative\u2019s policy. Such adoption followed a special meeting of the board held on August 8, 1961, attended also by the accountants, at which the question of the propriety of such a formula was considered.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s final argument is based upon the stipulated fact that during the two years here involved, the assessments paid by plaintiff \u201cwere not more than rental charges then obtaining for equivalent apartment space in non-cooperative rental buildings in that area of New York City.\u201d The contention is that the full value of services rendered by the corporation, including those rendered to its stockholders, must be deemed to constitute income, otherwise what plaintiff terms a \u201cbargain purchase\u201d situation results, causing an improper understatement of the cooperative\u2019s income. If the \u201cincome\u201d the cooperative derives from the tenant-stockholders is less than the fair rental value of their apartments, then, plaintiff argues, a distribution of income to the stockholders would, in effect, result. The difference between such lower amount and the actual fair market value therefore must, says plaintiff, constitute imputed income to the cooperative. By this reasoning, only amounts paid by the stockholders in excess of the fair market rental value of their apartments could be considered as contributions to capital. And plaintiff further points out that, while Section 1.118-1 of the Treasury Regulations on Income Tax (1954 Code) repeats the Code provision that contributions to the capital of a corporation are to be excluded from income, it specifically provides further that \u201cthe exclusion does not apply to any money or property transferred to the corporation in consideration for goods or services rendered * x- <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The entire amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>rent, plaintiff urges, must here be regarded as being paid \u201cin consideration for goods or services rendered\u201d because under the proprietary lease possession of the premises was conditioned upon the paying of such rent. Thus, \u201c[t]he entire rent was paid for services and the entire rent was necessarily income to the Corporation,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and this must be so, plaintiff argues, regardless of any labels that may have been applied to any portion of such rent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">Even though one of the purposes of a cooperative may be to furnish products or services to members at prices below those which nonmembers must pay for comparable products or services, no reason is apparent why even a cooperative could not run into the tax problems which are incident to the furnishing of products or services at prices below the cost of furnishing them or below \u201cfair market value,\u201d resulting in a distribution of income to the members and a depressing of the cooperative\u2019s taxable income. See Anaheim Union Water Co. v. Commissioner, 321 F.2d 253 (9th Cir. 1963). If they realize profits, cooperative corporations too must pay the regular corporation income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">However, even if the \u201crent\u201d of the tenant-stockholders is deemed not to include the portion allocated to mortgage amortization, so that, on a monthly basis, they are paying less than renters of comparable space in noncooperative buildings in the same area, it does not necessarily follow that on an overall basis they are the recipients of any \u201cbargain purchase.\u201d This is so because such a calculation gives no consideration to the fact that the tenant-stockholders were obliged to make a substantial purchase of stock for the privilege of living in the building, an investment which the tenants in the commercial apartment building were not obliged to make. Plaintiff paid $15,750 for the shares allocated to her apartment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There is here no showing that the amount of the \u201crent\u201d plaintiff paid, even if calculated at the reduced figure resulting from the elimination therefrom of the allocable mortgage amortization, but adding thereto the costs flowing from her stock purchase, did not equal \u201cfair market value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-16\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention thus necessarily falls because comparing her situation with renters of similar space in commercial buildings is improper. The correct comparison is, instead, with the homeowner. As the legislative history shows, the very purpose of Section 216 and its predecessor Section 23 (z) of the 1939 Code is to give tenant-stockholders of housing cooperatives the same tax deductions as are allowed to homeowners. S.Rep.No.1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. (1942-2 Cum.Bull. 504, 546) <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>lowance to tenant-stockholders of qualified housing cooperatives of deductions similar to those of homeowners, <em>i. e., </em>amounts equal to their proportionate share of mortgage interest and real estate taxes paid by the cooperative, is accomplished by in effect disregarding the corporate entity in this respect and \u201cpassing through\u201d these deductions to the tenant-stockholders, as if they were the \u201cowners.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">Accordingly, in analogizing plaintiff\u2019s situation, as the law does, to a homeowner, who also is normally required to make a substantial initial capital investment, considerations of \u201cbargain purchase\u201d \u2014 in the sense that plaintiff here uses the term of comparing amounts of monthly \u201crental\u201d payments with those of commercial apartment occupants \u2014 become inapplicable. On plaintiff\u2019s theory, when the time arrives that the mortgage will be liquidated and the \u201ccash requirements\u201d of the cooperative will therefore be reduced, the cooperative would nevertheless be obliged to continue to charge its tenant-stockholders \u201crent\u201d equal to the \u201cfair market value\u201d of equivalent space in commercial buildings, or to credit itself, as \u201cimputed income,\u201d with the difference between the reduced \u201crent\u201d charged its tenant-stockholders, and such \u201cfair market value.\u201d However, on the correct analogy to that of the homeowner, whose periodic payments of mortgage principal increase his equity in his property, the equity of a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation is similarly regarded as being increased when the cooperative\u2019s mortgage principal payments are made, which is clearly the rationale for the lease provision that such portion of the \u201crent\u201d which is \u201callocated\u201d or \u201cused\u201d for mortgage amortization purposes is to be considered as a capital payment, to be credited to \u201cpaid-in surplus,\u201d and not to \u201cincome.\u201d The homeowner too, after liquidating his mortgage, may be able, on a current monthly outlay basis, to live on his property less expensively than his neighbor who is renting similar premises \u2014 provided again that no consideration is given to his capital investment (and loss of interest thereon over the years).</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">Because of the special nature of the relationship between a cooperative housing corporation and its tenant-stockholders insofar as the tax statutes are concerned, the court in <em>Lake Forest, Inc. </em>did not feel that the decisions in cases of other types of membership cooperatives or corporations<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> involving the question of \u201cwhether certain payments by stockholders were contributions to capital or payments for services rendered or to be rendered * * * require a different decision in this case.\u201d 22 TCM at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">Based upon the above considerations, the refusal of the Commissioner to change the \u201cincome\u201d figure on the cooperative\u2019s 1959 and 1960 returns by add<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>ing thereto the amounts of the mortgage amortization payments, and considering such additions as \u201cincome\u201d from tenant-stockholders for application of the 80-percent rule, was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">\n<em>The Elghanayan Nominee Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s case for overturning the Commissioner\u2019s determination on this issue is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Section 216(b) of the Code defines a \u201ccooperative housing corporation\u201d as one in which \u201ceach of the stockholders * * * is entitled, solely by reason of his ownership of stock in the corporation, to occupy <em>for dwelling purposes </em>* * * an apartment in a building, owned * * * by such corporation * * (Emphasis supplied.) As noted, Section 216 first appeared as Section 23 (z) of the 1939 Code. It has remained substantially unchanged since its enactment. Section 23 (z) was added by a Senate amendment to the House bill (H.R. 7378, being the Revenue Act of 1942). The aforementioned Senate report on such bill explains, with respect to such section (constituting Section 129 of the Revenue Act) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-12\">The definitions of the terms \u201ccooperative apartment corporation\u201d and \u201ctenant-stockholder\u201d prescribe certain standards which are designed to safeguard the revenue by assuring that the apartment corporations involved are bona fide cooperative apartment corporations <em>and that the individuals entitled to deductions under section 28 (z) are bona fide tenant-stockholders of such </em>corporations<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-16\">The issue is thus whether Elghanayan was a bona fide tenant-stockholder of the housing cooperative who owned stock therein \u201cto occupy for dwelling purposes * * * an apartment\u201d at 120 East 81st Street, New York City. It is plain that Elghanayan was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-17\">The reason is that it is clear that Elghanayan was the nominee, not of an individual, but of a corporation, the selling company, while Section 216(b) (2) requires a tenant-stockholder to be an \u201cindividual.\u201d His taking over the 21 unsold apartments on the closing date, as the \u201cnominee\u201d of the seller-corporation, \u25a0 the buyer-cooperative not being given any amount for its stock by the individual Elghanayan, but instead being given, by the seller-corporation, credit against the purchase price for the full value of the stock allocated to such apartments, amounted in effect only to a price adjustment between the seller and buyer corporations. As \u201cnominee,\u201d Elghanayan was, clearly, only a figurehead for the selling corporation of which he was the president and a major stockholder, a device manifestly adopted, as plaintiff frankly admits, to effect seeming compliance with the requirement of Section 216(b) (2) that a \u201ctenant-stockholder\u201d be <em>\u201can individual </em>who is a stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.) It was the seller-corporation that took all deductions in its income tax returns for the proportionate share of the interest and taxes allocable to the 21 unsold apartments, and that reported all gains and losses on the later sales of the stock allocated to the apartments, although such sales were effected by agreements executed by Elghanayan personally.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>The emphasis upon the \u201cnominee\u201d device being a common practice in the New York area is apparently for the purpose of imposing something in the nature of an equitable estoppel against the Commissioner. Plaintiff feels that the Commissioner must have known what was going on over the years and, through his inaction in obtaining a judicial determination of the question, must be deemed to have accepted the practice as satisfying the requirements of Section 216 \u2014 until he suddenly acted otherwise in this case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">The contention has no merit. Even if the Commissioner had expressly ruled that the \u201cnominee\u201d practice, with respect to nominees of the selling corporation (which is all that is involved here), satisfied Section 216, he could nevertheless reverse himself if he later concluded otherwise, for \u201c[t]he doctrine of equitable estoppel is not a bar to the correction by the Commissioner of a mistake of law.\u201d Automobile Club of Michigan v. Commissioner, 353 U.S. 180, 183, 77 S.Ct. 707, 709, 1 L.Ed.2d 746 (1957). In this instance, however, the practice should not reasonably have been based upon a conclusion of Commissioner acceptance or acquiescence because in 1955, well prior to the events here involved, Revenue Ruling 55-316 announced that \u201c * * * individuals who hold * * * proprietary leases as nominees for [the] seller [corporation] do not qualify as tenant-stockholders since the beneficial ownership is in a corporation, which cannot so qualify under section 23 (z); * * 1955-1 Cum.Bull. 312, 315.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">\n<em>Moneys Received Under Seller\u2019s Commercial Rent Guarantee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-12\">Plaintiff has made no real showing, by testimony or otherwise, that, for the purpose of the 80-percent rule, the Commissioner erred in classifying these funds as \u201ccommercial rental income.\u201d As with the mortgage amortization moneys, the Commissioner here too was simply accepting the designation which had been applied to the funds by plaintiff\u2019s own cooperative (and its certified public accountants).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention is that the seller-corporation was \u201cnot a tenant\u201d; that \u201cit received neither space nor services\u201d; that the guarantee moneys were, therefore, \u201cnot true income at all\u201d but instead actually amounted to a seller\u2019s \u201cadjustment of the purchase price of the building and land\u201d resulting from a breach of the \u201cwarranty of minimum receipts from commercial rents,\u201d and that such breach made the property \u201cless valuable than had been represented and warranted,\u201d with the result that \u201ca portion of the purchase price was returned.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This is an ingenious argument, but plaintiff cites nothing in support. The more natural manner of regarding these funds is to consider them as commercial income. They certainly flowed to the cooperative in respect of commercial space. \u201cThe fund involved must be considered in the light of the claim from which it was realized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>* * Farmers\u2019 &amp; Merchants\u2019 Bank of Catlettsburg, Ky. v. Commissioner, 59 F.2d 912, 913 (6th Cir. 1932). (Moneys recovered through compromised litigation represented compensation for lost value of business (capital), not taxable earnings or income.) To the cooperative it made no difference whether such rental income was produced from leases or from the guarantee. <em>Cf. </em>Mellinger v. United States, 54-1 USTC ff 9197 (S.D.Tex. 1953). (Proceeds received under a policy insuring loss of rents when building was rendered untenantable by fire are to be treated as being in replacement of the lost rentals and therefore properly taxed as ordinary income and not as capital gain resulting from involuntary conversion of property destroyed by fire.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">To carry its burden of overcoming the presumption of correctness attaching to the Commissioner\u2019s determination, the taxpayer \u201cmust do more than merely claim alternative designations for\u201d the nature of moneys received. Sager Glove Corp. v. Commissioner, 311 F.2d 210, 211 (7th Cir. 1962). (Commissioner\u2019s determination that sum received in settlement of litigation constituted reimbursement for lost profits, taxable as income, and not nontaxable return of capital, sustained.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">Since it is not possible to sustain any of the three bases upon which plaintiff attempts to change the ratio between the gross income which the cooperative received in 1959 and 1960 from its tenant-stockholders and the total gross income it received in such years, the Commissioner\u2019s determination that the 80-percent requirement was not satisfied must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">Plaintiff stresses the alleged unfairness of this result to the tenant-stockholders who in good faith thought that, as apartment residents in a housing cooperative building, they would be entitled to the income tax deductions in question. Their disappointment in this respect is understandable. Nevertheless, Congress imposed the 80-percent requirement as a condition to their receiving such favorable tax treatment. During the initial period of a housing cooperative\u2019s existence, it may have difficulty, because of too many unsold apartments, in meeting the requirement. That was obviously the situation in the early years here involved, the cooperative commencing its existence with the shares allocated to 21 of the 101 apartments in the building remaining unsold. Since the device of the \u201cnominee\u201d of the selling corporation taking over these 21 vacant apartments is not permissible in order to bridge this gap, the occupants of the remaining apartments are necessarily in the unfortunate position of having become tenant-stockholders before their cooperative was able to qualify as a \u201ccooperative housing corporation\u201d under the tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">The Plan of Organization pursuant to which the cooperative corporation was organized by its sponsor corporation specifically stated that tenant-stockholders would receive their income tax deductions \u201cwhen 80 percent of the income of the Apartment Corporation [the cooperative] consists of rent received from tenant-stockholders,\u201d and, as shown, the proprietary leases specifically excluded the mortgage principal portion of the rent from the cooperative\u2019s \u201cincome,\u201d so that the tenants were all fully apprised of the existence of the 80-percent requirement and the relationship of their rental payments to it. Every prospective tenant-stockholder received a copy of the Plan (and, of course, the proprietary lease, which the lessee had to sign) prior to his stock purchase. The Plan further warned that neither the sponsor nor the corporative corporation made any warranty or representation that the Government would hold that the cooperative met the requirements imposed by the statutes for eligibility as a cooperative housing corporation. Under the circumstances, therefore, the tenant-stockholders cannot fairly claim surprise con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>cerning the existence of the 80-percent requirement, upon which their tax status depended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">For the reasons indicated, plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">. \u201cSec. 216.

The cooperative\u2019s first accountant\u2019s report, which was for the period September 22, 1958, the date operations commenced, to December 31, 1958, set forth the portion of the assessments on tenant-stockholders which was appropriated for the reduction of mortgage principal in the identical manner. This report was approved at a stockholders meeting held on March 16, 1959. The second accountant\u2019s report, covering the interim period January 1 to June 30,1959, was also identical in this respect. This report was approved at a directors meeting held on July 16, 1959.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">. For the year 1959, the accountants set forth the \u201cIncome\u201d from the assessments on the tenant-stockholders as $306,411.75, being the net of the total $400,000.08 assessment figure less the $93,588.33 \u201cportion appropriated for the reduction of the mortgage principal.\u201d The two previous accountants\u2019 reports (note 12) similarly set forth the assessments under \u201cIncome\u201d in only a net amount. For 1960, however, the accountants, for the first time, showed the entire $400,000.08 assessment figure under \u201cIncome,\u201d without any reduction. The \u201cPortion of tbe assessments on tenant-stockholders allocated for mortgage amortization payments\u201d was, instead, set forth at a later point in the statement under the heading \u201cFinancial expenditures.\u201d (In this report, the accountants, in setting forth the 1959 figures for \u201ccomparative\u201d purposes, restated such figures to conform to the 1960 setup.) The reason for this sudden change in the statements is not clear. Each report carried the usual certification that it was \u201cin conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.\u201d However, by January 31, 1961, the date of the accountants\u2019 1960 statement, the issue involved in this case had already arisen. Sometime in 1960, the deductions of a director tenant-stockholder\u2019s proportionate share of real estate taxes and mortgage interest paid in 1958 by the cooperative was disallowed by a Revenue Agent on the ground that less than 80 percent of the cooperative\u2019s gross income during that year had been derived from tenant-stockholders.

At the meeting on August 30, 1961, the board also adopted a resolution which applied the new formula retroactively to the tenant-stockholders\u2019 assessments received since September 22, 1958, the date upon which the cooperative took title, and the accountants the following day issued a new report for 1960 applying the new formula and reducing the additional paid-in capital from $97,871.41 to $82,270.71. Manifestly, while the new formula might well be appropriate on a prospective basis, it could hardly, on a retroactive basis, serve to undo that which had already been done. Plaintiff herself agrees that no weight should be given to the board\u2019s action in 1961 or to the accountants\u2019 statements following such action insofar as they were \u201cdesigned to remedy retroactively for the record the [prior] situation * * (PL Objections to Def.

The section is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A52\">\u201c\u00a7 1.118-1 <em>Contributions to the capital of a corporation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adc\">\u201cIn the case of a corporation, section 118 provides an exclusion from gross income with respect to any contribution of money or property to the capital of the taxpayer. Thus, if a corporation requires additional funds for conducting its business and obtains such funds through voluntary pro rata payments by its shareholders, the amounts so received being credited to its surplus account or to a special account, such amounts do not constitute income, although there is no increase in the outstanding shares of stock of the corporation. In such a case the payments are in the nature of assessments upon, and represent an additional price paid for, the shares of stock held by the individual shareholders, and will be treated as an addition to and as a part of the operating capital of the company. Section 118 also applies to contributions to capital made by persons other than shareholders. For example, the exclusion applies to the value of land or other property contributed to a corporation by a governmental unit or by a civic group for the purpose of inducing the corporation to locate its business in a particular community, or for the purpose of enabling the corporation to expand its operating facilities. However, the exclusion does not apply to any money or property transferred to the corporation in consideration for goods or services rendered, or to subsidies paid for the purpose of inducing the taxpayer to limit production.

Upon its organization, the cooperative allocated its 40,000 shares to the 101 apartments in the building, the selling price to the tenant-stockholders being $59 per share. There were 285 shares allocated to plaintiff\u2019s apartment. The tenants executed stock purchase agreements for the stock allocated to the apartments they wished to rent. Thus, to occupy plaintiff\u2019s apartment, a stock purchase in the amount of $16,815 would be required. Plaintiff\u2019s apartment was one of those which remained vacant as of the date of closing. It was, therefore, taken over by Elghanayan as \u201cnominee.\u201d On December 29, 1958, plaintiff purchased the 285 shares from Elghanayan for $15,750.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1105-18\">. \u201cThe' hill provides for a new deduction in section 23 (z) of taxes and interest paid or accrued by a tenant stockholder to a cooperative apartment corporation within the taxable year.
