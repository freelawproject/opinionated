In 1965, appellant and five others were apprehended after the attempted robbery of a liquor store, whose owner was shot (not fatally) during the attempt. Two co-defendants, Richard Ferguson and Ike Hill, signed statements in which they confessed to being in the car that was used for the robbery, though they denied leaving it during the episode. Both claimed that co-defendant Eddie Cason (who pleaded guilty before the trial), co-defendant Rodney Mitchell (who was treated as a youthful offender), and a man whom they could identify only as \u201cDuffy,\u201d left the car, walked toward the liquor store, and returned to the car after the attempt had been perpetrated. Duff himself signed a statement in which he admitted being in the car, but said that he \u201cwalked the other way,\u201d away from the liquor store, while Cason and Mitchell attempted to rob it. Two detectives testified to oral statements made by Duff to the effect that he had agreed to participate in the robbery and that he acted as a \u201clook-out,\u201d standing \u201ca door or two away\u201d from the liquor store. The statements of all three defendants were found voluntary at a pre-trial <em>Huntley </em>hearing, People v. Huntley, 15 N.Y.2d 72, 255 N.Y.S.2d 838, 204 N.E.2d 179 (1965), at which Ferguson testified, and were admitted into evidence with instructions that each was admissible only against the person making it. Other evidence against Duff included the testimony of David Hollis, who was incarcerated with Duff and Ferguson, and who repeated a statement by Ferguson that Duff had acted as a look-out. Hollis also claimed to have overheard Duff threaten Ferguson with harm unless the latter \u201ccut him loose\u201d from the case. Cason testified that Duff had gone into the store, but an eyewitness in the store, an acquaintance of the victim, was unsure in his identification of Duff. Duff was convicted of first degree attempted robbery, first degree attempted grand larceny, and two counts of second degree assault, and was sentenced to concurrent terms of 7% to 15 years for robbery, and 2% to 5 years on the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">We reject appellant\u2019s claim that the admission of the written statements of Ferguson and Hill violated the rule of Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). The statements were similar to Duff\u2019s own confessions, written and oral, which placed him at the scene with a fair implication of knowing participation. When the defendant\u2019s \u201cconfession interlocks with and supports the confession of\u201d the co-defendant, there is no violation of the <em>Bruton </em>rule. United States ex rel. Catanzaro v. Mancusi, 404 F.2d 296, 300 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 942, 90 S.Ct. 956, 25 L.Ed.2d 123 (1970). \u201cWhere the jury has heard not only a codefendant\u2019s confession but the defendant\u2019s own confession [to essentially the same facts] no such \u2018devastating\u2019 risk attends the lack of confrontation as was thought to be involved in <em>Bruton.\u201d </em>Id. In the light of Duff\u2019s undisputed presence at the scene, Ferguson\u2019s and Hill\u2019s statements were not a \u201cvitally important part of the prosecution\u2019s case\u201d against him. See Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731, 735, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969); United States ex rel. Nelson v. Follette, 430 F.2d 1055 (2d Cir. 1970). A limiting instruction as that given here may be \u201cadequate to protect appellant\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d notwithstanding <em>Bruton. </em>See United States ex rel. Nelson v. Follette, <em>supra, </em>430 F.2d at 1059; United States v. Cusumano, 429 F.2d 378, 381 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, Testa v. United States, 400 U.S. 830, 91 S.Ct. 61, 27 L.Ed.2d 61 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">As far as Ferguson\u2019s statement is concerned, it should be noted also that Duff had the opportunity to cross-examine Ferguson at the <em>Huntley </em>hearing. See California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 165, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>People v.
