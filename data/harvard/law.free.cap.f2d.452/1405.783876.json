With respect to these categories, the Universal backhoe crawler (4), the Caterpillar bulldozer (5), and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>Hamm 3-wheel road roller (6) have limitations in speed, steering and road-ability which prevent them from being moved on highways under their own motive power. Hence, these three categories must be moved by trailer or train from construction site to construction site. By contrast, the five categories of equipment represented by the other models (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8) have been so designed with regard to size maneuverability, equipment and speed that they can travel on highways under their own power and can maintain speeds of from 30 to 35 miles per hour. They also conform with highway requirements for treads, steering, maneuverability, width, weight, lights and horns. An additional aspect is that with the exception of the Universal crane truck (7), when equipment falling within the latter five categories is operated on the highway in transit from one site to another, it must carry a contractor\u2019s license. The crane truck, however, must have a regular truck license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-4\">Finally, the evidence shows that the vehicles represented by the models in issue <em>are primarily used for moving dirt, the construction of roads and the building of culverts and buildings, and that their movement over the highway is to enable them to get to construction sites to perform the job or jobs for which they were </em>designed. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-8\">With the above facts in mind, we agree with the Customs Court that none of the importations are models of \u201chighway vehicles\u201d within the common meaning of that expression as employed in item 737-07. Appellant acknowledges that Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 \u2014 the bulldozer, backhoe and road roller \u2014 would not be encompassed even under its proposed definition of a \u201chighway vehicle\u201d model, inasmuch as the record shows the prototypes do not normally travel under their own power on highways at all. With respect to the remaining model vehicles, the Customs Court appropriately observed that any \u201chighway\u201d movement of the prototypes that does occur is only for the purpose of travelling to the site to perform the off-the-road job for which the equipment was designed or acquired. That movement on the highways, of course, is merely incidental to their main purpose \u2014 use as construction equipment \u2014 and is not the essence of their existence. Such occasional use of, or association with, the highways does not, in our opinion, necessitate classification of those vehicles as models of \u201chighway vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-9\">We have considered appellant\u2019s arguments, but perceive no error in the conclusion reached below.
