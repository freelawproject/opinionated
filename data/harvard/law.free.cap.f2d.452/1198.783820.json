Thereafter, he was sentenced on the state charge to three years, to run concurrently with the federal sentence, and credit was accorded him for presentence \u201cjail time.\u201d He contends that he should be given credit upon his federal sentence for time spent in state custody prior to sentencing because he was unable to post bond on the state charge as a result of the federal detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-11\">Even if appellant was given credit on his state sentence for presentence eustody, if that sentence- runs concurrently with a longer federal sentence and he was unable to post bond on the state charge solely because of the existence of the federal detainer, he is entitled to credit on -the federal sentence. Willis v. United States, 5th Cir.1971, 438 F.2d 923; Cf. Radcliffe v. Clark, 5th Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-17\">There were no findings on the question of whether appellant\u2019s confinement between June, 1968 and January, 1969 was attributable to the federal detainer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We remand for further proceedings, and an evidentiary hearing if necessary, on appellant\u2019s contention that he is entitled to credit for that period.

It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
