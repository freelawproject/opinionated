The Deputy Commissioner\u2019s rejection of the claim was based on the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-19\">1. failure to establish that the injury was sustained on the dates alleged;</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-20\">2. failure to give written notice of the injury to the employer or Deputy Commissioner within thirty days;</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-21\">3. failure to establish a causal relationship between the injury and the appellant\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-22\">What the foregoing reasons fail to establish, however, is whether the Deputy Commissioner gave proper consideration to the possibility that appellant's failure to give timely notice as required by statute was excusable \u201cfor some satisfactory reason.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>In order that such a determination be made, we remand to the District Court with instructions to direct the Deputy Commissioner to determine whether any basis for excusing the failure to' give timely notice exists.
