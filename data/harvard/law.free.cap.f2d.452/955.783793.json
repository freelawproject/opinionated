BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1014-22\">During a final sea trial run of the USCG Cutter Hamilton prior to its delivery to the United States Coast Guard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>Edgar J. Williams either slipped on an oil spot or became engaged in a fistfight.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In whichever manner, he injured his right index finger and brought this suit seeking $225,000.00 plus $20,-000. 00.for maintenance and cure, and attorney fees from the United <em>States</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and from his employer, Avondale Shipyards (Shipbuilder). Agreeing with the District Court that Williams was not a member of a crew of a vessel in navigation within the meaning of the Jones Act, and that he was not entitled to a warranty of seaworthiness from the vessel on which the injury occurred, but concluding that the Judge went too far too fast to sustain a summary judgment upholding the exclusiveness of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, we must vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings on the count for general maritime negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Williams worked for Shipbuilder as an engineering draftsman during 1966 and 1967. At that time Shipbuilder was engaged in construction of USCGC Hamilton, a new vessel being built for the United States Coast Guard. The contract called for sea trials. In January of 1967 Williams was assigned to go aboard Hamilton for approximately two days to serve as a data-taker and gauge monitor during final sea trials of the vessel. Shipbuilder\u2019s crew was aboard. It was during this trial run that his injuries were sustained. A month later, after additional construction activities and procedures were carried out, the Hamilton was delivered to and accepted by the United States Coast Guard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">Three theories are asserted against Shipbuilder. We reject two, but the third requires a remand for further development of the pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">7. <em>Warranty of Seaworthiness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">Williams\u2019 first claim is that Avondale breached its warranty of seaworthiness by manning the Hamilton with an insufficient and inadequately trained crew which allowed a slippery condition to develop and exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">Without even deciding whether Williams was a member of the crew or whether he was a blue water, paper or <em>Sieracki </em>seaman or whether the condition complained of was an unseaworthy one, we disallow this claim because at the time of Williams\u2019 injuries, no warranty of seaworthiness was owed to anyone. The whole purpose of the sea trial was to ascertain what additional work would be required to make the Hamilton fully fit. Shipbuilder could, of course, be held to due care to those properly aboard, but that is a far cry from the awesome obligations of seaworthiness. At this stage of construction, no one was holding forth to any persons going aboard the vessel that she was in fact completed, fit and seaworthy. That was precisely what the trial run was intended to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">Thus Williams cannot prevail on a warranty of seaworthiness theory. See Rogers v. M/V Ralph Bollinger, 279 F.Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>92 (E.D.La.1968); Alfred v. M/V Margaret Lykes, 5 Cir., 1968, 398 F.2d 684.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">\n<em>II. Jones Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Williams next seeks benefits under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">\u201cThere are three essential elements in the term \u2018seaman\u2019 as used in the Jones Act. First, the vessel on which the claimant is employed must be in navigation. Second, there must be more or less permanent connection with the vessel, and third, the claimant must be aboard primarily to aid in navigation. McKie v. Diamond Marine Co., 5 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 132.\u201d Bodden v. Coordinated Caribbean Transport, Inc., 5 Cir., 1966, 369 F.2d 273, 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">As to the first of those three elements, we hold that Hamilton was not \u201cin navigation\u201d as that term has been defined by the courts at the time of Williams\u2019 injuries. It is true that Hamilton was at sea and underweigh at that time, but \u201cit is fallacious to assume that whenever a tort occurs on navigable waters, the person injured will automatically avail himself of the Jones Act.\u201d Frankel v. Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, 4 Cir., 1942, 132 F.2d 634, 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">The term \u201cin navigation\u201d means \u201cengaged in an instrument of commerce and transportation on navigable waters.\u201d Norris, Law of Seamen, \u00a7 664, p. 802; Carumbo v. Cape Cod S.S. Co., 1 Cir., 1941, 123 F.2d 991. And for a public non-merchant vessel, that would mean engaged in her expected duties as a vessel on navigable waters. The test for determining this is \u201cthe status of the ship.\u201d West v. United States, 1959, 361 U.S. 118, 122, 80 S.Ct. 189, 192, 4 L.Ed.2d 161, 165, 1959 A.M.C. 1602, 1606.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-18\">A shipbuilder\u2019s worker, construction hand or engineer assisting in the building and ultimate commissioning of a launched but uncompleted vessel floating or maneuvering in navigable waters is not a seaman within the meaning of the Jones Act, because his vessel is not yet an instrumentality of commerce \u2014 private or public- \u2014 and is therefore not \u201cin navigation.\u201d Frankel v. Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, <em>supra; </em>Rogers v. M/V Ralph Bollinger, <em>supra. </em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-19\">For there to be a seaman, there must first be a ship. And an incompleted vessel not yet delivered by the builder is not such a ship. Ship and seaman, ship and seaworthiness are mutual reflexes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">\n<em>III. General Maritime Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-21\"> Williams\u2019 final theory is that he is entitled to recover on general maritime principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-22\">Of course, the tort of which Williams complains is a classic case of a maritime injury, since it occurred and the injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>were consummated on navigable waters. And to this action, it does not matter whether those navigable waters are those of the United States or of all nations as international waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Likewise, from the standpoint of substantive principles it is the maritime law of the United States which, at least in an action involving its own nationals and a vessel<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the United States, is applicable. Kermarec v. Compagnie Generate Transatlantique, 1959, 358 U.S. 625, 79 S.Ct. 406, 3 L.Ed.2d 550, 1959 A.M.C. 597.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To this extent the maritime law is global.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">As a matter of pleadings there can be no doubt about the maritime claim. The allegations of Williams\u2019 complaint twice specify that the accident occurred while Hamilton was \u201cupon the navigable waters of the United States.\u201d At another point however, it alleged the vessel was on navigable waters in the Gulf of Mexico: \u201cThe USCG HAMILTON * * * was undergoing ocean tests in the Gulf of Mexico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">All this seems to have been well known to the Trial Court, for his first impression led him to refuse to dismiss the maritime negligence claim at the time he dismissed the Jones Act and unseaworthiness counts. But, of course, what faced him was something different. For Shipbuilder subsequently moved for summary judgment based on the fact that since Williams was unquestionably an employee, his exclusive remedy against his employer is under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-18\">The trouble was that there was not a stitch of proof \u2014 one way or another \u2014 on the crucial jurisdictional<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> question of coverage of the Act. Unlike the Jones Act or a claim for unseaworthiness or general maritime law the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is limited to the \u201cnavigable waters <em>of the United States.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-19\">Thus, the propriety of dismissing this action because of the exclusiveness of<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the compensation remedy depends upon a finding that Hamilton was in navigable waters of the United States at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-20\">Again as a matter of pleadings, the unverified motion of Shipbuilder stating merely that the Longshoremen\u2019s Act controlled stood denied by operation of the rules since no reply was called for. It is true that twice the complaint spoke in conclusory terms of \u201cnavigable waters of the United States,\u201d but there was the other allegation that the situs was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Gulf of Mexico, with no indication of how far out into the Gulf the vessel had ventured. Here for the Court to resolve this basic question on pleadings of this character was a sort of reverse of Barber v. Motor Vessel \u201cBlue Cat\u201d, 5 Cir., 1967, 372 F.2d 626, 1967 A.M.C.-and Conley v. Gibson, 1957, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80. Instead of reading too little, as is most often the cause of the soaring mortality rate of Rule 12(b) dismissals, the Judge read too much into the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">We do not mean to expound here a technical literalness so foreign to the Admiralty. But the legal question is serious and may well turn on specific territorial facts. Cf. O\u2019Loughlin v. Parker, 4 Cir., 1947, 163 F.2d 1011, cert. denied, 333 U.S. 868, 68 S.Ct. 785, 92 L.Ed. 1146, rehearing denied, 334 U.S. 824, 68 S.Ct. 1073, 92 L.Ed. 1753 (holding that the word \u201cupon\u201d in the Act requires a territorial construction). Apart from Congressional extensions of the Longshoremen Act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> there is neither legislation nor case law to indicate with assurance that the Longshoremen\u2019s Act applies on the high seas.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> How far might well be significant in view of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cases touching on the subject give us no reliable fix on what are navigable waters of the United States \u2014 the Great Lakes are,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> waters of Puerto Rico<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and of the Canal Zone<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-15\">The Outer Continental Shelf Act Lands Act extends the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, but only with respect to injuries occurring as the result of operations for \u201cexploring for, developing, removing or transporting natural resources * * * of the subsoil and seabed.\u201d 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1333(b) and (c). And at the same time the Act carefully preserves the international character of the waters above the seabed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>The upshot is that the Trial Court once again moved too far too fast.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There was a maritime claim for which, if proved, recovery could be had <em>unless </em>\u2014and the unless is the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. That \u201cunless\u201d turns on a virtually uncharted factual-legal question. When the facts \u2014 not just what the lawyers say are the facts \u2014 are established, the Court can then safely, albeit only initially, act. But this case must go back for Shipbuilder to demonstrate <em>factually </em>\u2014 not merely by allegation \u2014 that Williams\u2019 claim is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part; remanded with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">. The pleadings of the parties are in conflict as to just how the injury occurred. The complaint had all the vagueness that the Rules permit. In the pretrial order, Williams specified oil as the cause of the injury. Shipbuilder, to the contrary, answered that Williams injured his hand in a fistfight when he struck a pipe instead of a jaw. Since this appeal is from dismissal of the complaint without any evidence or trial, we assume that the Plaintiff\u2019s specifications are true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">. The United States was dismissed from the suit upon a successful pleading of the two-year Statute of Limitations. 46 U.S. G.A. \u00a7 .745.

She must have been a beautiful ship\u2014 378 feet long, manned by a crew of 15 officers and 149 enlisted personnel. She was even the subject of a magazine article, auspiciously entitled, \u201cThe USCGC HAMILTON (WHE'C-715) Coast Guard Ship of the Future,\u201d by Captain Edward F. Oliver, USCG, but the Court has been unable to ascertain whether or where the article was published.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">. See also, Roper v. United States, 1961, 368 U.S. 20, 82 S.Ct. 5, 7 L.Ed.2d 1, 1961 A.M.C. - esp. n. 3; Johnson v. Oil Transport Co., Inc., 5 Cir., 1971, 440 F.2d 109 [No. 28418, March 12, 1971] ; Stark v.

Starved Rock Ferry Co., 1952, 342 U.S. 187, 72 S.Ct. 216, 96 L.Ed. 205, 1952 A.M.C. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">These cases all involved vessels -which had been withdrawn from navigation, but the principle is pertinent where the vessel has not yet entered navigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1016-15\">. Our holding here would seem to follow the rationale enunciated in <em>Frwnkel </em>and quoted favorably in <em>Rogers:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-16\">\u201cAccordingly, since a contract for the building of a ship is non-maritime in character, a tort arising out of work on a launched but incompleted vessel also lacks maritime flavor, despite the fact that the vessel is lying in navigable waters. Furthermore, an incompleted vessel has yet to take her place in commerce and navigation; whereas a vessel which has been commissioned and taken into navigation and commerce remains in that status even when coming into a dock and undergoing certain repairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-24\">132 F.2d at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-25\">In this approach, much emphasis has been laid on the historical tradition that vessels under construction give rise to neither a maritime contract nor a maritime tort. But for the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, that is no longer controlling. See, Calbeck v. Travelers Ins. Co., 1962, 370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368, 1962 A.M.C. 1413. But it does not alter our holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">. For this purpose the \u201cvessel\u201d need not be in navigation.
