He has appealed'his conviction on both counts of an indictment charging violation of two federal statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084(a) and \u00a7 1952. Each count raises a question of statutory construction; in addition, he challenges the admissibility of the evidence tending to prove that the Western Union ticker tape machine in his tavern was an interstate facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">I. <em>Count I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-16\">The appeal from the conviction on Count I raises a precise issue. Does the activity of a professional gambler which is prohibited by \u00a7 1084(a) include the mere receipt as well as the transmission of the kind of information described in the statute? The issue is starkly presented because appellant\u2019s ticker tape enabled him to receive, but not to transmit, information which assisted in the placing of bets on sports events. The ticker tape is, therefore, unlike a telephone which provides a means for communication between two persons, each of whom normally transmits, as well as receives, some information during any use of the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-17\">Although we recognize that there is language in at least one case involving the use of the telephone that points in the other direction <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, we believe that the coverage of paragraph (a) of \u00a7 1084 is limited to prohibited transmissions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>does not encompass mere reception. Our conclusion is supported by the text of the statute, by its legislative history, and by the carefully considered opinion in Telephone News System, Inc. v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 220 F.Supp. 621 (N.D.Ill.1963), affirmed, 376 U.S. 782, 84 S.Ct. 1134, 12 L.Ed.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In that case the court rejected a Government contention that the word \u201ctransmission\u201d as used in paragraph (a) meant receiving as well as sending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201cIn support of this position, the government urges that the term \u2018transmission\u2019 as used in subsection (a) does not mean \u2018sending,\u2019 but rather means sending or receiving. Therefore, it maintains, Retelle violated subsection (a) when he received information from plaintiff over the telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201cWe must reject the theory that \u2018transmission\u2019 as used in subsection (a) means sending or receiving. Whatever validity there might be to the argument that \u2018transmission,\u2019 in some contexts, has a meaning broader than the term \u2018sending,\u2019 it is plain that Congress meant it as \u2018sending\u2019 in this statute. Subsection (d) uses the term \u2018transmitting or receiving,\u2019 and it is illogical to suppose that Congress would not have used both terms in both subsections had it meant to include \u2018receiving\u2019 in subsection (a). We shall not assume that \u2018transmission\u2019 has one meaning in subsection (a) and another in subsection (d), nor that \u2018receiving\u2019 in subsection (d) is superfluous.\u201d 220 F.Supp. at 638.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">In this case the Government advances a different argument. It contends that the statutory phrase \u201cfor the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers \u2022if * *\u00bb modifies the noun \u201cfacility\u201d rather than the verb \u201cuses.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is not a tenable interpretation of the section. Unless the phrase modifies the verb, a professional gambler would violate \u00a7 1084(a) whenever he made an innocent use of a facility which someone else had used for an illegal purpose. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Judkins, 428 F.2d 333 (6th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">Moreover, the somewhat different language used in the House Report also indicates that the qualifying language was intended to modify the verb \u201cuses\u201d rather than the noun \u201cfacility.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A reading of \u00a7 1084 in its entirety corroborates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>our conclusion that paragraph (a) is limited to \u201ctransmission,\u201d since the intent to encompass \u201ctransmitting or receiving\u201d by the civil remedy authorized in paragraph (d) was plainly specified by using both words.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">We, therefore, hold that the conviction on Count I must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">II. <em>Count II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Appellant contends that the evidence did not prove that the ticker tape had been used \u201cto facilitate\u201d gambling within the meaning of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952. He contends there was no evidence that any specific bet was placed or any specific payment made on the basis of information received over the ticker tape. For purposes of decision we accept appellant\u2019s version of the record, but hold that such evidentiary detail was not essential to sustain a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The record plainly establishes that the gambling enterprise was a regular and significant portion of the business carried on in appellant\u2019s tavern. Even if the prompt availability of sporting information did nothing more than advertise the business and attract patrons to the premises where wagers were being solicited and taken, we believe the jury could properly conclude that appellant had installed and used the ticker tape with intent to \u201c * * * facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on * * * \u201d of his unlawful activity. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Miller, 379 F.2d 483, 485 (7th Cir. 1967),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> cert. denied, 389 U.S. 930, 88 S.Ct. 291, 19 L.Ed.2d 281; United States v. Lookretis, 422 F.2d 647 (7th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 904, 90 S.Ct. 1693, 26 L.Ed.2d 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">III. <em>Evidence That the Ticker Tape Was an Interstate Facility.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">Dean Gerard, the manager of Western Union\u2019s Moline office, testified that in 1959 only two ticker tape machines were in service in Rock Island, one leased to appellant and the other to the local television station. He explained that Western Union gathered sporting information from various parts of the country at a center in Chicago where the information was compiled on a punch tape and sent out over a network to users\u2019 machines, which then printed the results on tape. When asked how information was sent from Chicago to Rock Island, he responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">\u201cA Well, we have a circuit that comes from Chicago. It is \u2014 goes to our Davenport, Iowa office, where our wire chamber is at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A53\">\u201cQ I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know whether the jury understood what you said after \u2018Davenport, Iowa.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-13\">\u201cA Well, there the incoming signals coming in through what is called a repeater. The repeater amplifies the signal and it is sent out from there to wherever the customers are at.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">On cross-examination he acknowledged that he had never examined the circuitry himself and, therefore, did not know the exact circuitry of his own knowledge. Appellant then moved to strike the earlier testimony to the effect that the transmission from Chicago to Rock Island was routed via Davenport, Iowa. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-15\">Thereafter, on redirect examination, Gerard produced a \u201cPatron Maintenance and Trouble Log\u201d for the machine used by appellant. The log made reference to two instances of service to appellant\u2019s installation in 1969 and contained a cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>cuit map sketched schematically, purporting to diagram the circuitry from Davenport, Iowa, to Moline and thence to Rock Island, Illinois.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Gerard testified that the log had been prepared by a maintenance man no longer in Western Union\u2019s employ, that it was the ex-employee\u2019s job to prepare and make entries in such documents, and that the log came from the regular files of the company. Over appellant's objections, the document was received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Appellant offered no evidence tending to dispute the showing that the circuit was routed from Chicago to Rock Island via Davenport. On appeal he argues that the testimony and the exhibit were both inadmissible and, if excluded, the record would contain no evidence of an interstate transmission. We believe Judge Morgan\u2019s evidentiary rulings were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">We recognize, as appellant argues, that the prosecutor has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and presumably the testimony of an engineer who had personally traced the circuit would have been more reliable than the evidence which was adduced. It is clear, however, that the information made available to the jury was that on which Western Union personnel relied in the regular course of business, and the likelihood that the local office manager or the maintenance man would incorrectly understand or describe the basic circuitry is remote.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is the kind of evidence \u201cwhich experience has shown to be quite trustworthy,\u201d Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 113, 63 S.Ct. 477, 480, 87 L.Ed. 645. See also Thomas v. Hogan, 308 F.2d 355, 358 (4th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">The conviction on Count I is reversed. The judgment on Count II is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\">. Sagansky v.

United States, 393 F.2d 627 (8th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 831, 89 S.Ct. 104, 21 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>103, cited by the government for the proposition that transmission is unnecessary, clearly does not support this conclusion because the court there wrote: \u201c[A] jury could properly conclude that Truchinski <em>transmitted </em>information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on a sporting event.\u201d 393 F.2d at 631.

It also prohibits the transmission of a wire communication which entitled the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of a bet or wager or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers. A penalty of $10,000 or imprisonment not more than 2 years, or both, is placed upon such <em>transmission,\u201d U.S</em>.Code Cong, and Admin.News (1961) p. 2632. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\">. We do not view the fact that payoffs may have been made on the basis of the ticker reports as essential to that decision. The court wrote: \u201cThey wanted the ticker in their establishment so that the customers could check the scores. They provided blackboards so that scores obtained from the ticker could be posted. They knew that these scores would be of interest to their baseball pool customers.\u201d 379 F.2d at 485.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\">. The diagram identified the nature of the circuitry as well as its routing. The connection between Davenport and Moline was \u201cW. U. CABLE\u201d and from Moline to Rock Island it was \u201cB FONE PR/7WU 2543.\u201d The purpose of the diagram was obviously to facilitate the work of the maintenance man if a defect in the circuit required repair or adjustment. The primary utility of the document was to assist routine maintenance; there is nothing to suggest that it was prepared in contemplation of litigation. <em>Cf. </em>Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 113-114, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b517-20\">. The Business Records Act expressly provides that circumstances which may affect the weight of the evidence do not necessarily affect its admissibility. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732(a). See also Rule 803 (6) of the Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and Magistrates (March, 1971, revised draft) which provides for the business records exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-21\">There can be no doubt that the log was made in the ordinary course of business and its trustworthiness is enhanced by the fact that it was used for maintenance purposes, which would surely require that the correct circuitry be known in order to facilitate repair.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
