At the time of the trial, there was no time limit, statutory or otherwise, on the use of prior convictions for such purposes and the admissibility of the evidence was within the sound discretion of the trial judge. Luck v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 348 F.2d 763 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-18\">Since the trial, Congress has enacted D.C.Code \u00a7 14-305(b) (2) (B) (ii) (Supp. IV, 1971),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides that prior convictions shall not be used to impeach a witness where the expiration of the witness\u2019s period of probation occurred more than ten years before the trial in which he is sought to be impeached. Therefore, if the instant case were retried, the forgery conviction could not be used, because the ten-year limitation has been slightly exceeded. However, since the new statutory rule was not in effect at the time of the trial, the question was within the broad dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>eretion of the trial judge. Luck v. United States, <em>supra. </em>In view of the close relevancy between a prior forgery conviction and a witness\u2019s credibility, we do not believe that the trial judge abused his discretion here by permitting use of such conviction. <em>See </em>Davis v. United States, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 167, 170-171, 409 F.2d 453, 456-457 (1967). The lapse of time since the witness committed the prior offense is a matter which goes to her credibility and as such is within the domain of the jury to consider in determining the weight they would give to such evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus we find that the trial in this respect was without error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1437-15\">.
