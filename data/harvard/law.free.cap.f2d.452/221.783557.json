Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b280-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Officials of the State of Mississippi filed in the courts of that state a quo warranto proceeding against Tri-County Community Center, a nonprofit Mississippi corporation, alleging that the corporation had exceeded its corporate powers and seeking to have its charter forfeited and its property placed in the hands of trustees. The defendant corporation sought to remove to the federal courts under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It alleges that it provides health services to poor people of Mississippi, mainly blacks, and that, despite a veto by the governor of Mississippi, is the recipient of a grant from the Office of Economic Opportunity, an agency within the Executive Office of the President, for the operation of a health center. Tri-County asserts that the quo warranto action is part of a pattern of harassment, intimidation, and coercion for the purpose of preventing the corporation from operating a health service program for the poor in Hinds County, Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">The corporation contends that prosecution, per se, of the quo warranto action in state court denies it an \u201cequal civil right\u201d conferred by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 245(b) (4) (A) (1970).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Arguably (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>(4) may rise to the level of an \u201cequal civil right,\u201d New York v. Horelick, 424 F.2d 697, 702 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 939, 90 S.Ct. 1839, 26 L.Ed.2d 273 (1970).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the language of subdivision (b), \u201cWhoever * * * by force or threat of force willfully injures, intimidates or interferes with, or attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with,\u201d indicates that \u00a7 245(b) is aimed at disruptions or attempted disruptions by violent activity, \u201cnot the ordered functioning of state legal processes, whatever the motivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>424 F.2d at 703. Appellant has alleged no force or threats of force. Thus, even if we concluded that \u00a7 245(b) (4) (A) does confer an \u201cequal civil right\u201d within the meaning of the civil rights removal section, the actions of which Tri-County complains are not such as are within the ambit of \u00a7 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Nor are we able to say that this is one of the \u201crare situations where it can be clearly predicted by reason of the operation of a pervasive and explicit state or federal law that these rights will inevitably be denied by the very act of bringing the defendant to trial in the state court.\u201d City of Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 827-828, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 1812, 16 L.Ed.2d 944, 956-957 (1966)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATx\">The District Court, 323 F.Supp. 286, correctly granted the motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"A1t\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\">. \u201c \u00a7 1443. Civil rights cases</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u201cAny of the following civil actions or criminal prosecutions, commenced in a State court may be removed by the defendant to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending r</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\u201c(1) Against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof ;</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\u201c(2) For any act under color of authority derived from any law providing for equal rights, or for refusing to do any act on the ground that it would be inconsistent with such law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">In Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966), the Supreme Court made clear that \u00a7 1443(1) had two requirements that must be met. Petitioners for removal must show that the right relied upon is one conferred by a law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality and it is denied or cannot be enforced in state court. In the companion case of City of Greenwood, Miss. v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966), the court held that removal under \u00a7 1443(2) was available only to federal or state officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-17\">. \u201c(b) Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, by force or threat of force willfully injures, intimidates or interferes with, or attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with \u2014 * * *</p>\n<p id=\"AF9\">\u201c(4) any person because he is or has been, or in order to intimidate such person or any other person or any class of persons from\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b280-18\">\u201c(A) participating, without discrimination on account of race, color, religion or national origin, in any of the benefits or activities described in sub-paragraphs (1) (A) through (1) (E) or subparagraphs (2) (A) through (2) (F) * * * [shall be punished by fine or imprisonment].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-21\">Subparagraph (1) (E) refers to participation in or enjoyment of benefits of any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-22\">In its petition for removal appellant relied also on alleged \u201cequal civil rights\u201d conferred by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981-83 (1970) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>and by the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution. No further reliance on these alleged rights has been brought to our attention at the appellate level, and we do not consider them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\">. \u00a7 245 is a criminal statute that in terms confers no rights. It prohibits and provides penalties for certain types of conduct relative to protected activities enumerated therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\">. For examples of those rare situations <em>see </em>Georgia v. Rachel supra, footnote 1 (defendants charged under Georgia trespass statute for refusal to leave facilities of public accommodation when allegedly ordered to do so solely for racial reasons), and Whatley v. City of Vidalia, 399 F.2d 521 (5th Cir. 1968) (defendants arrested while peacefully engaged in activity designed to encourage voter registration). In those cases defendants were acting under statutes that substitute rights for a crime and prohibit attempts to intimidate, threaten or coerce persons exercising those rights. Mere pendency of an action arising from the exercise of these preemptive federal rights was held to be a prohibited attempt to intimidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-21\">For a ease similar to the present one and also found not to be a Georgia v. Rachel situation, <em>see </em>Sunflower County Colored Baptist Ass\u2019n v. Trustees of Indianola Mun. Sep. Sch. Dist., 369 F.2d 795 (5th Cir. 1966) (eminent domain proceedings brought in state court against defendant whose land was being used by Mississippi civil rights group to conduct a freedom school).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
