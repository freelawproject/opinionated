United States (1970) 420 F.2d 702, 190 Ct.Cl. 385 and Ray E. Loper Lumber Co. v. United States (6th Cir. 1971) 444 F.2d 301, each of which deals with the identical problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">It is unnecessary to describe the elaborate arguments advanced in the ease at bench because their substance is fully explored in <em>Motor Fuel Carriers, Inc., </em>and <em>Ray E. Loper Lumber Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">We adopt the reasoning of <em>Motor Fuel Carriers, Inc., </em>in support of its conclusion that section 6601(f) (3) controls. Accordingly, we hold that the taxpayer is not liable for interest on the deficiency in accumulated earnings tax which it has paid within 10 days of demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-14\">.
