The low density foam can be produced by heating a blend of stereoregular polypropylene, blowing agent and a poly(sulfonazide) cross-linking agent, a method held to be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art in In re Lewis, 443 F.2d 389, 58 CCPA 1270 (1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A feature of that method is said to be the substantial cross-linking which occurs prior to expansion of the foam or simultaneously therewith, with the result that sufficient strength is imparted to the cells of the foam during formation that they will not rupture or collapse. According to the specification, the claimed foams have such advantages over the polypropylene foams of the prior art as improved cell structure, resistance to creep and solvents, and improved resistance to deformation at elevated temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">The examiner and board relied on Hohenberg,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Breslow,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Yokose,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Carr<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as evidence of the prior art; all but the last having been discussed in this court\u2019s previous <em>Lewis </em>opinion. Briefly, Hohenberg and Yokose describe the preparation of foams from various olefin polymers, including polyethylene and polypropylene. Those foams, however, are not cross-linked and do not have the low density specified in the claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Breslow describes the cross-linking (without foaming) of various alpha-alkyl polymers, such as polypropylene, by heating them in the presence of a poly(sulfonazide) of the type utilized by appellant. That method is said to obviate certain difficulties, such as chain scission or degradation, occurring when attempts were made to employ organic peroxides as cross-linking agents for those polymers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-13\">Carr, the reference which has sparked most of the controversy between appellant and the board, describes various techniques utilized in abortive attempts to produce uniform cell-sized, <em>non-collapsed </em>foams from linear or cross-linked <em>polyethylene </em>starting materials. Discussing his solution to that problem, Carr states:</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-14\">* * * From the foregoing experiments it was felt that linear polyethylene was not suitable as a starting material to produce an acceptable expanded product, and that another starting material would be needed. Pursuant to that conclusion cross-linked polyethylene was employed as the starting material, but it did not work at all, because it was not possible to mix the polymer with the blowing agent to be used in the expansion treatment. After more investigation, it was eventually found that the starting material would have to be polyethylene substantially free of cross-linking for milling purposes <em>and that the polyethylene should he cross-linked </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number><em>with the blowing agent contained therein. </em>[Emphasis supplied.].</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">The resultant polyethylene foam, which is produced by heating a blend of polyethylene, blowing agent and peroxide cross-linking agent, has a uniform \u201cclosed cellular structure of fine pore size\u201d with 88% or more of the cells closed, and a density of \u201cpreferably about 2 to 10 pounds per cubic foot.\u201d It also possesses improved dimensional stability at elevated temperatures and improved recovery from compression over conventional expanded polyethylene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">Said the board:</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">* * * Carr discloses a cross-linked polyethylene foam which corresponds, in physical properties, to the cross-linked polypropylene foam of the claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">With Carr at hand, preparation of a cross-linked polypropylene foam having the same physical properties as Carr\u2019s polyethylene product would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">Appellant argues that the peroxide cross-linking agent disclosed in Carr will not produce a cross-linked polypropylene foam having the claimed physical properties and has made of record an affidavit to this effect executed by George B. Feild.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">Breslow et al. state that organic peroxides are not readily effective for cross-linking alpha-alkyl polymers such as polypropylene and disclose the use of certain azides for cross-linking such polymers. Appellant also employs azide cross-linking agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">The Feild affidavit merely confirms the teachings of Breslow et al. One of ordinary skill in the art of applying the Carr procedure to the preparation of foamed polypropylene would obviously use cross-linking agents known to be applicable to polypropylene rather than those known to be inapplicable thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-15\">It cannot be gainsaid \u2014 appellant\u2019s arguments to the contrary notwithstanding \u2014 that polypropylene foam in general was obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time appellant\u2019s invention was made. Yokose and Hohenberg clearly suggest polyethylene as well as polypropylene foams, albeit of higher density than those claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-16\">From what has been said of the various references cited by the board, we think it is also reasonable to infer that one of ordinary skill in the art at the time appellant\u2019s invention was made had a mental appreciation of the desirability of a polypropylene foam possessing the properties recited in the claims. Carr made available to the art a low density polyethylene foam possessing a high percentage of closed and uniform-sized cells which he was able to produce by including a cross-linking agent in the polymer blend, thus solving a problem of high density, collapsed foams existing in that art. We think the worker of ordinary skill in the art \u2014 after considering Carr\u2019s cross-linking technique, other developments in the cross-linking of polypropylene evidenced by Breslow, and conceded similarities in this particular area of polyethylene and polypropylene technology<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 would realize that a solution of a similar problem in the polypropylene foam art was now possible, and that a polypropylene foam of like physical characteristics and properties to the foam disclosed by Carr was within his grasp, not merely within his contemplation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>Contrary to appellant\u2019s arguments, the board did not err in considering the obviousness of the method of producing the claimed foam as an aspect of the obviousness of the foam itself. While it is true, as appellant urges, that the existence of an obvious method of producing a given product does not necessarily negate patentability of the product so produced,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the method nevertheless is a factor to be considered, along with similarities and differences in structure and properties, in determining obviousness of the subject matter as a whole. In re Hoeksema, 399 F.2d 269, 55 CCPA 1493 (1968), and cases therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">Turning to whether the art was aware of an operative process for implementing, or bringing to fruition, the claimed foam, this court has already held in <em>Lewis </em>that a process for preparing polypropylene foams of density less than 12 lbs./cu.ft. would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill. Here, too, we find no error in the board\u2019s determination, predicated on a somewhat different reference combination, that the same process used to prepare foams of a density less than 10 lbs./cu.ft. would likewise be obvious. We see no reason why one of ordinary skill would not expect the Carr process to produce a polypropylene foam of the recited density and closed cell structure, once that process is suitably modified to incorporate the knowledge imparted to the art by Breslow that poly(sulfonazides) \u2014 not peroxides \u2014 are operative cross-linking agents for polypropylene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">Finally, appellant contends that \u201cone could not predict the properties of a hypothetical cross-linked polypropylene foam from a disclosure [Carr] describing certain properties of a cross-linked polyethylene foam,\u201d inasmuch as there are \u201cdifferences between the polymers.\u201d While we appreciate that polyethylene and polypropylene are \u201cdifferent\u201d polymeric materials, appellant has not explained how, or why, that difference in starting material would be expected to affect or change such properties as density and closed cell structure which are possessed by the foams actually produced by the Carr process, so long as that process is modified as necessary to include known operative cross-linking agents for the particular polymeric starting material employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-10\">We have considered appellant\u2019s remaining arguments, including those relating to the two Feild affidavits, but are not persuaded thereby of reversible error by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">.

Hohenberg, for example, states that the \u201cexpedient of foaming polyolefins is presently appreciated\u201d and that the resultant foam cells \u201cshould be discrete or unicellular (not interconnected)\u201d and \u201cuniformly distributed\u201d to insure optimum insulating and mechanical properties. According to appellant, the foams produced by Hohenberg have a density range of 12.5-56.2 lbs./cu. ft.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">. Appellant\u2019s specification acknowledges that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-13\">Many attempts have been made to apply techniques used for a preparation of polyethylene foams to the preparation of polypropylene foams. For example, it has been suggested that peroxide cross-linking could be used in combination with blowing, but this does not yield, in the case of polypropylene, a closed cell foam. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-18\">As the solicitor points out, it is not surprising that a closed cell foam did not result from the use of peroxide, in light of that material\u2019s lack of efficacy as a cross-linking agent for polypropylene described by Breslow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">.
