Alternatively, she asks that the judgment be vacated and the proceedings remanded to the Secretary for the purpose of receiving additional medical evidence at a hearing. We will grant the alternative relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-16\">Appellant argues that a remand is proper because additional medical evidence is available from a Dr. R. Middleton Frazier, Jr., suggesting a diagnosis of \u201cacute anxiety state with depressive reaction\u201d and \u201canxiety state with psychophysiological reaction.\u201d A reviewing court has authority under \u00a7 205(g), on good cause shown, to order additional evidence taken at the agency level. Moreover, the Secretary has indicated that he has no objection to a remand for the purpose of receiving appellant\u2019s additional medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-17\">In addition, appellant urges this court to order the immediate payment of benefits, arguing that such action is appropriate where a claimant\u2019s case is strong and the Secretary has not affirmatively countered it, and where there has existed a long time interval between the loss of employment and the filing of the claim. An independent review of the record does not convince us that we should order payment of benefits prior to additional agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-18\">The judgment of the district court, 317 F.Supp. 1101, will be vacated with the direction to remand the proceedings to the Secretary to afford appellant the opportunity to present additional medical evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
