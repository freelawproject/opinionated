The District Court found that plaintiffs-appellants failed to prove any injury, loss, or damage as a consequence of their confinement in a \u201cdry cell\u201d which had been maintained as a disciplinary adjunct of defendants-appellees\u2019 maximum security facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-17\">Plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 request for injunctive relief was considered earlier, and in an opinion reported at 301 F.Supp. 786 (M.D.Tenn.1969), it was determined that confinement in the dry cell under the conditions described therein offended the Eighth Amendment guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. An injunction against the continuation of this practice was ordered. Thereafter the court proceeded to consider the prayer for damages which resulted in the judgment from which this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-18\">In that judgment, the District Court found that following the earlier opinion and order, the prison officials eliminated the dry cell and have complied with the order in minute detail. Those findings and the finding that plaintiffs had failed to sustain their burden of proving damages are not clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-19\">The court expresses its appreciation to Richard E. Rudesill, Esq., of the Nashville, Tennessee, Bar, who, without compensation, at the appointment of the court below and of this court, represented the indigent plaintiffs-appellants with dedication and skill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
