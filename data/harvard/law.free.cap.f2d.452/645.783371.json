Assuming, without deciding, that the order is appealable <em>(cf. </em>Weller v. Dickson, 314 F.2d 598 (9th Cir. 1963)), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Magee is currently awaiting trial in a California superior court. Responding to a series of in forma pauperis removal petitions and complaints filed in federal court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the District Judge below entered an order on March 31, 1971, requiring that all of Magee\u2019s complaints \u201cbe lodged with the clerk and be considered by any judge of the Northern District (of California), and then filed only if they are found to have merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">During the next month four more complaints and petitions, including the instant complaint, were received by the district court bearing Magee\u2019s name as one of several parties-plaintiff or filed by him on behalf of someone else. In response to this apparent effort to avoid the previous order, the District Judge entered the order which forms the basis for the current appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201cIn order to effectuate the purpose and intent of this court\u2019s previous order, Mr. Magee will be severed from the other plaintiffs in each of the complaints. To the extent that the complaints relate to claims of Mr. Ma-gee, they will be processed pursuant to this court\u2019s March 31, 1971, order. The complaints of the other plaintiffs will be dismissed without prejudice. Such plaintiffs will be required to state their claims separate and apart from Mr. Magee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">There can be little doubt that the March 31 order was a valid exercise of the court\u2019s authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), which provides that a district court \u201cmay authorize\u201d the commencement of a suit without the prepayment of fees. The order purports to do no more than permit pre-filing review of the complaints or petitions by a district judge, a procedure clearly contemplated under section 1915(a), and governed by the general principles announced in Williams v. Field, 394 F.2d 329 (9th Cir. 1968). <em>See also </em>Benn v. Borden\u2019s Starlac Dry Milk Product, 438 F.2d 523 (9th Cir.1971); Heiser v. Ellsworth, 416 F.2d 19 (9th Cir.1969).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">Having concluded that the March 31 order is valid, it follows that the May 10 order is a proper exercise of the district court\u2019s authority to effectuate compliance with its earlier order. Accordingly, the order lodging Magee\u2019s complaint and refusing to file the complaint of West and Culver until they separate their claim from Magee is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\">. The order indicates that between January 1 and March 31, 1971, Magee had filed 10 complaints or petitions in the Northern District of California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\">. We have indicated that \u201cthe preferable procedure for the District Court to follow is to grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis if the requirements of 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1915(a) are satisfied on the face of the papers submitted, and dismiss the proceeding under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915 (d) if the court thereafter discovers that the allegation of poverty is untrue or the action is frivolous or malicious.\u201d Stiltner v. Rhay, 322 F.2d 314, 317 (9th Cir. 1963). As the cases cited in the text indicate, however, the failure to follow this procedure is not error under appropriate circumstances and, under the circumstances presented by Magee\u2019s numerous petitions and complaints, was not error here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
