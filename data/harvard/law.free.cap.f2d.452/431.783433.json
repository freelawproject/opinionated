(hereafter CSMA), having failed in its efforts to obtain review of the proposed City Regulations in the Board of Standards and Appeals of the City of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>York,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed this action in the District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the City Regulations. CSMA is a non-profit membership corporation composed of approximately 500 suppliers, packagers, and marketers of pressurized products. The essence of its complaint was that in a variety of respects the City Regulations were in impermissible conflict with the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261 et seq. (hereafter the FHSA), and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 135 et seq. (hereafter the FIFRA), and that Congress had fully occupied the field of regulating the testing and labeling of pressurized products subject to those federal laws. The district court concluded that it \u201cshould abstain from exercising jurisdiction and leave the plaintiff and its alleged members to the appropriate and competent State courts in which they may assert all legal defenses available to them. . . .\u2019\u2019It therefore denied an injunction <em>pendente lite </em>and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">We cannot accept the district court\u2019s suggestion that this is an appropriate case for invoking the doctrine of abstention. The Supreme Court has recently observed that the \u201cabstention cases have dealt with unresolved questions of state law which only a state tribunal could authoritatively construe.\u201d Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 438, 91 S.Ct. 507, 511, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971) (citation omitted). Here there is no uncertainty with respect to the City Regulations that would call for construction by the state courts in the first instance. As will be seen, such difficulties in statutory construction as exist pertain rather to the relevant federal laws, and a federal court is better equipped to deal with these. Indeed, abstention is peculiarly inappropriate when the federal claim is that the state has been ousted from jurisdiction. Once the abstention question is out of the way, it is clear that CSMA had standing to seek judicial review on behalf of its members, see, e. g., Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, 354 F.2d 608, 615-617 (2 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 941, 86 S.Ct. 1462, 16 L.Ed.2d 540 (1966), and that the district court had jurisdiction to entertain this preenforcement proceeding, see Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967); Gardner v. Toilet Goods Ass\u2019n, 387 U.S. 167, 87 S.Ct. 1526, 18 L.Ed.2d 704 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Turning to the merits, we begin by noting that the Supreme Court has instructed that \u201cfederal regulation of a field of commerce should not be deemed preemptive of state regulatory power in the absence of persuasive reasons . \u201d, Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 1217, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963), and that, in order for a federal act to preempt state regulation, it must be established that \u201ceither the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has unmistakenly so ordained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, even under this test, CSMA has raised sufficiently substantial questions to warrant factual determination after a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">The heart of the City Regulations is the detailed requirements concerning the testing and labeling as to flammability of all pressurized containers stored, sold, or used in the City of New York; in accordance with these provisions containers may be required to be labeled \u201cextremely flammable,\u201d \u201cflammable,\u201d or \u201ccombustible.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Regulations require similar cautionary labeling with respect to storage fire hazards on all cartons, cases, or other bulk packages of pressurized products, see \u00a7 5(A) (2), and prescribe the manner in which bulk quantities of a pressurized product must be stored depending upon its degree of flammability see \u00a7 6. Container materials, \u00a7. 3, limitations on container capacity, \u00a7 4, as well as complete bans on certain types of pressurized products, \u00a7 8, are also specified. Finally, the manufacturer, agent, or distributor must secure a Certificate of Approval, \u00a7 1(E), or a Permit, \u00a7 1(F), from the Fire Department of the City of New York before storing, selling, or using a pressurized product' in the City of New York, see \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 7, and the number of the Certificate of Permit, together with the name and address of the registered manufacturer, agent, or distributor, must appear, among other places, on each container of a pressurized product, see \u00a7 5(B).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">The FHSA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261, provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-18\">(f) The term \u201chazardous substance\u201d means:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-19\">(1) (A) Any substance or mixture of substances which (i) is toxic, (ii) is corrosive, (iii) is an irritant, (iv) is a strong sensitizer, (v) is flammable or combustible, or (vi) generates pressure through decomposition, heat, or other means, if such substances or mixture of substances may cause substantial personal injury or substantial illness during or as a proximate result of any customary or reasonably foreseeable handling or use, including reasonably foreseeable ingestion by children.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-20\">Certain pressurized products obviously fall within this definition and accordingly the provisions of the federal statute on testing and labeling <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> apply to them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>as do the regulations thereunder which have been adopted by the Food and Drug Administration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With respect to the regulation of products within the FHSA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Congress in 1966 took the rather unusual step of enacting the following express preemption provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">It is hereby expressly declared that it is the intent of the Congress to supersede any and all laws of the States and political subdivisions thereof insofar as they may now or hereafter provide for the precautionary labeling of any substance or article intended or suitable for household use . which differs from the requirements or exemptions of this Act or the regulations or interpretations promulgated pursuant thereto. Any law, regulations, or ordinance purporting to establish such a labeling requirement shall be null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1261 note (b). In light of this, the City Regulations provide that any pressurized product within the FHSA is to be tested and labeled as to flammability in accordance with the provisions of the latter, see \u00a7 5(A) (3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, even those pressurized products within the FHSA must be labeled with a New York City Fire Department Certificate or Permit number together with the name and address of the registered manufacturer, agent, or distributor, see \u00a7 5(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">CSMA\u2019s complaint charges that section 5(B) constitutes an impermissible local labeling requirement in light of the express preemption provision contained in the FHSA. Against this, the dissent suggests that the identification labeling requirement is merely additive; there is no evident conflict between it and the requirements of the FHSA. Indeed, in part, this local labeling requirement is not merely additive but redundant, for the FHSA requires that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>container of a hazardous substance suitable for household use state, among other things, \u201cthe name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, distributor or seller,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261 (p) (1) (A). Thus, only the requirement that the container display the New York City Fire Department Certificate or Permit number is additive.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">At first blush such a requirement does not seem onerous; manufacturers or distributors would only need to stamp the New York number on each pressurized container before storing, selling, or using the product in the City of New York. However, apparently it would be necessary either to segregate a certain number of containers at the point of manufacture, specially marking and routing them for the City of New York, or else to unpack and mark all containers immediately upon arrival in the City. One need only contemplate that many other major cities might establish for pressurized products similar registration provisions bolstered with an identification labeling requirement to realize that the burden thus placed on interstate commerce may be by no means trivial.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Despite this, such a requirement would presumably be valid if CSMA\u2019s ease rested on the Commerce Clause alone or on a federal statute without a preemption clause. See Patapsco Guano Co. v. Board of Agriculture, 171 U.S. 345, 18 S.Ct. 862, 43 L.Ed. 191 (1898); Savage v. Jones, 225 U.S. 501, 32 S.Ct. 715, 56 L.Ed. 1182 (1912); Swift &amp; Co. v. Wickham, 230 F. Supp. 398, 401-403 (S.D.N.Y.1964) aff\u2019d, 364 F.2d 341 (2 Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1036, 87 S.Ct. 776, 17 L.Ed.2d 683 (1967). But here we have not merely a federal labeling statute but an express statement of congressional intent to supersede state and local labeling requirements with respect to products within the FHSA. As the writer has previously said, \u201c[t]he very existence of an express preemption clause is somewhat unusual,\u201d Chrysler Corp. v. Tofany, 419 F.2d 499, 512 (2 Cir. 1969) (concurring opinion); it should not be taken casually. We must therefore explore the meaning of this provision and its legislative history with care.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">In this regard, we note the use of the phrase \u201cprecautionary labeling\u201d in the preemption provision and the reference to this provision in the House Report as a \u201climited preemption amendment.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 2166, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966). In giving meaning to this latter phrase, the legislative history <em>subsequently </em>explains that this \u201climited preemption amendment relates only to labeling and would not preclude States or localities from prohibiting altogether an article * * * which would not be banned under the Federal act if properly labeled.\u201d While Congress thus made clear that it was not preempting local regulation with respect to matters other than labeling, it is also evident that Congress intended to preempt all local regulations with respect to the labeling of products within the FHSA:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">It is impracticable, unnecessary, and undesirable for each [household] product [sold nationally and across state lines] to be labeled specially for those States and cities which have developed their own standards for requiring warnings and their own special forms of warnings over the years during which there was no Federal law. The committee now recommends a limited preemption amendment which would encourage and permit States to adopt requirements identical with the Federal requirements for substances subject to the Federal act, and to enforce them to complement Federal enforcement, <em>but at the same time would free marketers of products sold interstate from varying or added labeling requirements for such substances now existing or which States and cities might otherwise adopt in the future.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOn\">H.R.Rep. No. 2166, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966) (emphasis supplied). U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 4097. Any restricted reading of \u201cprecautionary labeling\u201d not to include such additional labeling as is required under the City Regulations would implicitly suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Congress was not concerned with the burdening of interstate commerce, a position clearly refuted by this legislative history; the flow of commerce in products within the FHSA free of differing labeling requirements was clearly of foremost concern to Congress in enacting the preemption provision. Such a concern would not be served by restricting the express preemption provision to cautionary labeling and sanctioning a proliferation of local requirements with respect to identification labeling.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Compare Campbell v. Hussey, 368 U.S. 297, 82 S.Ct. 327, 7 L.Ed.2d 299 (1961). In sum, the evidence is strong that Congress used the phrase \u201cprecautionary labeling\u201d in the preemption provision in the broad sense of all labeling of hazardous substances covered by the FHSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Thus, this case differs markedly from our decision in Chrysler Corp. v. Tofany, <em>supra. </em>Putting aside the fact that in <em>Tofany </em>we had the benefit of a fully developed record and the views of a number of district judges, the majority there concluded on the basis of rather convoluted legislative history that the overriding purpose of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq., which contained an express preemption provision, was the reduction of traffic accidents, not uniformity of regulation, and analyzed the case accordingly, see 419 F.2d at 508. Here, however, the congressional concern for uniformity of regulation with respect to the labeling requirements for products within the FHSA is unambiguous. <em>We </em>find it impossible to say that appellant has not propounded a claim on this question sufficiently substantial to warrant a trial in which the necessity for the additive label and the seriousness of its effect upon the interstate marketing of pressurized products can be explored.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Turning to the FIFRA, that Act regulates \u201ceconomic poisons\u201d regardless of whether sold in pressurized containers or in other packaging, see 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 135 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Substances within the FIFRA are specifically excluded from the coverage of the FHSA, see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261 (f) (2); the labeling required for such products is specified by 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 135 (z)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and by regulations promulgated under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 135d by the Secretary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Agriculture. A myriad of labeling regulations have been published, including provisions dealing with warnings as to flammability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, since in contrast to the FHSA, the FIFRA contains no explicit expression of congressional intent to preempt local regulation of products within the Act, the City Regulations must fall only if they are in irreconcilable conflict with the labeling requirements of the FIFRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">CSMA contends that such a conflict exists. Apparently the testing procedures under the FIFRA regulations and the City Regulations differ materially with respect to the determination of the labeling as to flammability that a pressurized product should bear. Consequently, differences have been found to result in the label as to flammability which the FIFRA regulations and the City Regulations would require, a fact which an affidavit submitted by the appellees to the court below acknowledges.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> From the information before us, it appears that certain products which would require no special label as to flammability under the FIFRA <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> would be required to be marked \u201cCombustible\u201d under the City Regulations. It could be argued that there is no irreconcilable conflict between the City and the federal regulatory schemes, that the City would merely require more than would the federal government in certain borderline cases. However, if the status of no special label under the federal law were viewed as a distinct category, the City Regulations would, in fact, be inconsistent with the FIFRA regulations rather than supplemental. Indeed, it could be contended that the conflict between local and federal requirements is most significant where federal law would require no special label and the City Regulations would.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Without doubt, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s stringent mandate in Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, <em>supra, </em>373 U.S. at 142, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 10 L.Ed.2d 248, CSMA may have difficulty in ultimately establishing an irreconcilable conflict here. Still, the question is not insubstantial for, as the Supreme Court has recently said, \u201c[t]he constitutional principles of preemption, in whatever particular field of law they operate, are designed with a common end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>in view: to avoid conflicting regulation of conduct by various official bodies which might have some authority over the subject matter.\u201d Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of Street Elec. Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U.S. 274, 285-286, 91 S.Ct. 1909, 1917, 29 L.Ed.2d 473 (1971). Indeed, with federal laws taking over many fields previously regulated by the states or not regulated at all, it is quite conceivable that, in order to avoid undue burdens on interstate commerce, the Supreme Court may move toward a somewhat broader position on preemption than it held a decade ago. In any event, the decision here is not one we either need or ought to make in the absence of a full evidentiary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">In summary, we cannot say at this juncture that CSMA has failed to state any claim warranting consideration on the merits. Contrary to the conclusion reached by the district court, what is needed here is not further delay until some future state enforcement proceeding, but an orderly factual investigation by a federal court of the relationship between the City Regulations and the relevant federal laws. We therefore reverse the decision of the district court dismissing the complaint and remand for a trial on the merits. In addition, having concluded that CSMA has shown a substantial likelihood of at least some success on its claims and having weighed the substantial harm to appellant and its members should the City Regulations be permitted to take effect at once against the minimal harm to the City of New York and its residents if the matter should temporarily be left only to federal regulation, we grant CSMA's request for injunctive relief pending decision of the proceedings below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-10\">. The terms \u201caerosol\u201d and pressurized container are apparently used interchangeably. Commercial ingredients such as insecticides, hair sprays, cleaning fluids, shoe polishes, and many others are packaged in a container together with a gas propellant. When the valve on the container is depressed, a mist consisting of a mixture of the components is expelled. The commercial substance or the propellant or both may be flammable. Fluorocarbon gases which are considered to be non-flammable and hydrocarbon gases which are considered to be flammable are frequently used in combination as a propellant. As a result, use of a pressurized container in conjunction with heat may have a blowtorch effect. Moreover, regardless of the flammability of the components, pressurized containers always have an explosive potential if subjected to heat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-20\">.

In Chrysler Corp. v. Tofany, <em>supra, </em>419 F.2d at 511-512, this court\u2019s decision that the local regulations at issue were not in conflict with a federal regulation was influenced, in part, by the opinion of the promulgating authority, the Federal Highway Administration, that the federal regulation was not intended to deal with the particular matter which the states sought to regulate. Here, however, we deal with a federal statute, not with federal regulations.

The standard aerosol can contains a marketable ingredient (whipped cream, Christmas snow, plant polisher, pet shampoos) and a compressed gas propellant by which the product is self-propelled out of the container when a valve is depressed. Both the main ingredient and the gas propellant may be flammable or nonflammable; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>flammable gas propellant is a hydrocarbon and the nonflammable a fluorocarbon. The ingredient is dispensed when the liquid gas propellant in the container separates from the ingredient, vaporizes, and fills the space above the main ingredient, exerting pressure against the sides of the container and the main ingredient; the pressure forces the main ingredient up a tube to the point of discharge when the valve is pressed. As the main ingredient is dispensed the space filled by the vaporized gas propellant enlarges, until the product in the can is wholly dispensed. Heat may cause the gas to expand to a point of explosion, and according to the affidavit of the Chief Inspector of the Division of Fire Prevention of the City Fire Department, a chemical engineer, this explosive potential, always present when a can is heated whether the propellant is flammable or not, presents a particular hazard where there is a fire. Hydrocarbon gas propellants such as propane, isobutane and butane, or a combination of them, create a blowtorch flame.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The New York City Fire Department has been attempting to regulate pressurized products since 1963. The proposed regulations here involved were finally published on January 31, 1970, with an effective date of July 1, 1970, and some further amendments were made between the publication and effective date of the regulations. In general the regulations require testing and approval prior to sale or storage of pressurized products; specifically set forth tests for classification of the propellants as extremely flammable, flammable or combustible; limit the size of the containers in which the products may be sold or stored; and require cautionary and very precise consumer labeling and storage labeling of cartons, cases or bulk packages of pressurized products. The regulations expressly conform both test methods and labeling requirements to specifications in the Federal Hazardous Substances Act and regulations thereunder, 21 C.F.R. 191. Appeals from the Fire Commissioner\u2019s administration of these regulations may be taken to the City Board of Standards and Appeals pursuant to Sections 666-1.0(3) and 666(6)-1.0 of the New York City Administrative Code (1970), and a number of such appeals are pending but have been stayed while this case has been in process.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Appellant\u2019s contention here that federal law has occupied the field must be examined, as the majority opinion concedes, in the light of Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 1217, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963):</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The principle to be derived from our decisions is that federal regulation of a field of commerce should not be deemed preemptive of state regulatory power in the absence of persuasive reasons \u2014 either that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has unmistakably so ordained. See, <em>e. g., </em>Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit [362 U.S. 440, 80 S.Ct. 813, 4 L.Ed.2d 852 (1960)].</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The principle has in no way been weakened by the 5-4 decision in a labor preemption case, some of the language of which is quoted by the majority here. <em>See </em>Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of Street Elec. Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U.S. 274, 91 S.Ct. 1909, 29 L.Ed.2d 473 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Only recently this court held in Chrysler Corp. v. Tofany, 419 F.2d 499 (2d Cir. 1969), that state regulation of an extra auto headlamp was not preempted by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1425, and regulations pursuant thereto, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 371.21. The Act challenged in <em>Tofany, </em>supra, included a preemption clause, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1392(d). Similarly, in a case involving the labeling of stuffed turkeys, this court found no irreconcilable conflict between the state scheme of regulation under the New York Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7 193 (McKinney Consol. Laws c. 69 1965), and the federal scheme of regulation under the Poultry Products Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 457. Swift &amp; Co. v. Wickham, 364 F.2d 241 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1036, 87 S.Ct. 776, 17 L.Ed.2d 683 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Bearing in mind that \u201cwhere the state\u2019s police power is involved, preemption will not be presumed,\u201d Chrysler Corp. v. Rhodes, 416 F.2d 319, 324 n. 8 (1st Cir. 1969), close examination of the federal statutes and regulations convinces me that there is here no viable claim of irreconcilable conflict with the otherwise eoncededly valid New York City Fire Department pressurized products regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Certain pressurized products obviously fall within the definition of a \u201chazardous substance\u201d in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261(f), and accordingly the provisions of the federal statute on testing and labeling apply to them,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as do the regulations adopted by the Food and Drug Administration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But I fail to see any conflict whatsoever with the City Fire Department regulations which, as previously stated, provide that \u201ccautionary labeling of the individual consumer package and the cartons, cases or similar bulk package\u201d of household products within the purview of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act \u201cshall be in accordance with the test methods and labeling requirements as specified under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act . . . and regulations adopted pursuant to that act . . . .\u201d Sec. 5(A) (3). The majority visualizes some conflict despite this provision because Sec. 5(B) of the New York City Fire Department regulations require identification labeling on both the containers themselves and bulk packages of containers \u2014 identification of the name and address of the manufacturer, agent or distributor listed or authorized in the Fire Department Certificate of Approval or Permit to Manufacture and of the Approval or Permit number. But this very limited identification labeling is additive only. What is the conflict with the <em>cautionary </em>labeling required by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act? The Fire Department labeling simply assists in the enforcement of other city regulations relating to limitation of capacities <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and storage,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which are undeniably non-preempted exercises of state police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">Additionally, as in Chrysler Corp. v. Tofany, supra, there is here an express but limited preemption provision in the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, a provision which was apparently suggested to Congress by appellant here<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">It is hereby expressly declared that it is the intent of the Congress to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>supersede any and all laws of the States and political subdivisions thereof <em>insofar as they may now or hereafter provide for the precautionary labeling </em>of any substance or article intended or suitable for household use (except for those substances defined in sections 2(f) (2) and (3) of this Act) which differs from the requirements or exemptions of this Act or the regulations or interpretations promulgated pursuant thereto. Any law, regulation, or ordinance purporting to establish such a labeling requirement shall be null and void. Federal Hazardous Substances Act, as amended (Pub.L. 91-113, \u00a7 4(b) (1), 83 Stat. 190 (1969), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1261, note (b) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">It is the states\u2019 and cities\u2019 \u201cown special forms of warnings\u201d which the Federal Hazardous Substances Act \u201climited preemption amendment\u201d is directed against, H.Rep. 2166, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966), not other forms of complementary enforcement. It is <em>cautionary </em>labeling of substances which the Federal Hazardous Substances Act prohibits, not identification labeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">The majority opinion says that \u201cprecautionary labeling\u201d in the preemption provision means \u201call labeling.\u201d I believe that Congress has sufficient wisdom to say \u201call labeling\u201d if it means \u201call labeling.\u201d When it chooses to say \u201cprecautionary labeling,\u201d I believe it means labeling pertaining to cautions or warnings. Congress did not say that local or state bodies cannot require identification of products the sale of which they could prohibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">The majority raises the hypothetical and to me entirely inconsequential danger of a \u201cproliferation of local requirements with respect to identification labeling.\u201d When and if such a proliferation occurs it seems to me that may be a matter for Congressional action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>For the federal courts to anticipate such an event and change by a wave of the judicial wand the prohibition against \u201cprecautionary labeling\u201d into one against \u201call labeling\u201d strikes me purely and simply as an exercise of the legislative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Beyond this, here the federal enforcement agency, H.E.W., took the view, in a letter to the New York City Fire Department dated February 20, 1968 (as did the federal enforcing agency in Chrysler Corp. v. Tofany, <em>supra), </em>that the respective federal statutes and regulations did not preclude the challenged local regulations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a view swept aside in a footnote by the majority opinion as apparently lacking in \u201clogic.\u201d Appellant ingeniously argued before us that, because this court narrowly construed the preemption provision involved in the <em>Chrysler </em>case, \u201cchaos\u201d accompanied enforcement of the state regulations and brought about a reversal of the Department of Transportation\u2019s position taken before this court to one favoring preemption.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But the Department of Health, Education and Welfare has not changed its position here. I do not envision any such \u201cchaos\u201d of enforcement, if indeed that were what precipitated the Department of Transportation\u2019s change of viewpoint after <em>Chrysler. </em>I take it that by silence the majority foresees no such chaos either; it simply rejects the H.E.W. view as not founded on \u201clogic.\u201d I should suppose, however, that an administrative interpretation of the words \u201cprecautionary labeling\u201d to mean \u201cprecautionary labeling\u201d and not \u201call labeling\u201d was at least as logical a reading of the statute as any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">It is argued that the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (\u201cFIFRA\u201d or the \u201cInsecticide Act\u201d)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the regulations originally issued thereunder by the Food and Drug Administration but now administered by the Environmental Protection Agency,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> preclude New York City Fire Department regulation of insecticides, plant regulators and weed killers sold in pressurized containers. It is claimed that since the Environmental Protection Agency must review and register pesticides under the Insecticide Act before they can move in interstate commerce, New York City cannot ban the sale of any such registered product. The Insecticide Act regulates \u201ceconomic poisons\u201d such as DDT,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> however, whether or not those poisons are sold as pressurized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>products; hence that Act in no way conflicts with state or local regulation of pressurized products.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The majority opinion relies on language in the FIFRA regulations, however, which purports to regulate the labeling of \u201cpressurized household insecticides\u201d which do not have \u201cextreme flammability or explosive hazards.\u201d See 7 C.F.R \u00a7 2762.113(f) (3), formerly 7 C.F.R \u00a7 362.113(f) (3), and \u00a7 2762.121 (g) (3). Even if the majority were correct, however, this would not justify an injunction against Fire Department regulation of the myriad of products other than pressurized insecticides. Moreover, I fail to see any conflict between these FIFRA regulations and the Fire Department regulations. The majority finds a conflict because two insecticides referred to in an affidavit submitted by appellees would apparently be required under the City regulations to bear a warning of combustibility while they would require no label of any sort under FIFRA regulations. The majority anticipates the counter argument that there is no irreconcilable conflict between the regulatory schemes when in two or three isolated borderline cases the City requires a label where the FIFRA regulations require none. Additionally, however, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the City cautionary label in these instances would not be acceptable to the federal authorities. Moreover, the FIFRA regulations do not, for example, purport to tell us what kind of testing will be required to determine \u201ccombustibility\u201d or \u201cflammability\u201d as opposed to extreme flammability or explosiveness. An irreconcilable conflict is thus presumed where none may well exist. This is the very kind of question which, it seems to me, is better left to case by case examination rather than determination in a sweeping federal court injunction proceeding. As the Supreme Court said in Rice v. Chicago Board of Trade, 331 U.S. 247, 255-256, 67 S.Ct. 1160, 1165, 91 L.Ed. 1468 (1947), a case involving, to be sure, state regulations not finally effective:</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Any claim of supersedure can be preserved in the state proceedings. And the question of supersedure can be determined in light of the impact of a specific order of the state agency on the Federal Act or the regulations of the Secretary thereunder. Only if that procedure is followed can there be preserved intact the whole state domain which in actuality functions harmoniously with the federal system. For even action which seems pregnant with possibilities of conflict may, as consummated, be wholly barren of it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-6\">.

See letter to Rep. Staggers from Assistant Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Huitt, commenting on the Child Protection Act of 1966, reprinted in 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 4102-06 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b501-6\">. The House Committee Report accompanying the 1966 amendment to this Act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">In 1960 this committee and the Senate committee emphasized the importance of uniform regulation of household products at which the act is aimed, which are sold nationally and across State lines. It is impractical, unnecessary, and undesirable for each such product to be labeled specially for those States and cities which have developed their own standards for requiring warnings and their own special forms of warnings over the years during which there was no Federal law. The committee now recommends a <em>limited preemption amendment </em>which would encourage and permit States to adopt requirements identical with the Federal requirements for substances subject to the Federal act, and <em>to enforce them to complement Federal enforcement, </em>but at the same time would free marketers of products sold interstate from varying or adding labeling requirements for such substances now existing or which States and cities might otherwise adopt in the future. This amendment also <em>precludes State or local requirements for cmtionary labeling </em>of substances (distributed interstate or imported) where the alleged hazard is of the general character dealt with by the Federal act but is not of sufficient degree to require cautionary labeling as a hazardous substance under the Federal act; for example, since under the Federal act a substance is not deemed hazardous on account of flammability unless it has a flashpoint of 80\u00b0 F. or below, substances with a higher flashpoint could not be made subject to State or local warning requirements relating to flammability. On the other hand, if the hazard involved is of a kind not dealt with the Federal act, <em>e. g., </em>the hazards involved in power lawnmowers, the States and localities would continue to be free to impose warning requirements though there is no such Federal requirement. Moreover, <em>the limited preemption amendment relates only to labeling and would not preclude States or localities from prohibiting altogether an article, </em>such as fireworks, which would not be banned under the Federal act if properly labeled.</p>\n<p id=\"AnCD\">H.Rep.No.2166, 89th Cong.,</p>\n<p id=\"AM3\">2d Sess.
