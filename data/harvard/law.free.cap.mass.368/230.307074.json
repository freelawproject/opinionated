In his declarations,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff alleges that his fall \u201cwas due to the negligent and careless manner in which said ladder was manufactured, designed, and constructed.\u201d The two actions were consolidated for trial in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston. In the action brought against the manufacturer of the ladder, John S. Tilley Co., Inc. (Tilley), the trial judge, after denying the defendant\u2019s request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>rulings,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> found for the plaintiff in the amount of $1,000. In the action brought against the wholesaler of the ladder, Lynn Ladder Co., Inc. (Lynn Ladder), the trial judge, after denying five<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the plaintiff\u2019s six requests for rulings, found for the defendant. The plaintiff and Tilley, alleging that they were aggrieved by the judge\u2019s denial of their requests for rulings, claimed reports to the Appellate Division of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 108. These reports were consolidated into a single report which stated that it \u201ccontains all the evidence material to the questions reported.\u201d The Appellate Division vacated the judge\u2019s finding for the plaintiff against Tilley and directed that a finding be entered for the defendant in each case. We treat the Appellate Division\u2019s order that a finding be entered for Lynn Ladder as a dismissal of the report in the plaintiff\u2019s case against Lynn Ladder. The plaintiff appealed to this court from the Appellate Division\u2019s orders. We transferred the cases to the Appeals Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 12. The Appeals Court affirmed the orders of the Appellate Division in both cases. <em>Coyne </em>v. <em>John S. Tilley Co. Inc. </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 641 (1974). The cases are before us for further appellate review on the plaintiff\u2019s application. The principal question presented for our decision is whether the evidence warranted a finding for the plaintiff in either case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We summarize the evidence contained in the report to the Appellate Division of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was employed as a night cleaner by York Realty, Inc. (York). On the evening of May 12, 1969, the plaintiff ascended a six-foot aluminum stepladder in order to wash an overhead transom and door. After he had perched on the ladder \u201cfor a minute or so,\u201d a leg of the ladder \u201ccollapsed inward at a 45\u00b0 angle.\u201d The plaintiff was thrown to the floor and suffered injuries. Prior to the accident, the ladder had appeared to the plaintiff to be \u201cfree of defects.\u201d \u201c[T]he legs were straight, the finish was clean and bright, and it appeared new.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The ladder in question was manufactured by the defendant Tilley. At some unstated time, the ladder was sold by Tilley to Lynn Ladder, also a defendant. On March 26, 1969, Lynn Ladder sold the ladder to Warren Electric &amp; Hardware Supply Co., Inc. (Warren), which sold the ladder to York the following day. There was evidence that, before Lynn Ladder shipped ladders to customers, the ladders were inspected. There was further evidence that the president of Lynn Ladder examined the ladder in question prior to shipment to Warren and found it in good condition without apparent defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The ladder was stored by York in the cellar storeroom of the building in which the plaintiff was working on the night of his accident. At some unspecified time, the night supervisor of the building, the plaintiff\u2019s brother, had removed the ladder from the storeroom and had given it to the plaintiff for use in his job. There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>evidence that the night supervisor had observed the ladder and thought it free from defects: \u201c [T]he legs were straight, and the surface of the ladder was shiny and free from dirt or paint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s theory of recovery in each case is the principle of negligence we announced in <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Yardley </em>&amp; <em>Co. Ltd. </em>319 Mass. 92, 96 (1946): \u201c[A] manufacturer or other person owning or controlling a thing that is dangerous in its nature or is in a dangerous condition, either to his knowledge or as a result of his want of reasonable care in manufacture or inspection, who deals with or disposes of that thing in a way that he foresees or in the exercise of reasonable care ought to foresee will probably carry that thing into contact with some person, known or unknown, who will probably be ignorant of the danger, owes a legal duty to every such person to use reasonable care to prevent injury to him.\u201d Accord, <em>Ricciutti </em>v. <em>Sylvania Elec. Prod. Inc. </em>343 Mass. 347, 352-353 (1961). The plaintiff argues that the defendants had a duty to discover defects in the ladder which, in his view of the evidence, caused its collapse when it was put to a normal and foreseeable use.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Though the <em>Yardley </em>case eliminated the privity of contract requirement in actions for the negligent manufacture and sale of a product <em>(Carter </em>v. <em>Yardley &amp; Co. Ltd., supra, </em>at 96-97, 104), the case did not relieve the plaintiff of the burden of proving that a defect attributable to a manufacturer\u2019s (and in this case a wholesaler\u2019s as well) negligence caused his injuries. <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>346 Mass. 225, 230 (1963). <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Bereault, </em>348 Mass. 502, 506 (1965). In the instant case, the plaintiff has adduced no direct evidence as to the specific acts or omissions by the defendants which constituted negligence and as to the specific defect of manufacture which caused the accident. Cf. <em>Kalash </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Ladder Co. </em>1 Cal. 2d 229 (1934). To sustain his burden of proof, the plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence and, consequently, on an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ference of negligence which, he claims, one may permissibly draw from the occurrence of the accident. We pass to a consideration of the sufficiency of the evidence to support that inference against each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The Case Against Tilley.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The nature of the inference on which the plaintiff would rely in this case has been described in <em>Evangelio </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Bottling Co. Inc. </em>339 Mass. 177, 180 (1959): \u201c[T]he tribunal of fact [is permitted], if it sees fit, to draw from the occurrence itself of an unusual event the conclusion that it would not have happened unless the defendant had been negligent. It does no more than recognize that negligence and causation, like other facts, may be established by circumstantial evidence.\u201d Accord, <em>Roscigno </em>v. <em>Colonial Beacon Oil Co. </em>294 Mass. 234 (1936). In drawing this inference and determining that there is a balance of probabilities in favor of negligence, the trier of fact must be able to find, either from common knowledge <em>(Graham </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>164 Mass. 42, 47 [1895]; <em>Zentz </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno, </em>39 Cal. 2d 436, 442 [1952]) or from expert testimony <em>(James </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>204 Mass. 158, 162 [1910]; <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>346 Mass. 225, 231 [1963]) that the occurrence of the accident shows negligence as a cause. <em>Roscigno </em>v. <em>Colonial Beacon Oil Co., supra, </em>at 235. <em>Evangelio </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Bottling Co. Inc., supra, </em>at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">We believe that a trier of fact could infer as matter of common knowledge<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that a relatively new aluminum stepladder would not collapse in such a way that one of its legs was bent inward in a 45\u00b0 degree angle in the course of usage unless someone had been negligent. Plainly, a properly fabricated and designed aluminum ladder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>which had received proper care and usage would not collapse if put to the use for which it was intended. See <em>Jiminez </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. 4 </em>Cal. 3d 379, 387 (1971). There are numerous conceivable acts of negligence which might have contributed to the collapse: A leg of the ladder might have been constructed with defective materials and then inadequately tested by the manufacturer. The ladder might not have been designed to support a load which the manufacturer should reasonably have expected the ladder to hold. The ladder might have been mishandled by a middleman in the distribution process. At the time of the accident, a leg of the ladder might have been positioned in such a way that it could not withstand the weight applied, or, in the alternative, the weight applied might have been excessive when considered in light of the ladder\u2019s manifest construction and design. In any event, the likelihood that the collapse was caused by some negligent act could be found to be greater than that it was not. Just as in the case of a mysteriously exploding bottle (see <em>Evangelio </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Bottling Co. Inc., supra) </em>or a mysteriously malfunctioning automobile transmission (see <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>346 Mass. 225 [1963]), the occurrence of this accident will support an inference of negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">However, the above mentioned <em>inference </em>alone will not support a finding for the plaintiff in the instant case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u201cWhere, as here, the accident occurs after the defendant has surrendered control of the instrumentality involved, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to show that the instrumentality had not been improperly handled by himself or by intermediate handlers.\u201d <em>Evangelio </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Bottling Co. Inc. </em>339 Mass. 177, 183 (1959). <em>Rafferty </em>v. <em>Hull Brewing Co. </em>350 Mass. 359, 363 (1966). The evidence introduced must he of such a nature that it warrants a reasonable inference that the particular defendant-manufacturer, rather than another, bears responsibility for the negligence which, one may infer, caused the accident. <em>Zentz </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of </em>Fresno, 39 Cal. 2d 436, 447 (1952). Harper &amp; James, Torts, \u00a7 19.7, pp. 1085, 1093-1094 (1956). See <em>Rafferty </em>v. <em>Hull Brewing Co. </em>350 Mass. 359, 362 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We believe that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence was sufficient to warrant exclusion of negligence by intermediate handlers as a cause of the ladder\u2019s collapse. Cf. <em>Kenney </em>v. Sears, <em>Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>355 Mass. 604, 607 (1969). There was evidence that three people, the president of Lynn Ladder, the night supervisor, and the plaintiff, had observed the ladder and had noticed no defects. There was evidence that, prior to the accident, the ladder had appeared new to the plaintiff. Its finish had been clean and bright. The trier of fact could deem it improbable that a ladder which appeared bright, new and defect-free to these observers had been damaged significantly by handling between the time it left the manufacturer\u2019s control and the time of the plaintiff\u2019s use.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>General Tire </em>&amp; <em>Rubber Co. </em>3 Utah 2d 354, 360 (1955). Cf. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Barker Bros. Corp. </em>267 Cal. App. 2d 530 (1968). In this respect, this case is similar to prior cases in which evidence of the intact appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>of a carton used in transporting bottles <em>(Jankelle </em>v. <em>Bishop Indus. Inc. </em>354 Mass. 491, 493 [1968]) and of the defect-free appearance of a carbonated beverage bottle at the time of sale <em>(MacDonald </em>v. <em>Najjar,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>362 Mass. 119, 122 [1972]) was held sufficient to warrant a finding that the bottles had not been damaged by handlers intervening between the injured victim and a defendant manufacturer. Cases such as <em>Selissen </em>v. <em>Empire Bottling Co. Inc. </em>343 Mass. 779 (1962), and <em>Rafferty </em>v. <em>Hull Brewing Co. </em>350 Mass. 359 (1966), in which no admissible evidence of due care by intermediate handlers was introduced, are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Though the evidence presented by the plaintiff was sufficient to warrant a finding that the actions of intermediate handlers had not contributed to the ladder\u2019s collapse, his evidence was insufficient to exclude his own actions as a cause for the ladder\u2019s collapse. The evidence concerning the plaintiff\u2019s use of the ladder is meager. The report recites only the most general evidence about the plaintiff\u2019s actions prior to the accident. It notes only that he was on the ladder briefly while washing the door and overhead transom. There is no evidence that the plaintiff put the ladder to the normal use for which it was intended. Cf. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Barker Bros. Corp. </em>267 Cal. App. 2d 530, 533 (1968). He could have overloaded the ladder with a variety of cleaning paraphernalia or could have placed the ladder so that the leg which subsequently was bent inward bore an inordinate proportion of the weight. From the evidence, a finder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>fact could not say that it is more likely that the plaintiff handled the ladder properly than that the collapse of the ladder resulted from his contributory actions or carelessness. Cf. <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>346 Mass. 225, 231 (1963) (testimony by the plaintiff and another that selector lever of car was in neutral position at time of accident). Without further evidence,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c [i]t cannot be said, when a step ladder breaks, that the fact of its breaking by common experience points more closely to a defect in the appliance than to some carelessness on the part of the person using it.\u201d <em>Drum </em>v. <em>New England Cotton Yarn Co. </em>180 Mass. 113, 114 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the evidence is insufficient to warrant the plaintiff\u2019s recovery against Tilley and that the trial judge erred in denying Tilley\u2019s request for a ruling that \u201c [t]he evidence does not warrant a finding that the defendant, its agents, or servants was [sic] negligent.\u201d \u201c[T]he inference of negligence does not point to the defendant until the plaintiff himself has been eliminated as a cause.\u201d Prosser, Res Ipsa Loquitur in California, 37 Cal. L. Rev. 183, 201 (1949). \u201cThe plaintiff need not exclude every possible cause for his injuries. He is only required to show a greater likelihood that his injury was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence than by some other cause.\u201d <em>Jankelle </em>v. <em>Bishop Indus. Inc. </em>354 Mass. 491, 494 (1968). <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Najjar, </em>362 Mass. 119, 122 (1972). This he did not do.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>There is no merit to the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the requirement that he exclude his own actions as a cause of the ladder\u2019s collapse contravenes G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85 (as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1123, \u00a7 1). The statute provides that \u201cthe plaintiff shall be presumed to have been in the exercise of due care\u201d and places the burden of proving contributory negligence by the plaintiff on the defendant. It is settled that the statute did not \u201cchange the substantive law of negligence in any respect, but simply affected procedure and the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>322 Mass. 206, 209 (1948). \u201c [Tjhe whole practical effect of the statute\u201d is to place the burden of proof of contributory negligence on the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 210. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>John Bean Div. of Food Mach. </em>&amp; <em>Chem. Corp. </em>344 Mass. 420, 425-426 (1962). Yet, the requirement that the plaintiff eliminate his own handling of the product as a cause of his injuries is analytically distinct from a requirement, in violation of the statute, that he prove the absence of contributory negligence. Generally, we agree that the requirement, in cases such as this, that the plaintiff exclude his own actions as a cause of his injuries \u201cshould not be confused with the problem of contributory negligence, as to which defendant has the burden of proof, and its purpose, like that of control by the defendant, is merely to assist the court in determining whether it is more probable than not that the defendant was responsible for the accident.\u201d <em>Zentz </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno, </em>39 Cal. 2d 436, 444 (1952). Proof which excludes the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>handling of the product as a cause of its failure \u201ccomplete [s] the basis for an inference,\u201d drawn from the occurrence of the accident, that the defendant-manufacturer\u2019s negligence proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Harper &amp; James, Torts, \u00a7 19.8, p. 1093 (1956). Frumer &amp; Friedman, Products Liability, \u00a7 12.03 [4], pp. 306-307 (1974). Without such proof, the fact finder could not conclude that the occurrence of the accident was most likely caused by the negligence of that particular defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The Case Against Lynn Ladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s case against Lynn Ladder must fail for the same reasons as his case against Tilley. The plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence so that an inference can be drawn that the collapse of the ladder resulted from some negligent act. He has not, however, sufficiently excluded his own actions as a cause of its collapse. His evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that some defect in the ladder more probably than not caused its collapse. Thus, a trier of fact could not find from the evidence introduced that a failure of Lynn Ladder to inspect the ladder so as to discover the defect, if, in fact, Lynn Ladder had such a duty of inspection<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (compare <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Louis K. Liggett Co. </em>282 Mass. 438, 441-442 [1933], and <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Stineway Drug Store Co. </em>38 Ill. App. 2d 415, 426-429 [1963], with <em>Gauld </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins.

L. R. 3d 12 [1966]), or mishandling by Lynn Ladder (see <em>Rafferty </em>v. <em>Hull Brewing Co. </em>350 Mass. 359, 362 [1966]) amounted to negligence for which the plaintiff could have recovery. The judge properly denied the plaintiff\u2019s request for a ruling that \u201c [t]he evidence warrants a finding for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In the case against Tilley, the order of the Appellate Division vacating the finding for the plaintiff and directing a finding for the defendant is affirmed.

Because of this holding, we have no occasion here to consider the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence regarding his <em>prior </em>handling of the ladder. We emphasize that, in cases in which a plaintiff relies on an inference of negligent manufacture drawn from the occurrence of an accident, the plaintiff must demonstrate that his prior handling did not damage the product and contribute to the accident. Evidence of his proper prior handling is as essential to the plaintiff\u2019s case as evidence of proper use at the time of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"> We do not now express our opinion as to the nature and extent of the duty of inspection which a wholesaler in the exercise of due care owes to a remote purchaser of a ladder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
