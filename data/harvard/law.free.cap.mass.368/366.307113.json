A number of police officers were present. There was a scuffle between some of the demonstrators and the police, the details of which remain rather obscure in the abbreviated record before us. As a result of the encounter, one of the group, the defendant Coleman P. Harrison, was indicted for armed robbery (taking a service revolver out of the possession of Officer Thomas Matthews with the threat of a knife) and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (kicking Officer Matthews).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>trial in the Suffolk Superior Court, the defendant was convicted by a jury of the lesser included offenses of larceny from the person and simple assault and battery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sentence on the larceny conviction was six months in a house of correction, suspended, with three years\u2019 probation; there was a like sentence on the assault conviction, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">On a substitute bill of exceptions to the Appeals Court, the defendant raised only the points that the trial judge committed error in denying, in part, a motion with respect to the conduct of the voir dire examination of prospective jurors, and in denying also a motion, after trial and verdict, for a new trial. The Appeals Court overruled the exceptions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 775 (1975). On the defendant\u2019s application, we granted further review. G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7 11. We agree with the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">1. <em>Motion at voir dire. </em>At commencement of trial, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, as it then stood,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for an order that he be permitted to put seventeen questions to the prospective jurors individually; in the alternative, counsel asked the judge to put these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>An affidavit of counsel filed in support of the motion stated that \u201c[t]he media, both newspapers and radio and television reported incidents of violence in connection with the gathering. The media also reported injuries to certain policemen. The newspapers reported that some of the participants were members of radical\u2019 political groups.\u201d The affidavit went on to say that \u201camong a substantial proportion of the population there exists hostility toward young persons, especially those engaging in political protest.\u201d Counsel mentioned a few trials known to him where prospective jurors in response to particular questions had acknowledged biases which, in counsel\u2019s opinion, they would not have admitted in answer to questions of a more general character.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Of the seventeen questions proffered in the motion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the judge accepted three:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> whether the prospective jurors were relatives of or acquainted with named police officers, or relatives of any policemen or law enforcement officers, or acquainted with the attorneys in the case. He also undertook to put the substance of a fourth question inquiring what the prospective jurors had learned through the news media about the episode in Roxbury on May 7 involving a protest against Medicaid, welfare, and other matters, and arrests or charges connected therewith. Questions refused by the judge asked whether the prospective jurors were aware of feelings of hostility toward persons engaged in peaceful protest of governmental activities, or believed those persons to be unpatriotic or more likely to commit crimes than persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>not so engaged; whether they were aware of feelings of hostility toward the welfare or Medicaid system; whether they believed youthful persons had less right to make judgments on governmental activities than other persons; whether they believed the testimony of police officers should by reason of their status be given greater credence than the testimony of others.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Although refusing the questions mentioned, the judge put questions (mostly deriving from \u00a7 28) as to whether the prospective jurors had an interest in the case or had expressed or formed an opinion about the guilt or innocence of the defendant or anyone else connected with the indictments; whether they were conscious of any bias or prejudice for or against the defendant or the Commonwealth; and whether they were satisfied they could afford the defendant a fair trial basing their decisions solely on the evidence produced in court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We should add that in the course of trial the judge again cautioned the jury that they were to reach their verdict on the evidence presented in court, and that only. In his charge to the jury (to which no exception was taken), the judge, besides warning against bias, said that the case involved only particular criminal charges, that no political or social philosophy was on trial; that the merit or lack of it of the welfare system was not on trial, nor the validity of anyone\u2019s protest; that the appearance of anyone, whether short or long haired, clean shaven or bearded, was not the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The defendant argues that in the judge\u2019s denial (in part) of the voir dire motion there was error amounting to deprivation of the constitutional right to an impartial jury. The error, if there was one, could lie only in the judge\u2019s declining to go further in particularizing or making specific the questions as to interest or bias or prejudice that he did ask. Traditionally we have held that it is within the wide discretion of the trial judge whether to refine or improve on the subjects of G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, by going into more detail. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>324 Mass. 714, 717-718 (1949); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonomi, </em>335 Mass. 327, 334-335 (1957); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geagan, </em>339 Mass. 487, 504 (1959), cert. den. 361 U. S. 895 (1959); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kudish, </em>362 Mass. 627, 632 (1972). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Malinowski, </em>347 F. Supp. 347 (E. D. Pa. 1972), affd. 472 F. 2d 850 (3d Cir. 1973), cert. den. 411 U. S. 970 (1973). \u201cIf trial by jury is not to break down by its own weight, it is not feasible to probe more than the upper levels of a juror\u2019s mind.\u201d L. Hand, J., in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>183 F. 2d 201, 227 (2d Cir. 1950), affd. on other grounds, 341 U. S. 494 (1951). We have been content to allow the trial judge a fair leeway in deciding how deep the probe should go, having in view the nature of the case as the judge apprehends it at the start.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">It is true that in <em>Ham </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>409 U. S. 524 (1973), the Supreme Court decided, in a case involving a black activist who claimed to have been framed by the police, that questions addressed simply to prejudice were not constitutionally sufficient, that the jurors must be asked in one way or another whether they were conscious of racial prejudice. Just how exacerbated a situation must be in order to raise this right under the Constitution is still a matter of debate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, it is clear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>court saw a difference between racial prejudice and other kinds of possible bias \u2014 for example a bias against bearded men, the defendant in the <em>Ham </em>case being such a man. The court said, \u201cThe inquiry as to racial prejudice derives its constitutional stature from the firmly established precedent of <em>Aldridge </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>283 U. S. 308 (1931)]<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the <em>numerous </em>state cases upon which it relied, and from a principal purpose as well as from the language of those who adopted the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d 409 U. S. at 528. In holding that, so far as the Constitution was concerned, the prospective jurors need not be questioned about prejudice against bearded men, the court said: \u201cGiven the traditionally broad discretion accorded to the trial judge in conducting <em>voir dire </em>. . . and our inability to constitutionally distinguish possible prejudice against beards from a host of other possible similar prejudices, we do not believe the petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights were violated when the trial judge refused to put this question. . . . The trial judge\u2019s refusal to inquire as to particular bias against beards, after his inquiries as to bias in general, does not reach the level of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">It may be that the States are constitutionally free or nearly so to allow their trial judges their \u201ctraditionally broad discretion\u201d when the claimed bias does not relate to race but to other matters. But assuming that the <em>Ham </em>case could find its counterpart in some strong case in a field outside race,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we do not think counsel\u2019s slim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>affidavit \u2014 which, as the Appeals Court indicated, was less a statement of facts than a piece of legal argumentation<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 portrayed a situation of such dimensions or exigency or so fraught with appeals to unreason as to require at voir dire an extraordinary quiz of prospective jurors as a constitutional right.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The case was perhaps stronger than one concerned with beards, but it was closer to beards than to problems of race. The logic of the collection of possible biases to which the proposed questions spoke could suggest for this case, and for many others, a still larger melange of biases and a multiplication of questions in which the constitutional thread would be hard indeed to follow. We conclude that there was no violation of the State or Federal Constitution in the present case, nor do we see any occasion for overriding the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion on any nonconstitutional ground. This is not to say that the judge would have been wrong, had he chosen to go further in adopting questions tendered by the defendant; and a recent amendment of \u00a7 28<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> will for the future lend encourage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ment to judges\u2019 taking such a course on defendants\u2019 requests in cases of doubt. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lumley, </em>367 Mass. 213, 216-217 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">2. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>Five days after the jury had rendered their verdicts and been discharged, one of the jurors had an interview with the trial judge. He reported that while the jury were considering their verdicts, one juror said the defendant was a communist and the judge should hang the whole bunch of them (presumably the demonstrators) for what they were doing; another juror, trying to persuade the reporting juror how to vote, said the defendant was just a \u201cbum.\u201d Also, the foreman said he, the foreman, had been approached after the jury deliberations by a third juror who called the defendant a communist. Reminded by the judge that he had joined in the guilty verdicts, the reporting juror said he still had a question whether the defendant was guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">On the basis of the report, the defendant moved for a new trial, which the judge denied after hearing. That decision so far as it rested in discretion is of course entitled to respect. Independently considered, it seems correct. The defendant expressly disclaims any effort to use the reporting juror\u2019s statement to \u201cimpeach the verdict,\u201d presumably by showing that one or more jurors were influenced by considerations extraneous to the evidence, and in this connection he accepts as relevant and does not challenge those decisions which have barred testimony of jurors about jury misconduct. See <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>107 Mass. 453, 458-471 (1871); Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Meserve, </em>156 Mass. 61, 62 (1892); <em>Dixon </em>v. A. <em>J. Cunningham Co. </em>257 Mass. 63, 71 (1926); anno. 58 A. L. R. 2d 556 (1958). Cf. A. B. A. Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Trial by Jury, \u00a7 5.7 (Approved Draft 1968); Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 606, 28 U. S. C. App. (Supp. V, 1975). The precise ground of the motion for a new trial was that the juror\u2019s report lent weight to the original contention that the proposed questions should have been asked at voir dire. However, the obvious reasons of policy, which put a damper on the use of jurors\u2019 testimony to impeach a verdict, would seem to inhibit as well the use of such testimony for the purpose here suggested by the defendant. We may add that among the defendant\u2019s seventeen questions none mentioned communism; the only connection came during trial when pictures of the May 7 gathering showed a display of red flags. There must be some limit to the use of matters not thought of at voir dire to prove that the trial judge made a mistake at that time. If later events. could be taken into account, one might point to the fact that the jury were apparently not runaway or overborne by passion; they convicted of the lesser offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Departing from the reason assigned in his motion for a new trial, the defendant now suggests that the juror\u2019s report indicates that one or more jurors swore falsely at voir dire when they said or implied, in response to the judge\u2019s question on the point, that they were not biased against the defendant, and by that falsehood \u2014 so the defendant argues \u2014 instantly disqualified themselves as jurors, thereby voiding any subsequent verdict in which they participated. Assuming, but only for purposes of argument, the proposition that a juror\u2019s statement that would not be received to impeach the verdict could nevertheless be received to disqualify a juror, and the further proposition that a false statement by a juror at voir dire automatically renders him a nonjuror and undermines the verdict, we think the defendant is not helped. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>It would surely be required that the falsehood be not only unmistakable but material and knowing. But a juror who at the close of trial might think that the defendant should be convicted because he was a communist or a \u201cbum,\u201d might quite conscientiously have believed himself free of prejudice at voir dire. Cases cited by the defendant hardly go as far as his argument would require. See <em>Clark </em>v. <em>United States, </em>289 U. S. 1 (1933); <em>People </em>v. <em>Castaldia, </em>51 Cal. 2d 569 (1959); <em>State </em>v. <em>Levitt, </em>36 N. J. 266 (1961); <em>People </em>v. <em>Leonti, </em>262 N.
