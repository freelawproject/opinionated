The taxpayer\u2019s petition, brought under the formal procedure (G. L. c. 58A, <em>\u00a7 </em>7), alleged that \u201c[o]n or about September 15, 1973 . . . four bills or \"notices of taxes\u201d were sent to the taxpayer, that these were received \u201cabout September 15, 1973,\u201d that \u201c[o]n or about October 5, 1973\u201d'the taxpayer \u201capplied in writing\u201d on proper forms for an abatement of the taxes, and that on October 31, 1973, the taxpayer paid more than one-half of the taxes due (see G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 64). The petition alleged further that the assessors \u201cdid not thereafter notify the . . . [taxpayer] of any action having been taken on said application\u201d and that \u201ctherefore, the same is deemed to have been denied.\u201d See G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 64.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The assessors filed a motion to dismiss<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the taxpayer\u2019s appeal to the board on the ground that the taxpayer\u2019s application for abatement had not been filed within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>time prescribed by G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59. After a hearing at which evidence was taken, the board allowed the assessors\u2019 motion and rendered a decision for the assessors. The taxpayer appealed. The appeal is before us now on the pleadings, certain exhibits and the board\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact and Report.\u201d There is no transcript of the proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">1. General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 59, as amended through St. 1974, c. 831, \u00a7 4, permits an application for abatement to be filed \u201con or before October first of the year to which the tax relates or, if the tax is other than a poll tax and the bill or notice was first sent after September first of such year, on or before the thirtieth day after the date on which the bill or notice was sent.\u201d Adherence to the schedule of application incorporated in G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, is an essential prerequisite to effective application for abatement of taxes and to prosecution of appeal from refusals to abate taxes. \u201c[T]he time within which the application is to be made is not a mere matter of limitation but is an integral part of the right [to apply for abatement of taxes assessed], and the failure to apply within the prescribed time destroys the right.\u201d <em>Old </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>Colony R.R. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Quincy, </em>305 Mass. 509, 511-512 (1940). Accord, <em>Canron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Everett, </em>366 Mass. 634, 637, n. 4 (1975). Manifestly, there can be no appeal to the board on the merits after the right to apply to the assessors for abatement has been lost through failure to follow statutory procedures. \u201cSince the remedy by abatement is created by statute the board . . . has no jurisdiction to entertain proceedings for relief by abatement begun at a later time or prosecuted in a different manner than is prescribed by the statute.\u201d <em>Singer Sewing Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>341 Mass. 513, 516 (1960), quoting from <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Suffolk Law Sch. </em>295 Mass. 489, 492 (1936). Cf. <em>New England Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>308 Mass. 543, 544-545 (1941); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>333 Mass. 501 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In the instant case, after hearing evidence, the board found that the tax bills were sent to the taxpayer on August 31, 1973, and, pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, that the application for abatement dated October 5, 1973, was received<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by the assessors on October 9, 1973. On these facts, the board quite properly concluded that the application had not been timely and that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">2. The taxpayer challenges the board\u2019s finding that the tax bill was sent on August 31, 1973, on the ground that the finding was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>The taxpayer asserts that, when considered in light of testimony that \u201cthe bills were received in Cambridge on September 17, 1973,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the assessors\u2019 evidence before the board was insufficient to support the board\u2019s finding that the bills were mailed on August 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">An appellant may challenge the findings of the board on the ground that they are unsupported by substantial evidence. Although a 1968 amendment (St. 1968, c. 120) to G. L. c. 30A, the State Administrative Procedure Act, exempted the board from the provisions of the act, the board is still bound by \u201cgeneral principles affecting administrative decisions and judicial review of them.\u201d <em>Assessors of New Braintree </em>v. <em>Pioneer Valley Academy, Inc. </em>355 Mass. 610, 612, n. 1 (1969). Cf. <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass. 1, 10-11 (1975). In accordance with such principles, findings of fact by the board must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Schlaiker </em>v. <em>Assessors of Great Barrington, </em>365 Mass. 243, 245, n. 2 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">However, to invoke review by this court, an appellant must supply a proper record. The appellant has the duty to assemble such materials as will make it possible for the court to consider the points of law he raises. It seems axiomatic that one who challenges a factual finding of the board on the ground that it is not supported by substantial evidence must supply at least the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>portion of the transcript of the hearing. Rule 8 (b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure, 365 Mass. 849 (1974), incorporated by reference in G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 5, requires that \u201c[i]f the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, he shall include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to such finding or conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 10. In the context of appeals from the board and its predecessor, the Board of Tax Appeals, we have said repeatedly that \u201c[s]o far as the [board\u2019s] findings are based upon unreported evidence they cannot be disturbed.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Coomey </em>v. <em>Assessors of Sandwich, </em>367 Mass. 836, 839 (1975), quoting from <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>J. G. McCrory Co. </em>280 Mass. 273, 278 (1932). Accord, <em>Revere </em>v. <em>Revere Constr. Co. </em>285 Mass. 243, 247 (1934); <em>Commissioner of Corps. </em>&amp; <em>Taxn. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>308 Mass. 558, 572 (1941); <em>DeCordova </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>314 Mass. 371, 374 (1943). Cf. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>310 Mass. 674, 677-678 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">In the instant case, the failure of the taxpayer to secure a copy of the transcript for inclusion in the record on appeal limits the scope of our review. Without the evidence before us, we cannot consider the taxpayer\u2019s claim that a finding of the board was unsupported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>substantial evidence. The summary of evidence contained in the board\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact and Report\u201d is no substitute for a transcript. Before any evidence was offered, it was open to the taxpayer to request an official report of the proceedings. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 10. Rule 28 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Appellate Tax Board (1974). Having neglected to make such a timely request, the taxpayer cannot now press a question of law concerning substantial evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">3. The taxpayer also contends that the board\u2019s action in allowing the motion to dismiss denied it due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The taxpayer argues that the interval between September 17, 1973, the date on which it alleges the tax bill was received, and October 1, 1973, the date by which it would have had to file an application for abatement to comply with the jurisdiction requirements imposed by the board, was too short to afford it a practical opportunity to file for an abatement and obtain review of the assessors\u2019 determination. The taxpayer concedes that the constitutional question was not raised before the board, but asserts that an issue of constitutional law may be presented to this court although it was not argued before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Once again, we do not reach the merits of the taxpayer\u2019s argument. General Laws c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 5, provides that \u201c[t]he court shall not consider any issue of law which does not appear to have been raised in the proceedings before the board.\u201d As the due process issue was not so raised, it is not properly before us. See, e.g., <em>Assessors of Worcester </em>v. <em>Knights of Columbus Religious Educ. Charitable &amp; Benevolent Assn. of Worcester, </em>329 Mass. 532, 534 (1952); <em>Assessors of Everett </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co. </em>330 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Mass. 464, 466 (1953); <em>Assessors of Dover </em>v. <em>Dominican Fathers Province of St. Joseph, </em>334 Mass. 530, 535 (1956); <em>Cacciatore </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. ante, </em>149, 151 (1975). Although a limited exception to the statutory rule has been developed for jurisdictional questions, which entail a fundamental determination of the scope of the power conferred on the board by the Legislature and a cognate determination of the ability of the board to decide the case in the first instance (see <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Suffolk Law Sch. </em>295 Mass. 489, 495-496 [1936]), there is no such exception for constitutional questions such as the one argued here (see <em>Wellman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>289 Mass. 131, 139-140 [1935]). To raise a constitutional question on appeal to this court from the board, the taxpayer must present the question to the board and, in so doing, make a proper record for appeal. Otherwise, the taxpayer waives the right to press the constitutional argument. The authorities cited by the taxpayer in support of its right to argue the constitutional questions before us are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">4. As an adjunct to its due process argument (see part 3, <em>supra), </em>the taxpayer directs us to certain language in G.L. c. 59, \u00a7 57, as amended through St. 1973, c. 52, \u00a7 6: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided, bills for real estate and personal property taxes shall be sent out not later than June fourteenth of each year . . ..\u201d The taxpayer contends that this language is mandatory, that G.L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, must be read together with this language and that such reading guarantees the taxpayer three and one-half months as \u201cthe appropriate period for notice and opportunity to be heard.\u201d This argument, like the central due process argument, is not properly before us. There is no hint in the record that any such issue of statutory construction was raised before the board. <em>Cacciatore </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. supra, </em>at 151. See authorities cited, <em>supra, </em>at 751-752. However, we add a few words to clarify procedure for the future. General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 59, establishes the time within which a tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>payer may apply to the assessors for an abatement. The statute grants the taxpayer, at the minimum, thirty days from the day when the assessors send the tax bill. Irrespective of whether the above-quoted language in G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 57, is mandatory<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (compare <em>Singer Sewing Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>341 Mass. 513, 515, n. 1 [1960], with <em>Boston </em>v. <em>DuWors, </em>340 Mass. 402, 403-404 [1960], and <em>Alves </em>v. <em>Braintree, </em>341 Mass. 6, 11, n. 1 [1960]; see G. L. c. 60, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 3A; see also St. 1943, c. 166), we discern in the language no legislative effort to amplify the time available for filing applications for abatement or to alter the jurisdictional requirements for appeals to the board. There is no indication in G. L. c. 59 that tardiness on the part of the authorities in the mailing of tax bills will excuse the taxpayer\u2019s noncompliance with the explicit timing requirements of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59. Our previous decisions have applied, and, when necessary, enforced these explicit requirements without variation. See, e.g., <em>Old Colony R.R. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Quincy, </em>305 Mass. 509 (1940); <em>Singer Sewing Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>341 Mass. 513, 517-520 (1960); <em>Assessors of New Braintree </em>v. <em>Pioneer Valley Academy, Inc. </em>355 Mass. 610, 618-619 (1969); <em>Canron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Everett, </em>366 Mass. 634, 638-640 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">5. For the reasons discussed above, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-7\"> The petition did not allege that the three-month statutory period for action by the assessors had expired. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\"> Rule 16 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Appellate Tax Board (1974) reads in part: \u201cAn objection to the jurisdiction of the Board not apparent on the pleadings may be raised by filing a plea in bar before issue is joined or at such other time as the Board may allow.\u201d The assessors\u2019 motion to dismiss did not attack any matter apparent on the pleadings. Although the motion to dismiss was not the appropriate procedure under the board\u2019s rules, \u201cwe prefer to treat the motion as it was considered by the board and the parties as setting up the question of fact whether the application was seasonably filed.\u201d <em>Old Colony R.R. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Quincy, </em>305 Mass. 509, 512-513 (1940). \u201cThis paper, without too much regard to its title, could be treated according to its substance.\u201d <em>Singer Sewing Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>341 Mass. 513, 515 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b761-6\"> The taxpayer did not file a timely request for a stenographic transcript before any evidence was offered. See G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 10; Rule 28 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Appellate Tax Board (1974). After the adverse decision by the board, the taxpayer filed a motion to include the transcript of testimony taken by the board\u2019s stenographer in the record for appeal. A hearing was held and the motion was denied. The taxpayer does not challenge the board\u2019s denial of the motion in this appeal. Cf. <em>Fall River </em>v. <em>State Tax Cortimn. </em>367 Mass. 681 (1975). The taxpayer\u2019s attorney expressly admitted this in oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">In support of the board\u2019s denial of the motion, we note additionally that the relevant statute provides: <em>\u201cFor its own information only, </em>the board shall have stenographic notes of hearings taken and may have transcripts thereof prepared in proceedings which are not officially reported at the request of a party\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 10, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 321, \u00a7 5. See Rule 28 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Appellate Tax Board (1974), which expressly precludes use by the parties of the board\u2019s stenographic notes when there has been no proper request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> The determinative date under the statute is the date of receipt of the application by the assessors, not the date of mailing by the taxpayer. <em>Old Colony R.R. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Quincy, </em>305 Mass. 509, 513 (1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\"> See part 4, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b762-9\"> The taxpayer entitles its argument: \u201cThe finding ... is not Warranted by the Subsidiary Findings.\u201d However, it is evident from the cases cited and the taxpayer\u2019s line of argument that the argument is directed to the substantiality of the evidence. The board\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact and Report\u201d is pertinent primarily because it contains a summary of part of the evidence adduced at the hearing. The finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>that the tax bills were sent on August 31 is, itself, a subsidiary finding of the board requiring support from the evidence and not from other subsidiary findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b763-10\"> According to the board\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact and Report,\u201d the accountant for the taxpayer\u2019s parent company testified that he received the bills in Cambridge on September 17. However, some of the bills, which are included in the record, were addressed to the taxpayer\u2019s local office in New Bedford. At oral argument, the taxpayer\u2019s counsel conceded that these bills were first received in New Bedford. The record does not indicate when these bills were received locally and contains no evidence as to what happened to the bills before they reached the parent company\u2019s office in Cambridge. The taxpayer did not retain the envelopes in which the bills were mailed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b764-6\"> Although this rule does not specifically refer to questions of substantial evidence, we construe its language \u201cunsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence\u201d to encompass such questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\"> This rule may require qualification when a party challenges the board\u2019s jurisdiction on appeal after a finding by the board that jurisdiction was proper. \u201cConsent or waiver by the parties cannot confer upon a court or administrative tribunal jurisdiction over a cause which is not vested therein by the law.\u201d <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Suffolk Law Sch. </em>295 Mass. 489, 495 (1936). We reserve decision on what qualification may be necessary when an inadequate record seems likely to confer additional jurisdiction on the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\"> The taxpayer\u2019s belated motion for inclusion of a transcript in the record for appeal could not preserve this issue for appeal.
