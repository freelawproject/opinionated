See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We need to refer here to one of the prior proceedings. In <em>Whitmarsh </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>366 Mass. 212 (1974), opp. dism. 421 U. S. 957 (1975), Whitmarsh was tried in a District Court on a charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor; he moved at the outset for trial by jury; the motion was denied. On trial he was found guilty. He appealed to the Superior Court where he would be entitled to a trial de nova with a jury. He moved in that court to dismiss, insisting on the invalidity of the procedure from the start. Pending decision of the motion, he filed a so called \u201cinterlocutory appeal\u201d in this court for Suffolk County asking a declaration that the two-tier system was unconstitutional, and an injunction against further prosecution of the criminal charge. A single justice of this court denied the injunction and reserved and reported the case. We held that the \u201cinterlocutory appeal\u201d could not be maintained, and we declined exercise of extraordinary power under our superintendency statute, G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. But \u201cin view of the nature of the question which . . . [Whitmarsh] attempted to raise and in view of the fact that . . . [Whitmarsh\u2019s] counsel appears determined to raise the same question in other cases\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 218), we undertook to state our opinion on the claimed infractions of constitutional rights \u2014 the right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment, the right to jury trial under the Sixth Amendment and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and the guaranty against double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment. We held each of these claims to be untenable. <em>Id. </em>at 218-228.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In holding that the \u201cinterlocutory appeal\u201d was not available, we indicated how a final decision might be obtained that would be subject to regular appellate review. We said, \u201cIf his motion were denied [i.e., Whit-marsh\u2019s motion in the Superior Court to dismiss], and if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>he were thereafter tried in the Superior Court and found guilty . . . [Whitmarsh] would have available to him an opportunity for appellate review of the ruling on his motion as a matter of right by saving and perfecting exceptions thereto.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 216.) Counsel followed that line in the present case. Here the defendant Ludwig, charged in the District Court of Northern Norfolk with driving to endanger (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 [2] [a]), moved for a jury trial, which the judge denied; the defendant was then found guilty. In the de nova proceeding in the District Court of Northern Norfolk, Six Man Jury Session (similar for present purposes to a de nova proceeding in the Superior Court, see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18), the defendant moved to dismiss, claiming among other things that the court lacked \u201cjurisdiction\u201d because of the improper refusal of a jury at first instance. The motion was denied over due exception, and the defendant was fined $20. Imposition of sentence was stayed, and the case is before this court on a bill of exceptions, as amended, which in effect raises again the constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The case is properly here for review. The attack on \u201cjurisdiction\u201d is but a flourish, and adds nothing to the constitutional points above mentioned which the defendant\u2019s counsel has been pressing with repetitious insistence. We have suffered no change of mind on the constitutional issues since the <em>Whitmarsh </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-15\"> See the listing of such cases in <em>Whitmarsh </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>366 Mass. 212, 218, fn. 4 (1974); <em>Costarelli </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>367 Mass. 35, 39-40, fn. 3 (1975).
