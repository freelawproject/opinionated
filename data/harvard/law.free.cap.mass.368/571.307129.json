L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, from a conviction of statutory rape (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23) after a jury trial in the Superior Court in Hampden County. Following proceedings under G. L. c. 123A, the defendant was found to be a sexually dangerous person. On June 7, 1973, he was sentenced to a term of fifteen to twenty years in the State prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">The incident which gave rise to the proceedings occurred in the early morning hours of November 3, 1972. The victim was the two year old daughter of one Alice Lupien, with whom the defendant had been living at her home in Chicopee for a period of some seven or eight months. The defendant\u2019s peregrinations on the night of November 2 need not be recounted in any great detail other than to note that a considerable amount of liquor appears to have been consumed during their course. It appears that Mrs. Lupien spent the latter part of the evening at a friend\u2019s house in Holyoke, and that around midnight the defendant and one Ted Chalmers, a friend of Mrs. Lupien\u2019s neighbor Sandra Headlee, drove through Holyoke searching for Mrs. Lupien. Unable to find her, Chalmers and the defendant returned to Chicopee about 12:30 a.m. on November 3, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>There was conflicting testimony as to the events which followed. Chalmers and Sandra Headlee testified that the defendant next stopped in at Mrs. Headlee\u2019s house and had two drinks before arriving at Mrs. Lupien\u2019s house at 12:45 a.m. Some thirty minutes later the defendant returned to Mrs. Headlee\u2019s apartment exclaiming that he needed help, that something had happened to Mrs. Lupien\u2019s daughter Julie. Blood was observed on the defendant\u2019s trousers at this time. Mrs. Headlee went next door to investigate and discovered that Julie had been injured. Soon thereafter Alice Lupien returned from Holyoke, and about ten minutes later the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">By the defendant\u2019s account, when he and Chalmers returned home at 12:30 a.m. Mrs. Headlee was standing in her doorway yelling that Julie had been injured. The defendant talked with Chalmers outside for awhile and then entered the Lupien home. He picked up the child and then noticed that he had gotten blood on his trousers. The defendant next called the police, who arrived about the same time as Mrs. Lupien.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Two police officers entered the Lupien home between 2:20 and 2:25 a.m. They concluded that the child needed immediate medical attention and so drove her, along with Mrs. Lupien and a second daughter Jennifer, to the Holyoke hospital. The defendant arrived at the hospital by taxicab some twenty-five minutes later. A medical examination of the child revealed that there had been forceful penetration of the vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">While awaiting the results of the examination two police officers observed the defendant in the waiting room yelling and swearing at Mrs. Lupien. After attempting to quiet him they placed him under arrest for drunkenness and disturbing the peace. At 4:25 a.m. he was taken to the Chicopee police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The single issue in this case is the admissibility of a statement given to the police by the defendant on November 3 after his arrest. The statement was made in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>absence of counsel but after he had received <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Thus we are concerned with whether the defendant \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly and intelligently\u201d waived effectuation of his constitutional rights. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, 444 (1966). A voir dire on this question was held during the trial when it became apparent that Sergeant Bartholomew Sullivan of the Chicopee police department would testify to the content of the defendant\u2019s statement. The Commonwealth produced two witnesses only at the voir dire, Sergeant Sullivan and Captain Charles J. Tutty, both of whom were present at the interrogation of the defendant on November 3. The judge made no findings of fact but concluded that, on the basis of the testimony of Sullivan and Tutty, \u201cthere was an intelligent waiver.\u201d We have reviewed this testimony carefully and are of opinion that as matter of law the judge was not warranted in reaching his conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A full description of the voir dire testimony is necessary here for it is our obligation to examine the totality of circumstances leading up to the waiver, including the conduct and characteristics of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>accused and the details of the interrogation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>366 Mass. 601, 606-607 (1975). See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938); <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U. S. 218, 226 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">It appears that the defendant arrived at the Chicopee police station about 4:25 a.m., having been arrested at the Holyoke hospital for drunkenness at approximately 3 a.m. After completion of the booking procedure the defendant attempted to make a telephone call but received no response. Captain Tutty then approached the defendant and asked him if he would talk to the police \u201cabout an assault on a child.\u201d The defendant answered, \u201c [Y]eah, man, let\u2019s talk.\u201d He was taken upstairs to the juvenile bureau where he was given a cup of coffee. Sergeant Sullivan testified to the defendant\u2019s condition in no uncertain terms. The defendant appeared to him \u201cextremely emotional, extremely high,\u201d and \u201cabnormal.\u201d He was \u201cdoing a great deal of motioning, right on, man, that\u2019s it, man\u201d; in other words, he \u201cwasn\u2019t making much sense.\u201d The conversation was \u201ca haphazard thing.\u201d Sergeant Sullivan\u2019s judgment that he was high on something was based on \u201chis actions,\u201d \u201c[t]he way he talked,\u201d and \u201cthe fact that he was detached from reality, so to speak.\u201d There was \u201cdefinitely\u201d \u201csomething wrong with him.\u201d Though he had no trouble walking, his speech ran together. Not until after an hour and a half of interrogation and three cups of coffee was he \u201ckind of simmering down.\u201d Captain Tutty did not go quite so far in describing the defendant\u2019s condition, stating that he thought that the defendant was not drunk but was \u201cunder the influence of something,\u201d alcohol or drugs, or was physically ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>A period of about fifteen minutes elapsed before the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given. During this time the defendant \u201ckept rambling on and on about things, we went drinking, we went here and there, and so forth.\u201d He also told the police he hoped they \u201cwould hurry up and get this over with, that he had a job to go to, he had to be there . . . at 6.00 o\u2019clock in the morning, and he was rambling on in this trend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The standard <em>Miranda </em>warnings were then given to the defendant with one variation. While Sergeant Sullivan read the warnings from a card, Captain Tutty interjected that \u201cit was about 5:00 in the morning and it would be tough to get ... [a lawyer], but if he insisted . . ..\u201d Sergeant Sullivan also read a form waiver to the defendant and asked him if he would like to sign a waiver. The defendant answered that \u201che didn\u2019t think it would be of any use because he said he neither reads nor writes.\u201d Sergeant Sullivan then asked if he would like to talk about the events leading up to his being taken to the police station. The response was, \u201c[R]ight on, man, let\u2019s talk about it. This is what I want to do, I want to talk about it. Let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d As to the problem of getting an attorney at that hour, he said \u201che didn\u2019t need a lawyer and he would talk to us.\u201d The defendant thereupon gave a statement to the police which differed in some respects from his testimony at trial and which contained certain inculpatory elements despite its generally exculpatory nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, 475 (1966), the Supreme Court set out the test for waiver as follows: \u201cIf the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. . . . This Court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458 (1938), and we reassert these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>standards as applied to in-custody interrogation.\u201d It was emphasized in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, supra, </em>at 464, that \u201c\u2018courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u2019 of fundamental constitutional rights.\u201d Based on the evidence adduced at the voir dire, we cannot say that the Commonwealth\u2019s heavy burden was met in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">One factor weighing against a finding of waiver is the physical and emotional condition of the defendant during the interrogation. The police were aware that the defendant had been brought to the station under arrest for drunkenness. See <em>Logner </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>260 F. Supp. 970, 976 (M. D. N. C. 1966), cert. den. 393 U. S. 857 (1968). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>354 Mass. 630, 635 (1968). Sergeant Sullivan\u2019s own observations were that the defendant was \u201cextemely high,\u201d \u201cextremely emotional,\u201d and \u201cdetached from reality.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>361 Mass. 224, 228-229 (1972). Thus the police were well aware that something was wrong with the defendant, that he was not behaving normally.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Knowing what they did, the police should have been sensitive to whether the defendant was genuinely in a position to understand the significance of a waiver of his rights, in particular the importance of having a lawyer with him during the interrogation. See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>at 469-472; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>453 F. 2d 634, 636 (4th Cir. 1972), cert. den. 406 U. S. 923 (1972). Instead, the police gratuitously indicated to the defendant that it would be difficult to get a lawyer at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>that hour though his right could be exercised \u201cif he insisted.\u201d The police knew that the defendant felt the need to finish the interrogation quickly so he would be able to get to work on time, and in maldng this statement they appear to have encouraged a waiver, putting the burden on the defendant to \u201cinsist\u201d on a lawyer. We do not go so far as to say that the defendant was \u201cthreatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver,\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>at 476, though cajolery can take subtle forms. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>509 F. 2d 227, 230 (8th Cir. 1974). But in light of what the police knew about the defendant\u2019s physical and emotional condition, we cannot condone an attempt to induce a waiver in this manner. See Am. Law Inst. Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, \u00a7 140.4 (Proposed Official Draft 1975). We so state in the face of the fact that the police were working on a detestable crime and naturally sought its solution. Under these circumstances, when the defendant responded to a suggestion of waiver with \u201cright on, man, let\u2019s talk about it,\u201d that response does not seem to us to evince \u201cwith sufficient clarity an understanding by the defendant of his fundamental rights and an intelligent waiver of those rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cain, supra, </em>at 228. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>366 Mass. 601, 608 (1975). In fact, Sergeant Sullivan apparently reached the same conclusion upon hearing the defendant\u2019s response, as appears from the following colloquy with defense counsel: Q. \u201cAnd that [the response to the suggestion of waiver] indicated to you he wasn\u2019t acting in a normal fashion, is that so?\u201d A. \u201cRight. It indicated he was really high on what, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Q. \u201cThere was something wrong with him.\u201d A. \u201cYes, definitely.\u201d Having reviewed the voir dire testimony, we cannot say that \u201cevery effort\u201d was made by the police to see to it that the defendant did not unknowingly relinquish basic constitutional protections indispensable to a fair trial. <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U. S. 218, 242 (1973). When the police became aware that the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u201cextremely high,\u201d \u201cextremely emotional,\u201d and \u201cdetached from reality,\u201d all questioning should have ceased until he was clearly capable of responding intelligently. See <em>Sample </em>v. <em>Eyman, </em>469 F. 2d 819, 821 (9th Cir. 1972). There was testimony that he was \u201ckind of simmering down\u201d after an hour and a half at the police station and three cups of coffee; presumably sometime after that point interrogation could have proceeded. But particularly when a suspect is brought in on a charge of drunkenness the police should not assume they can immediately receive a knowing and intelligent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights and commence interrogation. Certainly in this case the \u201cheavy burden\u201d connected with demonstrating such a waiver cannot be said to have been met on the basis of the testimony of the two police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The remaining question is whether admission of the defendant\u2019s statement to the police might be considered \u201charmless error.\u201d Apart from the statement there was substantial evidence pointing to the defendant as the perpetrator of this most reprehensible crime. But the evidence was entirely circumstantial and the defendant took the stand to deny any involvement in the incident. Although the statement to the police was generally exculpatory, it differed from his trial testimony in describing where he was when the injured child was discovered, and in the explanation offered for a bloodstain observed on his pants. The statement thus impeached his trial testimony and was \u201cincriminating in any meaningful sense of the word.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>at 477. Also, the defendant had told the police that he had better \u201chave a good story for the jury,\u201d further implying his guilt. For these reasons we are unable \u201cto declare a belief that . . . [the error in admitting the statement] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967). Contrast <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>407 U. S. 371 (1972). Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the verdict is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-5\"> Had there been subsidiary findings of fact by the trial judge they would have been accepted by this court absent clear error, but the ultimate legal conclusion to be drawn from the facts developed at the voir dire is a matter for review by this court, particularly where the conclusion is of constitutional dimensions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>362 Mass. 542, 550-551 (Hennessey, J., concurring) (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>359 Mass. 541, 546 (1971). In a number of cases involving factual issues which were the subject of voir dire hearings in the trial court but on which the judge made no express findings of subsidiary facts, we remanded the cases to the trial court with instructions that the judge make such findings and report them to us. However, because of our conclusion that the evidence in this case, in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is insufficient to support a finding, whether express or implied, that \u201cthere was an intelligent waiver,\u201d no useful purpose would be served by remanding the case for findings on this factual issue. The insufficiency of the evidence distinguishes this case from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tempesta, </em>361 Mass. 191 (1972), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>362 Mass. 542 (1972), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>364 Mass. 471 (1973), which we remanded for such findings following the decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>in <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Picard, </em>428 F. 2d 1351 (1st Cir. 1970), and <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Picard, </em>316 F. Supp. 856 (D. Mass. 1970), granting habeas corpus after our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>356 Mass. 74 (1969), in a situation where the judge of the Superior Court had not made subsidiary findings of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\"> We need not address ourselves to whether, as argued by the Commonwealth, this burden may be met by a demonstration of waiver by a mere \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 14, 18 (1974); <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>404 U. S. 477, 489 (1972), or whether, as the defendant contends, a more exacting standard is required. Even under the first test, we are not persuaded that the preponderance of the evidence does in fact demonstrate a valid waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
