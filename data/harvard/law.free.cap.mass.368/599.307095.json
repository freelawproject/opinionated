If, as we shall conclude, the procedural problems are not serious, then we have to decide on the merits, on reservation and report of a single justice of this court, a petition for appeal under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, by Consumers Organization for Fair Energy Equality, Inc. (\u201cCOFFEE\u201d) and 415 residential customers of six electric companies (named as respondents herein) from a final decision or order of the Department of Public Utilities (also named as a respondent) published on January 29, 1975. The decision (D. P. U. dockets 18,209 and 18,221) terminated an \u201cadjudicatory proceeding\u201d in which the petitioners contended that increases in rates for electricity, billed to the petitioners by the electric companies in pursuance of \u201cfuel adjustment clauses\u201d in their rate schedules, were illegal because no public hearings had been held by the department under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94, in connection with the imposition of those increases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioners say that \u00a7 94, properly interpreted, called for public hearings, and in any event due process required them. Apparently the petitioners limited their attack to the increases that went into effect from January 1, 1973, to July 26, 1974.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the department that the petitioners\u2019 contentions fail. There is no problem after July 26, 1974, because of new legislation that went into force that day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">1. Fuel adjustment clauses have appeared in electric utility rate schedules in this country for many years. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>need for them was felt during the first World War and they have been with us ever since, although the wisdom of their use has been regularly a subject of controversy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such a clause provides typically for the fluctuation upward or downward of the rates charged to customers reflecting, in accordance with formula, changes from a defined base in the cost to the company of the fuel used by it to generate power. It is a \u201cpass-through\u201d provision operating in terms of a mathematical formula. We need not go into the complexities and variations of these clauses since we face a general question that applies to fuel adjustment clauses regardless of their precise details.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Before its amendment by St. 1973, c. 816, \u00a7 2, effective December 20, 1973, \u00a7 94 of c. 164, stating that gas and electric companies must file with the department \u201cschedules . . . showing all rates, prices, and charges to be thereafter charged or collected,\u201d as well as changes in those schedules, did not set out any requirement of a public hearing in connection with departmental proceedings at which the tariffs and changes of tariffs were considered. And so, even if increases of rates to customers pursuant to a fuel adjustment clause (as distinguished from any change in the clause itself) could be regarded as within the phrase \u201cschedules . . . showing all rates,\u201d and so forth, it could not be said that \u00a7 94 compelled a public hearing in respect to those increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The 1973 amendment of \u00a7 94 came about through an episode involving the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company. The department in 1972 approved a change of the rate schedules of that company in a departmental proceeding without a public hearing (there was no problem of any cost adjustment clause). This provoked some agitation for an amendment of c. 159, \u00a7 20,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a section somewhat comparable to c. 164, \u00a7 94, and both sections were duly amended, the amendment of \u00a7 94 taking effect, as we have indicated, on December 20, 1973. As amended, \u00a7 94 provides that \u201c[w]henever the department receives notice of any changes proposed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>made in any schedule filed under this chapter which represent a general increase in rates, prices and charges for gas or electric service, it shall notify the attorney general of the same forthwith, and shall thereafter hold a public hearing and make an investigation as to the propriety of such proposed changes after first causing notice of the time, place and the subject matter of such hearing to be published at least twenty-one days before such hearing in such local newspapers as the department may select.\u201d The petitioners argue that this language should be read as requiring a public hearing for such increase<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which comes about through application of the formula of a fuel adjustment clause in a schedule on file.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In the opinion accompanying its decision herein, the department dealt with the matter as follows: \u201cPetitioners argue that statutes 1973, Chapter 816, Section 2, amending General Laws, Chapter 164, Section 94, effective September 21, 1973 [sic: the proper date is December 20, 1973], changed the then existing statutory law and made a hearing mandatory for any \u2018general increase in rates, prices and charges\u2019 for electric service. We believe that this amendment required hearings for changes in any company\u2019s Fuel Clause itself, but not for mathematical variations pursuant to such a clause. A fuel clause obviously contemplates changes in the dollar amount (expressed as a decimal) that appears on a consumer\u2019s bill; such a figure will fluctuate upward and downward according to the cost of fuel, computed according to the formulae. As long as the clause (the formulae) remains fixed, the mathemathics resulting from the clauses\u2019 operation do not constitute a \u2018general increase in rates, prices and charges.\u2019 We believe that, prior to July 26, 1974, no hearings were required for mathematical fluctuations pursuant to approved Fuel Adjustment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Clauses.\u201d The departmental interpretation is matched by this court\u2019s remarks in <em>Century Cab Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>327 Mass. 652, 664 (1951), where we said of a feature of an insurance rate expressed not in dollars and cents but in terms of a formula, \u201cA rate may be fixed where its elements are settled and where all that remains to be done is to combine those elements by the employment of a definite rule, or as here by mathematical process . . . [citing cases].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The department\u2019s view reflects long administrative understanding and practice. On the one hand, rate proceedings conducted by the department have comprised discussions of and decisions upon the desirability and content of cost adjustment clauses, and changes in those clauses, set out in proposed schedules of rates.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Re Arlington Gas Light Co. </em>74 P. U. R. (N. S.) 442 (1948) (Mass. D. P. U.); <em>Re Worcester Gas Light Co. </em>9 P. U. R. 3d 152 (1955) (Mass. D. P. U.); <em>Re Plymouth County Elec. Co. </em>18 P. U. R. 3d 315 (1957) (Mass. D. P. U.); D. P. U. 16,482 (August 13, 1970). Cf. <em>Boston Consol. Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>321 Mass. 259 (1947). On the other hand, there is no past instance that has been cited to us or that we have found where a change or impending change in the dollar amount of a rate, occasioned by application of the formula of a cost adjustment clause, has itself been the subject of a rate proceeding before the department. That the 1973 amendment of \u00a7 94 called for public hearings where certain changes of schedules were being proposed did not alter the understanding that an increase of rate in pursuance of a cost adjustment clause appearing in a filed schedule was not the proper subject of a departmental proceeding under that section. But a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>posal that an adjustment clause be added to a schedule, or that a clause in an existing schedule be modified, could be dealt with in such a proceeding, now with the requirement, in certain cases, of a public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">These observations are reinforced when one considers the main historic purpose of cost adjustment clauses as conventionally stated. Rate proceedings have been notoriously slow as well as expensive. In times of inflation, dependence on lumbering rate proceedings to accommodate the rates to rapidly increasing costs would threaten utilities with unrecoverable expenditures destructive of reasonable returns. Therefore the demand arose to build into the rates, provisions by which increases in certain costs to the utilities (and, to be fair, decreases as well) would in accordance with formula be automatically passed on to the consumers as fluctuations of the charges to them, without the burden and expense to utilities \u2014 which would ultimately fall upon consumers \u2014 of instituting and carrying out separate rate proceedings to justify the varying charges.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Automatic adjustment made particular appeal where the utility had only minimal bargaining power about the particular items of cost (e.g., a gas company purchasing natural gas from a supplier whose rates were fixed by the Federal Power Commission), or where the State regulatory agency believed it could keep a close watch on the particular costs (e.g., an electric company purchasing coal or oil to generate power, the purchase contracts being under continual effective scrutiny by the State agency). See <em>Chicago </em>v. <em>Illinois Commerce Commn. </em>13 Ill. 2d 607, 614-616 (1958); <em>Re Providence Gas Co. </em>88 P. U. R. 3d 430, 433-434 (R. I. Pub. Util. Commn. 1971). If we have stated correctly the conventional rationale for the appearance of cost adjustment clauses in rate schedules, it would seem incongruous to subject fluctuations of charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>to consumers under these clauses to rate proceedings under such a statute as \u00a7 94; the clauses were designed precisely to avoid those proceedings except where changes were being proposed in the clauses themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Lastly, we observe that authority in other States is consistent with and supports the basic position that fluctuations of charges to consumers under a cost adjustment clause are not, in the characteristic legislative pattern, changes in the schedule of rates invoking rate proceedings with any incident hearings. See <em>Chicago </em>v. <em>Illinois Commerce Commn., </em>supra; <em>United Gas Corp. </em>v. <em>Mississippi Pub. Serv. Commn. </em>240 Miss. 405 (1961); <em>Akron </em>v. <em>Public Util. Commn. of Ohio, </em>5 Ohio St. 2d 237 (1966); <em>Norfolk </em>v. <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. </em>197 Va. 505 (1955); <em>Re Brooklyn Borough Gas Co. </em>100 P. U. R. (N. S.) 271 (1953) (N. Y. Pub. Serv. Commn.); <em>Complaint of Trustees of Villages of Saugerties and Ellenville, </em>N. Y. Pub. Serv. Commn. Op. No. 75-5, March 31, 1975.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But cf. <em>In re Petition of Allied Power &amp; Light Co. </em>132 Vt. 354 (1974).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The most familiar statement is that of Commissioner Catterall of the Virginia State Corporation Commission, adopted by the court in the <em>Norfolk </em>case, <em>supra. </em>His remarks, quoted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the margin,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> parallel those of the department in its opinion in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">2. The petitioners herein make a constitutional claim that, apart from what \u00a7 94, as amended, may be held to mean, due process entitled them as consumers to hearings concerning the several increases of charges made by the respondent electric companies under their respective fuel adjustment clauses. We need not pause to undertake an analysis of the respondents\u2019 broad argument that ratepayers have no \u201cvested property right\u201d in the charges for service that they are obliged to pay, so that, presumably, they are entitled to no procedural safeguards with respect to the exaction of increases in those charges.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nor need we consider whether the consumers\u2019 potential right to intervene in the rate proceeding in which the particular cost adjustment clause is proposed for inclusion in a rate schedule, is itself enough to afford them due process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We think the petitioners had additional opportunities to question the increases that satisfied any due process requirements. To be sure, the particular increases were made without notice to the consumers or public hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>However, the fact of the increases, with intimations of possible further increases, was apparent on the face of the bills rendered. A procedure existed by which the petitioners could compel official hearing of their grievances. If they believed the fuel adjustment clauses were inherently improvident or were resulting in excessive returns to the companies; if they doubted the propriety of any features of the clauses or thought the calculations under the clauses were erroneous; if they had any relevant objections, they had available to them G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 93, as appearing in St. 1963, c. 615, \u00a7 4. This states broadly that any twenty customers of a company may file written complaint \u201ceither as to the quality or price\u201d of the electricity furnished, whereupon the department is required to give appropriate notice and hold a public hearing and order any suitable change of price or improvement of quality. The department may also proceed on its own motion under \u00a7 93.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In either case there is court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">But it appears further from the department\u2019s handling of the present case, to which we shall refer immediately below, that the department has also afforded procedures cumulative to \u00a7 93 by which consumers could attack increases of charges by the companies. The short of the matter is that the petitioners and any consumers similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>situated had means of taking the initiative and directing the department\u2019s attention to their complaints about billing increases. That some initiative was called for does not suggest unfairness especially when it is considered that the department has a continuing protective duty toward consumers which it is bound to discharge even without prodding by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In the present case, the department joined for hearing and decision D. P. U. 18,209 and 18,221. Number 18,209 was a proceeding instituted by some of the present petitioners under departmental \u201cRegulations on Billing and Termination Procedures for Residential Customers of Gas and Electric Companies\u201d (Regulation 16,696), published on September 4, 1973, following the decision of this court in <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>363 Mass. 474 (1973). Under Regulation 16,696, a customer may, prior to termination of service for nonpayment of a billing, notify a representative of the company that \u201cany matter related to a billing is disputed, including, without limitation, the accuracy of the amount of the bill or the proper party to be billed.\u201d The customer is then entitled to investigation of the grievance by a company-designated complaint officer, followed, if necessary, by a nonadjudicatory hearing before a hearing officer of the department, whose decision is subject to review in an adjudicatory hearing<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> by the department itself. Meanwhile, service continues. The \u201cmatter related to a billing\u201d disputed in D. P. U. 18,209 was evidently the validity of increases under the relevant fuel adjustment clauses. D. P. U. 18,221 was an application by the other present petitioners, made direct to the department, for a hearing on the same subject matter. Waiving, apparently, as to the latter group, the step-by-step procedures of Regulation 16,696, the department heard D. P. U. 18,209 and 18,221 together, and rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>its decision, from which the present appeal was taken.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Regulation 16,696 is thus seen to be a method of obtaining hearing and decision by the department on any question regarding the fuel adjustment clause, that decision being subject to review in this court under c. 25, \u00a7 5. Due process is again served. See the discussion in <em>Sellers </em>v. <em>Iowa Power &amp; Light Co. </em>372 F. Supp. 1169, 1173-1174 (S. D. Iowa 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">3. A petition for appeal under c. 25, \u00a7 5, was first filed herein by \u201cCOFFEE,\u201d a nonprofit corporation claiming as \u201cmembers\u201d a large number of customers of electric companies, including the present petitioners. The respondent companies and the D. P. U.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> moved to dismiss the petition on several grounds, of which the more material were: that as \u201cCOFFEE\u201d was not a party to or intervener in the departmental proceedings, it could not act as petitioner on the appeal; that the department was a necessary or indispensable party to the appeal, but had not been joined; that the petition did not state a claim for appeal, as it seemed to attack Regulation 16,696 (the validity of which, according to the respondents, was established by the <em>Cambridge Electric </em>case, <em>supra), </em>and not the decision in D. P. U. 18,209 and 18,221, and was in any event grievously unclear or ambiguous. The motions to dismiss were argued to the single justice, who ordered that the department be joined as a party to the appeal, and suggested in memorandum that the petition for appeal be amended to meet the companies\u2019 other criticisms. An amended petition was filed, pursuant to leave, adding as parties the individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>who had appeared as complainants in the departmental proceedings,, and directing its fire at the departmental decision in D. P. U. 18,209 and 18,221. The companies then renewed, in effect, their motion to dismiss, now addressed to the amended petition for appeal, and the motions, together with the appeal proper, the single justice reserved and reported to the full court. The amended petition suffices as a pleading when read with an indulgent eye in the light of the single justice\u2019s memorandum (consider the teaching of <em>Charbonnier </em>v. <em>Amico, </em>367 Mass. 146 [1975]); and the individual petitioners are proper petitioners, though \u201cCOFFEE\u201d is not. Accordingly, the respondent companies\u2019 motions are unavailing except as to the dismissal of \u201cCOFFEE,\u201d see <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>366 Mass. 667, 673-674 (1975), and, reaching the merits, we shall affirm the decision appealed from. As we hold that the petitioners fail on the merits, we do not decide what remedy they would be entitled to if they had succeeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">4. We add that the precise problem of the present case is not likely to recur. Statute 1974, e. 625, \u00a7 1, effective July 26, 1974, adds a new \u00a7 94G to c. 164, dealing with the uniform calculation and billing of fuel charges by electric companies. It provides among other things that \u201c[i]n no event shall a fuel charge be billed to customers which has not been specifically approved by the department after a public hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The fact that this legislation was thought to be necessary tends to confirm our interpretation of \u00a7 94, as amended. Implicitly, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>innovative statute bespeaks a confidence that the hearing procedure can be carried through with despatch, so that a main object of these clauses, the timely adjustment of rates to costs, will not be defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">\u201cCOFFEE\u201d will be dismissed as a petitioner on this appeal. The department\u2019s decision will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-6\"> There is no claim that the fuel adjustment clauses were not properly approved as part of the rate schedules of the companies, or that there was mathematical error in the amounts billed which resulted from application of the formulas set out in the fuel adjustment clauses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\"> That the petitioners so limited their attack was noted by the single justice in memorandum after hearing the parties to the appeal. See p. 614 below. In fact, as we shall see, the logic of the petitioners\u2019 argument as to \u00a7 94 seems rather to look to the period from December 20, 1973, the effective date of an amendment of \u00a7 94, to July 26, 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\"> As to this legislation, see p. 615 below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><em> </em>The practical arguments for and against the use of \u201cescalator\u201d clauses in utility rate schedules (not limited to fuel adjustment clauses but including, for example, \u201cpurchased gas adjustment clauses\u201d in the rate schedules of gas companies) will be found in Trigg, Escalator Clauses in Public Utility Rate Schedules, 106 U. of Pa.

The following is a fairly simple fuel adjustment clause with a \u201cneutral zone\u201d feature (quoted from Mass. D. P. U. 16,482, August 13, 1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">\u201cFUEL ADJUSTMENT: Whenever in any month the cost of fossil fuels priced alongside the Company\u2019s electric generating stations is greater than $8.20 or less than $8.05 per ton of 29,000,000 British Thermal Units, an additional charge or deduction will be applied to the kilowatt hours which are billed in the second succeeding billing month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-11\">\u201cThis charge or deduction will be determined by multiplying the increase of each full cent above $8.20 or the decrease of each full cent below $8.05 by 0.00039 and by the ratio of kilowatt hours generated by fossil fuels to total kilowatt hours generated and purchased in that month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\">\u201cIn determining the cost of fossil fuel used in any month, the cost of the fossil fuel received during the month will be averaged with the cost of fossil fuel in storage at the beginning of the month.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\"> While an appeal from the results of a departmental rate proceeding affecting New England Telephone and Telegraph Company was pending in this court, the company filed a new schedule instituting a fresh proceeding.

Apparently this led to the enactment of the 1973 amendments of \u00a7 20 and c. 164, \u00a7 94, by St. 1973, c. 816, \u00a7 1 and \u00a7 2, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\"> In our discussion we forgo the point that an increase under a fuel adjustment clause, even if an increase within the quoted amendatory language, might not be a \u201cgeneral\u201d increase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\"> In D.

One of the court\u2019s grounds appears to be that such a general rule is inconsistent with the statutes requiring changes in a company\u2019s rate schedule to be made the subject of a rate proceeding as to that company. This is not inconsistent with the other authority cited in the text. Other remarks in the court\u2019s opinion may be referable to the particular statutory arrangements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\"> \u201cThe legislature has, by the language quoted, recognized that rate schedules consist not merely of lists of rates in dollars and cents, but that they customarily include provisions that will in various ways affect the rates charged at the time of filing or to be charged thereafter.\u201d Catterall, Commr., in <em>Re Lynchburg Gas Co. </em>6 P. U. R. 3d, 33, 37 (1954) (Va. State Corp. Commn.), quoted in the <em>Norfolk </em>case, 197 Va. at 516 (1955). The commissioner continued (at 37): \u201cThe thing that the statute says must be filed is not every change in the consumers\u2019 bills, but every change in the schedules that affects the computation of the bills. A charge that can be computed by a fixed mathematical formula is as firmly fixed as a charge that is stated in terms of money.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\"> See the majority and dissenting opinions in <em>Georgia Power Co. </em>v. <em>Allied Chemical Corp., </em>Sup.
