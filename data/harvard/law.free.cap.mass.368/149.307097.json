Neither party requested the board to make findings of fact and a report thereof. The defendant commission argues that the board\u2019s decision must have turned on the factual question whether the receipts in dispute were \u201cshown by the books\u201d of the trust before 1971. G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 1 (f), as appearing in St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 5. This, says the commission, is the sole issue presented by the appeal. We hold that this issue does not appear to have been raised in the proceedings before the board and therefore cannot be considered by us. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. We reverse and order the disputed tax abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>We summarize the facts shown by the admissions in the answer and the brief of the commission. The trust never filed an agreement to be taxed and was not subject to income tax before 1971, but became subject to tax under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7\u00a7 1-8, as appearing in St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 5. In 1966 the trust made an instalment sale of Massachusetts real estate, and reported the sale as an instalment sale on its 1966 Federal income tax return. Its Federal income tax return for 1971 included receipts of $70,043 on account of the 1966 sale. The commission contended that these receipts were taxable at nine per cent as capital gains under \u00a7 4 (a) (3). The plaintiff claimed that the receipts were \u201ctax-free earnings and profits\u201d under \u00a7 8 (c), and filed an application for abatement of the tax. The commission denied the application, but reduced the amount of gain from $70,043 to $50,010 after receiving additional information as to the Massachusetts cost basis of the property sold in 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Under \u00a7 8 (c) any \u201cearnings and profits accumulated prior to the effective date\u201d of that section (which was to take effect for taxable years commencing after December 31, 1970, St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 67) and during a period when the trust \u201cwas not subject to taxation . . . solely by reason of the fact that it had elected not to file with the commissioner an agreement to pay a tax shall be considered tax-free earnings and profits.\u201d Dividends paid from such tax-free earnings and profits are subject to taxation. The question whether accrued profit on a 1966 sale had been \u201caccumulated\u201d before 1971 even though not yet received in money was fairly presented to the board, and it would appear that it was decided against the taxpayer. The commission does not defend on that basis, however, in effect conceding that such a decision by the board would be erroneous. Cf. <em>First Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>40 T. C. 474, 487 (1963). Contrast <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner Int. Rev. </em>56 F. 2d 58, 59 (5th Cir. 1932), cert. den. 286 U. S. 551 (1932) (cash receipts and disbursements basis); <em>N. J. Ennis, </em>17 T. C. 465, 470 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>(1951) (same). We therefore need not decide the point. Nor do we decide whether it makes any difference that the trust used the instalment method on its Federal income tax returns. Cf. G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 63, as amended by St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 18, under which use of that method apparently required the permission of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The commission relies entirely on \u00a7 1 (f), defining \u201cdividend,\u201d as \u201cused in this chapter,\u201d as a \u201cdistribution . . . made . . . out of . . . earnings and profits,\u201d and adding: \u201cEarnings and profits, as used herein, mean the earnings and profits shown by the books of the corporation or other entity making the distribution.\u201d The commission apparently assumes that this language was intended to be applied to \u00a7 8 (c) so as to make a retroactive bookkeeping rule for transactions recorded before the statute was enacted in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We need not pass on this point, however, in view of G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as amended through St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 5, which provides: \u201cThe court shall not consider any issue of law which does not appear to have been raised in the proceedings before the board.\u201d There is in the record before us no hint that any issue as to what was \u201cshown by the books\u201d of the trust was so raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The decision of the board is reversed. The plaintiff\u2019s application for abatement is to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
