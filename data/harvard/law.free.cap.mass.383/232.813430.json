After divorce, custody of the two minor children of the marriage was granted to the mother, with visitation rights to the father. The mother, a member of a Congregational church, later complained that the father, who had become a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, was indoctrinating the children in that faith, and that this confused and disoriented the children and in some degree alienated them from her. A judge of the Probate Court entered judgment modifying the visitation provisions of the divorce judgment in effect to forbid visitation unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the father refrained from instructing the children in his religion. The father appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion for direct review. Holding that the evidence brought forward was not sufficient to support the judge\u2019s disposition, we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings (if the mother should elect) at which the facts, including particularly those bearing on the physical and emotional consequences to the children, may be more fully developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">1. The question whether or how to accommodate diverse religious practices of parents, living apart, in the upbringing of minor children, is a not unfamiliar one in State courts, but has not had much attention here. Typical is the approach taken in a recent case, <em>In re Marriage of Murga, </em>103 Cal. App. 3d 498, 504-505 (1980): \u201c[T]he courts have refused to restrain the noncustodial parent from exposing the minor child to his or her religious beliefs and practices, absent a clear, affirmative showing that these religious activities will be harmful to the child. [Citations omitted.] The refusal to intervene in the absence of a showing of harm to the child reflects the protected nature of religious activities and expressions of belief, as well as the proscription against preferring one religion over another. [Citations omitted.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">To enlarge on this. The parents together have freedom of religious expression and practice which enters into their liberty to manage the familial relationships. See <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>375 Mass. 733, 747-748 (1978); <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205 (1972); <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510 (1925); Developments in the Law \u2014 The Constitution and the Family, 93 Harv. L. Rev. 1156, 1161-1168 (1980). But the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child are to be promoted, and when the parents are at odds, the attainment of that purpose may involve some limitation of the liberties of one or other of the parents. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Hedrick, </em>158 Cal. App. 2d 281, 285 (1958); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>271 Pa. Super. 19, 29 (1979). Cf. <em>Vilakazi </em>v. <em>Maxie, </em>371 Mass. 406, 409 (1976); <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 166-167 (1944). However, harm to the child from conflicting reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>gious instructions or practices, which would justify such a limitation, should not be simply assumed or surmised; it must be demonstrated in detail. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>260 Ark. 691, 693 (1976); <em>Compton </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>98 Idaho 190, 192 (1977); <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>267 S.W.2d 340, 343 (Mo. App. 1954); <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>180 Neb. 83, 88-89 (1966); <em>Munoz </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>79 Wash. 2d 810, 813 (1971). But cf. <em>Boerger </em>v. <em>Boerger, </em>26 N.J. Super. 90, 104 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">If the dominating goal of the enterprise is to serve a child\u2019s best interests, as the cases asseverate (see <em>Vilakazi </em>v. <em>Maxie, supra </em>at 409; cf. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31 [as to awards of custody]), then it might be thought to follow that a policy of stability or repose should be adopted by which the child would be exposed to but one religion (presumably that of the custodial parent) at whatever cost to the \u201cliberties\u201d of the other parent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The law, however, tolerates and even encourages up to a point the child\u2019s exposure to the religious influences of both parents although they are divided in their faiths. This, we think, is because the law sees a value in \u201cfrequent and continuing contact\u201d of the child with both its parents <em>(Murga, supra, </em>103 Cal. App. 3d at 503, quoting from Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 4600 [West 1981]) and thus contact with the parents\u2019 separate religious preferences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>may also be a value in letting the child see, even at an early age, the religious models between which it is likely to be led to choose in later life. And it is suggested, sometimes, that a diversity of religious experience is itself a sound stimulant for a child. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>90 Ariz. 190, 194 (1961) (en banc). In all events, the question that comes to the courts is whether, in particular circumstances, such exposures are disturbing a child to its substantial injury, physical or emotional, and will have a like harmful tendency for the future. See Mnookin, Child Custody Adjudication: Judicial Functions in the Face of Indeterminacy, 39 L. &amp; Contemp. Prob. 226, 251-252 (No. 3, 1975). The critical literature warns against perverting a quest for the child\u2019s best interests into one for the psychic comfort of the parents \u2014 a warning against overvaluing the parents\u2019 constitutional liberties. See Henszey, Visitation by a Non-Custodial Parent: What Is the \u201cBest Interest\u201d Doctrine?, 15 J. Fam. L. 213 (1976-1977). Cf. <em>Quiner </em>v. <em>Quiner, </em>59 Cal. Rptr. 503, 519-520 (Ct. App. 1967) (Herndon, J., dissenting). A warning is equally in order against depriving a parent of all connection with the child, or connection on the religious plane, out of an exaggerated fear of injury to the child. See Note, The Religious Upbringing of Children After Divorce, 56 Notre Dame Law. 160, 171 (1980); Developments in the Law, <em>supra, </em>93 Harv. L. Rev. at 1340. It is often said that if accommodation appears necessary, that form should be sought which intrudes least on the religious inclinations of either parent and is yet compatible with the health of the child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">2. The parents at bar, Diane and Wayne Felton, were married in September, 1967, at the respective ages of twen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ty and twenty-three. Deborah was born to them in March, 1971, and Jennifer in May, 1974. Wayne began to live apart from the family in April, 1976, on an informal arrangement that left custody with Diane and allowed liberal visitation to Wayne. The divorce judgment nisi of June 1, 1977, continued custody and visitation on a similar agreed basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The orientation of the family had been Protestant, and what religious experience or training the children received was at the Foster Memorial Church (Congregational) in Springfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Sometime in summer or fall, 1976, soon after the separation, Wayne became interested in the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, which on this record may be described as a Protestant sect of fundamentalist doctrine with strict attachment to the Biblical texts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By the time the divorce judgment became absolute in December, 1977, Wayne was committed to these precepts, a commitment probably strengthened by his marriage to Gail, a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, in the same month. It was not until May, 1978, however, that he took the step of being baptized as a Witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">According to Diane\u2019s later testimony, she knew of Wayne\u2019s new religious interest around the time of the separation. In the last months of 1977 she became apprehensive of the effect on the children of the religious instruction imparted to them by their father during the periods of visitation. She remonstrated with Wayne about this in October or November, 1977. There was an abortive effort, about mid-March, 1978, for the two to meet to discuss the matter. When, on April 8, 1978, Wayne and Gail, on a visitation day, took the children to a lengthy \u201cfamily\u201d convention of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Diane decided to take a firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>stand and refused to allow further visitation, permitting Wayne only weekly telephone conversations with the children. On April 28, 1978, Wayne commenced contempt proceedings against Diane, in response to which Diane sought a change of the visitation part of the divorce judgment. Following a pretrial conference, the probate judge on January 11, 1979, made an interim order suspending Wayne\u2019s visitation rights. An evidential hearing took place on January 30, 1979, resulting in dismissal of the contempt application and entry of judgment the same day:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[Sjaid defendant [Wayne Felton] shall hereafter have the right to visit and to take Deborah Jean Felton and Jennifer Lynn Felton, minor children of said parties, at reasonable times, provided that he refrains from giving his children any religious training or education which shall be in conflict or contrary with the religious training and beliefs of the custodial parent.\u201d This on its face would require subtle interpretation and raise infinite difficulties of enforcement, but the intent in substance was to forbid religious instruction of the children by Wayne or his involving them in religious practice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The hearing had rambled through many pages of transcript.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When the mere chatter or banter is put aside, we find a relatively small bundle of relevant material. From Diane\u2019s testimony it appeared that she disliked what she took to be Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 doctrine and style, and her negative feelings were probably communicated to the then seven-year old Deborah (Jennifer at age four hardly figured). What especially concerned Diane was that the Witnesses did not celebrate birthdays, Christmas included, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>and regarded Halloween and Santa Claus as atavisms to be shunned. So also the Witnesses were negative with respect to the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. Diane thought Wayne should not be impairing Deborah\u2019s enjoyment of birthdays and holidays or puncturing her fantasies \u2014 there would be time for disillusionment as she grew up. Diane at the family home celebrated birthdays and carried on in the other conventional ways with the children. Their upbringing on Diane\u2019s side was not intensely religious but was Congregational as far as it went, with attendance at Sunday school and Bible reading there. In Diane\u2019s view, the Bible reading on Wayne\u2019s side (about the exact nature of which neither she nor Wayne actually testified in detail) was too strict or literal and not suited to young children. She thought it detracted from Wayne\u2019s \u201cknowing\u201d the children. Similarly attendance from morning to afternoon at the April 8 convention (described only sketchily in the testimony) in her estimation was wrong for children. Deborah, Diane said, was upset and confused; this was largely through reluctance to recount to her mother what happened during visits with her father, presumably because she sensed her mother\u2019s disapproval of that regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">So much for Diane\u2019s testimony. Wayne in his testimony verified that the doctrine of his church forbade birthday celebrations and so forth and bound him to instruct the children in his religion with its emphasis on strict reading of, and implicit belief in Biblical text. He held that those who deviated from this text and the direct derivations from it were \u201cwrong,\u201d but he did not depreciate or lessen them on account of such errors. It was not true that the children\u2019s visits consisted only of Bible lessons and other religious instruction: the children were entertained by being taken to the movies on occasion, by games played with Gail\u2019s young sons, and other diversions. Deborah did not seem to Wayne to be upset, and there was love between his daughters and himself (this seemed conceded by Diane) ,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>3. We apply the words of <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. 366, 368 (1981), a case seeking modification of alimony and child support provisions in a divorce judgment, to the present case, also demanding modification of a divorce judgment, although as to a different subject matter: \u201cTo be successful in an action to modify a judgment for alimony or child support, the petitioner must demonstrate a material change of circumstances since the entry of the earlier judgment. <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>343 Mass. 247, 249 (1961). <em>Hinds </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>329 Mass. 190, 191-192 (1952). In this case, the judge held that [the petitioning husband] did not prove the requisite change of circumstances. The judge reported his findings and we have a transcript of all the evidence. Accordingly, \u2018the appeal brings before us all questions of law, fact, and discretion.\u2019 <em>Krokyn </em>v. <em>Krokyn, </em>378 Mass. 206, 208 (1979), quoting from <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>368 Mass. 144, 147 (1975). However, we will not reverse findings made by the judge on the basis of oral testimony unless we are convinced they are plainly wrong. <em>Consent to Adoption of a Minor, </em>363 Mass. 537, 539 (1973). <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>325 Mass. 28, 28-29 (1949).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We have noted the meagerness of the evidence on such elementary points as the precise manner of Wayne\u2019s Bible lessons. The more striking weakness is a failure of proof about Deborah\u2019s physical and emotional condition or about any causal connections between her visits with her father and that condition, such as it may have been. General testimony by Diane that the child was upset or confused (and that testimony was contradicted by testimony of like generality on the part of Wayne) will not suffice. See <em>Compton </em>v. <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>98 Idaho at 191-192; <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Goodman, supra, </em>180 Neb. at 88-89; <em>Munoz </em>v. <em>Munoz, supra, </em>79 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Wash. 2d at 814; <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>19 Wash. App. 425, 427-428 (1978). There are few ground-level facts to be found in the record on this entire matter. The decisions hold such an infirmity to be fatal to an action seeking to limit materially or to cancel visitation rights. See <em>Compton, supra </em>at 192; <em>Munoz, supra </em>at 814; <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>267 S.W.2d at 343; <em>Angel </em>v. <em>Angel, </em>2 Ohio Op. 2d 136, 138 (C.P. 1956). Cf. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>90 Ariz. at 194; <em>Osier v. Osier, </em>410 A.2d 1027,1031 (Me. 1980). Thus there is clear error, for lack of foundation in the record, in the judge\u2019s findings of a \u201cdeleterious effect\u201d on the children and an \u201cundermining\u201d of the custodial relationship by reason of the father\u2019s religious instruction or practice. The findings seem traceable to a predisposition on the judge\u2019s part. His remarks during the hearing would indicate that, despite some protestations by him to the contrary, he assumed that differences of religion, at least where one of the parents took his religion zealously, must have such grave damaging effect on the children as to require the censorship he imposed by the judgment. The assumption is far from self-proving. \u201cWe are not convinced . . . that duality of religious beliefs, per se, creates a conflict upon young minds.\u201d <em>Munoz, supra </em>at 815. See also <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>260 Ark. at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We conclude the discussion of the inadequacy of the record to base the judgment by referring to a pair of cases comparable to the present. A trial judge in <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra, </em>had forbidden the father, a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, to discuss his beliefs with his children during visitation. This order was grounded on the custodial mother\u2019s affidavit that the father\u2019s teachings \u201cconfuse and alarm [the] children\u201d and \u201chave a detrimental and confusing impact upon [their] welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427. Pointed to specifically was the father\u2019s teaching about holidays which, according to the mother, \u201ccauses a great deal of trauma for the children at school because they feel guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reversing the order and remanding for further proceedings, the appellate court said the case called for a <em>\u201cfactual </em>showing, not mere conclusions and speculation\u201d (court\u2019s emphasis). <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>In <em>In re Marriage of Murga, supra, </em>103 Cal. App. 3d 498 (1980), the custodial mother sought to condition the father\u2019s visitations with a nine-year old son on the father\u2019s engaging in only such religious teaching or activity as the mother approved. The father, who evidently was adhering to one of the less popular Protestant sects, had prayed and studied Bible with his son daily during visitations and taken him to services and Sunday school. These exercises, the mother asserted, resulted in the boy\u2019s hating religion and refusing to go to church with her. She claimed the boy had fits of temper just before visitations. But there was testimony by the father that any such displays disappeared when the boy was out of the mother\u2019s presence. The mother\u2019s requested change of the visitation provisions of the divorce decree was denied on the trial as well as the appellate level, again for failure of evidence persuasive of a connection between such problems as the child might have and his involvement in religious activities during visitations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The few cases which, though faithful to the accepted legal pattern earlier described, limit visitation because of religious differences, have relied on firmer proof.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">4. Upon the reversal of the judgment of modification appealed from (which will have the effect of restoring the original judgment) and remand of the case to the Probate Court, Diane may, if so advised, again apply for modifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>tion upon additional and updated evidence. A suggestion of the kind of proof that might be influential on either side, and the likely sources of such proof, appears by implication in <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>267 S.W.2d at 343, where, upon reversing an order restricting visitation on account of religious differences, the court said the custodial mother \u201cgave no testimony whatever that his [child\u2019s] general demeanor, attitude, school work, appetite, health or outlook has been affected one iota by the so-called conflict in his mind. Her testimony was wholly uncorroborated. No church, school, medical or psychiatric authorities, nor any of the boy\u2019s associates, in or out of school, appeared in support of this charge.\u201d We should mention, too, that a judge may seek correction of the possibly self-serving testimonies of the father and mother by appointing a qualified investigator (whether called a guardian or given some other title) who would look into the facts, render a report, and be subject to examination by the parties. See <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>369 Mass. 598, 603-606 (1976); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>349 Mass. 259, 264-265 (1965); G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 56A.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Some two years will have elapsed between the judgment appealed from and the coming down of this opinion. We do not know how circumstances may have changed in the meanwhile. It will be for the probate judge to consider upon competent proof whether some order adjusting the visitation provisions of the original judgment would be advisable during an interim period, pending the result of any further hearings that may be in prospect on the mother\u2019s application. Cf. <em>Osier </em>v. <em>Osier, supra, </em>410 A.2d at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-6\"> Indeed there are situations where even the joint wishes of the parents are disregarded by the courts in order to avert threatened or real harm to the child.
