He left no surviving spouse. He was survived by his parents and by the minor plaintiff, his illegitimate child. On November 29, 1977, a judge sitting in the Second District Court of Bristol County had adjudicated that Farrell was the father of the minor plaintiff and had ordered him to pay support for her. On January 2, 1979, Farrell\u2019s father and Mr. John Silvia, Jr., were appointed coadministrators of Farrell\u2019s estate. They asserted claims under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, against the persons allegedly responsible for Farrell\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">On January 16, 1979, a complaint was filed on behalf of the minor child seeking (a) a determination that, as the illegitimate child of Farrell, she was his next of kin as defined by G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 1, and (b) an order against the co-administrators of Farrell\u2019s estate enjoining them from prosecuting any claim for damages for Farrell\u2019s death until the minor child\u2019s status was settled.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On January 30, 1979, the coadministrators filed a complaint seeking an order prohibiting the minor, through her mother or anyone else, from prosecuting any claim for Farrell\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">We need not treat the various procedural steps in these cases. Judgment was entered that the illegitimate child was Farrell\u2019s next of kin for the purposes of recovery under G. L. c. 229. The judge ordered that counsel for the child be appointed as special counsel to prosecute any claim for damages recoverable under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, setting forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the terms of any compensation to be paid. We transferred to this court the coadministrators\u2019 appeal from the judgment and the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Although, at the trial stage, the major controversy concerned whether Farrell\u2019s illegitimate child was his next of kin for the purposes of recovery under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, Farrell\u2019s coadministrators no longer challenge the child\u2019s status as his next of kin. At the time these proceedings were considered below and briefs were filed on appeal, there was a question whether a child, who was adjudicated to be the illegitimate child of his or her deceased father, could constitutionally be barred from sharing in his or her natural father\u2019s estate as the statutes of the Commonwealth then provided. In <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663 (1980), we held that an illegitimate child whose father had acknowledged her as his child was entitled to share in the distribution of the assets of her father\u2019s intestate estate. We held unconstitutional the statutory distinction then in effect (see G. L. c. 190, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 7, prior to their amendment by St. 1980, c. 396) between an illegitimate child\u2019s right to inherit from his or her natural mother and that child\u2019s right to inherit from his or her natural father who had acknowledged him or her as his child. We also noted \u201ca judicial adjudication of paternity as one appropriate method of establishing inheritance rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We think the coadministrators of Farrell\u2019s estate were correct in conceding that the plaintiff was the deceased\u2019s next of kin for the purposes of G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 1. We need not decide whether this conclusion is correct as an application, within constitutional limits, of the principles of intestate succession to the words \u201cnext of kin\u201d (see G. L. c. 190, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3), or simply as a construction of the meaning of \u201cnext of kin\u201d in G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 1, without consideration of the statutory rules of intestate succession.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">We are left with the coadministrators\u2019 challenge to the judge\u2019s order appointing the plaintiffs counsel as special counsel to prosecute the tort claim under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. The coadministrators point to the provision in G. L. c. 229, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u00a7 2, that an action under that section should be brought \u201cby the executor or administrator of the deceased.\u201d They have acknowledged that the minor plaintiff would receive any recovery in the wrongful death action. They have no further financial interest in the law suit. We think it clear that, on application to the Probate Court, an administrator representing the plaintiff\u2019s interests would be substituted for the coadministrators. The judge below did not order a substitution of administrators and had no authority to do so. He did, however, determine that counsel for the real party in interest should be allowed to control the wrongful death claim. This result makes sense. It achieves the practical result that would have been obtained by a substitution of administrators. It permits the party in interest to have counsel of her own choice rather than counsel who once opposed her status as Farrell\u2019s next of kin. The judge did not override the purpose of G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, and acted within his authority in achieving a practical and proper solution to the question of who should prosecute the wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The judgment that the plaintiff is next of kin of her father for the purposes of any recovery under G. L. c. 229 is affirmed, as is the order appointing special counsel to prosecute the wrongful death action under G. L. c. 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\"> Pursuant to G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, as amended through St. 1973, c. 957, \u00a7 1, a deceased\u2019s next of Idn is entitled to recover damages \u201cin the amount of . . . the fair monetary value of the decedent\u201d to the next of kin. The amount of the recovery for Farrell\u2019s wrongful death might differ depending on whether the minor plaintiff or Farrell\u2019s parents were his next of kin.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
