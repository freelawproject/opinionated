L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, from the decisions of the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Tax Board (board) granting abatements to the appellees, taxpayers, from real estate taxes levied in the years 1977 through 1979. The appellant board of assessors of the city of Boston (city) challenges the board\u2019s ruling that the lowest substantial class of real property in the city of Boston was the so called R-l single family residential, or single dwelling unit residential class. The city contends that the board\u2019s ruling is erroneous (1) because the board failed to state its reasons or make findings of fact in support of its determination that the R-l class, as opposed to the class of all residential property, is a separate and distinct class for the purpose of real property classification; (2) because the selection of the R-l class has no rational basis in law or fact; and (3) because the board\u2019s determination is inconsistent with the policy underlying the recently approved classification Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the legislative responses to that amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The determination whether single family residences constitute a \u201cclass\u201d for tax abatement purposes is a mixed question of fact and law. As the board is a State agency charged with administering the tax abatement process, its determination is due some deference. See <em>Henry Perkins Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Bridgewater, </em>377 Mass. 117, 121-122 (1979). We have long recognized the board\u2019s expertise in tax matters. See <em>Assessors of Quincy </em>v. <em>Boston Consol. Gas Co., </em>309 Mass. 60, 72 (1941). The board has adequately set forth and the record supports the factual predicates for its determination.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cf. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 12C. Moreover, this determination is in no respect inconsistent with our past declarations of the appropriate remedy available to a taxpayer whose real estate taxes have been disproportionately assessed. See, e.g., <em>Tregor </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>377 Mass. 602, 611-612, cert, denied, 444 U.S. 841 (1979); <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Assessors of Foxborough, </em>369 Mass. 855 (1976); <em>Shoppers\u2019 World, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Framingham, </em>348 Mass. 366, 377 n.10 (1965). \u201c[A] taxpayer has a right to have his assessment reduced so that it is \u2018proportional to the assessments of the class of property valued at the lowest percentage of fair cash value.\u2019\u201d <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. Assessors <em>of Boston, ante </em>456, 458 n.3 (1981), quoting from cited cases. Cf. <em>Chomerics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Woburn, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 394 (1978). Finally, the board\u2019s ruling is not inconsistent with the Massachusetts Constitution or any legislation as in effect during the tax years in question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The decisions of the Appellate Tax Board are therefore affirmed. Costs of the appeal are to be awarded to the taxpayer in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Justice Kaplan participated in the deliberation on this case, but retired before the opinion was issued.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b500-6\"> Article 112 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, approved and ratified by the people November 7, 1978, and inserted in the first paragraph of Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, of the Constitution, provides in pertinent part that the Legislature \u201cmay classify real property according to its use in no more than four classes and to assess, rate and tax such property differently in the classes so established, but proportionately in the same class . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\"> Statute 1979, c. 797, \u00a7 11, codified as G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2A, provides that property shall be assessed according to four classifications: residential, open-space, commercial, and industrial. Residential property is defined to include single as well as multiple dwelling unit residences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\"> The board found: \u201cthe R-l class of property is one of the two or three largest classes of real property in the City of Boston in terms of its total area, number of parcels, total assessed value, and total estimated full valuation\u201d and it \u201cis assessed at a lower percentage of fair cash value than any other class of property in the City of Boston.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b501-10\"> Statute 1979, c. 797, \u00a7 25, provides that \u00a7 10 of that chapter applies to \u201cclassification of all property for the fiscal years commencing on or after July first, nineteen hundred and eighty.\u201d Moreover, we recently held that retroactive application of St. 1979, c. 797, prior to fiscal 1980 would be unconstitutional in so far as it would alter the previous state of the tax abatement law as relied upon by the taxpayers. See <em>Keniston </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>380 Mass. 888, 903-906 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b501-8\">Wilkins, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar4\">(concurring, with whom Hennessey, C.J., joins). If one accepts the view expressed by the court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>Tregor </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>377 Mass. 602, 611-612 (1979), that the taxpayers are entitled to abatements to the level of the class of property that is valued at the lowest percentage of-fair cash value, the result reached by the court in this case is correct. I did not, and do not, agree with the view expressed by the court in its <em>Tregor </em>opinion. See <em>Tregor </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, supra </em>at 613 (Wilkins, J., dissenting, with whom Hennessey, C.J., joins). However, because the point has not been raised anew and the court in the <em>Tregor </em>case established the rule of law to be applied in this case, I join in the opinion in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
