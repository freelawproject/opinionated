The parties disagree as to the proper construction of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 125, as appearing in St. 1955, c. 770, \u00a7 63, which provides in relevant part as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>follows: \u201cThe expense of supporting a prisoner . . . sentenced to a jail or house of correction in a county other than that in which he was convicted, <em>may </em>be paid by the county where he was sentenced. If the amount to be paid cannot be agreed upon by the county commissioners of the two counties, it may be determined by the superior court sitting in either county.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The word \u201cmay,\u201d emphasized in the quotation of \u00a7 125, was substituted for the word \u201cshall\u201d in G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 125, by a 1946 amendment. St. 1946, c. 148. We are not concerned here with the question of the amount of the reimbursement to which a county might be entitled but only with the question whether \u00a7 125 permits one county to maintain an action to recover reimbursement from another county.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The parties have agreed to the facts that are material to the question reported.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As to the relationship between Franklin and Worcester counties, it is agreed that in 1976 Franklin County provided 3,141 days of care and support in its county jail and house of correction to prisoners sentenced directly there by courts in Worcester County. From January 1, 1977, through June 30, 1977, Franklin County furnished care and support to such prisoners during 1,471 days. From July 1, 1977, to June 30, 1978, there were 1,988 such prisoner days. Franklin County has approximately 63,500 and Worcester County approximately 640,000 inhabitants. The parties have not set forth any information concerning prisoner days of prisoners sentenced in Franklin County to serve in the Worcester County jail and house of correction. They have assumed in their presentation that there has been a \u201cbalance of trade\u201d in prisoner sentencing adverse to Franklin County in relation to Worcester County.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The relationship between Hampshire County and Hampden County is much the same as between Franklin and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Worcester counties. From July 1, 1975, to June 30, 1976, persons sentenced from Hampden County to the Hampshire County jail served 7,063 days there. Persons sentenced in Hampshire County to the Hampden County jail served 478 days there. For that period, Hampshire County seeks reimbursement for 6,585 prisoner days. For the year July 1, 1976, through June 30, 1977, the \u201cbalance of trade\u201d adverse to Hampshire County was 6,971 prisoner days. Hampshire County has a population of approximately 120,000 and Hampden County has approximately 461,000 people.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Our task, of course, is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent. The defendant counties point to the provision in \u00a7 125 that states that they \u201cmay\u201d pay the expense of supporting a prisoner sentenced to a jail or house of correction in another county. We must give particular recognition to the word \u201cmay\u201d because it was substituted for the word \u201cshall\u201d in the 1946 amendment. We think it clear that the first sentence of \u00a7 125 authorizes but does not direct a county to pay for the support of a prisoner sentenced by a court in that county to serve a sentence in a county jail or house of correction in another county. If there were no further provision in \u00a7 125, that would end the matter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The second sentence of \u00a7 125 cannot be ignored in our analysis. We must consider the entire statutory arrangement to determine the legislative intent. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>373 Mass. 819, 823 (1977). Section 125 provides that \u201c[i]f the amount to be paid cannot be agreed upon,\u201d it may be determined by the Superior Court. The plaintiff counties argue, we think correctly, that this language authorizes a \u201creceiving\u201d county to sue to collect expenses if the \u201csending\u201d county declines to pay for the support of prisoners sentenced in the \u201csending\u201d county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>to the \u201creceiving\u201d county\u2019s jail or house of correction. We reject as illogical the argument that the second sentence of \u00a7 125 is limited to cases in which a \u201csending\u201d county agrees to pay something but the two counties cannot agree on the amount. It is difficult to imagine that an elected county official would voluntarily impose an expense on the taxpayers of his or her county by agreeing to make a payment that the law does not oblige the county to pay. In other words, we see no reason why such an official would make out a \u201cblank check\u201d for the Superior Court to fill in. The argument of the defendant counties as to the meaning of \u00a7 125 makes no practical sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">We are unwilling to attribute to the Legislature an intent to grant a county the unfettered discretion to refuse to pay one cent to another county for the support of prisoners sentenced to a jail or house of correction in that other county. The place where sentence is to be served is beyond the control of the \u201creceiving\u201d county. Barring some special problem (such as a prohibition against sentencing such a prisoner to a county facility at all), a master or keeper of a county jail or house of correction must accept a prisoner sentenced to serve in his jail or house of correction regardless of the county in which the sentence was imposed (G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 15), and he must maintain him at the expense of the county (G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 29). If a county has adequate or special facilities available, perhaps as a result of careful planning, it should not be punished because some other county may lack those facilities. It is preferable that a judge\u2019s decision as to where a defendant is to serve time in a county jail or house of correction not affect the allocation of expenses among counties. The plaintiff counties do not argue that the apparent inequity in denying a \u201creceiving\u201d county reimbursement from another county presents a problem of constitutional dimensions. See <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Norfolk, </em>367 Mass. 345, 350-351 (1975). However, if we construed \u00a7 125 so as to deny reimbursement to a \u201creceiving\u201d county, the taxpayers of the \u201creceiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ing\u201d county would be obliged to fund the expenses which in fairness should not be theirs to pay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We conclude that G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 125, does provide a cause of action for one county against another and answer the reported question in the affirmative.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The reported question reads as follows: \u201cDoes G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 125 provide a cause of action for a county of the Commonwealth that has provided the expense of supporting a prisoner, sentenced directly to that county, against the county where the prisoner was sentenced?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> The 1946 amendment of \u00a7 125 served a practical purpose. The first sentence of \u00a7 125, as so amended, authorizes, but does not require, a county to make payments to other counties. It recognizes that because of offsetting claims or reciprocal arrangements concerning prisoners there may be no occasion for mandating an exchange of funds between counties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\"> We would grant as well that imposing such costs on a sentencing county may riot be equitable in all instances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> No question has been put to us concerning the source of funds to pay any judgment entered against a county in a case under \u00a7 125. Funds might properly be available to a county to satisfy such a judgment. See <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Middlesex </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>371 Mass. 456, 460-462 (1976). The ultimate answer must be a legislative one because of the Legislature\u2019s control over county budgets (G. L. c. 35, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 34) and its authority to determine what system should be used for paying for the care of prisoners in county institutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
