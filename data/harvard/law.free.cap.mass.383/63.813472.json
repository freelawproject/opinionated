We granted the commission\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The facts found by the motion judge are these. On February 21, 1977, the commission voted to investigate the administration of redevelopment programs under G. L. c. 121A by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) and the city of Boston. A subpoena was issued on March 1, 1979, to the Department of Revenue (department) to produce form 121A, Urban Redevelopment Excise Returns, and all attachments as submitted by six named corporations<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the calendar years 1973 through 1978. On the same day the commission subpoenaed the commissioner of the assessing department of the city of Boston (assessor) and the BRA for \u201c[a] 11 financial records and statements\u201d submitted by the six companies yearly for the same years pursuant to G. L. c. 121 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">In response to the subpoenas the department submitted one excise return for the year 1977 but declined to produce the other requested documents. The assessor and the BRA produced no subpoenaed items.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commission commenced this action, and The Prudential Insurance Company of America (Prudential) was allowed to intervene as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>representative of the companies. The commission filed a motion to compel production of documents and for judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The judge concluded that c. 121A projects are properly subject to the commission\u2019s investigatory authority under St. 1909, c. 486, \u00a7 18, but that the law in effect before March 22, 1976, barred disclosure of \u201ctax returns\u201d by the subpoenaed agencies. On the basis of the parties\u2019 memoranda and the commission\u2019s uncontroverted, verified complaint, the judge ordered that discovery was limited to documents pertaining to c. 121A projects, the applications for which were filed on or after March 22, 1976.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The commission argues that it is entitled to discovery of c. 121A excise returns and records for all the years in question on two premises: first, that the documents are public records in which c. 121A corporations have a diminished privacy interest; second, that it has the statutory power and duty to reach the documents. The responding agencies maintain that the proscription against disclosure found in G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 21 (a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> preempts the commission\u2019s public record claim and forecloses the need for balancing the privacy-publicity interests. We agree, in so far as the subpoenas encompass excise returns and their attachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>1. <em>The Public Record Claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In 1975 the Legislature designated c. 121A information as public records. Statute 1975, c. 827, \u00a7 7, replaced former \u00a7 10 of G. L. c. 121A and added the proviso that: \u201cAll such information, as submitted to the tax commission, the department of corporations and taxation, and the appellate tax board by such corporation and the assessors of every such city or town, shall be filed with the housing board and in the office of the assessor of the city or town in which the project is located, and, upon request, shall be made available by said department of corporations and taxation and by the housing board to any person in accordance with the twenty-sixth clause of section four of chapter seven\u201d (error in official print). The judge concluded that the above enactment rendered c. 121A records disclosable under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, but only as to c. 121A applications submitted for approval after the effective date of the 1975 amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The commission takes issue with the judge\u2019s prospective reading of the 1975 amendment and contends that G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, mandates disclosure of all records filed in the years 1973 through 1978 because the documents it seeks were at all times, after 1973, public records within the intendment of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1050, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>The commission\u2019s reliance on our analysis of the public records statutes in <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, </em>374 Mass. 812 (1978), is misplaced in this instance. In <em>Hastings </em>we determined that the expansive definition of public records implemented by St. 1973, c. 1050, \u00a7 6, set out at note 8, <em>supra, </em>required disclosure unless one of nine statutory exemptions applied. 374 Mass, at 817. The commission here seeks tax records which are \u201cspecifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(a). </em>General Laws c. 62C, \u00a7 21 <em>(a), </em>explicitly provides for the confidentiality of tax returns. The records sought in this case thus fall squarely within exemption <em>(a), </em>G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, rather than exemption <em>(c),</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the privacy exclusion addressed in <em>Hastings. </em>Cf. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, </em>377 Mass. 151, 153-156 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Even conceding the public purpose of the c. 121A corporation and that such a corporation has a lesser privacy interest, as the commission claims, the question of the corporation\u2019s rights to confidentiality is not before us.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The subpoenas at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>issue were directed, not to the six companies, but to public officials whose handling of tax records is the object of G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 21 <em>(a). </em>Only by reading a retroactive effect into St. 1975, c. 827, \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> could we reach the conclusion the commission urges. The commission, however, points to no legislative history that might overcome the clearly prospective intent of the section, and we thus rely on the plain language of the statute as enacted. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Norfolk County </em>v. <em>Norfolk County Retirement Sys., </em>377 Mass. 696, 701 (1979) (only positive demonstration of contrary legislative purpose can overcome plain text). We concur in the judge\u2019s limiting discovery to the period after the effective date of St. 1975, c. 827.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> General Laws c. 121A, \u00a7 10, as in effect during the pre-1976 time frame, extended without qualification the provisions and protections of G. L. c. 62G, to c. 121A excise returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">2. <em>The Applicability of G. L. c. 62C, </em>\u00a7 <em>21 (a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 71A, was repealed by St. 1976, c. 415, \u00a7 102, and replaced by G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 21, inserted by St. 1976, c. 415, \u00a7 22.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The provisions of both statutes serve the same underlying intent, to preserve the confidentiality of State tax returns in the hands of public officials. <em>Leave </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>306 Mass. 391, 402-403 (1940) (ban on disclosure by public officials cannot be circumvented by recourse to taxpayer himself); <em>James Millar Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>251 Mass. 457, 464 (1925) (corporate excise returns are privileged). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Section 21 <em>(a) </em>prohibits disclosure of information contained in a \u201creturn or document filed with the commissioner\u201d held by the Commissioner of Revenue, G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1978, c. 514, \u00a7 111, or any \u201cemployee of the Commonwealth or of any city or town . . . .\u201d The section also contains an exception for \u201cproceedings to determine or collect the tax.\u201d G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 21 <em>(a). </em>We examine each aspect of the statute \u2014 the subject parties, the protectible materials, and the exception \u2014 in light of the exemption under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">a. <em>The Parties and Materials Subject to Discovery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The language of the commission\u2019s subpoena to the department for \u201cexcise\u201d returns clearly falls within the proscription of G. L. c. 62C. The subpoenas upon the two city agencies, by contrast, do not specify excise returns but call instead for \u201cfinancial records and statements, submitted yearly . . . pursuant to G. L. Chapter 121A . . . .\u201d Here, the effect of \u00a7 21 <em>(a) </em>depends on whether the assessor and the BRA are \u201cemployee[s] ... of any city\u201d and whether the records sought, if not \u201creturn[sj\u201d are \u201cdocuments] filed with the commissioner\u201d under that section. As to the assessor, the statute\u2019s prohibition is explicit; and, by operation of G. L. c. 121A, \u00a7 10, the assessor has such an integral role in determining the excise<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that its c. 121A records are readily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>construed to be \u201cdocuments] filed with the commissioner\u201d under \u00a7 21 <em>(a). </em>As to the BRA, our reading of its enabling legislation, St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7 12, indicates \u201cemployee\u201d status within the intendment of G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 21 <em>(a). </em>However, it is unclear from the record before us that the BRA holds tax \u201creturn[s] or document[s] filed with the commissioner\u201d as does the assessor.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The BRA has made no response here or in the court below. On the record before us, however, we conclude that to the extent the BRA possesses records predating March, 1976, and duplicating the contents of documents filed with the Commissioner of Revenue, such records are protected from discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">b. <em>The Exception Clause in </em>\u00a7 <em>21 (a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We reject the commission\u2019s characterization that its investigation is a proceeding \u201cto determine a tax,\u201d exempt from confidentiality under G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 21 <em>(a). </em>Without question, the enabling acts which gave birth to the Finance Commission of Boston also granted broad investigatory powers, including \u201cmatters pertaining to taxation.\u201d St. 1908, c. 562, \u00a7 1. See St. 1909, c. 486, \u00a7\u00a7 18 and 19; <em>Finance Comm\u2019n of Boston </em>v. <em>Basile, </em>354 Mass. 188, 191 (1968) (1909 organic act incorporated powers and duties enumerated in 1908 act). But no statute empowers the commission to determine or collect a tax. Contrast G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 21, as appearing in St. 1971, c. 766, \u00a7 19 (assessors empowered to fix the rate of tax); G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 2, as amended by St. 1976, c. 4, \u00a7 31 (constables and sheriffs named as collectors of taxes). The commission suggests no judicial opinion upholding disclosure on the basis of this clause. <em>Opin-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>ion of the Justices, </em>354 Mass. 804 (1968), which the commission cites, addressed the rights of the Attorney General to obtain tax records \u201cfor the purpose of criminal prosecution.\u201d This purpose is manifestly different from the purely investigatory function of the commission and that opinion lends no support to the commission\u2019s claim. See <em>Finance Comm\u2019n of Boston </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>370 Mass. 693, 696-697 (1976) (commission\u2019s function purely investigative) .</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Moreover, as we read the language of the predecessor statute, in effect during the years in question, we find no exemption for proceedings to \u201cdetermine\u201d a tax.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 71A, as amended through St. 1975, c. 514, \u00a7 <em>2. </em>The difference in the language of G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 21 <em>(a), </em>and the prior version at G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 71A, reinforces our conclusion that the commission\u2019s function is not so allied with the taxing power as to entitle it to disclosure. As we have already stated, both the present version, G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 21 <em>(a), </em>and its predecessor statute embody the policy of the Commonwealth to preserve the confidentiality of State tax returns. See <em>Finance Comm\u2019n of Boston </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>343 Mass. 754, 766-767 (1962) (by statute, Massachusetts tax returns privileged; but Federal returns discoverable upon showing substantial necessity); see generally W.B. Leach &amp; P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 147-148 (4th ed. 1967). Until the Legislature took affirmative steps to modify that policy for c. 121A corporations, St. 1975, c. 827, \u00a7 7, there was no reason to draw an exception to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Finally, the commission\u2019s citations to the statutory and judicial underpinnings of its authority fail to overcome the unequivocal prohibition upon the authorities named in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 71A (now G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 21). Without undercutting the established discovery and investigative powers of the commission, we conclude that its subpoena power must yield to the statutory confidentiality mandate which obtained prior to March, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b82-9\"> Besides Prudential Insurance Company, the commission\u2019s complaint sought pertinent financial records of: Northern Assurance Company of America, Charlestown Savings Bank, Al-Jordan Realty Corporation, One-Seventy-Five Federal Street Associates, and Summer Street Realty Corporation (Stone and Webster Corporation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b82-10\"> The record shows no response from the BRA in the proceeding below or on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\"> The judge treated the commission\u2019s motion as one for summary judgment based on an uncontradicted, verified complaint.
