L. c. 151D, \u00a7 11, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1169, \u00a7 1, for the failure of employers to make contributions to employee pension plans regulated by ERISA. We conclude that ERISA preempts \u00a7 11 of the State statute, precluding such prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The cases are before us on a report of questions by a District Court judge pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979). The facts are not in dispute. In 1971, the defendant Richard D. Federico, president of D. Federico Co., Inc., signed an agreement on behalf of the corporation providing for contributions by the corporation to the Massachusetts Laborers\u2019 Health, Welfare, Pension, Training and Legal Fund, an employee welfare benefit plan. The plan and the contributions are the subject of regulation under the Health, Welfare and Retirement Funds Law, G. L. c. 151D. A criminal complaint was filed against Federico, alleging that between December 21, 1978, and January 5, 1979, he had failed to make contributions to the plan, in violation of G. L. c. 151D, \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A similar but unrelated complaint was issued against the defendant Donald A. Dow, treasurer of The Dow Company, Inc., alleging his failure to make employer contributions under c. 151D as provided by an agreement signed by him on behalf of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In their separate proceedings, each defendant claimed a jury trial and moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that G. L. c. 151D, \u00a7 11, is unconstitutional and that, regardless of its constitutionality, the State statute is preempted by the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144. Because of the identity of issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>presented, the two cases were consolidated. The District Court judge reported to the Appeals Court five questions of law concerning Federal preemption and the constitutionality of the State statute. The text of the reported questions is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We transferred the cases to this court on our own motion. As our conclusion that ERISA precludes prosecutions under G. L. c. 151D, \u00a711, disposes of these cases, we confine our discussion to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In enacting ERISA in 1974, Congress determined that comprehensive and uniform regulation of employee benefit plans was necessary in light of the enormous growth in size, scope, and number of such plans and the attendant increase in their economic and social impact. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a) to (c) (1976). In addition to imposing reporting and disclosure requirements, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1021 to 1031, ERISA establishes minimum standards for pension plans, \u00a7\u00a7 1051 to 1086, and provides for civil remedies for violations of the act\u2019s provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 1132, 1140. For some violations, criminal penalties may be imposed, \u00a7 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Federal preemption of the State\u2019s authority to regulate employee benefit plans is contained in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 (1976), which states that with certain exceptions, the provisions of ERISA \u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>plan\u201d covered by the act. \u00a7 1144(a). Qualified exceptions to this broad preemption are made for State laws regulating insurance, banking, and securities. \u00a7 1144(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, the preemption provision \u201cshall not apply to any generally applicable criminal law of a State.\u201d \u00a7 1144(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">All parties agree that the employee benefit plans involved in these cases are subject to the applicable requirements of ERISA. Nor is there dispute over whether G. L. c. 151D, \u00a711, penalizing delinquent contributions to employee retirement plans, \u201crelates to\u201d an employee benefit plan. Thus, there would seem to be little room for argument that the sweeping language of \u00a7 1144(a) requires preemption of G. L. c. 151D, \u00a7 11, unless the State statute may be characterized as a \u201cgenerally applicable criminal law\u201d under \u00a7 1144(b) (4). Despite the broad preemptive language of \u00a7 1144(a), however, the Commonwealth argues that preemption should not be found unless there is an actual conflict between ERISA and G. L. c. 151D, \u00a7 11. No such conflict exists here, urges the Commonwealth; permitting prosecutions under \u00a7 11 for failure to make the contributions that an employer is contractually obliged to make would not interfere with the requirements of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s preemption analysis might have some force had Congress not stated so explicitly in \u00a7 1144(a) its intent to overrid\u00e9 \u201cany and all\u201d State laws relating to employee benefit plans. Only when Congress has not clearly expressed its intent to preempt State law must a court decide whether the application of the State law would frustrate the purposes of the Federal l^w.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Malone </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497, 504 (1978) (plurality opinion), and cases cited. When instead Congress, through explicit statutory language, has \u201cunmistakably ... ordained\u201d that its enactment supersedes State law, the State law must be invalidated under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, art. 6. <em>Chicago &amp; N. Western Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Kalo Brick &amp; Tile Co., </em>450 U.S. 311, 317 (1981) (noting that Federal law should not be deemed to preempt State law \u201cin the absence of persuasive reasons \u2014 either that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has unmistakably so ordained,\u201d quoting from <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142 [1963]). In such situations, the State law must fall even if, as the Commonwealth contends here, it is harmonious with the Federal regulation. See <em>DeCanas </em>v. <em>Bica, </em>424 U.S. 351, 356-357 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Not only the language of the ERISA preemptive provision but also its legislative history compel the conclusion that Congress \u201crejected a concept of preemption limited to conflicting or duplicate state law, in favor of applying the principle in its \u2018broadest sense.\u2019\u201d <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Whaland, </em>562 F.2d 70, 77 (1st Cir. 1977), cert, denied, 435 U.S. 980-981 (1978) (footnote omitted). See <em>Hewlett-Packard Co. </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>425 F. Supp. 1294, 1297-1300 (N.D. Cal. 1977), aff'd per curiam, 571 F.2d 502 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 439 U.S. 831 (1978); <em>National Carriers\u2019 Conference Comm. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>454 F. Supp. 914, 915-917 (D. Conn. 1978).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Having determined that G. L. c. 151D, \u00a7 11, is not exempted, under general principles of the doctrine of preemption, from the preemptive impact of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), we must decide whether \u00a7 11 is nonetheless exempted under the saving clause of \u00a7 1144(b) (4), which leaves intact \u201cany generally applicable criminal law of a State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The Commonwealth contends that \u00a7 11 is a \u201cgenerally applicable\u201d law because it punishes all employers, as well as certain corporate officers, who fail to abide by their contractual obligations to make contributions to retirement benefit plans.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such reasoning was adopted by a New York County Court in <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Mangano, </em>99 Misc. 2d 523, 532 (N.Y. Kings County Ct. 1978), which found that a New York criminal statute similar to G. L. c. 151D, \u00a7 11, was \u201cgenerally applicable\u201d because it affected all employers within the State. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The \u00a7 1144(b)(4) exception from preemption for \u201cgenerally applicable\u201d State criminal laws appears designed to prevent otherwise criminal activity from being immunized from prosecution simply because the activity \u201crelates to\u201d an employee benefit plan. The exception seems directed toward criminal laws that are intended to apply to conduct generally \u2014 criminal laws against larceny and embezzlement, for example. By virtue of \u00a7 1144(b) (4), a State is not precluded from prosecuting, under a theft statute applicable to the entire population, an employer who steals money from an employee benefit plan, simply because the theft involved such a plan. But by limiting the \u00a7 1144(b) (4) exception to criminal laws of <em>general </em>applicability, Congress apparently intended to preempt State criminal statutes aimed specifically at employee benefit plans. See <em>National Carriers\u2019 Conference Comm. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>454 F. Supp. 914, 915-916 (D. Conn. 1978); <em>Bucyrus-Erie Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Industry, Labor &amp; Human Relations of the State of </em>Wis., 599 F.2d 205, 208 (7th Cir. 1979);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hutchinson &amp; Ifshin, Federal Preemption of State Law under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 46 U. Chi. L. Rev. 23, 72 (1978). General Laws c. 151D, \u00a7 11, is such a criminal statute and thus is not entitled to exception from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>preemption under \u00a7 1144(b) (4). The United States Secretary of Labor, in an opinion letter, has reached the same conclusion. 5 Pension Plan Guide (CCH) par. 25, 304, Opinion Letter 79-36, at 27,005-33 to 27,005-34 (October 5, 1979) (noting that ERISA preempts not only \u00a7 11, but also G. L. c. 151D in its entirety).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">As prosecution of these defendants for violations of G. L. c. 151D, \u00a7 11, is precluded under ERISA, we answer \u201cYes\u201d to reported questions 1 and 2, and \u201cNo\u201d to reported question 3.
