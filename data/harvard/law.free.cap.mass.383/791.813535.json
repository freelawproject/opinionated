See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11. The arbitrator awarded \u201callied service credit\u201d to Anthony M. Iacozza, a probation officer, and the Superior Court confirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>award. The employer appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The facts found by the arbitrator are not in dispute. Iacozza, the grievant, was appointed on May 12, 1978, as a temporary probation officer for the Superior Court in Bristol and Barnstable counties. He had worked as a counselor for the Boston Youth Activities Commission, and at least two court officials had discussed with him \u201callied service credit\u201d for that work. See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 83, 99B (3), authorizing such credit. Under the Court Reorganization Act, effective July 1, 1978, the appointment became subject to review by the plaintiff. G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9, inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 110. G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 83, as amended by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 290. The grievant was appointed a temporary probation officer on November 28, 1978, with a retroactive hiring date of July 24, 1978. On June 28, 1979, he was recommended for permanent appointment as a probation officer for Bristol County, and on November 26, 1979, the plaintiff approved the permanent appointment but denied the grievant\u2019s request for allied service credit. Meanwhile, on August 21, 1979, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a collective bargaining agreement for the period from July 1, 1978, to June 30, 1981. Before July 1, 1978, it had been the practice for the Superior Court committee on personnel to grant such credit at its discretion, but the practice ended on June 30, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The arbitrator ruled as a threshold matter that the grievance dealt with compensation rather than appointment and was therefore arbitrable. On the merits, he found that a practice of giving credit for allied service existed before July 1, 1978, sufficient to ensure that the grievant would have received such credit if the plaintiff had not terminated the practice. The practice was clearly stated and understood, maintained over a reasonable time, and accepted by both parties, and it could not be terminated unilaterally. There had been no negotiations about the practice. Hence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>the plaintiff had violated the collective bargaining agreement, and the grievant should receive allied service credit as of July 25, 1978, placing him on Step 3 of Job Group 1 instead of Step 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The collective bargaining agreement, art. V, \u00a7 5.01, defines a \u201cgrievance\u201d as \u201ca written dispute concerning the application or interpretation of the terms of this agreement.\u201d Article V, \u00a7 5.04, provides for arbitration of grievances, and adds, \u201cThe arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify any provision of this Agreement or to issue any decision or award inconsistent with applicable law or which interfers [sic] in any way with normal operations of the courts.\u201d Article XXVI, \u00a7\u00a7 26.01-26.03, under the caption \u201cEntire Agreement,\u201d is an \u201cintegration\u201d or \u201czipper\u201d clause, and is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Under art. XVI, \u201cManagement Rights,\u201d \u00a7 16.01, appointment of personnel is a right \u201cvested exclusively in the Employer.\u201d Compensation of probation officers, however, is governed by art. X, \u00a7 10.01, and by Schedule A, setting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>forth in tabular form specific annual rates of pay for seven or more steps in each of four \u201cjob groups\u201d in each of the three fiscal years covered by the agreement. Under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 99B (1), probation officers are in job group 1; \u00a7 10.01A of the agreement refers to \u201cthe step rate in which\u201d employees \u201cwere classified on June 30,1979,\u201d and \u00a7 10.01D refers to probation officers \u201chired on and after July 1, 1978 in Step 1.\u201d But the grievant was not classified to any step on June 30, 1979, and the very question in dispute is whether he should be hired in Step 1. Reference to some standard or practice outside the agreement seems essential if the agreement is to have meaningful application, and reference to previous practice is an orthodox source of meaning. Thus we have no doubt that the dispute is a \u201cgrievance\u201d subject to arbitration under the agreement. The arbitrator was asked to interpret and apply the agreement, not to add to it, subtract from it, or modify it. See <em>Cape Cod Gas Co. </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers Local 13507, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 258, 261-265 (1975), and cases cited. Cf. <em>Torrington </em>v. <em>Metal Prods. Workers Local 1645, </em>362 F.2d 677, 681-682 (2d Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Once it is decided that a matter is arbitrable, we do not decide the merits. See <em>School Comm. of Southbridge </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>375 Mass. 502, 504 (1978), and cases cited. The arbitrator\u2019s opinion here manifests fidelity to his obligations; he did not \u201cdispense his own brand of industrial justice.\u201d His award \u201cdraws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d See <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960); <em>Morceau </em>v. <em>Gould Nat'l Batteries, Inc., </em>344 Mass. 120, 124-125 (1962). Our conclusion is not affected by the \u201czipper\u201d clause, art. XXVI. That clause does not prevent interpretation and application of the agreement in accordance with past practice. <em>Shippensburg Area Educ. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Shippensburg Area School Dist., </em>42 Pa. Commw. Ct. 128, 133-134 (1979).
