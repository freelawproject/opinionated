Arthurs, a physician licensed by the Commonwealth, seeks judicial review of the decision of the Board of Registration in Medicine (board), revoking his license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The board found that Arthurs prescribed controlled substances for other than a legitimate medical purpose, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19 <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">The plaintiff claims that (1) the board\u2019s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence; (2) the board erred by basing its decision on one of its adjudicatory opinions decided after Arthurs\u2019s conduct had occurred; (3) the board erred in its treatment of Arthurs\u2019s objections to the recommended decision of a hearing officer; (4) the doctrine of double jeopardy bars the board\u2019s disciplinary proceeding on the ground that Arthurs was acquitted in the Superior Court of charges growing out of the same conduct; and (5) that the disciplinary proceedings are barred on the ground of entrapment. We conclude that the decision of the board should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>On October 1, 1976, the board issued an order to show cause,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> charging Arthurs with issuing prescriptions for controlled substances for other than a legitimate medical purpose, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19 <em>(a).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Arthurs moved for specification of the charges, and the board detailed its allegations against him in a document entitled \u201cFurther Specifications.\u201d In essence, the board charged Arthurs with unlawfully prescribing controlled substances for five persons on fifty-six occasions. Arthurs then challenged the right of the board to deny him a continuance of the disciplinary proceedings during the pendency of criminal charges against him arising from some of the same conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After those proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>terminated in the board\u2019s favor, the board held a hearing on its charges. In a \u201cRecommended Decision,\u201d the hearing officer,* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who conducted that hearing,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> found that Arthurs had prescribed controlled substances for other than a legitimate medical purpose for three persons on numerous occasions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The hearing officer concluded that in the prescribing of controlled substances, Arthurs failed to meet the minimum standards of proper medical practice suggested in a 1978 opinion by the board. <em>Matter of Baer, </em>Adjudicatory Case No. 205 (July 14, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">After Arthurs made written and oral objections<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the recommended decision, the board issued a final order revok<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ing Arthurs\u2019s certificate of registration to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The board stated that \u201c [ajfter full consideration of the record and the exhibits, the Board adopts the Recommended Decision as the basis of its decision.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It further stated that \u201c[ojn the basis of the findings of fact enumerated in the Recommended Decision, and for reasons similar to those set forth in detail in <em>In the Matter of Arthur E. Baer, M.D., . </em>. . the defendant did prescribe controlled substances for other than a legitimate medical purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The specific findings made by the board are that: (1) Arthurs issued, without explanation, repeated refill prescriptions for controlled substances over relatively short periods of time; (2) Arthurs failed to exercise minimum care in preventing persons from obtaining multiple prescriptions from him for controlled substances under different pseudonyms; (3) Arthurs failed to exercise minimum care in obtaining and recording the addresses of patients for whom he was prescribing controlled substances over extended periods of time; and (4) Arthurs repeatedly failed to record an appropriate medical history, and to record an appropriate physical examination, in instances where controlled substances were prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The board concluded that, \u201c [f ]rom the extensive evidence submitted, it is clear that [Arthurs\u2019s] behavior was not an isolated incident or oversight, but a pattern of intentional or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>negligent practice.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Arthurs then filed his complaint for judicial review. G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">1. <em>The- substantiality of the evidence. </em>Arthurs claims that the decision of the board is unsupported by substantial evidence, and therefore must be set aside. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(e). </em>\u2018\u201cSubstantial evidence\u2019 means such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). Initially, we note the limited nature of our review under the substantial evidence standard. While we must consider the entire record, and must take into account whatever in the record detracts from the weight of the agency\u2019s opinion, <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1966), as long as there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the agency, we will not substitute our views as to the facts. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>347 Mass. 264 (1964). <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>342 Mass. 45 (1961). There must, however, be substantial evidence in the record to support the findings of the board. While the board is free to evaluate evidence in light of its expertise, it cannot use its expertise as a substitute for evidence in the record. We are concerned with how the board arrived at its decision and with the evidence on which it relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We summarize the facts found by the board. A. <em>Charles Jackson and David Jackson.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A black male weighing approximately 300 pounds and standing approximately six feet, three or four inches, tall, established a patient relationship with Arthurs under the names Charles Jackson and David Jackson. On six days this patient visited Arthurs twice, once under each name, and received prescriptions for either Quaalude<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or Desoxyn, both controlled substances. The board found as a fact that Jackson was \u201cphysically prominent\u201d and that \u201cit would be extremely difficult for him to pass himself under two different aliases to the same doctor.\u201d At the hearing, Arthurs conceded that Jackson was a distinctive looking individual. The board found that Arthurs \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that David and Charles Jackson were the same person.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>From the prescriptions and the patient cards in evidence, the board found that Arthurs had prescribed controlled substances on sixteen occasions for David Jackson, and on at least nine occasions for Charles Jackson. All these prescriptions directed the patients to take one tablet daily. The board calculated that over the ninety-two days covered by the first four prescriptions to Charles Jackson, Arthurs issued prescriptions that exceeded the one tablet daily dosage prescribed to that patient by thirty per cent;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> over a period of 166 days, Arthurs issued prescriptions to David Jackson that exceeded the directed dosage by forty-five per cent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Arthurs offered no explanation for the excess in the amount of controlled substances prescribed by him, or for his failure to identify a patient for whom he was prescribing controlled substances.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The facts found by the board also indicate that Arthurs failed to record on a patient card four prescriptions for Quaalude, two for David Jackson and two for Charles Jackson. It also found that six prescriptions for controlled substances issued to David Jackson were recorded on Charles Jackson\u2019s patient card, and that a prescription for Quaalude for one Margaret Jackson was recorded on Charles Jackson\u2019s card.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The patient cards, the board found, showed that Arthurs recorded Charles Jackson\u2019s address on his first visit as 108 Pearl Street, Cambridge, and David Jackson\u2019s address as 108 Pearl Street, Somerville. The first visit of this patient under his two names occurred on two consecutive days. Arthurs used the two addresses interchangeably thereafter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The board concluded that \u201c [wjhile it is certainly possible to copy or remember part of an address incorrectly, the extended pattern of using \u2018Cambridge\u2019 and \u2018Somerville\u2019 interchangeably on the twenty-five prescriptions in evidence for \u2018Charles Jackson\u2019 and \u2018David Jackson\u2019 raises the question whether Dr. Arthurs here took minimal care to prevent the fraudulent use of controlled substances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">B. <em>Gail </em>Diamond.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Arthurs issued six prescriptions for Quaalude to a patient known to Arthurs as Gail Diamond. Two of these prescriptions were not recorded on the patient card, and on at least one prescription Arthurs used a different address without making a notation of any change of address on the patient card.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Arthurs\u2019s prescriptions directed Diamond to take one tablet daily. Over the forty-nine days covered by the first five prescriptions, the board determined that Arthurs issued prescriptions which exceeded the one tablet daily dosage by 200 %. The board concluded that there might be an explanation for one of the surplus prescriptions,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but not for the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">C. <em>Thomas Price. </em>Thomas Price<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> was the pseudonym used by a detective from the Massachusetts State Police Diversion Investigation Unit. On Price\u2019s first recorded visit, Arthurs prescribed Nembutal but did not indicate a quantity on the patient card. On Price\u2019s return visit, Ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>thurs noted that \u201c [pjatient works late as he is a bouncer in a bar room and when he gets home he can\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d There is no notation of a prescription on that date. Arthurs prescribed Nembutal at bedtime to Price on seven subsequent dates, all of which were noted on the patient card, the last with the notation \u201cmay repeat if needed.\u201d Arthurs also prescribed Quaalude for him on one occasion. Over the 125 days covered by six prescriptions issued to Price, the board calculated that the number of tablets prescribed exceeded the one tablet daily dosage directed by Arthurs by forty-four per cent.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The patient card for Thomas Price does not show any record of any physical examination during any of his nine visits,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> nor any mention of the patient\u2019s present condition after the first two visits; nevertheless, controlled substances were prescribed on all but the second visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The findings that prescriptions for controlled substances were not recorded, or were recorded on the wrong patient card, as well as the findings as to the quantity of drugs prescribed at short intervals to patients in excess of Arthurs\u2019s specific directions to take one tablet daily, all support the board\u2019s conclusion that Arthurs prescribed controlled substances for other than a legitimate medical purpose.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201cThe issuing of additional prescriptions ... at short intervals . . . could [be] found to be inconsistent with accepted medical treatment and support an inference that the prescriptions were not intended to serve a medical purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Comins, </em>371 Mass. 222, 233 (1976), cert, denied, 430 U.S. 946 (1977). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smurthwaite, </em>590 F.2d 889, 892 (10th Cir. 1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>582 F.2d 1032,1036 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bartee, </em>479 F.2d 484, 489 (10th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The board also could find that Arthurs prescribed controlled substances not in the usual course of his medical practice and acted other than for a legitimate medical purpose \u201cfrom evidence . . . <em>surrounding the facts and circumstances of the prescriptions\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>609 F.2d 834, 839 (5th Cir. 1980). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>507 F.2d 385, 387 (9th Cir. 1974). We conclude that on the above facts and circumstances, the board\u2019s decision is amply supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We comment briefly on certain other findings of the board in its decision. The board also found that Arthurs\u2019s recordkeeping, and certain of his medical practices, were deficient in some respects. We cannot consider these findings because there is no substantial evidence in the record to support these findings.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The board, however, argues that since most of the members of the board are experts, the board can use its expertise without the evidentiary basis of that expertise appearing in the record. \u201cThis startling theory, if recognized, would not only render absolute a finding opposed to uncontradicted testimony but would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>render the right of appeal completely inefficacious as well. A board of experts, sitting in a quasi-judicial capacity, cannot be silent witnesses as well as judges.\u201d <em>New Jersey Bd. of Optometrists </em>v. <em>Nemitz, </em>21 N.J. Super. 18, 28 (1952). The board may put its expertise to use in evaluating the complexities of technical evidence. However, the board may not use its expertise as a substitute for evidence in the record. \u201cThe requirement for administrative decisions based on substantial evidence and reasoned findings \u2014 which alone make effective judicial review possible \u2014 would become lost in the haze of so-called expertise [if material facts known to the agency did not appear in the record]. Administrative expertise would then be on its way to becoming \u2018a monster which rules with no practical limits on its discretion.\u2019\u201d <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. </em>v. <em>Aberdeen &amp; Rockfish R.R., </em>393 U.S. 87, 92 (1968), quoting from <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 167 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">If an agency wishes to rely on a fact, that fact must be established by evidence in the record. An agency may introduce technical or specialized facts in the record through expert witnesses, or by taking official notice of facts. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (5). Whatever method it chooses, the board must make certain that sufficient evidence is in the record for a court to review the evidence on which the agency relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">As we read the board\u2019s decision, it concentrated on Arthurs\u2019s overprescribing, his failure properly to identify David and Charles Jackson, and the obvious mistakes in the patient cards concerning the prescriptions in evidence. The over-all facts and circumstances established by substantial evidence permitted the board to conclude that Arthurs was not acting for a legitimate medical purpose in prescribing controlled substances. Determinations as to the effect of conduct is essentially a matter of drawing inferences, and an agency\u2019s conclusions based on inferences will not be set aside by a reviewing court unless they are unreasonable. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>conclude that the inferences drawn by the board in this case are reasonable and are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">2. <em>Reliance on the Baer decision. </em>Arthurs challenges the revocation of his license on the ground that the hearing officer, and the board, took notice \u201cof general, technical or scientific facts\u201d without notifying him of the materials so noticed as required by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (5).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> He also claims that the board is required to adopt such standards as it promulgated in <em>Matter of Baer, </em>Adjudicatory Case No. 205 (July 14,1978), see note 25, <em>infra, </em>solely by rulemaking, and that it is not fair to judge Arthurs\u2019s conduct by criteria set forth in an adjudicatory case determined after that conduct had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In its decision, the board drew inferences from the findings of fact as to Arthurs\u2019s conduct. \u201c[T]he Board is, as is any other trier of fact, accorded the power to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence before it.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Milk Drivers, Local 338, </em>531 F.2d 1162, 1165 (2d Cir. 1976). \u201cOne of the purposes which lead to the creation of such boards is to have decisions based on evidential facts under the particular statute made by experienced officials with an adequate appreciation of the complexities of the subject which is entrusted to their administration.\u201d <em>American Broadcasting Cos. </em>v. <em>Writers Guild of America, West, Inc., </em>437 U.S. 411, 433 (1978), quoting from <em>Republic Aviation Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 800 (1945). <em>Radio Officers\u2019 Union </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>347 U.S. 17, 48-49 (1954). The board\u2019s conclusion that Arthurs prescribed controlled substances for other than legitimate medical purposes is a reasonable and permissible inference from the evidence. See <em>supra </em>at 308-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>309. The board based its holding on the <em>Baer </em>decision, which relies on case law,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> not on expertise or technical knowledge. See note 22, <em>supra. </em>The inferences drawn from the evidence in this case were largely matters of common experience and common sense, not matters of specialized or technical knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Arthurs next argues that the board should have utilized rulemaking rather than adjudication in establishing standards for determining when a physician unlawfully prescribes controlled substances. We disagree. It is a recognized principle of administrative law that an agency may adopt policies through adjudication as well as through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>rulemaking. <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 201-203 (1947). Accord, <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 291-294 (1974); <em>Maine Pub. Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>FPC, </em>579 F.2d 659, 669 n.14 (1st Cir. 1978). Policies announced in adjudicatory proceedings may serve as precedents for future cases. See <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>394 U.S. 759, 766 (1969); <em>Michigan Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. </em>v. <em>FPC, </em>520 F.2d 84, 89 (D.C. Cir. 1975). Further, \u201cthe choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual, <em>ad hoc </em>litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947). <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 294 (1974).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">We do not think it inappropriate, much less erroneous, for the agency to use an ad hoc method of adjudication in disciplinary cases arising out of a criminal statute which is interpreted on an ad hoc basis by the courts. \u201cIt is the merit of the common law that it decides the case first and determines the principle afterwards. ... A well settled legal doctrine embodies the work of many minds, and has been tested in form as well as substance by trained critics whose practical interest it is to resist it at every.step. These are advantages the want of which cannot be supplied by any faculty of generalization, however brilliant . . . .\u201d <em>Matter of Roche, </em>381 Mass. 624, 639 n.16 (1980), quoting Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Codes, And the Arrangement of the Law, 5 Am. L. Rev. 1 (1870).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Since the board\u2019s decisions are public, see 243 Code Mass. Regs. 1.04: (13) (1979),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the board is not at fault if persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>appearing before it are unaware of its decisions. Of course, it is helpful for the hearing officer to inform counsel of the opinions on which the hearing officer intends to rely. Arthurs had an opportunity<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to argue that the inferences from the evidence of overprescribing, the failure to recognize a patient obtaining prescriptions under two names, and the failure to record prescriptions for controlled substances on patient cards, were not reasonable or, even if reasonable, should not be made by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Arthurs also contends that, since the conduct which gave rise to the charges against him took place prior to the <em>Baer </em>decision, any reliance on the <em>Baer </em>standards is barred as an ex post facto ruling. The short answer is that disciplinary proceedings fall outside the scope of the ex post facto doctrine. <em>Hawker </em>v. <em>New York, </em>170 U.S. 189, 197 (1898). <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019rs, </em>102 Cal. 483, 492 (1894). <em>Furnish </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>149 Cal. App. 2d 326, 330-331 (1957). The <em>Hawker </em>court, holding that a State may bar a convicted felon from the practice of medicine by way of legislation enacted after the individual\u2019s conviction, stated, \u201cThe State is not seeking to further punish a criminal, but only to protect its citizens from physicians of bad character.\u201d 170 U.S. at 196. Such a law is, rather than ex post facto, simply \u201cretrospective insofar as it determines from the past conduct of the party his fitness for the proposed business.\u201d <em>Furnish, supra </em>at 331, quoting from <em>Foster, supra </em>at 492. Further, Arthurs\u2019s conduct was criminal under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 19 <em>(a), </em>and that statute was in effect prior to the conduct which culminated in discipline. Thus the board did not impose any new substantive liabilities on Arthurs. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Klein, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>372 Mass. 823, 833 (1977) (new standard of criminal conduct not applied retroactively because defendant not on notice of possible criminality of his conduct). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>381 Mass. 411, 418 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">3. <em>The board\u2019s denial of Arthurs\u2019s objections to the recommended decision. </em>After the hearing officer filed the recommended decision with the board, the board notified Arthurs of his right to file objections to that decision.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Arthurs then filed written objections and made oral objections to the recommended decision. The board\u2019s, final order, which adopted the recommended decision, noted Arthurs\u2019s objections, but did not specifically address or answer them.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Arthurs argues that the board erred by not providing an adequate statement of reasons for overruling his objections. We disagree. First, while the board is required to afford parties adversely affected by a recommended decision of a hearing officer the opportunity to file objections to the decision, see note 29, <em>supra, </em>nothing in the regulations governing the board\u2019s adjudicatory hearings requires the board to respond specifically to those objections. Second, while G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (8),<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> requires every agency decision to be \u201caccompanied by a statement of reasons for the decision,\u201d that requirement was satisfied in this case by the statement of reasons set forth in the hearing officer\u2019s recommended decision, which the board adopted in its entirety. General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (8), does not specifically require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>that objections to a recommended decision be answered or be accompanied by a statement of reasons, only that the agency\u2019s final decision be accompanied by the required statement of reasons. The board\u2019s failure to rebut Arthurs\u2019s objections specifically, therefore, is not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Arthurs also argues that it was error for the board to have overruled those objections since the board did not have a copy of the hearing transcript when it made its ruling. The simple answer is that there is no requirement in the State Administrative Procedure Act that agency officials who are to render a final decision must review the transcript before ruling on objections to a proposed decision. Cf. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (7). Arthurs urges us to impose a rule of procedure on the board. The board is responsible to the public for the discipline of physicians who abuse their obligations and the responsibilities of their profession. Since the board must \u201cprovide itself with the flexibility it needed to investigate and to determine whether the public interest requires the revocation of a physician\u2019s license,\u201d <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 526 (1979), we defer to the board\u2019s determination as to how it should proceed as long as its actions are consistent with the requirements of due process and G. L. c. 30A. We decline to impose a rule on the board which might unduly hamper its effective functioning. See <em>Grocery Mfrs. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 80 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">4. <em>Double Jeopardy. </em>Arthurs argues that since he was acquitted in 1977 of charges relating to the issuance of prescriptions to Thomas Price (the undercover officer), and since the indictments as to Charles and David Jackson, and Gail Diamond were continued without a finding and then dismissed, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brandano, </em>359 Mass. 332 (1971), the principle of double jeopardy bars the board from disciplining him. Arthurs claims that the disciplinary proceedings are punitive, and as such they are barred by the outcome of judicial proceedings. Arthurs argues that, since a person disciplined by a professional board is necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>humiliated and disgraced, disciplinary proceedings are essentially a form of punishment. While Arthurs may be correct as to the effect of such a proceeding on a disciplined professional, the purpose of discipline is not retribution but the protection of the public. The board is mandated to police the medical profession, and to take appropriate disciplinary action against those members of the profession \u201cwho do not live up to the solemn nature of their public trust.\u201d <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 528 (1979). The fact that discipline is painful does not alter the board\u2019s responsibility to consider a physician\u2019s qualification to practice medicine. The board may make that determination even in cases where the physician prevails in a judicial proceeding. See <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>303 U.S. 391, 397 (1938); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Naftalin, </em>606 F.2d 809, 812 (8th Cir. 1979); <em>Younge </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Registration for the Healing Arts, </em>451 S.W.2d 346 (Mo.

To show entrapment, a defendant must show some evidence of government inducement, and \u201c[m]ere evidence of solicitation is not enough to show inducement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>382 Mass. 379, 385 (1981), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 652 (1972). Here, there were no lengthy negotiations between Arthurs and Price, nor was there evidence that the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ment \u201cwent beyond a simple request and pleaded or argued with the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra </em>at 385, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 652, quoting from <em>Kadis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 F.2d 370, 374 (1st Cir. 1967).

Arthurs claimed that the disciplinary proceedings in their entirety were barred by principles of double jeopardy. Arthurs made a number of additional claims in his objections to the recommended decision. He claimed that many of the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions related to charges never specifically made, namely that Arthurs failed to maintain adequate records, that he issued prescriptions at less than proper intervals, that he failed to question patients closely before issuing prescriptions for controlled substances, that he failed to schedule return office visits for his patients, and that he failed to take adequate note of the addresses of his patients. Arthurs also argued that the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions on these points were unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\"> Hereinafter, we shall refer to the decision as the board\u2019s decision since it is that decision which is subject to judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\"> In June, 1974, Arthurs was tried and acquitted on a Federal indictment charging him with prescribing Desoxyn and Seconal not in the course of his professional practice. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arthurs, </em>No. 74-23-M (D. Mass., June 19, 1974). The board found that Arthurs was on notice of the care required in prescribing controlled substances by a prior trial on similar charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\"> On June 11, 1979, Arthurs filed a complaint in the Superior Court in Middlesex County seeking judicial review of the decision of the board. Although G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, provides for judicial review of the board\u2019s decision in the Supreme Judicial Court, the board did not move to dismiss. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b)(1) and (h)(3), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). Rather the board petitioned the single justice to transfer the action pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A. By an order dated June 14, 1979, a single justice transferred the action. The physician then moved that the single justice stay the board\u2019s order; the physician similarly moved that the board stay its own order pending the completion of the proceeding for judicial review. The board allowed this motion on the ground that it was unable to provide a transcript of the administrative hearing; it stayed its disciplinary order until ten days after it would have filed its answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The board filed its answer to Arthurs\u2019s complaint on July 28,1980, incorporating the documentary record as well as the transcripts of the disciplinary proceeding. The parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment. After hearing argument on these cross motions, a single justice reserved and reported the case for decision of all issues by us. Upon Arthurs\u2019s motion, the board subsequently stayed its disciplinary order until fifteen days after the issuance of a rescript from this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\"> The person who used the names Charles Jackson and David Jackson was summoned by the board. He was unwilling to testify without his attorney present, and was dismissed to be recalled at a later time. Neither the board nor Arthurs recalled him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> The parties stipulated that \u201cthe descriptions of the drugs as found in the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference would govern these proceedings.\u201d However, it is unclear from the record what the parties meant by \u201cdescription.\u201d For example, in the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference, in addition to the chemical description of Quaalude, the following comments appear: \u201cCaution must be exercised in administering [Quaalude] to individuals known to be addiction-prone or those whose history suggests they may increase the dosage on their own initiative. Illicit use of the drug or abuse of the drug for nontherapeutic purposes may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.\u201d PDR at 986 (1979). The board does not argue that this warning is included in the stipulation as to the description of the drugs; hence, we do not consider it. The PDR text contained warnings about the dangers of misuse of the other controlled substances prescribed by Arthurs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\"> Arthurs issued thirty unit Quaalude prescriptions for Charles Jackson with directions to take one tablet daily, at intervals of 15, 27, 37, 14, 27, and 39 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> Arthurs issued Quaalude prescriptions to David Jackson with directions to take one tablet daily, at intervals of 15, 27, 29, 7, 17, 25, 34, and 11 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b324-9\"> When asked if some of his black patients were obtaining prescriptions by using aliases, Arthurs said, \u201cBlack people, I just couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d The board, correctly, did not credit this feeble excuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> The hearing officer concluded that Gail Diamond was not the true name of Arthurs\u2019s patient but that Arthurs knew her as Gail Diamond.

A hearing officer who hears evidence in a contested adjudicatory proceeding should make credibility determinations whenever necessary, no matter how difficult.
