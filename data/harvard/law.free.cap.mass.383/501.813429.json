L. c. 151A. The board\u2019s decision was affirmed by a judge of the District Court and, pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42, the case was reported to this court. We hold that the persons employed in church-operated elemen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>tary and secondary schools are not covered by the Massachusetts unemployment compensation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We summarize the facts. The Roman Catholic bishop of the diocese of Springfield and his successors are a \u201cbody politic and corporation sole . . . subject to all laws of this Commonwealth regulating corporations established for religious and charitable purposes.\u201d St. 1898, c. 368, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 6. The corporation is \u201cempowered to receive, take and hold, by sale, gift, lease, devise or otherwise, real and personal estate of every description, for religious, charitable and burial purposes, and to manage and dispose of the same for the religious and charitable purposes of the Roman Catholic church.\u201d St. 1898, c. 368, \u00a7 2. The corporation sole operates 136 churches, fifteen missions, and thirty-nine elementary and secondary schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The corporation sole is a nonprofit entity as described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) (1976), and is exempt from income taxation pursuant to \u00a7 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The schools are not separately incorporated and do not enjoy an independent tax-free nonprofit status. The exemption from taxation only \u201cruns in favor of the Corporation Sole,\u201d and not to any of the schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The bishop of Springfield appoints a superintendent of schools, who in turn appoints administrators and principals who operate the schools on a day-to-day basis. Of the 725 faculty members in the schools, approximately 400 are lay teachers; the remaining are priests, nuns, or brothers. The schools are funded by tuition fees and revenues collected at Sunday masses, and any operating deficit is paid by the corporation sole. In the first calendar quarter of 1978, each of the thirty-nine schools paid wages in excess of $1,500. G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 8A.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The schools are accredited by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Both religious and secular subjects are taught in the schools. However, classes, including courses in the secular subjects, are taught in a manner reflecting the perspectives of the church. Each school has some mandatory religious services, as well as optional religious services.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>In 1970, the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3311 (1970), was amended to require the States to extend unemployment insurance coverage to employees of nonprofit corporations, including institutions of higher learning. However, as amended, \u00a7 3309(b), permitted the States to exclude from coverage services performed \u201c (1) in the employ of (A) a church or convention or association of churches, or (B) an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes and which is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches; (2) by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry or by a member of a religious order in the exercise of duties required by such order; (3) in the employ of a school which is not an institution of higher education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In 1976, Congress again amended FUTA and specifically eliminated subsection 3 of \u00a7 3309(b), and required the States to conform their employment security statutes to Federal law in order to qualify for Federal certification. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304 (1976). In 1977, the Legislature amended the State statutory counterpart to \u00a7 3309 so as to conform Massachusetts law to the requirements needed for Federal certification. See St. 1977, c. 720, \u00a7 3. See also G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 6 <em>(r) </em>and 6 (s).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The issue is whether the repeal of the exemption for services performed \u201cin the employ of a school which is not an institution of higher education\u201d means that church-operated elementary and secondary schools are now covered by the State employment security law. The director contends that Congress intended to extend State unemployment benefits to the employees of church-operated elementary and secondary schools, and that the employer is the school. Hence he argues that the exemption for those in the employ of a church, \u00a7 3309(b)(1)(A), is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The director suggests that the various amendments<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> expanding unemployment compensation coverage evidence a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>general congressional intent to afford \u201cuniversal coverage\u201d for every employee against wage loss resulting from unemployment. He suggests that in light of this congressional intent the 1976 amendments should be interpreted by us as expanding unemployment coverage to employees of church-operated elementary and secondary schools. The director argues that his position is also supported by an opinion issued by the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor (Secretary) in 1978 officially stating that services performed in church-related elementary and secondary schools were covered by FUTA,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that in response to this opinion, all States were required to assess unemployment compensation taxes against church schools. The director urges us to give \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the statute, which supports his reading of the statute. The director concludes that this court should hold that the thirty-nine schools are employing units required to pay unemployment compensation taxes. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Neither G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 6 (r), nor 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309(b) (1970) evidences a clear legislative intent to require States to tax church-operated schools. On the contrary, when Congress deleted subsection (b) (3) of \u00a7 3309, specifically pertaining to schools, it retained subsection (b)(1)(A), exempting employees of a church. Since \u201cthe two subsections are disjunctive . . . compliance with Subsection 1(A) . . . is sufficient to warrant exemption.\u201d <em>Grace Brethren Church </em>v. <em>California, </em>CV 79-93 MRP, slip op. at 8 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 21, 1979). Since under prior law, employees of church-operated elementary and secondary schools enjoyed dual exemption under \u00a7 3309(b)(1)(A) and (b)(3), the elimination of one exemption did not by itself subject these schools to the provisions of the unemployment compensation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The record before us indicates that the schools are run for religious purposes, and the employees of the schools are employees of the corporation sole. As we read G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 6 (r), it is dependent on who the employer is, and not on the nature of the services to be rendered. It is abundantly clear on this record that the employer is the Roman Catholic Bishop of Springfield, a corporation sole.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The director\u2019s interpretation of the statute would necessitate defining \u201cchurch\u201d to include only the physical house of worship, and duly ordained ministers. We find no such limitation in \u00a7 6 (r). \u201cWe are convinced that the plain meaning of \u2018church\u2019 requires a definition as something qualitatively greater than the physical building of worship and, at a minimum, the term encompasses the legal entity commonly referred to as a church.\u201d <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>626 F.2d 366, 369 (5th Cir.), appeal pending, 49 U.S.L.W. 3456 (Dec. 8, 1980). We believe that Congress did not intend the employment security tax to apply to church-operated schools run directly by the church with its own employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The argument that we should give great deference to the Secretary\u2019s 1978 opinion is inapplicable to the facts of this case. The Secretary\u2019s opinion was neither contemporaneous with the congressional amendment nor was it consistent with prior Labor Department constructions of the Federal statute. See Comment, Bringing Christian Schools Within the Scope of the Unemployment Compensation Laws: Statutory and Free Exercise Issues, 25 Vill. L. Rev. 69, 84 n.121 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hence, there is no reason for us to defer to the Secretary\u2019s latest interpretation of the FUTA provisions. See generally <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 139 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>(1944). Cf. <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 343 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 3309(b)(1)(A), and of its State corollary, G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 6 (r), is consistent with the decision of every court that has considered the issue, save one. <em>In re Northwestern Lutheran Academy, </em>S.D. (1980) (290 N.W.2d 845 [S.D. 1980]), cert, granted sub nom. <em>St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>South Dakota, </em>449 U.S. 959 (1980). Contra, <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>626 F.2d 366 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Grace Brethren Church </em>v. <em>California, </em>CV 79-93 MRP (C.D. Cal. Sept. 21,1979); <em>Roman Catholic Church of the Archdiocese of New Orleans </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>387 So. 2d 1248 (La. App. 1980), appeal pending, 49 U.S.L.W. 3644 (Feb. 6, 1981). <em>Sant Bani Ashram, Inc. </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dep\u2019t of Employment Security, </em>121 N.H. 74 (1981); <em>Grace Lutheran Church </em>v. <em>North Dakota Employment Security Bureau, </em>294 N.W.2d 767 (N.D. 1980); <em>Employment Div. </em>v. <em>Archdiocese of Portland, </em>42 Or. App. 421 (1979); <em>Christian School Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>55 Pa. Commw. Ct. 555 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In light of our holding that the church-operated schools are exempt from the State employment security law by virtue of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 6 (r), we need not consider the bishop\u2019s argument that the schools are also exempt by virtue of the prohibitions of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\"> See employment security amendments of 1970 amending \u00a7\u00a7 3304(a)(6), 3306 (c)(8) and 3309 (a)(1)(A), and requiring unemploy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ment coverage to be extended to individuals employed- by nonprofit organizations and institutions of higher learning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\"> See <em>Independent Baptist Church </em>v. <em>Tennessee, 468 F. </em>Supp. 71, 74 (E.D.
