The trust asserts that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>no authority under the Constitution of the Commonwealth to impose an income tax on rental income derived from Massachusetts real estate and that the tax classifications are unfairly discriminatory and deny equal protection of the laws. These assertions are without merit. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">1. We consider first the trust\u2019s claim that G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 2 <em>(a), </em>unconstitutionally seeks to impose an income tax on net rental income derived from Massachusetts real estate. There is no question that since the substantial rewriting of the tax law by St. 1971, c. 555, the Legislature had intended that rental income derived from real estate be subject to the State income tax. See <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>368 Mass. 242, 244-245, 247 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s authority to impose an income tax is set forth in art. 44 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth. <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 245. Article 44 \u201cgrants complete authority to tax the full range of incomes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246. See <em>Tax Comm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>227 Mass. 522, 525-526 (1917). The fact that, pri- or to the 1971 statutory revision, the sweep of the income tax laws was substantially narrower than permissible under aft. 44 does not aid the trust\u2019s argument. Since that revision, G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 2 <em>(a), </em>has defined Massachusetts gross income <em>as gross </em>income for Federal <em>income </em>tax purposes with certain modifications not material here. See <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>363 Mass. 589, 591 (1973). Article 44 presents no barrier to the achievement of that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">2. We find no merit to the trust\u2019s claim that it is unfairly discriminatory and a denial of equal protection of the laws under the State and Federal Constitutions to impose an income tax on net rental income from property which is also subject to a local property tax. The trust\u2019s argument in support of its claim of a constitutionally impermissible tax classification rests on the provision in G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Twenty-seventh, as amended by St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 3, which exempts from local taxation all property \u201cother than real estate,\u201d the income from which is or would be taxed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>G. L. c. 62 (the income tax statute). The claim is that \u00a7 5, Twenty-seventh, unconstitutionally discriminates between real estate and other property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Any distinction in a tax statute that has a rational basis will survive a challenge under the equal protection clause. <em>Weinstock </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>367 Mass. 66, 70, and cases cited, appeal dismissed for want of a substantial Federal question, 423 U.S. 805 (1975). The breadth of legislative discretion available to the Legislature is wide in tax classifications. See <em>Mary C. Wheeler School, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Seekonk, </em>368 Mass. 344, 346-347 (1975). There is a rational basis for the Legislature to subject real estate to local taxation (subject to exemptions for certain real estate), and not to subject certain other income-producing property to local taxation. It can be found in the expectancy that real estate as a class generally will be the beneficiary of local services in a far greater degree than other forms of income producing property.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-15\"> We shall refer to the taxpayer-appellant as the trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b157-16\"> The income was earned between January 1, 1971, and July 31, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\"> We pass by the point raised by the Commissioner of Revenue that a challenge to an exemption provided in a statute concerned with local property taxation cannot properly be raised by a challenge to the denial of an abatement of State income taxes. The income tax statute does not distinguish between the taxability of rental income and the taxability of income from other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">We see no indication that the trust argued before the board that the exemption from local taxation of income-producing property other than real estate violated the proportionality requirement of Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. The trust\u2019s brief before us cites Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, but does not present any argument worthy of attention in terms of that constitutional provision, nor does that brief consider, in presently relevant terms, the impact of art. 44 of the Amendments to the Constitution, which concerns the income tax. Article 44 states, in discretionary language, that a class of property whose income is taxed \u201cmay be exempted from the imposition and levying of proportional and reasonable assessments, rates and taxes as at present authorized by the constitution.\u201d We mention the possible argument of an unconstitutional lack of proportionality to make it clear that the issue was not before us in this case and not to suggest that the argument would be meritorious if it were before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
