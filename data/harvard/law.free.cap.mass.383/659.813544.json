L. c. 265, \u00a7 13, for the death of her two year old daughter, Jennifer, and of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A, upon her three year old son, Edward. The defendant was also convicted of assault and battery on Edward, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, and on two counts for failure to provide care for a minor, G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 1. She received a sentence of not more than twenty nor less than eighteen years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Framingham (MCI), on the manslaughter conviction, and a nine- to ten-year concurrent sentence on the conviction of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The convictions for assault and battery and failure to provide care for a minor resulted in concurrent sentences of two years in MCI, to be suspended for two years, but to go into effect from and after any sentence then being served or waiting to be served. She appeals from these convictions, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">The defendant claims her motion for directed verdicts as to the indictments charging manslaughter and assault by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>means of a dangerous weapon was improperly denied. She argues also that the judge\u2019s charge erroneously defined manslaughter, and that his instructions to the jury improperly permitted a nonunanimous verdict. Last, she claims that failure to allow a motion to sever the indictments pertaining to Edward from those pertaining to Jennifer denied her a fair trial. We conclude that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The Commonwealth presented evidence of the following facts. The son, Edward Gallison, Jr., was born in November, 1974. The daughter, Jennifer, was born in September, 1975. The Department of Public Welfare brought a petition for care and protection of Edward in October, 1975. Both children were eventually placed in foster homes. Jennifer was returned to the defendant\u2019s physical custody in July, 1977. Edward was returned to the defendant\u2019s physical custody in September, 1977. Edward was in good health and had no bruises or mouth damage at that time. On May 12, 1978, police officers and welfare department workers who entered the Gallison apartment found Edward alone in the apartment and bruised \u201cfrom head to toe.\u201d Photographs taken that day evinced numerous bruises about the boy\u2019s body, missing front teeth and upper lip, as well as two small scars, one on each buttock, apparently caused by a lighted cigarette.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Several Commonwealth witnesses recounted the defendant\u2019s abusive treatment of Edward. One Timothy Mullins, a fellow worker of the defendant\u2019s husband, described seeing Edward when he visited the Gallisons during January and February, 1978. On one occasion he found Edward standing still as punishment in the middle of the parlor. During a later visit Mullins again observed the boy similarly standing in the parlor, this time wearing a pair of his soiled underpants over his head. The defendant explained to Mullins that she was toilet training Edward. Mullins described a third instance of seeing the defendant give Edward a \u201clittle slap\u201d on the back of the head saying, \u201cGet in, you little bastard,\u201d as he entered Mullins\u2019s car. Mullins had observed the deformed condition of Edward\u2019s mouth during his visits but assumed it was due to a harelip.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The Gallisons\u2019 downstairs neighbor, Mary Brown, testified that, over the period from September, 1977, to May, 1978, she heard daily sounds of \u201chollering\u201d and \u201cspanking\u201d during the hours the defendant\u2019s husband was at work. The witness heard the defendant yelling around the noon hour, \u201cI will kill you if you don\u2019t eat.\u201d The neighbor also related that one day in early May, 1978, the defendant asked to have a cigarette and came into the neighbor\u2019s apartment for coffee. The two had coffee together each day of that week, and on one of those visits Edward accompanied his mother. The witness observed that his lip \u201c[h]ad like a piece missing\u201d and his face had scars and black eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Police and social workers removed Edward from the apartment on May 12, 1978. He was taken to Cambridge City Hospital. Dr. Porter, the physician who examined Edward after his admission to the hospital on May 12, 1978, described him as \u201c[a] small boy, fearful. He was covered with multiple bruises, black and blue marks over his body. Strikingly, was the finding that his upper lip was gone.\u201d The lip had been obliterated by repeated forceful blows. The doctor opined that Edward\u2019s teeth were missing as a result of blows to the mouth. Dr. Porter described Edward\u2019s buttocks as leathery, as if \u201cstruck a multiple number of times\u201d by an object other than a hand. He further testified that two small scars which he found on each of Edward\u2019s buttocks resulted from cigarette burns inflicted perhaps two weeks earlier. Although he was three and one-half years of age at the time, his size was at the fiftieth percentile of a child two and one half years of age. Noting that Edward had been born prematurely, the doctor characterized premature birth as a risk factor for abuse, but declined to state that abuse might focus on one child and not another.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">When the police and social workers entered the defendant\u2019s apartment on May 12, 1978, Jennifer could not be found. They were told by the defendant\u2019s husband that Jennifer was in Texas with his parents. After further investigation, the police returned to the defendant\u2019s apartment on May 14, 1978, and placed her under arrest for manslaughter and for concealing Jennifer\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>The Commonwealth\u2019s case as to the death of Jennifer consisted primarily of two statements which the defendant made to the Somerville police on the day of her arrest. The statements were not consistent, but she indicated Jennifer became ill in February, 1978. Jennifer was vomiting continuously and had diarrhea; her temperature on February 5 was 100 \u00b0F. She described the worsening of Jennifer\u2019s illness on February 6, 1978, the day of an historically severe blizzard. The defendant said she thought the child had pneumonia when her fever rose from 101 \u00b0F to 105 \u00b0F by late afternoon. Jennifer continued to suffer from diarrhea and vomiting and began to shake and shiver. The apartment was unheated because of lack of oil. The defendant brought Jennifer into the kitchen, which was the warmest room. The child collapsed, fell face down, and hit her head against a wooden kitchen chair.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant stated that the child did not cry, but was \u201clike she was in a deep sleep.\u201d The child wasn\u2019t breathing, but the defendant found a heartbeat and attempted resuscitation. She made no calls to neighbors, doctors, or police to seek assistance. She asked her husband to help her when he came back from the store, but their efforts were futile and the child \u201cjust went.\u201d The defendant\u2019s husband laid the baby in her cot overnight. They found Jennifer \u201cice-cold\u201d the next morning. The defendant and her husband then moved Jennifer\u2019s body to the back room, the coldest room in the apartment. The defendant stated that she opened the window and \u201cblocked that room off.\u201d Jennifer\u2019s body remained in the back room for six weeks<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> until the defendant\u2019s husband put it into a large trash bag and placed it into a trash container on a nearby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>street. The defendant and her husband agreed to say only that Jennifer was away with her grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Also in her statements to the police was the defendant\u2019s account that she administered liquid aspirin to Jennifer and fed her pieces of bread to relieve the vomiting and diarrhea. She claimed she used a neighbor\u2019s phone to call Somerville Hospital when Jennifer\u2019s illness became acute on February 6, but was refused an ambulance because of the storm. The downstairs neighbor Mary Brown, whose phone the defendant had used previously, denied that the defendant had sought use of her phone at all on the evening of February 6. Employees working the Somerville Hospital emergency switchboard during the late afternoon and evening of February 6, testified that no callers were denied ambulance service because of the storm that day. One of the owners of the ambulance service covering Somerville Hospital on February 6 testified that she logged no request for an ambulance to the defendant\u2019s address.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">There was no direct evidence of the condition of Jennifer\u2019s body or of the cause of death. The body was never recovered, probably having been incinerated in the regular course of rubbish disposal. The defendant stated that she had not taken Jennifer to a doctor because the clinic would not give shots without prior medical records. She denied ever beating or needing to discipline Jennifer. The only evidence of bruises on Jennifer came from the social worker, Carolyn Punch, who observed a circular bruise, a thumbprint, on Jennifer\u2019s left cheek during a home visit in September, 1977. The defendant explained to the social worker that she had inflicted the bruise inadvertently.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">There was testimony that the defendant\u2019s apartment was cluttered and dirty, with empty cans, beer cans, and dishes on the kitchen table. Witnesses attested to a distinct, unpleasant odor in the apartment. Dog urine and feces littered the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The defendant did not testify. Two witnesses called by the defense proffered testimony that Edward\u2019s mouth deformity resulted from dental surgery and that parental abuse might target on only one of several children.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>We turn now to the various claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">1. <em>The Motion for Directed Verdicts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">a. <em>Manslaughter. </em>The elements of manslaughter are set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 399 (1944). \u201cThe essence of wanton or reckless conduct is intentional conduct, by way either of commission or of omission where there is a duty to act, which conduct involves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another.\u201d The defendant argues that under this test the Commonwealth failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the essential elements of manslaughter to warrant submission of this case to the jury. She maintains that the evidence, derived primarily from her own statements, portrays a woman acting under difficult conditions to nurse her child through a serious illness. The defendant urges that her omission to obtain medical care can be viewed only as a good-faith mistake of judgment falling far short of the intentional, wanton or reckless \u201comission where there is a duty to act\u201d contemplated by <em>Welansky, supra </em>at 399. Also, she asserts a total lack of competent evidence of manslaughter to support the charge that she had physically beaten Jennifer. Finally, the defendant maintains that the Commonwealth failed to show that her conduct in fact caused Jennifer\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Exercising our obligation to review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), we conclude on this record that there was ample evidence to permit the jury to deliberate the manslaughter charge. As a parent to Jennifer, the defendant had a duty to provide for the care and welfare of her child. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>322 Mass. 523 (1948). See generally <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), </em>378 Mass. 732, 744 (1979), and cases cited therein. From her own account the jury might have believed that she made no effort to obtain medical help, knowing that her child was gravely ill. The jury were free to disbelieve her claimed attempts to call for an ambulance and to give credence to the contradiction of other witnesses. The evidence was suscep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>tibie of the finding that the mother\u2019s inaction in light of her child\u2019s vomiting, diarrhea, high fever, subsequent unconciousness, and breathing failure created a \u201csubstantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d of death. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Godin, </em>374 Mass. 120, 130 (1977). \u201cSuch evidence, if believed, would warrant the jury in concluding that the defendant should have been aware and indeed was aware of the increased risk of harm and thus [her] failure to remedy the situation was the kind of conduct which constitutes wanton and reckless conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">As to the Commonwealth\u2019s commission theory, there was evidence of one instance of a bruise inflicted by the defendant on Jennifer\u2019s cheek. Juxtaposing this with the evidence of repeated aggravated batteries suffered by Edward, which we determine, <em>infra, </em>was admissible as to Jennifer, the jury might infer that Jennifer was similarly treated. The defendant could be heard daily \u201chollering\u201d at and \u201cspanking\u201d one or both children. The secret concealment and disposal of Jennifer\u2019s body permit the inference that her body, if discovered, would have shown signs of physical abuse. These separate inferences, though hardly compelled, are more than merely speculative. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Best, </em>381 Mass. 472, 483 (1980). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em>379 Mass. 334, 343 (1979) (Commonwealth failed to present more than speculative inference of scienter).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Evidence of the mistreatment of Edward was probative also of the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of Jennifer\u2019s death. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Estremera, ante </em>382, 392-393 (1981); <em>Welansky, supra </em>at 398, 400 (wanton, reckless conduct is intentional conduct). Also, the defendant admitted to concealing the child\u2019s body, surreptitiously disposing of it, and concocting a fiction that Jennifer was with the defendant\u2019s mother or her husband\u2019s family. These indicia of consciousness of guilt, though not conclusive, were probative strands from which the jury might construct \u201c[a] web of convincing proof \u201d <em>Best, supra </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Even if we accept arguendo the defendant\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth failed to adduce evidence of man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>slaughter by the beating of Jennifer, the evidence of manslaughter by omission was sufficient to persuade the jury. If the evidence on either theory sufficed, a verdict could not have been directed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podlaski, </em>377 Mass. 339, 343-344 &amp; n.5 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The defendant further argues a total lack of evidence on the question of the cause of Jennifer\u2019s death. Medical evidence was precluded by the incineration of the child\u2019s body. However, there was evidence to support the inference that the defendant\u2019s failure to get medical help set in operation the factors which caused the death. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>379 Mass. 810, 817 (1980). The defendant\u2019s statements, corroborated through the testimony of Dr. Reece, depicted the rapid deterioration of Jennifer\u2019s resistance to an \u201cinfectious process,\u201d very likely pneumonia. The jury were free to conclude from their own common knowledge and experience that failure to obtain emergency treatment for a child with extreme fever and unconsciousness hastened the child\u2019s death. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giacomazza, </em>311 Mass. 456 (1942). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>2 Allen 136 (1861). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>7 Gray 585 (1856). See generally 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2570, at 542-547 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">b. <em>Assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. </em>The defendant concedes that there was substantial evidence that Edward was a battered child but challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to show that she in fact burned the child\u2019s buttocks with a lighted cigarette. Because there were two parents in the home, the defendant argues that it is equally probable that either parent inflicted the burns. This contention is refuted by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Although witnesses testified that both the defendant and her husband smoked cigarettes, there was no evidence before the jury that the father struck the children. The testimony of Timothy Mullins, Mary Brown the downstairs neighbor, and Carolyn Punch the social worker, was that the defendant disciplined the children, that the hollering and spanking occurred at times when the defendant was alone with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>children. There was evidence that the leathery condition of Edward\u2019s buttocks was caused by an object other than a hand. There was also evidence that the circular scars on the child\u2019s buttocks were caused by a lighted cigarette. Taken as a whole, the evidence permitted the inference that on at least one occasion the defendant applied a lighted cigarette to the boy\u2019s buttocks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Latimore, supra </em>at 678-679.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Even if the scars presented to the jury by means of photographs are assumed to have been inflicted by Edward\u2019s father; there was sufficient evidence to warrant the verdict on a joint venture theory. From evidence of her other acts of abuse upon Edward the jury might deduce a shared mental state. The two parents\u2019 complicity in concealing Jennifer\u2019s body adds substance to the possibility of their cooperative enterprise in inflicting the burns on Edward. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 173-174 (1980); <em>Best, supra </em>at 481-483. Moreover, the Commonwealth was not obliged to prove that no one other than the defendant committed the act. <em>Casale, supra </em>at 175. The judge charged the jury on the theory of joint enterprise. The Commonwealth met its burden to adduce probative evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of, or complicity in, the criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">2. <em>The Manslaughter Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The defendant complains that the judge\u2019s instructions as to manslaughter improperly reduced the standard of evidence required for conviction of involuntary manslaughter. The defendant cites in the first instance the language of the charge that wanton or reckless conduct might consist of \u201cdisregard of the probable harmful consequences <em>... or </em>the alleged victim\u2019s right to care\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">The defendant claims that the instructions permitted a conviction merely on finding mistake, negligence, or inad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>vertence. The claim is asserted for the first time on appeal. No objection was made at trial to the charge which raised this issue. It is a fundamental principle of appellate review that a prompt objection at trial is a prerequisite to the presentation of an issue for appellate review. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>364 Mass. 829 (1973). Contrast <em>Dejoinville </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 246 (1980) (constitutional issues, later decided, may be considered in the absence of objection). The defendant asks that we consider the issue, nevertheless, to avoid \u201ca substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967). We have reviewed the charge in light of this test. We find no such risk in that the charge was properly based on <em>Welansky, supra, </em>and correctly stated the law as to manslaughter. There is nothing in the charge which could have led the jury to make a finding of guilty based on mere mistake, negligence, or inadvertence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The defendant also claims error in the judge\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question, set out in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge explained that manslaughter might be found \u201cif the defendant intentionally or recklessly and wantonly failed to provide proper necessary care, and, as a result of that, the child died.\u201d The defendant made a timely objection to this response, but there is no merit in the defendant\u2019s suggestion that these words placed before the jury a third standard of conduct, lower than wanton, reckless disregard of probable harm. The phrase \u201cfailed to provide proper necessary care\u201d specified the acts of omission which the jury were to evaluate by the wanton, reckless standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The major thrust of the defendant\u2019s challenge to this language is that the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d between \u201cintentionally\u201d and \"recklessly and wantonly\u201d created a lower standard of culpability than the mens rea contemplated by <em>Welansky. </em>The logic of this proposition eludes us. To say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>that the defendant\u2019s behavior was intentional requires a very high showing of consciousness of harm and actual intent to bring about that harm. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>322 Mass. 523, 527-528 (1948) (intentional withholding of infant\u2019s food constituted murder in the second degree). If anything, the <em>Welansky </em>language sets a lesser standard than \u201cintentional\u201d conduct for conviction. Thus, any error in the use of the word \u201cintentional\u201d inured to the defendant\u2019s benefit because the jury were asked to reach their verdict on the basis of a standard even higher than that of <em>Welansky. </em>See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 224 (1973) (no reversible error where Commonwealth rather than defendant suffered prejudice). Reading the charge as a whole, we conclude that the judge correctly defined involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">3. <em>Jury Unanimity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The defendant makes the claim also for the first time on appeal that the judge\u2019s instructions on alternate theories of manslaughter permitted the jury to return a nonunanimous verdict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These instructions were consistent with the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>dence adduced. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>365 Mass. 235, 237 (1974). See our discussion, <em>supra, </em>of the directed verdict claims. The judge explicitly required unanimity on either or both theories of guilt. There was no error. Hence we cannot perceive any \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d on this point. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">4. <em>Severance of the Charges.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The defendant reasserts on appeal her claim, twice rejected on pretrial motions, that failure to sever the charges relating to Jennifer and Edward was so prejudicial as to deny her a fair trial. Severance is a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>373 Mass. 676, 690-691 (1977), and we review the exercise of that discretion by the guidelines expounded in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>362 Mass. 196, 200 (1972). Those criteria permit joinder of charges where the offenses constitute a single line of conduct, grow out of essentially one transaction, and would be proved by substantially the same evidence. <em>Id. </em>Conversely, under <em>Blow </em>severance is required where the above criteria are not satisfied and the defendant may be prejudiced by the cumulative evidence of the several offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 201. This court concluded in <em>Blow </em>that the dubious relevance of other acts committed during the same time frame was outweighed by the prejudicial effect on the jury. <em>Id. </em>We determine to the contrary here.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The defendant bears the burden to show that prejudice will result from failure to sever. <em>United States </em>v. <em>LaFond, </em>482 F. Supp. 1379, 1387-1388 (E.D. Wis. 1980). This burden includes a showing that any prejudice from joinder is beyond the curative powers of the court\u2019s instructions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Avarello, </em>592 F.2d 1339, 1346 n.10 (5th Cir.), cert, denied, 444 U.S. 844 (1979). Prejudice requiring severance does not arise from the mere fact that the defendant\u2019s chances for acquittal of the manslaughter charge might have been better had the manslaughter indictment been tried separately from the indictments charging assault and battery of Edward. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Knife, </em>592 F.2d 472, 480 (8th Cir. 1979). The defendant has not claimed that a particular defense tactic or right was foreclosed by the joinder. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>351 Mass. 37, 45 (1966) (but for admission of fact of prior arrests, defendant would not have testified). See generally <em>Drew </em>v. <em>United States, </em>331 F.2d 85, 88 (D.C. Cir. 1964). The nub of the defendant\u2019s claim is that trial of both indictments created a \u201cseepage ... of evidence not otherwise admissible\u201d against her. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass. 188, 221 (1971), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>407 U.S. 910, and <em>Beneficial Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>407 U.S. 914 (1972). The cogent consideration in this appeal thus reduces to the evidentiary question: Would the evidence as to Edward have been admissible in a separate trial for manslaughter of Jennifer?</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In Massachusetts, evidence of other criminal behavior may not be admitted to prove the propensity of the accused to commit the indicted offense but it is admissible for other relevant probative purposes. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chalifoux, </em>362 Mass. 811, 815-816 (1973). See generally W.B. Leach &amp; P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 302-303 (4th ed. 1967). The testimonial and photographic evidence of abuse of Edward in the same household as Jennifer, during the period from September through February, was sufficiently related in time and location to be logically probative. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 691. That Edward was physically abused and neglected during the time frame of Jennifer\u2019s death bears on the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of Jennifer\u2019s death. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schoening, </em>379 Mass. 234, 242 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>356 Mass. 245, 248 (1969). Evidence of the defendant\u2019s reckless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>and wanton state of mind as to the physical well-being of both children serves to refute the possibility that Jennifer\u2019s death came about through accident, mistake, or inadvertence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-232 (1980). The evidence concerning Edward formed a temporal and schematic nexus with the treatment of Jennifer which rendered it admissible also to show a common course of conduct regarding the two children. <em>Schoening, supra </em>at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The cases which the defendant cites to negate admissibility are distinguishable. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, supra </em>at 44-45, evidence of a sixteen year old murder accusation was irrelevant not only because of its prejudicial effect but because of its remoteness. The facts at issue here, by contrast, were carefully circumscribed to the six-month period when the children were returned to their natural mother until her arrest. The fact that the photographic evidence of Edward\u2019s bruises and injuries postdates Jennifer\u2019s death does not render it irrelevant for purposes of demonstrating the defendant\u2019s ongoing course of conduct. See <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 690-691. Other cases relied on by the defendant are also factually distinguishable. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valcourt, </em>333 Mass. 706, 717-718 (1956), evidence of failure to file tax returns two years before the act of arson being tried was inadmissible because it fell short of the very threshold of relevance; it was not logically probative. So also may the holding of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>321 Mass. 669, 670 (1947), be differentiated from our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s treatment of Edward is probative in the case about Jennifer. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Machado, </em>339 Mass. 713, 715 (1959) (evidence of similar acts in same home with same victim not remote). The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine noted in this context: \u201cMany crimes are committed in secret. In such case the State must forge a chain of circumstances, each essential link proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and the whole pointing inexorably to guilt as the only rational hypothesis. When, as here, the alternative is accidental causation, the circumstantial evidence must rule out accident as a rational or reasonable explanation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>death\u201d (citations omitted). <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>153 Maine 89, 93 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel proffered the testimony of a physician that abuse of one child need not mean abuse of its siblings. The over-all effect of the statements of defense counsel, in counterpoise to those of the prosecutor, was to delineate the separate applicability of the evidence. In his closing argument defense counsel cautioned the jury to keep separate the defendant\u2019s treatment of the two children, but he made no request for limiting instructions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>371 Mass. 40, 43 (1976) (curative instructions approved). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluker, </em>377 Mass. 123,131 (1979) (failure to request appropriate instructions precludes appellate review).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Without intimating that limiting instructions would have been required, we conclude that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-13\"> On appeal to the Appellate Division, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 28A-28C, these sentences were modified to not more than ten nor less than seven years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-14\"> The convictions-for unlawful disposal of a human body and failure to report death were filed, without objection, and hence are not before us. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 438 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b681-5\"> There was some discrepancy in the defendant\u2019s accounts of Jennifer\u2019s fall. In one version the child collapsed on the kitchen floor, not breathing. In still another interview, she related that Jennifer struck her head on a coffee table. The version recounted in the text was given during the defendant\u2019s last statement to the Somerville police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\"> The defendant also told the Somerville police that at one point a week or two after Jennifer\u2019s death the defendant\u2019s husband attempted to bury the body but was unsuccessful in digging a grave because the ground was too hard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\"> The defendant stated that her husband physically attacked her when he had been drinking. The jury might have chosen to regard this as a self-serving statement unrelated to her husband\u2019s treatment of the children. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132,134 (1977) (credibility and weight of the evidence for the jury).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\">\u201cDoes manslaughter necessarily have to result from assault and beating or can it result from wilful failure to provide proper and necessary care, or from wanton or reckless conduct, which results in death?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> The defendant challenges this language which occurs in the main body of the instructions: \u201cWhat the Commonwealth argues here, and urges that you find, is either one of two things: Either this defendant so abused, intentionally abused, knew what she was doing, the daughter, that, as a result of that abuse, the daughter died, although the defendant specifically did not intend to kill her daughter. That is one theory that the Commonwealth is going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">\u201cThe other theory that the Commonwealth is going on is that the defendant, again, did not intend to kill her daughter, but she acted so wantonly or recklessly in neglecting her daughter that she should be tagged with manslaughter. And that is the Commonwealth\u2019s second theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">\u201cAnd you can accept either theory or both theories, or you can reject each theory. If you accept either theory, or both theories, you have to do so beyond a reasonable doubt. The Commonwealth has to prove its case with respect to either or both of those theories beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">Later, in response to a question by the jury, the judge stated: \u201cThere are two ways you can go here with respect to that manslaughter indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">\u201cThe first way is, if the facts justify it, if you believe and <em>agree unanimously </em>that the Commonwealth <em>has proved beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that this defendant, by means of assault and battery, although not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>necessarily with the intent to kill, caused injuries that resulted in the death of Jennifer Lisa Gallison, you can find manslaughter from that.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">\u201c Alternatively, you can, <em>if you so find </em>the facts as proved to you <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>by the Commonwealth, <em>if the defendant intentionally or recklessly and wantonly failed to provide proper necessary care, </em>and, as a result of that, the child died, you can find manslaughter from that, also. Or you can find both. <em>Manslaughter can result from both, or from either one\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">No objection was raised by the defendant at either time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\"> The pretrial motion judge apparently believed curative instructions would be appropriate and recommended this option to the defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
