They claimed that the defendant landlord had violated statutory and common law duties to provide adequate means of egress from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the building and to install fire fighting apparatus on each floor of the building. G. L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 24.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a trial without a jury in September, 1978, a judge of the Superior Court found that the landlord was negligent both in removing a fire escape and in failing to provide fire extinguishers, and entered a judgment for the plaintiffs. The Appeals Court reversed, holding that there was no breach of duty with respect to means of egress, and that it was not shown that the absence of fire extinguishers was a contributing cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 882 (1980). We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for further appellate review, and we affirm the judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The parties agreed to the following facts. At the time of the fire, on June 2, 1966, the defendant owned the building and was in control of the common areas. The plaintiffs were tenants of the building, which was used as an apartment house and had more than eight rooms above the second story. There was no fire extinguishing apparatus anywhere in the building; the fire was not in any way the fault of the landlord; there were no fire escapes; and the plaintiffs were injured when they jumped from the second story during the course of the fire. The amount of damages was also agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The judge made the following additional findings on the basis of the testimony. At the inception of the plaintiffs\u2019 tenancy an outside fire escape led from the window of their apartment to the ground, but it was removed by the landlord about five months before the fire. The building had both front and rear exits, and the landlord had never been notified by an inspector that additional exits or means of escape from fire were necessary. On the night of the fire, the plaintiff Sallie Williams was awakened by screams, ran down the front stairs to find the front exit engulfed in flames, and retreated to the second floor, reasonably believing that the rear exit was also blocked by fire. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>plaintiffs feared to jump to the ground, and could hear the sirens of approaching fire engines coming to the rescue, but the absence of any fire fighting apparatus prevented them from beating back the flames and gaining some breathing space until the fire apparatus arrived. They jumped, leaving behind Sallie\u2019s crippled sister, who was ultimately rescued unharmed by the fire fighters.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">It seems clear enough that the landlord violated G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 24, which required that each story of a building subject to G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 21,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cshall be supplied with means of extinguishing fire . . . and such appliances shall be kept at all times ready for use and in good condition.\u201d The violation was evidence of negligence. <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>291 Mass. 100, 102 (1935). See <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Massios, </em>372 Mass. 79, 83 (1977). The defendant argues, however, as the Appeals Court held, that there was no evidence that the absence of fire extinguishers was a contributing cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, relying on <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>as in the present case, the plaintiff was injured by reason of jumping from a second-story window to escape injury by fire. The trial judge said that he was \u201cunable to find affirmatively\u201d that the defendant landords\u2019 violation of G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 24, was causally related to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, \u201csince there was no evidence that the plaintiff or any of the other tenants tried to use a fire extinguisher or even to find one to use as a means of protection when the fire broke out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101. We affirmed the decision: \u201cThe trial judge was not required to find that the violation of the statute by the defendants had a causal connection with the harm to the plaintiff. Whether it did or not was a question of fact. The circumstances of the fire already narrated warranted the finding of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>In the present case, there was evidence that the plaintiffs, trapped in the building, \u201cstarted trying to find something to put the fire out.\u201d The judge found that they were well aware that there were no fire extinguishers on the second floor, and that they \u201chad no occasion to scout around, seeking out fire fighting apparatus that they knew was not present.\u201d He also found that fire extinguishers \u201ccould well have provided the extra margin of safety necessary to make remaining in the second story bedroom a viable alternative until rescue by the fire department occurred.\u201d Whether the statutory violation was a contributing cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries was a question of fact and the judge\u2019s finding that it was must stand unless \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). We conclude that it was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In view of that conclusion, we need not consider the judge\u2019s alternative conclusion that the defendant was subject to liability by reason of her removal of the fire escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-7\"> Repealed by St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\"> Section 21 applied to an \u201capartment house . . . which has eight or more rooms above the second story, or in which ten or more persons . . . reside above the second story.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
