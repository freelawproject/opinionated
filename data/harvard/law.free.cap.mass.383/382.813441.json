The killing occurred while Allende was handcuffed and sitting in the back seat of a police cruiser driven by Estremera. The key issue at trial was Estremera\u2019s criminal responsibility. A jury found Estremera guilty of murder in the second degree. He appeals pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, claiming error in the empanelment process, in the trial judge\u2019s instructions on malice, and in the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on manslaughter. Finding no reversible error and no occasion to exercise our powers under \u00a7 33E, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The defendant Estremera and Angel Rosario, police officers employed by the Worcester Housing Authority (authority) , were on cruiser patrol at Great Brook Valley Housing Project (project) on the evening of June 20, 1979. Estremera was the driver. About 12:30 a.m., the officers noticed a car drive out of the project with a stove in the trunk. Believing the stove might be the property of the authority, they followed and stopped the car. Two men were in the car. Estremera asked the driver, Allende, for his license and registration, which were produced promptly. Estremera recognized Allende\u2019s face; he had stopped Allende in the past for motor vehicle violations and had been given a \u201crough time.\u201d When asked by Rosario where he had obtained the stove, Allende replied that his sister had given it to him. Estremera called for a backup, and another authority police officer, Terrance J. Ferraro, arrived in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>another cruiser. Ferraro\u2019s arrival somehow aggravated Allende, who began swearing viciously and accused the officers of harassing him. Allende punched Ferraro. Ferraro grabbed Allende, arrested him for assault and battery, and handcuffed his hands behind his back. Estremera patted down Allende for weapons and found an \u201cAfro pic\u201d (a comb) and a small knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Allende continued to hurl obscenities at the officers while he was being escorted to Estremera\u2019s cruiser by Ferraro and Estremera. He claimed that there would be a riot in the project and that he would burn the project down. He also threatened to kill the officers. Most of the taunts and threats were in Spanish;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Estremera and Rosario are Puerto Rican, as was Allende.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Allende was put in the back of the cruiser for transport to the police station. Rosario drove Allende\u2019s car toward the station, with the unidentified passenger still inside; Estremera followed in his cruiser with Allende; and Ferraro brought up the rear. Ferraro testified that Estremera seemed normal at the time the three cars began making their way toward the police station. After driving about 100 feet, Rosario heard a sound \u201clike a gunshot\u201d; looking at the side-view mirror, he saw Estremera getting out of his cruiser. Ferraro testified that while driving behind Estremera, he saw Estremera swing the cruiser from the right-hand lane into the left-hand lane, jam on the brakes and get out. Ferraro pulled up behind him. Estremera opened the back door and pulled Allende\u2019s body out onto the ground. On seeing Allende\u2019s face covered with blood, Ferraro called for an ambulance. Officer Rosario heard Ferraro\u2019s voice over the radio and, after delivering Allende\u2019s car to the station, returned in his own car. Rosario testified that Estremera was crying hysterically; attempts to calm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>him were unavailing. Estremera said he did not know what had happened and told Rosario to \u201csave the guy.\u201d According to Ferraro, Estremera cried, \u201cGod, don\u2019t let him die. I shot him.\u201d Ferraro said Estremera was confused, hysterical, \u201c[o]ut of the ball park.\u201d Estremera ripped off his shirt and equipment and threw them into the street. An ambulance arrived and took the unconscious victim to the hospital, where he died minutes later. His brain had been perforated by a gunshot wound through the left eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Estremera\u2019s was the only testimony of the events immediately leading to Allende\u2019s death. He testified that Allende\u2019s vituperation continued unabated after the two of them were alone in the cruiser. Allende again predicted a riot in the project and threatened to kill Estremera and the other officers. Estremera became \u201cmad\u201d and told Allende to shut up. Estremera then heard a pop. He looked to the right where the sound had come from and, as he continued to drive, realized that he had his revolver in his right hand. He then slammed on the brakes, stopped the cruiser, stepped from it, and looked around to determine where the noise had come from. As he was getting back into the cruiser, he noticed that Allende was quiet. He opened the rear door and spoke to Allende. Allende lifted his head, and Estremera saw blood oozing from his left eye. He removed Allende from the cruiser and placed him on the pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The defense <em>claim </em>at trial was lack of criminal responsibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3 According to psychiatric testimony, Estremera suffered from a mental disease identified as a \u201ccathathymic crisis within the context of a hysterical dissociation,\u201d as a result of which he was \u201cgrossly temporarily unaware\u201d of what was going on at the time of the shooting. The defendant also introduced evidence of a radical personality change caused by a series of psychologically traumatic experiences, including a miscarriage suffered by his wife; mysterious, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>silent telephone calls; the stealing and burning of his car near the project; and previous riots at the project, during one of which a superior officer was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">1. <em>Propriety of the Empanelment Process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The defendant attacks the judge\u2019s actions in striking certain questions to prospective jurors after the first day of empanelment and in otherwise altering the empanelment process in order to save time. Consideration of the defendant\u2019s challenges requires us to set out in some detail the particular method followed for the selection of the jury in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">On the day before the trial was to begin, the defendant filed a motion for leave to question prospective jurors, reciting twenty-five questions he wished to have put to each juror. The first two questions concerned the juror\u2019s relationship to the defendant and prospective witnesses. Questions 3 through 11 involved pretrial publicity and its impact, if any, upon the juror. The twelfth question involved the juror\u2019s ability to consider only evidence adduced at trial. The next seven questions were aimed at discovering any prejudice against either Puerto Ricans or police officers. Questions 20 through 25 focused on the juror\u2019s attitudes toward psychiatrists and the defense of lack of criminal responsibility. The judge allowed the motion except with respect to the twelfth question<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and agreed to pose the questions to each juror individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">On the first day of empanelment, seven prospective jurors were questioned individually and out of the presence of the others,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in accordance with the defendant\u2019s request. Of the seven, two were deemed acceptable and were sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">On the second day, concerned that the previous day\u2019s proceedings had resulted in the selection of only two jurors, the judge decided to alter the empanelment process in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>to save time. He announced his intention to pose questions relating to pretrial publicity to the entire venire collectively. Furthermore, none of the questions dealing with attitudes toward psychiatrists and the defense of lack of criminal responsibility were to be posed any longer. The defendant objected to these alterations.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">a. <em>Questions on criminal responsibility. </em>The defendant claims that the striking of questions revolving around the defense of lack of criminal responsibility<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> constituted both a denial of due process and an abuse of discretion. He cites two cases from other jurisdictions for the proposition that it is prejudicial error to refuse to permit voir dire examination of prospective jurors on subjects relating to the defense of insanity, when the defendant has given notice of such defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The cases cited are not constitutionally based and contain little or no reasoning in support of their conclusions. We have recently reaffirmed that \u201c[qjuestions not aimed at \u2018revealing racial bias or any similarly indurated and pervasive prejudice\u2019 are not constitutionally required\u201d on voir dire. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>379 Mass. 810, 821 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>(1980), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, 370 </em>Mass. 388, 399 (1976). We cannot say that whatever prejudice might exist against psychiatrists is sufficiently \u201cindurated and pervasive\u201d as to result in a denial of constitutional rights if not explored before trial. Nor do we consider the refusal to ask questions such as those at issue here a violation of the statute governing jury selection, G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, or an abuse of the discretion afforded the judge in the jury selection process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 794 (1977). In fact, we have earlier considered it \u201ca doubtful proposition that [such] questions . . . need be asked in every case involving testimony by psychiatrists and the defense of insanity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Killelea, 370 </em>Mass. 638, 649-650 (1976) (finding no abuse of discretion in denying a defendant\u2019s motion to propound questions similar to those requested by the defendant here). The present record, as was true in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>381 Mass. 340, 353 &amp; n.12 (1980), \u201ccontains nothing to make that [doubtful] proposition seem more plausible.\u201d At oral argument the defendant maintained that popular attitudes toward psychiatrists are largely negative and suggested that terms such as \u201cheadshrinker\u201d indicate a common belief that psychiatrists are not credible. But we are not prepared to assume today, any more than we have been in the past, that there is such widespread prejudice against psychiatrists and the concept of criminal irresponsibility as to mandate pretrial inquiry on those subjects. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ricard, </em>355 Mass. 509, 511-512 (1969). Absent some reason to suspect that jurors may be so prejudiced, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680, 696 (1979), a judge is warranted in relying upon his final charge to the jury to purge any bias from the jurors prior to their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The fact that the questions were initially allowed by the judge and asked on the first day of empanelment, but not thereafter, does not change matters. The defendant contends he was prejudiced because he relied on the allowance of the questions; when he was told unexpectedly on the second day of empanelment that the questions would no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>be asked, little or no opportunity remained for investigating prospective jurors. The defendant does not say what he would have done differently had the judge not allowed the questions in the first place. Certainly, any investigations of jurors\u2019 attitudes toward psychiatrists and the defense of lack of criminal responsibility would have been constrained by our prohibition against direct contact with prospective jurors and members of their families. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>379 Mass. 564, 576, 578 (1980). In these circumstances, absent any showing of prejudice, the subsequent striking of the questions at issue cannot be deemed to have impaired the defense. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, the mere fact that the judge modified the empanelment process in order to speed up the proceedings does not make the modification an abuse of discretion requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">b. <em>Questions on pretrial publicity. </em>The defendant claims error in the manner in which the judge questioned prospective jurors about their exposure to pretrial publicity. He alleges that collective questioning on this subject violated G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. The defendant\u2019s concern about possible prejudicial publicity had prompted his request that the judge pose a series of questions to jurors about what they had heard and whether they had formed an opinion about the case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After the first day of empanelment, again for rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>sons of judicial economy, the judge indicated that he was changing the procedure for posing questions relating to pretrial publicity. Addressing the entire venire, the judge began by delivering a short statement of the case, saying the defendant was accused of a homicide arising out of an incident in the Great Brook Valley Housing Project on June 21, 1979. He then asked whether anyone had formed an opinion about the facts of the case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> One juror responded affirmatively, and the judge excused her after asking her further questions out of the hearing of the other jurors. The judge next asked whether any juror was conscious of any bias or prejudice with respect to the case. No one responded. Turning to the subject of pretrial publicity, the judge said: \u201cThis case, as I understand it, was the subject of a lot of newspaper and media publicity. How many of you ladies and gentlemen have read something about this case?\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A number of hands went up. When the judge asked whether any one had formed an opinion from or been affected by what he or she had read,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> no one responded. A list of the names of prospective witnesses and of counsel was then read to the venire, who were asked whether they were related to or acquainted with any of the persons named. The jurors who responded affirmatively had further questions put to them individually. The collective inquiry of the venire was then over. The jurors retired to the jury room, and from then on were brought in only for individual examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">During each individual examination,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the judge asked further questions concerning the juror\u2019s exposure to publicity about the facts of the case: what the juror had read or heard, whether it caused him or her to form an opinion as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>what actually happened on the day in question; and whether the juror could confine his or her deliberations to the evidence presented at trial and disregard whatever had been heard earlier. These questions approximated most of the defendant\u2019s requested questions on pretrial publicity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Our reading of the record belies the defendant\u2019s assertion, on which his claim of error is based, that the jurors were not questioned individually about pretrial publicity. Although it is true that questions about publicity were posed initially to the entire venire, we need not decide whether, in the circumstances of this case, such collective inquiry alone would have fulfilled the requirements of G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, or whether a sufficient foundation had been laid to require individual questioning.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Our independent examination of the entire empanelment procedure reveals that each seated juror was subjected to individual inquiry concerning possible exposure to prejudicial pretrial publicity about the facts of this case. The defendant was entitled to no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">2. <em>Failure to Instruct on Manslaughter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The defendant alleges that the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury on voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Such instructions were not warranted in this case, as no view of the evidence would permit a finding of manslaughter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 745-746 (1975), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">a. <em>Voluntary manslaughter. </em>The defendant contends that the evidence presented allowed the jury to find he had acted in the heat of passion upon adequate provocation, and that therefore it was error to refuse his requested instruction on voluntary manslaughter. He argues that words such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>those spoken by the victim here \u201cmay convey information sufficient to provoke a person to the extent that he could not be expected to control himself,\u201d citing as support for this proposition <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>370 Mass. 438 (1976). This argument fails to recognize the limited scope of our decision in <em>Bermudez. </em>We there reaffirmed prior holdings to the effect that verbal insults and arguments, even if obscene or hostile, cannot constitute sufficient provocation, for a reasonable person \u201ccan be expected to control the feelings aroused\u201d thereby. <em>Id. </em>at 440-441. Acknowledging nonetheless that \u201ccertain incidents may be as provocative when disclosed by words as when witnessed personally,\u201d we left \u201copen the possibility that, in an appropriate case, testing the defendant\u2019s response on an objective standard, sufficient provocation may be found in information conveyed to a defendant by words alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441-442. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schnopps, ante </em>178 (1981) (sudden verbal disclosure of present adultery may be equivalent to the defendant spouse\u2019s discovery of the act itself and thus may constitute sufficient provocation).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The obscenities, insults, and taunts directed by the victim to the defendant Estremera are not the sort of \u201cinformation\u201d contemplated by <em>Bermudez. </em>Nor can the victim\u2019s threats to kill the defendant at some undetermined point in the future be said to convey information constituting an \u201cimmediate and intense offense\u201d to the defendant\u2019s sensitivities, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bermudez, supra </em>at 442, such as \u201cwould have been likely to produce in an ordinary person such a state of passion, anger, fear, fright, or nervous excitement as would eclipse his capacity for reflection or restraint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 728 (1980). As the evidence was insufficient to establish the kind of provocation considered in <em>Bermudez, </em>the judge rightly refused to give instructions on voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">b. <em>Involuntary manslaughter. </em>An instruction on involuntary manslaughter should have been given, argues the defendant, because \u201c[i]t is possible that the defendant waved his gun and it discharged accidentally.\u201d For the re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>suiting death to be deemed involuntary manslaughter, the waving of the gun would have to be characterized as an act constituting such a disregard of the probable harmful consequences to another as to amount to wanton or reckless conduct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 389-390 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>352 Mass. 387, 397 (1967). The wanton or reckless conduct that leads to manslaughter must be intentional conduct, however, <em>id. </em>at 398, and no evidence of the defendant\u2019s having waved the gun intentionally was presented at trial. Indeed, the claimed defense was that the defendant did <em>nothing </em>intentionally; there was never any suggestion that his conduct evinced a wanton and reckless disregard for the victim\u2019s safety. Because the contention that involuntary manslaughter was a possible verdict rests on a hypothesis not supported by the evidence, there was no error in failing to charge otherwise. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 726 (1980), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">3. <em>Adequacy of the Instructions on Malice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The defendant challenges as deficient the judge\u2019s instructions on malice. No objection was made to the charge at the time it was given. We nonetheless review the issue pursuant to our special powers under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as it existed prior to amendment by St. 1979, c. 346, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (authorizing our ordering of a new trial or an entry of a lesser verdict \u201cfor any . . . reason that justice may require\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The defendant first contends that the judge in his charge described the permissible inference of malice in terms that could lead the jury to regard the inference as either a conclusive or a mandatory presumption, in violation of the principles enunciated in <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684 (1975) , and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684 (1976) . We have reversed murder convictions where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>judge charged either that a presumption of malice arises from the intentional use of a deadly weapon or that a person must be presumed to intend the consequences of his conduct. See <em>DeJoinville </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 246, 253-254 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>380 Mass. 821 (1980). More often, however, we have concluded that language of presumption was used interchangeably with language of permissible inference, and that any erroneous equation of presumption and inference was mitigated by the charge\u2019s over-all emphasis on the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chasson, ante </em>183, 192-193 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>382 Mass. 119, 132-134 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>380 Mass. 840, 845-846 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>380 Mass. 565, 577-578 (1980); <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>377 Mass. 539, 541-542 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McInerney, </em>373 Mass. 136, 150-151 (1977). Here, the judge never even used words of presumption; he spoke of \u201cthe malice that the law implies,\u201d and told the jury they were entitled to draw logical and proper inferences from the evidence presented. He also charged at length that the Commonwealth retained the burden of proving every essential element of the crime charged. There was no danger that a reasonable juror might have interpreted the instructions as creating a constitutionally impermissible presumption or as requiring the defendant to disprove malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The defendant further argues that the judge\u2019s failure to define malice adequately left the jury to speculate about what facts might constitute this essential element of the crime of murder. Although we agree that, standing alone, the instruction of malice was insufficient, we conclude that, viewing the charge as a whole, the jury were adequately instructed on the mental state necessary to support a conviction of murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The malice aforethought necessary for second degree murder requires a finding that the defendant intended to inflict injury on the victim without legal excuse or palliation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuirk, </em>376 Mass. 338, 344-345 (1978), cert, denied, 439 U.S. 1120 (1979), and cases cited. Although the defendant need not have intended to kill the victim, at the very least he must have intended \u201cto do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that death or grievous harm will follow.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huot, </em>380 Mass. 403, 408 (1980). Nowhere in his instructions on second degree murder did the judge expressly define malice as requiring proof of any intent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Given this deficiency, we must examine other parts of the charge referring to the defendant\u2019s mental state, \u201csince the adequacy of instructions must be determined in light of their over-all impact on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-232 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The heart of the defense in the case at bar was the defendant\u2019s lack of criminal responsibility. The judge\u2019s thorough charge on criminal responsibility focused the jury\u2019s attention on the crucial issue of the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the shooting and his ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and to conform his conduct to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the requirements of the law. The instructions enlightened the jury on the relationship between the defendant\u2019s mental state and the physical act of pulling the trigger. In the circumstances of this case, the instructions on criminal responsibility were equivalent to a proper instruction on malice.

Although the requisite intent for second degree murder may be inferred from the <em>intentional </em>use of a deadly weapon, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>375 Mass. 308,313 (1978), and cases cited, the unintentional or accidental use of a weapon cannot constitute malice. <em>Lannon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 786, 790 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCauley, </em>355 Mass. 554, 561 (1969).
