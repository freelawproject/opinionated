Merritt contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion <em>in limine </em>to prohibit the Commonwealth from introducing at his sentencing hearing evidence of his prior probation violations. Because probation violations are a part of the sentencing process and, thus, are part of the record of criminal convictions, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">A jury found Merritt guilty of grand larceny by receiving stolen property, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-108. Merritt moved the trial court to prohibit the Commonwealth from introducing evidence of his probation violations resulting from previous convictions. The trial court denied the motion, and the Commonwealth presented evidence that Merritt had violated the conditions of probation on four prior occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>In cases of trial by jury, upon a finding that the defendant is guilty of a felony, a separate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment shall be held as soon as practicable before the same jury. At such proceeding, the Commonwealth shall present the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the record of conviction, including adult convictions and juvenile convictions and adjudications of delinquency. Prior convictions shall include convictions and adjudications of delinquency under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, the United States or its territories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Merritt contends that probation violations are not \u201ccriminal convictions\u201d and, therefore, evidence of such is inadmissible at the sentencing phase of trial. By statute, evidence of the defendant\u2019s record of prior criminal convictions is admissible at sentencing. Evidence of the sentences imposed on those convictions is also admissible. <em>See Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 523-24, 465 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1996). \u201cThe sentence reflects the gravity of the offense and the defendant\u2019s propensity for violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Revocation of probation is merely a modification of the sentence. <em>See Ralston v. Robinson, </em>454 U.S. 201, 220 n. 14, 102 S.Ct. 233, 245 n. 14, 70 L.Ed.2d 345 (1981). A probation violation, therefore, is an aspect of the sentencing process imposed upon a criminal conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">This rationale serves the declared purposes of punishment for criminal conduct. \u201c[T]he sentencing decision ... is a quest for a sentence that best effectuates the criminal justice system\u2019s goals of deterrence (general and specific), incapacitation, retribution and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>United States v. Morris, </em>837 F.Supp. 726, 729 (E.D.Va.1993); <em>see also Wilborn v. Saunders, </em>170 Va. 153, 160, 195 S.E. 723, 726 (1938); <em>Nuckoles v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1083, 1086, 407 S.E.2d 355, 356 (1991). Manifestly, the prior criminal convictions of a felon, including previous efforts to punish and rehabilitate, \u201c \u2018bear upon a tendency to commit offenses, the probabilities of rehabilitation, and similar factors\u2019 \u201d indispensable to the determination of an appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>sentence. <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 656, 659, 446 S.E.2d 469, 472 (1994) (quoting <em>Eaton v. United States, </em>458 F.2d 704, 708 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 880, 93 S.Ct. 208, 34 L.Ed.2d 135 (1972)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><em>Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at 524, 465 S.E.2d at 594-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">A probation violation is not itself a criminal conviction. It is, however, a continuation and part of the sentencing process imposed for a criminal conviction and is, thus, admissible as part of the sentence imposed for the prior conviction. Thus, the trial court correctly denied Merritt\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
