He was sentenced to life imprisonment and fined $100,000. On appeal, Cressell argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a change of venue and by failing to strike three jurors for cause. He also argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">On July 24, 1997, Cressell, Louis Ceparano, Hazel Anderson, Christy Harden, and G.P. Johnson spent the evening and early morning hours of July 25, celebrating Harden\u2019s twenty-first birthday. At some point in the evening, the birthday celebration moved to Ceparano\u2019s trailer. Everyone was drinking heavily except Anderson. Before the evening ended, Johnson, who was of African-American descent, became the victim of a gruesome murder. Johnson, who was intoxicated, was doused with gasoline, set afire, burned alive, and decapitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">Hazel Anderson testified that at least twice during the evening Cressell grabbed Johnson by the shirt collar, called him a \u201cnigger,\u201d and accused Johnson of trying to start a fight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>between Cressell and Ceparano. Later that evening, Cressell and Ceparano were \u201chorseplaying\u201d with Johnson on a mattress on the floor. Both Cressell and Ceparano stated several times that they were going to take Johnson outside and \u201cburn him on a white cross.\u201d Anderson testified that Cressell took off Johnson\u2019s watch and, in response to Johnson\u2019s request to return the watch, Cressell stated that \u201cwhere you\u2019re going, they had their own time.\u201d Cressell then grabbed Johnson\u2019s shoulders while Ceparano grabbed Johnson\u2019s legs, and together, the two carried Johnson outside. Johnson, apparently not comprehending the situation, told Cressell and Ceparano to be careful not to hurt his ankle, which he had injured in a car accident a few weeks earlier. Johnson stated, as he was being carried out of the trailer, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just shoot me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Harden, who remained in the trailer with Anderson, testified that she looked out the window and noticed a large fire. Harden stepped onto the front porch and realized that Johnson was being burned alive. She testified that Ceparano was standing near Johnson and Cressell was walking back in the direction of the trailer. Cressell and Ceparano returned to the trailer without Johnson. Both Anderson and Harden stated that .they smelled gasoline fumes, and Anderson testified that she smelled the fumes emanating from Cressell when he returned to the trailer. Ceparano went back outside, and when Anderson began to follow Ceparano, Cressell stated sarcastically, \u201cit\u2019d be best if you don\u2019t go outside.\u201d Later, Ceparano cornered Anderson in the kitchen and told her in a threatening manner that he had walked Johnson home. He threatened to kill her if she told anyone anything different. Ceparano again went outside, and when he returned, he had blood on the front of his pants. Ceparano changed clothes and washed his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Harden testified that Cressell told her that Ceparano poured gasoline on Johnson and set him on fire. She testified that she and Cressell left the trailer, flagged down a passing car, and proceeded to the Sheriffs office where Cressell informed the deputies that Ceparano had murdered Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>In Cressell\u2019s initial statements to the authorities, he denied any involvement in Johnson\u2019s murder. He later admitted, however, that he helped Ceparano carry Johnson outside and across the driveway. Cressell consistently denied pouring gasoline on Johnson or setting him on fire. Rather, Cressell stated that he saw Ceparano pour gasoline on Johnson and set him on fire. Ceparano denied murdering Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Johnson\u2019s burned, decapitated body was found near Ceparano\u2019s trailer. When investigators arrived at the scene, they discovered Johnson\u2019s body lying in a prone position still on fire. The investigator observed two burn sites on Ceparano\u2019s property. At the second burn site, the investigator found \u201cwhat appeared to be a piece of a skull,\u201d a gas can, beer cans, a blood stain, and debris piled on top of Johnson\u2019s body. There appeared to be a trail of blood from the first burn site to the second. At the first burn site, investigators found a belt buckle and loose change. Johnson\u2019s wallet was lying on the ground a few feet from the back door of Ceparano\u2019s trailer, and Johnson\u2019s checkbook and watch were on the loveseat in the trailer. Johnson\u2019s body had been decapitated and his head was buried beneath his body in a hole more than a foot deep. Near the trailer, the investigator found a shovel and a splitting maul. Ceparano had blood on his hands and on his clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">An autopsy of Johnson\u2019s body revealed that the cause of death was \u201cinhalation of flame with edema of the lungs and burning of the respiratory passages.\u201d The evidence indicated that the fire had been started using an accelerant. Johnson was decapitated postmortem. Johnson\u2019s skull suffered a number of blunt trauma and chop injuries. His skull was fractured, and his brain was out of the cranial cavity due to the nature of the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">\n<em>II. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">\n<em>A. Motion for a Change of Venue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ac9\">Prior to trial, Cressell moved for a change of venue, arguing that widespread media attention created \u201ccommunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>prejudice\u201d against him. He argued that the news reports were inflammatory, hostile, and prejudicial. Cressell stated that a newspaper photograph of him in a prison uniform, wearing handcuffs and leg irons, created an aura and impression in the minds of prospective jurors in the community that he was guilty. The media also impermissibly reported his criminal record and prejudicial evidence concerning particulars of the crime that would be inadmissible at trial. Although Cressell conceded at oral argument that the media reports were factually accurate, he argued that the coverage was inflammatory, pointed, and selective, because the photographs in the newspaper articles of the victim showed him as a \u201cyoung, good-looking black man in a dress marine corps uniform with a background of the American flag,\u201d while the newspaper articles pictured him, the defendant, in \u201cslovenly jail garb, a mug shot.\u201d In addition, Cressell argues that the media portrayed the murder as a \u201chate crime\u201d and Grayson County as a \u201chot bed of racism.\u201d He asserts that by doing so, the media put the citizens of Grayson County \u201con trial\u201d to defend their reputation as jurors and that is the \u201creason that [he] was convicted of anything at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">At counsel\u2019s request, the court took the motion for change of venue under advisement pending a determination of whether a qualified and unbiased jury panel could be seated. After <em>voir dire </em>of eighty-one potential jurors, a panel of twenty-four jurors was seated. Of the eighty-one prospective jurors, the court excused twenty because each expressed the view that he or she had formed an opinion about the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence from news accounts that he or she would be unable to set aside. The court excused nine prospective jurors because each was opposed to the death penalty. Twenty-eight others were excused for \u201cvarious sundry reasons.\u201d The court denied the motion for a change of venue, noting that, although the case had received widespread publicity, a qualified jury had been selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">\u201c \u2018It is presumed that a defendant can receive a fair trial in the locality where the offense occurred, and the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>is on the accused to overcome that presumption by clearly demonstrating widespread prejudice against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 315, 336, 504 S.E.2d 399, 409 (1998) (quoting <em>LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 577, 304 S.E.2d 644, 651 (1983)). \u201c \u2018A change of venue based on pre-trial publicity is required when the defendant demonstrates that there is \u201cwidespread\u201d prejudice against him and that such prejudice would, with reasonable certainty, prevent a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown, </em>28 Va.App. at 336, 504 S.E.2d at 409 (quoting <em>Chandler v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 275, 455 S.E.2d 219, 222 (1995)). The trial court\u2019s decision whether to grant a motion for change of venue is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kasi v. Commonwealth, </em>256 Va. 407, 420, 508 S.E.2d 57, 64 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 119 S.Ct. 2399, 144 L.Ed.2d 798 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">\u201c \u2018[EJxtensive knowledge in the community of either the crimes or the putative criminal is not sufficient by itself to render a trial constitutionally unfair.\u2019 \u201d <em>George v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 264, 274, 411 S.E.2d 12, 18 (1991) (quoting <em>Dobbert v. Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 303, 97 S.Ct. 2290, 2303, 53 L.Ed.2d 344 (1977) (abrogation on other grounds recognized by <em>Grimes v. State, </em>807 S.W.2d 582 (Tex.Crim.App.1991))). \u201cThe fact that there have been media reports about the accused and the crime does not necessarily require a change of venue.\u201d <em>Roach v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 324, 342, 468 S.E.2d 98, 109 (1996) (citation omitted). \u201cA significant factor in determining whether a change of venue is warranted is whether the media reports are factual and accurate.\u201d <em>Mueller v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 386, 398, 422 S.E.2d 380, 388 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cAnother significant factor the trial court must consider is \u2018the difficulty encountered in selecting a jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roach, </em>251 Va. at 342, 468 S.E.2d at 109 (quoting <em>Mueller, </em>244 Va. at 398, 422 S.E.2d at 388).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Cressell has not overcome the presumption that he received a fair trial in Grayson County. Here, virtually every prospective juror admitted hearing about the case through the media or by speaking with others. After extensive <em>voir dire, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>twenty-four jurors were selected who \u201cunequivocally answered that they could enter the jury box with an open mind and wait until the entire case was presented before reaching a fixed opinion.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">Prospective jurors are not required or expected to be completely ignorant of the facts and the issues surrounding a highly publicized case; all that is required is that a prospective juror can lay aside his or her impression or opinion and render a verdict based upon the law and evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-6\"><em>Ascher v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1105, 1114, 408 S.E.2d 906, 912 (1991) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Moreover, the jury was selected with relative ease, and more prospective jurors were excused for reasons unrelated to publicity than were excused for holding fixed, preconceived notions about Cressell\u2019s guilt. <em>See Brown, </em>28 Va.App. at 337-38, 504 S.E.2d at 409-10 (finding no error in denying motion where twenty-four of sixty prospective jurors acknowledged awareness of publicity); <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 1, 10-12, 419 S.E.2d 606, 611-12 (1992) (affirming trial court\u2019s ruling denying change of venue where thirty-one percent of prospective jurors questioned were excused because of pretrial publicity). Finally, Cressell conceded at oral argument that the media reports were factually accurate. <em>See Mueller, </em>244 Va. at 398, 422 S.E.2d at 388; <em>see also Buchanan v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 389, 407, 384 S.E.2d 757, 767 (1989) (noting that media coverage disclosing the accused\u2019s criminal record is insufficient to justify a change of venue). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">\n<em>B. Jury Challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Cressell argues that the trial court erred in failing to strike three prospective jurors for cause. Cressell contends that prospective jurors Organ and Hancock should have been struck because they were members of a \u201cpoisoned panel\u201d that he sought to have struck in its entirety and that juror Thomp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>son should have been struck because during <em>voir dire </em>she expressed sentiments that she could not be indifferent to the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">\u201cThe right to a trial by an impartial jury is guaranteed under both the United States and Virginia Constitutions.\u201d <em>Gosling v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 642, 645, 376 S.E.2d 541, 543 (1989) (citing U.S. Const, amend VI; Va. Const, art I, \u00a7 8). \u201c[S]o long as the jury that sits is impartial,\u201d the compelled use of a peremptory challenge by a defendant to remove a biased juror does not violate the Sixth Amendment because peremptory challenges are \u201cauxiliary\u201d and \u201care not of federal constitutional dimension.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Salazar, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,---, 120 S.Ct. 774, 779-80, 145 L.Ed.2d 792 (2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the Virginia Supreme Court has held in <em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 300, 227 S.E.2d 734, 737 (1976), that as a matter of state law, relying on Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-357 and -358, an accused is entitled to a panel of jurors free from exception before exercising peremptory challenges. Thus, we review a trial court\u2019s decision whether to strike a prospective juror for cause for an abuse of discretion and that ruling will not be disturbed on appeal unless it appears from the record that the trial court\u2019s action constitutes manifest error. <em>See Stockton v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 192, 200, 402 S.E.2d 196, 200 (1991).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">The constitutional guarantee of an impartial jury does not contemplate excluding those who have read or heard news accounts concerning the case or even exclusion of those who may have formed an opinion based on such accounts.... The test, instead, is whether a juror is capable of laying aside a preconceived opinion and rendering \u201ca verdict solely on the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-10\"><em>Wilmoth v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 169, 173, 390 S.E.2d 514, 516 (1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>\n<em>1. Jurors Organ and Hancock</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Jurors Organ and Hancock were members of a thirteen member panel that was initially subjected to <em>voir dire </em>as a group. During <em>voir dire, </em>eleven of the prospective jurors stated they had formed opinions about the accused\u2019s guilt or expressed other sentiments which required that the judge excuse those eleven jurors for cause. Organ and Hancock were the two remaining jurors from the panel of thirteen who were not removed for cause. Cressell timely objected to the seating of jurors Organ and Hancock on the ground that they were present and unduly influenced when the other prospective jurors stated in Organ\u2019s and Hancock\u2019s presence that each had formed an opinion about the case, or explained how they knew the parties, or that they were prejudiced toward the testimony of law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Although none of the eleven jurors excused expressly stated his or her opinion about Cressell\u2019s guilt or innocence, one readily concludes from the responses that most, if not all, believed Cressell was guilty. However, both Organ and Hancock unequivocally stated that they did not hold fixed, preconceived opinions regarding Cressell\u2019s guilt or innocence and affirmatively stated that they could be fair and impartial. Both answered affirmatively when asked whether they understood that Cressell was presumed innocent until proven guilty and that he had no burden to present any evidence. Both Organ and Hancock also answered affirmatively when asked if they could set aside any preconceived views and render a verdict based solely on the law and evidence presented at trial. Moreover, Organ and Hancock stated that they were not influenced by the fixed opinions of the eleven prospective jurors who were excused. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to strike Organ and Hancock for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">\n<em>2. Juror Thompson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Cressell argues that the court erred by refusing to strike Thompson for cause and that the court\u2019s refusal to strike Thompson was not cured by the defense\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Cressell correctly asserts that his use of a peremptory strike to remove Thompson does not cure prejudice caused to him by seating a biased juror. <em>See Brooks v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 523, 530-31, 484 S.E.2d 127, 130 (1997) (finding that a prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective juror who should have been stricken for cause will not cure possible prejudice); <em>see also DeHart v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 213, 216, 456 S.E.2d 133, 134 (1995). \u201cA defendant has a right to an impartial jury drawn from \u2018a panel [of twenty] free from exceptions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 300, 227 S.E.2d at 737 (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-357, 8.01-358,19.2-262(2). \u201cIf a venireman who should have been removed for cause is allowed to remain on the jury panel, the accused is \u2018denied the opportunity of having another impartial person on his jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 199, 212, 510 S.E.2d 751, 757 (1999) (citation omitted). The trial court, however, did not err in refusing to strike Thompson for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">During <em>voir dire </em>of Thompson, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">COURT: Can you put what you\u2019ve read or heard about it totally aside and have an open mind when you enter the jury box?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">THOMPSON: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL] CLAYTOR: Have you formed any opinion about his [Cressell\u2019s] character or anything like that based upon what you\u2019ve read in the paper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG6\">THOMPSON: (No audible response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL] CLAYTOR: Do you think [the defendant is] guilty of something as he sits here?

THOMPSON: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-10\">^ # * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-11\">THE COURT: Mr. Bolt had asked you can you give a fair and impartial trial and let me just ask you. Can you and I\u2019ll ask this to all three (3) of you, can all of you set aside any impressions that you may have received through the news media or any opinion you may have formed? And if you become the jury and you\u2019re sworn to try the case, can you enter the jury box with an open mind and can you render a verdict based solely and only on the evidence and the law that you receive? Can you do that? Ms. Thompson nods yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">\u201cA prospective juror who is biased, prejudiced, or who \u2018persists in a misapprehension of law that will render him [or her] incapable of abiding the court\u2019s instructions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>applying the law, must be excluded for cause\u2019 because such a juror cannot be impartial.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 619, 621, 454 S.E.2d 363, 364 (1995) (quoting <em>Sizemore v.

Even though a prospective juror may hold preconceived views, opinions, or misconceptions, the test of impartiality is whether the venireperson can lay aside the preconceived views and render a verdict based solely on the law and evidence presented at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\"><em>Griffin, </em>19 Va.App. at 621, 454 S.E.2d at 364 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Cressell argues that this case is controlled by our decision in <em>Brown, </em>29 Va.App. 199, 510 S.E.2d 751, and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. 297, 227 S.E.2d 734. We disagree. In <em>Brown, </em>the defendant sought to strike three prospective jurors for cause. The holding concerning the seating of prospective jurors one and two is relevant to our discussion. During <em>voir dire, </em>prospective juror one stated that she had been the victim of a violent crime. In response to questions regarding whether that experience would influence her ability to \u201ckeep an open mind\u201d and render a decision based on the facts of the case, she expressed equivocation. She stated that she was not certain that her experience would influence her decision. We held that the juror expressed \u201cnumerous reservations about her ability to serve impartially on the jury in light of her personal experiences.\u201d We noted that nearly all of the juror\u2019s responses contained the phrases, \u201cI think,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and \u201cI would try.\u201d A trial judge has an opportunity to hear, observe, and assess the connotations of a juror\u2019s response; therefore, equivocal statements alone will not suffice to disqualify a juror. However, \u201call doubts about the fitness of a juror to serve must be resolved in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>29 Va.App. at 208, 510 S.E.2d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Prospective juror two in <em>Brown, </em>was Chief Counsel to the United States Secret Service and, stated during <em>voir dire </em>that \u201c[his] whole career has been law enforcement. So [he] tend[ed] to view things from a law enforcement perspective.\u201d He stated that he might give more weight to an officer\u2019s testimony. The prospective juror also expressed his belief that it was unlikely that a case would go to trial if the accused was not guilty. We held that the juror\u2019s firmly held belief and his view toward law enforcement created \u201ca reasonable doubt about his ability to sit impartially on a jury.\u201d The circumstances presented in <em>Brown </em>are readily distinguishable from the circumstance presented by juror Thompson. No evidence proved that Thompson was a victim of a violent crime, and she was unequivocal about being able to fairly render a decision in the case. Further, she did not harbor a firmly held personal belief about law enforcement and those who are standing trial that would interfere with her being an impartial juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In <em>Breeden, </em>the defendant sought to strike a prospective juror for cause, who, during <em>voir dire, </em>stated that she had read about the crime in the newspaper and \u201cwas glad that person was caught.\u201d She also stated that she held the view that the defendant would have to prove his innocence. After stating those views, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney attempted to rehabilitate the juror, asking if she could follow the court\u2019s instructions in applying the facts to the law and follow the court\u2019s instructions regarding the presumption of innocence. She stated, \u201cYes sir.\u201d In holding that the trial court erred in seating the prospective juror, the Virginia Supreme Court noted that it was not \u201cconcerned with a possible misapprehension of law,\u201d stating that \u201c[j]urors are not expected to be learned in legal maxims.\u201d Rather, the Court, considering the <em>voir dire </em>of the prospective juror in its entirety, found that \u201cher response to that crucial question was not so much a symptom of her ignorance of the law as a candid reflection of the state of mind concerning [the defendant\u2019s] guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Here, although Thompson initially expressed her belief that Cressell was \u201cprobably guilty of something because why would he be here at this far\u201d and her belief that if one is present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>during the commission of a crime and does nothing to intervene that person is also culpable, she subsequently stated she could set those beliefs aside if instructed to do so by the court. She expressed no equivocation in her ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions and in her ability to apply the facts to the law. Thompson also advised the court that she had not formed any preconceived opinions about Cressell\u2019s guilt or innocence based on the pretrial publicity, and she expressed no reservations regarding the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence. Here, the attempts to rehabilitate Thompson were made largely by defense counsel, not the trial judge. <em>But see McGill v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 237, 242, 391 S.E.2d 597, 600 (1990) (holding that where a prospective juror has been shown not to be impartial, a trial judge may not rehabilitate the juror by merely asking persuasive, leading questions to which the juror acquiesces). Thompson\u2019s initial statements about an accused\u2019s innocence reflects \u201ca symptom of her ignorance of the law,\u201d not a \u201creflection\u201d of her state of mind about Cressell\u2019s guilt. The trial judge had the opportunity to observe Thompson\u2019s demeanor, to hear her responses and the connotations which she placed upon her answers, and to better form an opinion than we can on a cold record as to whether she had a fair, impartial, and open state of mind. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in seating juror Thompson. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not err in refusing to strike Thompson for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">\n<em>C. Sufficiency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Cressell argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction. He asserts that the Commonwealth failed to prove he was directly involved in Johnson\u2019s death. He argues that Anderson\u2019s testimony, which was the only testimony remotely linking him to the crime, was inherently incredible and unworthy of belief. Cressell asserts that Anderson gave contradictory testimony at trial and lied to the defense investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">On review of a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>the Commonwealth, the prevailing party, and grant to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em>255 Va. 516, 521, 499 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1998). \u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995) (citations omitted). In order for a witness\u2019 testimony to be disregarded as a matter of law, the evidence must be inherently incredible or the witness\u2019 account of the events must be so contrary to human experience as to be unworthy of belief. <em>See Owens v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 689, 696-97, 43 S.E.2d 895, 898 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">At trial, Anderson admitted she lied to the defense investigator about whether she was in love -with Ceparano, pregnant with his child, which she aborted after the murder, and whether she was afraid of him. She stated that she lied because she \u201c[knew] whose lawyers you were and what you was trying to pull.\u201d Anderson also admitted she said in her statement to the defense investigator that she was unsure from whom the gas smell emanated. However, at trial, she unequivocally stated that the gasoline smell came from Cressell. She also gave conflicting statements and evidence concerning whether she had one drink or two during the course of the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Although Anderson made several contradictory statements during trial and admitted having made statements to the defense investigator, Anderson\u2019s account of the events was not inherently incredible, and the fact finder was entitled to weigh this evidence in determining Anderson\u2019s credibility and Cressell\u2019s guilt. <em>See Sandoval, </em>20 Va.App. at 138, 455 S.E.2d at 732. Her account of the events provides a cogent explanation for Johnson\u2019s gruesome murder and is not incredible as an explanation for what occurred. Moreover, defense witness Harden corroborated Anderson\u2019s account of the events that transpired that evening. Both testified that the group gathered to celebrate Harden\u2019s birthday, all but Anderson became heavily intoxicated, either Cressell or Ceparano removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Johnson\u2019s watch, Cressell and Ceparano carried Johnson outside, and both Cressell and Ceparano were outside when Johnson was doused with gasoline and set on fire. Both witnesses testified that they smelled gasoline after the burning when Cressell and Ceparano returned to the trailer, although Harden was unable to positively attribute the odor to Cressell. Anderson\u2019s testimony that she heard Cressell threaten to burn Johnson on a white cross and call him a \u201cnigger,\u201d although not corroborated by Harden, was not so incredible as to be unworthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The evidence proved that Cressell, at the very least, aided and abetted in carrying Johnson outside knowing that Ceparano intended to kill Johnson and that he assisted in dousing Johnson with gasoline and in burning Johnson alive. Even if Cressell did not actually set Johnson on fire, he assisted Ceparano in the murder. <em>See Pugliese v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 82, 93-94, 428 S.E.2d 16, 25 (1993) (stating that \u201c \u2018proof that a person is present at the commission of a crime without disapproving or opposing it, is evidence from which, in connection with other circumstances, it is competent for the jury to infer that he assented thereto\u2019 \u201d). Cressell made hostile remarks to Johnson, stating he was going to take him outside and burn him on a cross. Cressell helped Ceparano carry Johnson outside and across the driveway, and he smelled of gasoline when he returned to the trailer. Finally, in statements to the authorities, Cressell lied about his involvement in the crime. <em>See Rollston v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 535, 548, 399 S.E.2d 823, 831 (1991) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s false statements are probative to show he is trying to conceal his guilt, and thus are evidence of his guilt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Cressell was guilty of first degree murder. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-11\">. Because the dispositive holding in <em>Martinez-Salazar </em>involved a due process challenge under Fed.R.Crim.P. 23, it is inapposite to our case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
