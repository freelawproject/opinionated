On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in: 1) accepting his waiver of counsel when it failed to advise him of the nature of the proceedings, the possible punishment, and the right to court-appointed counsel; 2) failing to advise him of his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>remain silent; 3) failing to give him the opportunity to present evidence in his own behalf; 4) finding the evidence, sufficient to prove he acted with criminal intent; and 5) convicting him where his duty existed only by implication. We find that the evidence was insufficient to convict appellant of contempt; therefore, we reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The facts are not controverted. Murphy Hughes (\u201cHughes\u201d) was an inmate at the Richmond City Jail pending his trial. At a hearing on January 21, 1999, the trial court continued Hughes\u2019 case until June 21, 1999, for a psychological evaluation at Central State Hospital. The trial court issued a written order reflecting the continuance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The order was received by the City Jail, but Hughes was never transported to Central State Hospital. No separate order was entered scheduling a psychological evaluation at Central State Hospital or directing that Hughes be transported to Central State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">On May 5, 1999, the trial court issued a rule to show cause against appellant, directing him to show cause why he should not be \u201cfound in contempt for failure to abide by the court\u2019s order of January 21,1999.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Pursuant to the show-cause order, appellant appeared before the trial court on May 7, 1999. Appellant was a deputy sheriff for the City of Richmond and served as the supervisor of the records for the jail. As supervisor, he oversaw other deputies who received transportation orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The following colloquy occurred between the trial court and the appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">THE COURT: This is a show cause hearing in which Lieutenant Michaels shall show cause, if any, why he should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>not be held in contempt because the defendant in Case F-98-4207, Mr. Murphy Hughes, has been held in the jail since January 21st, 1999, and was not sent to Central State Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">Mr. Michaels, because you are before the Court on a show cause order, I would need to ask if you would like to obtain the services of an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">THE DEFENDANT: No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">THE COURT: You\u2019re prepared to go forward?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">THE COURT: The Court has some questions for you. Why don\u2019t you step forward, raise your right hand, and be sworn in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">The court then conducted a direct examination of the appellant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-11\">Q. Specifically as to this case, the Court has three questions. The first is, why was Mr. Murphy kept in jail after January 21st and not sent to Central State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-12\">A. We had a couple of problems, ma\u2019am. First off, the records room went under a change of personnel right around that time. We had a whole new staff brought in. And when the order did come in \u2014 it was faxed to me on the 22nd \u2014 it was read by one of the other deputies in the records room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-13\">It should have been brought to my attention, because there should have been questions on it. It wasn\u2019t specifically stated in there that he was to be transported by the Sheriffs Office to Central State. Also, we didn\u2019t have a date or a time when he was to be admitted to Central State. If those questions had come to me or those concerns had come to me at the time, I, certainly, would have questioned it and I would have called the Court on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-14\">The first time I saw the order was when Ms. Dailey called me the other day about that, and I explained to her that, that was the first time I had seen it and the order does not say that we were to take him, so we would need a transportation order on this court order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Q. So I understand it was not your decision but someone else\u2019s. It was the decision of another official in the Sheriffs Department that Mr. Hughes should remain incarcerated in the jail, but that was not your decision; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">A. Well, the decision wasn\u2019t consciously made to keep Mr. Hughes in the jail. When the order comes over from the Court, the order is read, and we update it in the system to ensure that the order is correct or what we have in the system is correct on the individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">Q. But the decision that was made in relationship to this order was made by who? That\u2019s the question the Court has. Regardless of which decision was made, who made that decision to interpret this particular order in that particular manner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">A. That decision was made by another deputy in the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">s\u00a1\u00ab Hs \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">Q. My question is for this particular individual, who has not been convicted. He\u2019s not under probation supervision, so he can\u2019t be transferred by the probation department. He has not been released on bond, so he cannot be transferred by his defense attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">Q. The Judge cannot transfer him. How would he be transferred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-12\">A. That would fall on Sheriffs transportation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-13\">Q. It\u2019s clear to you that the Sheriffs Department has the responsibility for seeing to it that this defendant gets to Central State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-14\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am, we do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-15\">THE COURT: Are there any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-16\">MS. REINER [Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney]: No, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-17\">THE COURT: Any questions, Ms. Sheridan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-18\">MS. SHERIDAN [Hughes\u2019 attorney]: No ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-19\">THE COURT: You may step down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-20\">THE DEFENDANT: Thank you, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>The court then proceeded to find appellant guilty of contempt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">THE COURT: The Court will find that your conduct, in agreeing with your Deputy Dickerson, was intentional, willful, and deliberate. It was mentally and professionally irresponsible. It was in total disregard of the rights of the Commonwealth to bring this defendant to trial within the speedy trial rights that are set forth pursuant to 19.2-243.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">It showed a total lack of respect for the judicial branch of government, and it was, regrettably, ignorant of the legal consequences that the Court must uphold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">The Court is somewhat concerned that there is someone under your supervision, who is a records clerk, who is ignorant of statutory interpretation, [and] legal interpretation ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">I will find that as her supervisor, Ms. Dickerson\u2019s supervisor, since you were aware of the fact that you have violated the Court\u2019s order, the Court will hold you in contempt. The court will impose a $1,000 fine and a 10-day jail sentence with 10 days suspended. Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The appellant did not move to strike the evidence nor did he object to any of the trial court\u2019s procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A76\">A. <em>Procedural Default</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">The Commonwealth contends appellant is procedurally barred from raising these issues. Appellant concedes that he did not object to the trial court\u2019s rulings at trial but maintains that the \u201cends of justice\u201d and \u201cgood cause shown\u201d exceptions in Rule 5A:18 apply. We will focus on the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals will not consider an argument on appeal which was not presented to the trial court.\u201d <em>Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>(1998) (citing <em>Jacques v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991)); <em>see also </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">However, Rule 5A:18 provides for consideration of a ruling by the trial court that was not objected to at trial \u201cto enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Rule 5A:18. \u201c \u2018The ends of justice exception is narrow and is to be used sparingly\u2019 \u201d when an error at trial is \u201c \u2018clear, substantial and material.\u2019 \u201d <em>Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 220-21, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997) (quoting <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 126, 132, 380 S.E.2d 8, 10-11 (1989)). \u201cIn order to avail oneself of the exception, a defendant must affirmatively show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not that a miscarriage might have occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 487 S.E.2d at 272 (citing <em>Mounce v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 433, 436, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">In order to show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, an appellant must demonstrate more than that the Commonwealth <em>failed </em>to prove an element of the offense .... [T]he appellant must demonstrate that he or she was convicted for conduct that was not a criminal offense or the record must affirmatively prove that an element of the offense did not occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 221-22, 487 S.E.2d at 272-73 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Appellant argues that a miscarriage of justice occurred because the record clearly established that the continuance order did not state a clearly defined duty to transport Hughes to Central State Hospital; therefore, appellant contends that his conduct was not a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Whether the ends of justice exception applies is inextricably linked to determination of the merits of this case. Because we hold that appellant committed no offense, the trial court\u2019s error was \u201cclear, substantial and material;\u201d therefore, we may apply the ends of justice exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>B. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We held in <em>Wilson v. Collins, </em>27 Va.App. 411, 424, 499 S.E.2d 560, 566 (1998), as Follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">A person is in \u201ccontempt\u201d of a court order only if it is shown that he or she has violated its <em>express </em>terms. <em>See Winn v. Winn, </em>218 Va. 8, 10, 235 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1977). \u201c \u2018[T]he process for contempt lies for disobedience of what is decreed, not for what may be decreed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Taliaferro v. Horde\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>22 Va. (1 Rand.) 242, 247 (1822)). \u201c[BJefore a person may be held in contempt for violating a court order, the order must be in definite terms as to the duties thereby imposed upon him and the command must be expressed rather than implied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">If the actions of the alleged contemnor do not violate a clearly defined duty imposed upon him or her by a court\u2019s decree, the alleged contemnor\u2019s actions do not constitute contempt. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11, 235 S.E.2d at 309.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The Supreme Court of Virginia held in <em>Winn v. Winn, </em>218 Va. 8, 10, 235 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1977), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">As a general rule, \u201cbefore a person may be held in contempt for violating a court order, the order must be in definite terms as to the duties thereby imposed upon him and the command must be expressed rather than implied.\u201d <em>Wood v. Goodson, </em>253 Ark. 196, 203, 485 S.W.2d 213, 217 (1972). This is also the rule followed in Virginia. In <em>Taliaferro v. Horde\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>22 Va. (1 Rand.) 242, 247 (1822), we said that \u201c(t)he process for contempt lies for disobedience of what is decreed, not for what may be decreed.\u201d <em>See also French v. Pobst, </em>203 Va. 704, 710, 127 S.E.2d 137, 141 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">In this case, the court order upon which the contempt show cause was predicated did not expressly impose a duty upon appellant or any other personnel from the Sheriffs office to transport Hughes to Central State Hospital. Appellant testified that no one in his office interpreted the continuance order as a transportation order. At best, the duty to trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>port is implied. Therefore, appellant did not violate the trial court\u2019s order, and his actions did not constitute contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">For these reasons, we apply the ends of justice exception pursuant to Rule 5A:18 and hold that the evidence was insufficient to convict appellant of contempt. We do not reach appellant\u2019s remaining assignments of error because they are rendered moot by our reversal on the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-12\">. The order stated, in part, \"For reasons satisfactory to the Court, this matter is continued to June 21, 1999 at 9:00 a.m. in order for the defendant to undergo inpatient psychological evaluation at Central State Hospital.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
