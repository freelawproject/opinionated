Appellant argued that the trial court erred in: (1) admitting the results of the preliminary alcosensor test; (2) allowing testimony during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief that appellant was previously convicted of an unrelated offense of driving under the influence; (3) denying his motion to strike the evidence; and (4) refusing appellant\u2019s jury instruction on causation. A divided panel of this Court reversed appellant\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>See Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 1280-984, 1999 WL 1133268, September 28, 1999. On the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, we stayed the mandate of that decision and granted a rehearing en banc. Upon rehearing en banc, we find no reversible error and affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">On February 2, 1997, shortly after 8:00 p.m., a pickup truck driven by appellant and a motorcycle driven by Wayne A. Holmes collided at the intersection of Occoquan and Homer Roads in Prince William County. Holmes died in the crash. In the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, Mike Arnold testified that he was driving about forty miles per hour westbound on Occoquan Road in the left lane and he was slowing down as he approached an intersection. Arnold said he was fifty feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>from the intersection at Horner Road when he saw in his rearview mirror a motorcycle approaching in the right lane. He testified that the traffic light at the intersection controlling his travel direction was green. As Arnold slowed, the motorcycle continued in the right lane past his car. Arnold testified that a pickup truck, driven by appellant eastward on Occoquan Road, made a left turn onto Horner Road, across the westbound travel lanes of Occoquan Road. Arnold testified that he was thirty feet away from the intersection when the truck turned, that the truck had given no turn signal, and that the truck did not make a proper turn \u2014 \u201cit cut the corner.\u201d Arnold saw the collision between the motorcycle and the truck. He estimated that thirty seconds passed between the time he first-saw the motorcycle in his rearview mirror and the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Connie Stewart was a passenger in a car, which turned onto Occoquan Road at Route One and began travelling westbound toward Horner Road. She saw the motorcycle turn onto westbound Occoquan Road from Route One. The car in which Stewart was a passenger was travelling west in the left lane of Occoquan Road, and the motorcycle was travelling west in the right lane of Occoquan Road. As the car in which Stewart was riding was moving at thirty-five miles per hour, the motorcycle passed the car. The motorcyclist gave a hand signal and drove into the left westbound lane. The motorcyclist passed a car in the right westbound lane, gave a hand signal, and moved again to the right westbound lane. Stewart estimated the speed of the motorcycle as forty to forty-five miles per hour. Stewart testified that as they were approaching the intersection, the light \u201chad turned green.\u201d Her car was in the left travel lane, and the motorcycle was in the right travel lane. As the motorcycle passed to the right of a vehicle in front of Stewart\u2019s car, Stewart \u201csaw the motorcycle flying up in the air.\u201d She did not witness the actual collision and said it was dark at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Officer J.S. Scalici, who examined the crash scene one-half hour following the accident, opined that if appellant\u2019s truck had not hit the motorcycle at the point of impact, the truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>would have traveled into oncoming traffic on Horner Road. The officer testified that the motorcycle was .travelling between thirty-five and forty miles per hour and that appellant\u2019s truck was travelling between thirty and thirty-five miles per hour. He admitted, however, that his estimates of speed were \u201cguess[es].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">When the officer interviewed appellant, appellant said he was returning from a bowling alley when the accident occurred. After the officer told appellant the bowling alley was in the opposite direction, appellant said he left the bowling alley, went to a friend\u2019s house, and was returning from the friend\u2019s house when the accident occurred. Appellant told the officer he had consumed three beers between 5:15 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The officer also testified that appellant \u201chad an odor of a strong alcohol beverage about his person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">When the officer made inquiry concerning appellant\u2019s driving status, appellant gave him an Alabama driver\u2019s license. Appellant said the license was suspended for failure to pay fines, that he had just returned from Alabama, and that \u201che had taken care of the fines.\u201d When the officer asked appellant if he had ever had a Virginia driver\u2019s license, appellant responded that he had not. Over objection, the officer testified that he told appellant the Department of Motor Vehicles records indicated appellant\u2019s Virginia driver\u2019s license had been suspended for a conviction. When asked about the conviction, the officer testified that appellant\u2019s Virginia license was suspended for \u201cDWI\u201d and that appellant\u2019s Alabama license had been revoked \u201cfor driving while intoxicated,\u201d not for failure to pay fines. Appellant unsuccessfully objected to the introduction of evidence concerning the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Officer Christopher Lando testified that he arrived at the accident scene at 8:30 p.m., obtained appellant\u2019s Alabama driver\u2019s license, and determined that it was suspended. When he asked appellant to complete a \u201cstatement form,\u201d appellant wrote that \u201c \u2018[he] was taking a left on\u2019 \u2014 \u2018[he] had the green\u2019\u2014 \u2018[he] was making a left\u2019 \u2014 \u2018[Holmes] hit [him].\u2019 \u201d After Lando \u201cdetected a very strong odor of an alcoholic beverage about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>[appellant\u2019s] person\u201d and was told by appellant that he had consumed three beers at a bowling alley, he had appellant perform several \u201cfield dexterity tests.\u201d Appellant was unsuccessful in those tests. Lando testified that he then gave appellant a \u201cfield alco-sensor test,\u201d which he identified as a device that can determine a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration at the scene of the accident. Appellant objected to testimony concerning the results of the alco-sensor test. The trial judge overruled the objection. Lando then testified that when appellant\u2019s reading reached .200, he stopped the test and arrested appellant. After the officer transported appellant to the police headquarters, appellant\u2019s breath was again tested and indicated an alcohol content of .22.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">A forensic toxicologist tested fluid recovered from Holmes\u2019 body and concluded that Holmes\u2019 blood alcohol level was .13. He agreed that at .13, a person\u2019s \u201cvision, judgment, and ability to execute or act on that judgment ... would be a little impaired.\u201d He further testified that at .22, appellant\u2019s blood alcohol level, a person would suffer \u201cincoordination of the muscle, ... disorientation, ... [a]nd confusion.\u201d Over appellant\u2019s objection, the toxicologist opined that a man of appellant\u2019s size would have to have consumed \u201cmore than 10 beers\u201d to reach an alcohol level of .22.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, appellant testified that he went to a friend\u2019s house after leaving the bowling alley on the night of the accident. He left the friend\u2019s house and drove east on Occoquan Road. When he arrived at the intersection with Horner Road, he was in the left turn lane and the light was red. He testified that when the light controlling his travel lane turned to a green arrow, he turned left and was struck by a motorcycle. On cross-examination, appellant conceded that he had consumed more than three beers that night and was not sure how many beers he act\u00faally had. Appellant testified he had a prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Elizabeth Tuialana testified that prior to the collision, she was driving north on Horner Road in the left lane. As she approached the intersection of Horner and Occoquan Roads, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>intending to turn left onto westbound Occoquan Road, the light controlling her lane of travel turned yellow. She stopped before entering the intersection because the light turned red. She saw a truck on Occoquan Road ready to turn onto Horner Road. After looking into her rearview mirror to see if her friend was behind her, she saw a truck on Occoquan Road turning onto Horner Road, saw \u201csomething coming down Occoquan and then the accident occurred.\u201d She recalled that the accident occurred within \u201ca matter of seconds\u201d of the time she arrived at the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Rachael Robinson testified that she was behind Tuialana\u2019s car going north on Horner Road. She stopped when Tuialana stopped, and she recalled that the light was yellow. When she stopped, she saw a truck stopped on Occoquan Road to her left in a turning lane. She testified that the accident then occurred within \u201cseconds. It was fairly quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">John Olivo, a traffic signal supervisor for the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), testified to the signal sequence at the intersection. He stated that after the signal light controlling Horner Road traffic turns red, if a vehicle is in the left turn lane at Occoquan Road, the next sequence of lights would display a green turn arrow for that lane of travel. The green arrow would be displayed for seven to twelve seconds, depending on the number of vehicles in the turn lane. He also testified it was impossible for the green turn arrow to display while a solid green light is displaying for traffic coming from the opposite direction. After a maximum of twelve seconds, the green arrow becomes yellow for four seconds and then becomes a solid green ball. He also testified that it was possible for a green turn arrow to display if a vehicle was also making a left turn coming from the opposite direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial judge refused an instruction tendered by appellant concerning the statutory element of causation that must be shown between appellant\u2019s intoxication and the death of Holmes. The trial judge ruled that the tendered instruction was redundant because the finding instruction contained the requisite elements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>offense. Following its deliberations, the jury convicted appellant of aggravated involuntary manslaughter, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">II. EVIDENCE OF ALCO-SENSOR TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Following the collision, the police officer used an \u201calcosensor\u201d to perform a preliminary test of appellant\u2019s breath-alcohol content. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial judge permitted the officer to testify concerning the result of appellant\u2019s preliminary breath test. Appellant contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-267 bars that testimony in a prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1. The Commonwealth argues that Code \u00a7 18.2-267 only bars introduction of the results of the test in a prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-266 or Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The Commonwealth indicted and tried appellant for aggravated manslaughter, which is statutorily defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">A. Any person who, as a result of driving under the influence in violation of subdivision (ii), (in), or (iv) of [Code] \u00a7 18.2-266, unintentionally causes the death of another person, shall be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">B. If, in addition, the conduct of the defendant was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life, he shall be guilty of aggravated involuntary manslaughter, a felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of not less than one nor more that twenty years, one year of which shall be a mandatory, minimum term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">Code \u00a7 18.2-267(A) permits a preliminary breath analysis of a \u201cperson who is suspected of a violation of [Code] \u00a7 18.2-266 or [Code] \u00a7 18.2-266.1.\u201d However, another provision of that statute states that \u201c[t]he results of the breath analysis shall not be admitted into evidence in any prosecution under [Code] \u00a7 18.2-266 or [Code] \u00a7 18.2-266.1, the purpose of this section being to permit a preliminary analysis of the alcoholic content of the blood of a person suspected of having violated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>provisions of [Code] \u00a7 18.2-266 or [Code] \u00a7 18.2-266.1.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-267(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The manslaughter statute under which appellant was tried expressly references a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 as the predicate for the prosecution of aggravated manslaughter. By the express wording of the statute, a prosecution for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 is necessarily a \u201cprosecution under [Code] \u00a7 18.2-266.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-267(E). The Commonwealth can prove a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 if and only if it proves a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Thus, we hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-267(E) applies to bar introduction of the results of the preliminary analysis because a prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 includes as an element of the offense proof of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court erred in admitting the results of the preliminary alco-sensor breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">However, our inquiry does not end there. We must decide whether the error requires reversal. Our determination of whether the error is harmless is guided by familiar principles. Non-constitutional error \u201cis harmless \u2018[w]hen it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678) (emphasis added in <em>Lavinder). </em>To determine whether an error is harmless, the Court \u201cmust review the record and the evidence and evaluate the effect the error may have had on how the finder of fact resolved the contested issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1007, 407 S.E.2d at 912. \u201cAn error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1005, 407 S.E.2d at 911. We have further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">\u2018Whether such an error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a host of factors, all readily accessible to reviewing courts. These factors include the importance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><em>Sargent v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 143, 154, 360 S.E.2d 895, 901 (1987) (quoting <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 674, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1432, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Applying the standard articulated in <em>Lavinder, </em>we conclude that the error was harmless because appellant suffered no prejudice and had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same. <em>See Lavinder, </em>12 Va.App. at 1005, 407 S.E.2d at 911. During the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, the actual breath test result taken pursuant to the Virginia Implied Consent Law was introduced into evidence without objection. The test result indicated a blood alcohol content of .22, reflecting a higher concentration of alcohol than that obtained from the preliminary alco-sensor test. Accordingly, the error in admitting the results from the preliminary alcosensor test was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">III. EVIDENCE OF UNRELATED DUI CONVICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Next, appellant contends the trial court erred in allowing testimony, of his other unrelated convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol. The Commonwealth argues that this evidence, although proving a prior criminal act, was admissible because appellant\u2019s lie about the status of his license was proof of consciousness of guilt. We disagree that the evidence was admissible for that purpose.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">As a general rule, evidence that an accused has committed a criminal offense other than that charged in the indictment is inadmissible. That is because such evidence confuses one offense with the other, unfairly surprises the defendant with a charge he is unprepared to meet, and, by showing that the accused has a criminal propensity, tends to reverse his presumption of innocence of the crime on trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 497, 502, 303 S.E.2d 890, 892-93 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The evidence concerning the prior convictions was not offered to prove an element of the offense. \u201c[I]t is improper to use evidence that a defendant has committed another crime when it has \u2018no connection with the one under investigation ... [because those] other acts of criminality ... are not legally relevant and should not be [used] to prejudice the defendant or to create a probability of guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 140, 495 S.E.2d 489, 492 (1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Although we find that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the unrelated convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol, \u201cthis does not automatically entitle ... [the defendant] to a reversal of his conviction. \u2018A conviction should not be reversed unless the introduction of improper evidence suggests a manifest probability that it was prejudicial to the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rider v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 595, 600, 383 S.E.2d 25, 27 (1989) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We, therefore, look to the evidence to see if the improperly admitted evidence of appellant\u2019s prior convictions had any effect upon the guilty verdict of the jury. We acknowledge the prejudicial tendency of introducing evidence in this aggravated involuntary manslaughter prosecution that appellant had two prior DUI convictions and that his license to operate a motor vehicle was suspended, particularly where, as here, that appellant\u2019s driving intoxicated caused the homicide. However, even though prejudicial, on this record we find the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt to have been so overwhelming that the jury could not have reached any other verdict. Thus, because the inadmissible evidence did not affect the verdict, we find the error harmless. <em>See Lavinder, </em>12 Va.App. at 1005, 407 S.E.2d at 911. On this record, had the error not occurred, we conclude that the verdict would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The effect the evidence of the two DUI convictions had upon the jury was completely overshadowed by other evidence in the record that appellant\u2019s intoxication caused the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>and homicide. Officer Lando smelled \u201ca very strong odor of alcoholic beverage\u201d upon appellant\u2019s breath at the accident scene. Appellant failed the field sobriety tests administered by the officer. His blood alcohol level was .22 on the breathalyzer test administered under the Virginia Implied Consent Law. Dr. Huynh, an expert in forensic toxicology employed by the Department of Criminal Justice for the Commonwealth of Virginia, compared the breath results of appellant and Holmes and explained that the difference between the two was \u201cenormous.\u201d Dr. Huynh further testified that appellant would have had to drink at least ten beers to reach .22, whereas appellant told the police officer that he had consumed only three glasses of beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The testimonies of several eyewitnesses and of the VDOT traffic supervisor prove that appellant turned, in violation of the traffic control signal, into the path of the victim\u2019s motorcycle. The blood alcohol test proved that, at the time, appellant was highly intoxicated, and the forensic toxicologist testified that a person with a .22 blood alcohol level, as appellant had, will be disoriented, confused, and have muscle incoordination. Defense counsel conceded in summation that the evidence proved appellant was intoxicated at the time of the accident. Because the evidence was overwhelming to establish aggravated involuntary manslaughter, evidence of the two DUI convictions could not have had any effect upon the guilt phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Admittedly, the two convictions would have affected the punishment stage; however, the Commonwealth was entitled to present evidence of appellant\u2019s prior convictions during the punishment stage. The Commonwealth introduced certified copies of appellant\u2019s convictions, including a 1986 felony conviction in Virginia for shooting or throwing a missile at an occupied dwelling; a 1993 driving under the influence conviction from Fairfax County; a 1994 driving under the influence conviction from Calvin County, Alabama, that included a conviction for possessing marijuana for personal use; a 1996 disorderly conduct conviction; a 1997 criminal mischief conviction involving property valued at less that $250; and a Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ary 7, 1997 driving under the influence conviction. In addition, appellant\u2019s driving records from Alabama and Virginia were introduced. Because abundant evidence was introduced to prove that appellant was intoxicated and because appellant\u2019s entire criminal record was admissible in the punishment phase for consideration by the jury, the introduction of the prior DUI convictions at an earlier stage was not prejudicial. Therefore, the admission of evidence of the Alabama and Virginia convictions of driving while intoxicated, under the circumstances of this case, was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">IV. MOTION TO STRIKE THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Appellant made a motion to strike the evidence, alleging that the evidence was: (A) insufficient to prove \u201cgross, wanton and culpable\u201d driving behavior; and (B) insufficient to prove a causal relationship between his driving and the death of Holmes.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">\u201cOn appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and grant to it all reasonable inferences therefrom.\u201d <em>Barlow v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 421, 428-29, 494 S.E.2d 901, 904 (1998). So viewed, the record discloses the following: (1) at the scene of the accident, Officer Lando detected a very strong odor of alcohol about appellant\u2019s person; (2) appellant did not perform field dexterity tests to the satisfaction of the police officer; (3) appellant took a breathalyzer test pursuant to the Virginia Implied Consent Law, and his test result showed a blood alcohol concentration of .22 grams per 210 liters of breath, almost three times the legal limit of .08; (4) Holmes\u2019 blood alcohol content was .13; (5) Dr. Anh Huynh, an expert in forensic toxicology, testified that .13% volume of alcohol means that in the three areas of vision, judgment, and ability to execute, the person would be a \u201clittle impaired\u201d; however, Dr. Huynh further opined that the difference between .13 and .22 is \u201cenormous\u201d and that the \u201ceffects at .22 alcohol in the blood would be even more impairment in terms of execution because of the incoordinations of the muscle\u201d and would produce \u201cdisorientation.\u201d According to Huynh, \u201cwhen you get more than .2,\u201d it is difficult to execute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>basic driving maneuvers. Dr. Huynh testified that appellant would have had to have consumed at least ten beers to reach a blood alcohol level of .22. Appellant originally informed the officer that he had consumed only three beers; (6) Officer J.S. Scalici testified that if appellant\u2019s truck had not hit the motorcycle at the point of impact, the truck would have traveled into oncoming traffic on Horner Road, indicating that he was \u201ccutting the corner\u201d in making the left turn; such a maneuver violates Code \u00a7 46.2-846, which requires left turns to be \u201cmade from the right half of the roadway and as close as possible to the roadway\u2019s center line where it enters an intersection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Commonwealth witnesses testified that Holmes had the green light. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to infer that appellant made the left turn on a red light or at least not on the green arrow. In fact, appellant admitted at trial that if westbound traffic on Occoquan Road had a green signal, there could have been no advance green arrow signaling eastbound traffic to turn left. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was competent, was not inherently incredible and was sufficient to prove appellant drove his vehicle in a \u201cgross, wanton and culpable\u201d manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Additionally, appellant contends that Holmes\u2019 conduct was the cause of the accident. The jury rejected this view of the evidence. In a prosecution brought under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1, the Commonwealth is required to prove \u201ca causal connection between the driver\u2019s intoxication and the death of another person.\u201d <em>Pollard v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 94, 99, 455 S.E.2d 283, 286 (1995). Generally, causation is an issue for the jury to decide. <em>See Forbes v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 304, 309, 498 S.E.2d 457, 459 (1998). The jury was instructed that the Commonwealth was required to prove \u201c[t]hat as a result of driving under the influence the defendant unintentionally caused the death of Wayne Holmes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The fact that Holmes had a blood alcohol concentration of .13 does not exonerate appellant. \u201c[Cjontributory negligence has no place in a case of involuntary manslaugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>ter.\u201d <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>170 Va. 597, 616, 195 S.E. 675, 683 (1938). \u201cOnly if the conduct of the decedent amounts to an independent, intervening act alone causing the fatal injury can the accused be exonerated from liability for his or her criminal negligence.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 1, 14, 413 S.E.2d 875, 882 (1992). The evidence does not support such a conclusion. Only if Holmes\u2019 conduct constituted the sole cause of the accident as a matter of law could the trial court strike the evidence. We hold that the trial court did not err in refusing to strike the evidence on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">V. JURY INSTRUCTION H</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Finally, appellant contends the trial court erred in rejecting his proffered Instruction H concerning the causal connection required to be shown between his intoxication and Holmes\u2019 death.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Without objection, the trial judge gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">Instruction No. 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">The defendant is charged with the crime of aggravated involuntary manslaughter. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">1. That the defendant was driving a motor vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">2. That at the time he was under the influence of alcohol; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">3. That as a result of driving under the influence the defendant unintentionally caused the death of Wayne Holmes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-13\">4. That the defendant\u2019s conduct was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-14\">If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the first three elements of the offense charged but you do not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s conduct was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>for human life then you shall find the defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter, but you shall not fix the punishment until your verdict has been returned and further evidence is heard by you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">If you find that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any of the above offenses, then you shall find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Appellant\u2019s tendered Instruction H only addressed element three, included in Instruction No. 3, above. The proffered instruction provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">Instruction No. H</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">The phrase \u201cas a result of driving under the influence ... causes the death,\u201d requires proof of causal connection between the driver\u2019s intoxication and the death of another person. Therefore, even if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was driving while intoxicated, he cannot be found guilty of either grade of involuntary manslaughter unless you also find, beyond a reasonable doubt a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s intoxication and the death of Wayne A. Holmes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">The causal connection required is a cause \u201cwhich in the natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produces the injury without which the' result would not have occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">When defense counsel tendered Instruction \u201cH,\u201d he stated that it explained what needed to be shown \u201cfor that one element \u2014 as a result of driving under the influence causing a death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney objected to the instruction. He stated that \u201cthe only reason that the defense wants this element emphasized is because that underscores the theory of their case.\u201d He further stated that the phrase \u201cas a result of\u2019 did not need any further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">The trial judge commented that it was a question of \u201cwhether you are emphasizing it or you are defining or clarifying it.\u201d Holding that Instruction H said the same thing that Instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tion No. 3 had already said, the trial judge found it redundant, and he refused the proffered instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\u201c[W]hen granted instructions fully and fairly cover a principle of law, the trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing another instruction relating to the same legal principle.\u201d <em>Stockton v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 145, 314 S.E.2d 371, 384, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873, 105 S.Ct. 229, 83 L.Ed.2d 158 (1984). <em>See also Cirios v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 292, 303-04, 373 S.E.2d 164, 170 (1988) (holding the same). \u201c[I]t is not desirable to multiply instructions. Moreover, any instruction that is given should relate to the specific evidence in the case, and should not incorrectly state the law or mislead the jury____ [T]he trial judge may properly refuse any instructions that are misleading or redundant.\u201d <em>Diffendal v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 417, 423, 382 S.E.2d 24, 26-27 (1989) (internal quotations and citations omitted). In the instant case, the trial court refused appellant\u2019s Instruction H. Significantly, appellant made no objection to Instruction No. 3 granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">In comparing the causation element, Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 uses the phrase: \u201cAs a result of driving under the influence in violation of subdivision (ii), (in), or (iv) of \u00a7 18.2-266, unintentionally causes the death of another person.\u201d Instruction No. 3 used the phrase \u201cthat as a result of driving under the influence defendant unintentionally caused the death of Wayne A. Holmes.\u201d The model jury instruction relating to the charge uses the phrase \u201cthat as a result of driving under the influence the defendant unintentionally caused the death of (name of person).\u201d II <em>Virginia Model Jury Instructions, Criminal </em>33.660 (1998 repl. ed.). Thus, the language used by the trial court substantially tracked the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 and the Virginia Model Jury Instructions. Instruction No. 3 adequately stated the elements of the offense. The elements of conduct punishable as involuntary manslaughter are precisely set forth by the General Assembly in Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>To the contrary, Instruction H did not provide the jury with the proper legal standard by which to determine causal connection. The proper legal standard for conduct punishable under Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 was established by the legislature in 1989, when they passed the statute. The standard was: any person who, <em>as a result of driving under the influence in violation of subdivision (ii), (Hi), or (iv) of \u00a7 18.2-266 unintentionally, causes the death of another person, </em>shall be guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The statute in clear and unmistakable terms requires proof of causation, nothing more, nothing less. In <em>Pollard, </em>20 Va.App. at 99, 455 S.E.2d at 286, we explained that Code \u00a7 18.2-36. l\u2019s \u201cvery language ... requires proof of causation,\u201d and \u201c[t]he phrase, \u2018as a result of driving under the influence ... causes the death,\u2019 requires proof of a causal connection between the driver\u2019s intoxication and the death of another person.\u201d <em>Pollard </em>correctly ruled that the language of the statute requires proof of causation. An instruction tracking the language in the statute is sufficient to require proof of causation. Thus, Instruction H was repetitious.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Instruction No. 3 given by the trial court, without objection from appellant, stated the correct elements of the offense charged and was a correct finding instruction setting forth all the issues fully and fairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Moreover, the last paragraph of Instruction H was improper. It is applicable to civil cases and was taken from I <em>Virginia Model Jury Instructions, Civil </em>5.000 (1998 repl. ed.). The actual model instruction begins with the words: \u201cA proximate cause of an accident, injury, or damage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In place of that phrase, appellant substituted in Instruction H the phrase \u201cthe causal connection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In <em>Hubbard, </em>the Supreme Court stated, \u201c[w]e think that by attempting to. inject inapplicable principles of civil negligence into a criminal trial, Instructions B and C would have created confusion and would have been misleading. Furthermore, they would have been duplicative.\u201d 243 Va. at 15, 413 S.E.2d at 882-83. The same is true of Instruction H. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the trial judge acted within his discretion when he rejected Instruction H.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated involuntary manslaughter, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b681-6\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAe\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Franklin Eugene Hall was indicted for aggravated involuntary manslaughter and tried by a jury. In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">A. Any person who, as a result of driving under the influence in violation of subdivision (ii), (iii), or (iv) of [Code] \u00a7 18.2-266, unintentionally causes the death of another person, shall be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">B. If, in addition, the conduct of the defendant was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life, he shall be guilty of aggravated involuntary manslaughter, a felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of not less than one nor more than twenty years, one year of which shall be a mandatory, minimum term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">\u201cThe statute\u2019s very language ... requires ... proof of a causal connection between the driver\u2019s intoxication and the death of another person.\u201d <em>Pollard v.

In his instructions the trial judge should inform the jury as to the law of the case applicable to the facts in such a manner that they may not be misled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-8\"><em>Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 497, 500, 345 S.E.2d 775, 777 (1986) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">I would hold that the trial judge erred in refusing to give Hall\u2019s proposed instruction. The trial judge did \u201cnot [say Hall\u2019s] statement of the law is wrong.\u201d Instead, the trial judge ruled that Hall\u2019s instruction was redundant of the following instruction, offered by the Commonwealth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-10\">The defendant is charged with the crime of aggravated involuntary manslaughter. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-11\">1. That the defendant was driving a motor vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>2.

That as a result of driving under the influence the defendant unintentionally caused the death of Wayne Holmes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">4. That the defendant\u2019s conduct was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the above elements of the offense as charged, then you shall find the defendant guilty, but you shall not fix the punishment until your verdict has been returned and further evidence is heard by you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the first three elements of the offense as charged but you do not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s conduct was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life then you shall find the defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter, but you shall not fix the punishment until your verdict has been returned and further evidence is heard by you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">If you find that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any of the above offenses, then you shall find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">The principle is well established that \u201c[e]ach party is entitled to have jury instructions upon vital points in language chosen by it, if the instruction is a correct statement of the law.\u201d <em>Broady v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 281, 291, 429 S.E.2d 468, 474 (1993); <em>see also Jeffress v. Virginia Ry. &amp; Power Co., </em>127 Va. 694, 714, 104 S.E. 393, 399 (1920). Thus, \u201cwhen a principle of law is vital to a defendant in a criminal case, a trial court has an affirmative duty properly to instruct a jury about the matter.\u201d <em>Jimenez v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 250, 402 S.E.2d 678, 681 (1991). The principle is equally well established that it is error not to instruct the jury on a point at issue when the jury may make findings based upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>mistaken belief of the law. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 4, 7, 235 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1977) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Hall\u2019s defense was that the motorcyclist\u2019s own actions were the proximate cause of his death. Because there was evidence from which the jury could have found that Hall turned when he had a green arrow, the issue of causal connection between Hall\u2019s intoxication and the accident was a significant issue for the jury to resolve. Yet, the finding instruction the Commonwealth offered and the trial judge gave the jury sparingly stated that an element of the offense is \u201c[t]hat as a result of driving under the influence [Hall] unintentionally caused the death.\u201d The instruction tendered by Hall was explanatory of this instruction and would have provided the jury the proper legal standard by which to determine the required causal connection. It was a more complete statement of the phrase, \u201cas a result of driving,\u201d and was intended to inform the jury that the law requires more than mere proof that Hall was driving while intoxicated to establish a causal connection to the death. Thus, Hall\u2019s instruction was appropriate and warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Indeed, the trial judge clearly recognized that other portions of the finding instruction were inadequate and gave instructions explaining to the jury two of the finding instruction\u2019s concepts. The jury was instructed concerning the phrase, \u201cunder the influence of alcohol,\u201d which is referenced in the second paragraph of the finding instruction. The trial judge told the jury that \u201c[a] person is under the influence of alcohol if he has drunk enough alcoholic beverages to so affect his manner, disposition, speech, muscular movement, general appearance or behavior as to be apparent to observation.\u201d In addition, the judge elaborated on the fourth paragraph of the finding instruction by informing the jury that \u201c[g]ross or culpable and wanton conduct is that which indicates a callous disregard of human life and of the probable consequences of that conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Hall was no less entitled to have the jury fully instructed as to the requirements of a causal connection. The third para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>graph of the finding instruction clearly did not adequately convey the requirement of causal connection. The refused instruction, as were these other clarifying instructions, was more explanatory and a fuller explication of the finding instruction. Indeed, the refused instruction was essential to properly inform the jury concerning the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Furthermore, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney rendered Hall\u2019s proposed instruction even more important when he told the jury the following in his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">[A]s a result of being under the influence, [Hall] unintentionally caused the death of Mr. Holmes. Is there any doubt about that? He didn\u2019t set out that day to kill Mr. Holmes, but it was the instrumentality that he was operating while he was drunk that killed Mr. Holmes and there isn\u2019t any question about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Without Hall\u2019s proposed instruction, the jury could easily have failed to understand that to find Hall guilty of involuntary manslaughter, they had to find that his inebriation caused the accident, not just that he happened to be \u201cdrunk\u201d when the accident occurred. For these reasons, I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that the finding instruction adequately stated the elements of the offense. Accordingly, I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The majority opinion also holds that the last paragraph of Hall\u2019s proposed instruction was improper because it was derived from civil model jury instructions. In so finding, the majority relies on <em>Hubbard v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 1, 413 S.E.2d 875 (1992). <em>Hubbard, </em>however, does not stand for the principle that language which properly defines a criminal law concept is improper simply because it is drawn from a civil jury instruction. The Supreme Court rejected Hubbard\u2019s proposed jury instructions because they inappropriately injected definitions of civil negligence in a case concerning criminal negligence. <em>See id. </em>at 15, 413 S.E.2d at 882-83 (holding \u201cthat by attempting to inject inapplicable principles of civil negligence into a criminal trial, Instructions B and C would have created confusion and would have been misleading\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Hall merely relied on the applicable language from a civil instruction for definitional support of a concept that is pertinent in both criminal and civil cases. Significantly, the trial judge did not rule that Hall\u2019s proposed instruction misstated the law. Likewise, the Commonwealth does not suggest that the instruction is an incorrect statement of the required causal relationship or that it would mislead the jury. Instead, the trial judge ruled, and the Commonwealth argues, that the instruction is improper because it is redundant and that Hall offered the instruction to \u201cunderscore[ ] the theory of [his] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Hall\u2019s theory of the case, however, was that the jury should be instructed upon \u201csuch language ... [as was] in keeping with the law.\u201d <em>Jeffress, </em>127 Va. at 714, 104 S.E. at 399. None of the instructions told the jury the Commonwealth had to prove a <em>causal connection between Hall\u2019s inebriation and the death of Holmes. </em>As the majority opinion notes, <em>Pollard </em>\u201ccorrectly\u201d held that Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 requires proof of causation. <em>See </em>20 Va.App. at 99, 455 S.E.2d at 286 (holding that the language of the statute clearly \u201crequires ... proof of a causal connection between the driver\u2019s intoxication and the death of another person\u201d). \u201cIt is elementary that a jury must be informed as to the essential elements of the offense; a correct statement of the law is one of the essentials of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Darnell, </em>6 Va.App. at 488, 370 S.E.2d at 719 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">I agree with the majority opinion that the trial judge erred in allowing the introduction in the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief of testimony regarding Hall\u2019s prior convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol. I disagree, however, that other admissible evidence, proving Hall had been drinking, overshadowed the effect of the improperly admitted evidence. The uncontested evidence in the record proved that Hall\u2019s blood alcohol content measured .22 when tested at the police station. Although the evidence clearly proved that Hall had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>been drinking, it did not clearly prove that Hall\u2019s drinking caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The evidence in the record concerning the cause of the accident was disputed. The testimony of several witnesses who had no connection to either Hall or the motorcyclist provided a basis upon which the jury could have determined that Hall turned at a time when he was privileged to do so. No evidence proved that Hall was speeding or driving recklessly prior to the accident. Indeed, the evidence indicated Hall was stopped at the intersection ready to turn, seconds before the accident. The evidence also proved that the motorcyclist that collided with Hall in the intersection had a blood alcohol concentration of .18, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Proof that Hall had prior suspensions and convictions for driving under the influence could have led the jury to conclude that Hall was driving with a reckless disregard for human life in this instance. This inadmissible evidence was unduly prejudicial because it had the tendency to affect the manner in which the jury viewed the credibility of Hall and the witnesses who testified that the accident had another cause. It was not harmless because we \u201ccan[not] conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (en banc). \u201cWhile the other evidence amply supports the jury\u2019s verdicts, the disputed testimony may well have affected the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Cartera v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978). Thus, the probative value of the improper evidence clearly did not outweigh its incidental prejudice. <em>See Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 141-42, 495 S.E.2d 489, 492-93 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Finally, I agree with the majority that the trial judge erred in admitting the results of the \u201calco-sensor\u201d breath alcohol test. For all these reasons, I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
