Farmer (appellee), arising from appellee\u2019s alleged failure to comply with an \u201cAdministrative [Child] Support Order.\u201d In adjudicating the motion, the court determined that appellee was not the father of the child, vacated the order, and relieved appellee from all accrued arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The Division appeals, arguing on brief that the court was without \u201cstatutory authority\u201d to entertain a collateral attack on the order and \u201cretroactively modify\u201d its terms at \u201ca show cause hearing.\u201d The Division further contended that the court erroneously determined that Diana L. Breakiron (mother) had fraudulently identified appellee as father of the child, \u201cbased solely upon genetic test results\u201d and \u201cwithout allowing any testimony\u201d on the issue. Finding the Division proeedurally barred from challenging the court\u2019s prospective vacation of the order, but agreeing that the retroactive discharge of accrued arrearages was error, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The pertinent facts, before this Court on a \u201cWritten Statement of Facts,\u201d are uncontroverted. On July 12, 1995, Diana L. Breakiron gave birth to D. Shortly thereafter, on July 31, 1995, appellee executed a \u201cDeclaration of Paternity\u201d and related \u201cParental Rights and Responsibilities Statement,\u201d acknowledging, under oath, that he fathered D. Also on July 31, the Division entered an \u201cAdministrative Support Order\u201d (ASO) in accordance with Code \u00a7 63.1-249, <em>et seq., </em>which \u201cobligated\u201d appellee, in pertinent part, to pay child support of $65 per month to the Commonwealth, through the Division, as reimbursement for Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) benefits to mother, as \u201cCustodial Parent\u201d of D. On August 21, 1995, the Division entered a revised ASO, which increased appellee\u2019s monthly support obligation to $241.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Appellee waived \u201cformal service\u201d of the initial ASO and was properly served with the second order. Both expressly advised appellee of his right to \u201cobject to [the] order,\u201d receive an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>administrative \u201cappeal hearing\u201d and, if aggrieved by the resulting \u201cdecision,\u201d pursue \u201can appeal <em>de novo </em>to the [J &amp; D] court,\u201d specifying the procedures necessary to such remedies. Each ASO also notified appellee that the subject \u201cobligation^] and arrears\u201d were \u201cconsidered legally established\u201d and \u201ccreate[d] a judgment by operation of law.\u201d Appellee appealed neither order, and both became \u201ceffective\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 63.1-252.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">On or about January 30, 1997, the Division filed a \u201cMotion for Show Cause Summons\u201d in the Gloucester County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (J &amp; D court), alleging that the court \u201cshould ... imprison! ], fine! ] or otherwise punish! ]\u201d appellee for non-compliance with the revised ASO, with an accrued arrearage of $3,446.69, and requesting the \u201cissuance of a show cause\u201d against him. In response, the J &amp; D court issued a summons requiring appellee to appear on a date specified and \u201cshow cause, if any,\u201d in defense of the Division\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Appellee appeared before the J <em>&amp; </em>D court at the scheduled hearing, denied that he was the father of the child, and requested \u201cDNA blood testing.\u201d The court granted father\u2019s motion and recessed the hearing pending completion of the necessary procedures and receipt of the attendant report. The hearing re-convened on June 23, 1997, and the test results, received into evidence, disclosed that appellee was <em>\u201cnot </em>the biological father of [D].\u201d Accordingly, the court dismissed the show cause and vacated the alleged arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The Division appealed to the trial court and, at a related hearing on October 15, 1997, \u201cadvised the court that the issue on appeal was whether [appellee] was responsible for arrears that accrued from the entry of the [ASO] until the determination he was not the biological father\u201d of D. The Division conceded that appellee was not the father but disputed that mother had committed \u201ca fraud\u201d in naming him. Nevertheless, the court declined the Division\u2019s request to present testimony on the issue, and the Division proffered no evidence for the record. The various documentary proofs, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>reported test results, were received into evidence, and the court, after finding that appellee was not the father of the child and that mother had \u201ccommitted a fraud upon the court,\u201d vacated the ASO, expressly relieving appellee from all related arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">On appeal to this Court, the Division complains that the trial court, acting only upon the Division\u2019s \u201cmotion to show cause,\u201d lacked authority to, at once, vacate the existing ASO and forgive accrued arrearages. Further, the Division contends that the court erroneously determined the mother \u201chad committed fraud based solely on the ... test results that excluded [appellee] as the child\u2019s father,\u201d without permitting additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Code \u00a7 63.1-249 declares \u201cit ... the purpose of [Chapter 13, Title 63.1] to promote the efficient and accurate collection, accounting and receipt of support for financially dependent children and their custodians, and to further the effective and timely enforcement of such support.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, Code \u00a7 63.1-250.1(A) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]n the absence of a court order, the Department of Social Services shall have the authority to issue [an ASO] directing the payment of child ... support[.]\u201d \u201cThe [Division] shall initiate [such] proceedings by issuing notice containing the [ASO],\u201d which \u201cshall be served upon the debtor,\u201d and the ASO \u201cshall become effective unless timely contested\u201d by \u201canswer\u201d and related \u201cadministrative hearing.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.1-252.1. A party aggrieved by \u201cthe decision of the hearing officer\u201d may appeal, <em>de novo, </em>\u201cto the [J <em>&amp; </em>D court] of the jurisdiction wherein appellant resides.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.1-268.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">An ASO \u201cshall have the same force and effect as a court order.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.1-258.3; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 63.1-250. However, \u201c[t]he existence of an [ASO] shall not preclude either an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>obligor or obligee from commencing appropriate proceedings in a [J &amp; D court] or a circuit court,\u201d Code \u00a7 63.1-252.1, and \u201cany order issued by a court of this Commonwealth super-cedes an administrative order.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.1-258.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u201c[I]t is generally held that \u2018[i]n the absence of fraud, accident or surprise, a judgment, when entered and no appeal taken, is conclusive, even though the judgment is manifestly wrong in law or fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slagle v. Slagle, </em>11 Va.App. 341, 346, 398 S.E.2d 346, 349 (1990) (citation omitted). However, \u201ca judgment obtained by \u2018intrinsic fraud\u2019 is ... voidable and can be challenged ... by direct appeal or by a direct attack in an independent proceeding.\u201d <em>Peet v. Peet, </em>16 Va.App. 323, 326, 429 S.E.2d 487, 490 (1993) (citations omitted); <em>see Slagle, </em>11 Va.App. at 348, 398 S.E.2d at 350. \u201c \u2018Intrinsic fraud\u2019 includes perjury ... or other means of obscuring facts presented before the court and whose truth or falsity as to the issues being litigated are passed upon by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Peet, </em>16 Va.App. at 326-27, 429 S.E.2d at 490. A party must act immediately upon the discovery of intrinsic fraud \u201cto rectify the alleged wrong and cannot wait to assail the judgment collaterally whenever it is enforced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 429 S.E.2d at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">However, the statutory scheme investing the Division with authority to \u201cissue\u201d an ASO clearly contemplates a command of less dignity than a judicially countenanced support order. Code \u00a7 63.1-252.1 expressly preserves the right of either an \u201cobligor or obligee\u201d of an ASO to, at any time during the \u201cexistence\u201d of such order, commence \u201cappropriate proceedings\u201d in a J &amp; D or circuit court. Commensurate with the parties\u2019 right to access the judiciary, Code \u00a7 63.1-258.3 subordinates an ASO to \u201cany order issued by a court of this Commonwealth.\u201d Thus, an ASO remains always vulnerable to displacement by a superceding judicial act and both the obligor and obligee are entitled to initiate proceedings to obtain such relief, without the necessity of proving fraud, accident or surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The instant record clearly discloses that appellee commenced no proceedings in either the J <em>&amp; </em>D or trial court to right any wrong that allegedly inhered in the subject ASO, but relied instead upon a collateral attack in defense of the Division\u2019s enforcement procedures. Nevertheless, the J <em>&amp; </em>D court entertained appellee\u2019s procedurally flawed attack on the ASO, determining that appellee did not father the child, based upon the paternity testing, and vacated the ASO, discharging the arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">On appeal to the trial court, the Division conceded that appellee was not the father and \u201cadvised the court that <em>the </em>issue on appeal was whether [appellee] was responsible for <em>arrears </em>that accrued from the entry of the [ASO] until the determination he was not the biological father of the child.\u201d (Emphasis added). Moreover, the record does not disclose a proper objection by the Division when the court also <em>prospectively vacated </em>the ASO. The \u201cWritten Statement of Facts\u201d recites no objection by the Division to such ruling, and objections appended by the Division to the final order address only the retroactive discharge of arrears, and related evidentiary issues.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cA matter not in dispute before the trial court will not-be considered for the first time on appeal[.]\u201d <em>Connelly v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 888, 891, 420 S.E.2d 244, 246 (1992) (citing Rule 5A:18). Thus, we decline to address the Division\u2019s challenge to that portion of the order prospectively vacating the ASO. <em>See Aviles v. Aviles, </em>14 Va.App. 360, 364, 416 S.E.2d 716, 718 (1992) (court may entertain procedurally defective attack on decree, absent proper objection).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">With respect to the remainder of the order, which relieved appellee from arrears that had accrued from the entry of the ASO, the Division correctly argues that he failed to appeal the ASO at the inception, and, thereafter, did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>commence an \u201cappropriate [judicial] proceeding\u201d to supercede the order. Under such circumstances, appellee\u2019s collateral attack in defense of Division efforts to enforce the arrears was ill founded, and the court erred in retroactively discharging the accrued obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the trial court that vacates the ASO prospectively, but reverse the discharge of arrearages previously accrued and remand the proceedings for determination of such issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\n<em>Affirmed, in part, reversed and remanded, in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">. We have previously determined that the statutory ASO scheme satisfies due process. <em>See Morris v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>13 Va.App. 77, 408 S.E.2d 588 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\">. The Division also failed to proffer for the record any evidence that was precluded by the disputed rulings. We, therefore, have \" 'no basis to decide whether the evidence was admissible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zelenak v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 295, 302, 487 S.E.2d 873, 876 (1997) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
