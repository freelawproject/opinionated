(collectively employer) appeal an award of temporary total disability benefits to Howard Flenner (claimant), upon his change of condition application. Employer contends that the award is barred by Code \u00a7 65.2-510 and, moreover, is unsupported by the evidence. Claimant cross-appeals, complaining that the commission erroneously construed Code \u00a7 65.2-510 to preclude temporary partial disability compensation, following the award of temporary total disability benefits. Agreeing both with the commission\u2019s application of the statute and the award of benefits to claimant, we affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">Claimant suffered an industrial injury on September 2, 1995. Employer accepted the resulting claim as compensable, and claimant received temporary total disability benefits. On April 8, 1996, Dr. David Biondi, a neurologist, released claimant to restricted work, but claimant refused employer\u2019s offer of selective employment, prompting employer to request the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>commission to terminate benefits. On August 20, 1996, the commission granted employer relief, effective April 12, 1996, noting that \u201cclaimant conceded that he refused the selective employment due to physical problems unrelated to the work injury\u201d and had \u201coffered no ... justification\u201d for his conduct. Claimant did not appeal the decision or cure such refusal within six months of April 12,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On May 7, 1997, claimant filed the instant application with the commission, alleging a change of condition and seeking temporary <em>total </em>disability benefits, commencing February 24, 1997, through October 13, 1997, with temporary partial benefits thereafter. Employer asserted Code \u00a7 65.2-510<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as an absolute bar to relief and, also, challenged the claim on the merits. Claimant countered that the statute was inapplicable both to a <em>total </em>disability that occurred after an unjustified refusal of selective employment and to a subsequent <em>partial </em>disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Following consideration of the record and arguments on appeal, the commission determined that claimant had suffered a temporary total disability after his unjustified refusal of selective employment and awarded attendant benefits, reasoning that the bar of Code \u00a7 65.2-510 is inapplicable to a subsequent total disability. However, the commission further concluded that the statute precluded benefits for any subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>quent <em>partial </em>disability and denied such claim. Both employer and claimant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\"><em>Employer\u2019s Appeal, </em>Record No. 2152-99-1</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">While the instant appeal was pending in this Court, we decided, in <em>Southwest Virginia Tire, Inc., et al. v. Bryant, </em>31 Va.App. 655, 525 S.E.2d 563 (2000), that \u201cCode \u00a7 65.2-510 does not have any bearing upon a change-in-condition application for an employee who becomes totally disabled as a result of the industrial injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659-60, 525 S.E.2d at 565. Thus, the commission correctly ruled that the statute does not bar the disputed award, upon proof of a change in condition resulting in temporary total disability, notwithstanding claimant\u2019s failure to cure the earlier unjustified refusal of selective employment within six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Employer, however, also contends that claimant\u2019s evidence failed to prove a total disability for the period in issue. \u201cFollowing established principles, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). \u201cFactual findings of the commission that are supported by credible evidence are conclusive and binding upon this Court on appeal.\u201d <em>Southern Iron Works, Inc. v. Wallace, </em>16 Va.App. 131, 134, 428 S.E.2d 32, 34 (1993). \u201cIf there is evidence, or reasonable inferences can be drawn from the evidence, to support the Commission\u2019s findings, they will not be disturbed on review, even though there is evidence in the record to support a contrary finding.\u201d <em>Morris v. Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>3 Va.App. 276, 279, 348 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1986). \u201cThis rule applies when an expert\u2019s opinion contains internal conflict.\u201d <em>Greif Companies/Genesco, Inc. v. Hensley, </em>22 Va.App. 546, 552, 471 S.E.2d 803, 806 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">In awarding claimant temporary total disability benefits, the commission reviewed the deposition of Dr. Robert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Hansen, a neurologist, together with the related reports, notes and correspondence of Dr. David Biondi and Dr. Kerri L. Wilkes, a \u201cheadache specialist.\u201d While we concur in the commission\u2019s observation that \u201cit is difficult to determine Dr. Hansen\u2019s true opinion about claimant\u2019s ability to work,\u201d we, also agree that sufficient evidence established a total disability for the period.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">On April 18,1997, Dr. Hansen noted that claimant had not been cleared to return to work. He has been felt in the past, both by Dr. Biondi and by myself, to have achieved maximal medical improvement (MMI).... I think it is appropriate ... to have an FCE [Functional Capacity Evaluation] performed. Return to work recommendation can be generated on the basis of the FCE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Dr. Hansen further recorded, on April 30, 1997, that claimant had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">been followed ... for some time with axial pain and headaches---- The pain has been very difficult to control. Recently, he has had more pain and headaches ... [and] was deemed by me to be unable to return to work, as of 2/24/97, because of the problems____ At the present time, [he] is not able to return to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Following the FCE, Dr. Wilkes released claimant to work on July 3, 1997, and Dr. Hansen \u201cdeferred\u201d to such recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Thus, despite a sometimes contradictory deposition by Dr. Hansen, a review of the entire record provides sufficient support for the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\"><em>Claimant\u2019s Appeal, </em>Record No. 2229-99-1</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">It is uncontroverted that the commission previously terminated claimant\u2019s original award of disability benefits, effective April 12, 1996, upon a finding that he refused selective employment without justification. Subject to certain exceptions not pertinent to the instant proceedings, Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u00a7 65.2-510(A) provides for the termination of benefits to an \u201cinjured employee refusing] employment procured for him suitable to his capacity.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C) prevents an injured employee from curing an unjustified refusal of selective employment that \u201clasts more than six months from the last day for which compensation was paid before suspension pursuant to this section[.]\u201d Thus, when claimant failed to cure his unjustified refusal of selective employment on or before October 12, 1996, his right to cure and pursue reinstatement of partial disability benefits was lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Claimant\u2019s contention that Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C) does not operate to bar the restoration of partial disability benefits following an intervening period of compensable total disability is without merit. The commission correctly applied Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C) to deny claimant renewed partial disability benefits, reasoning that \u201can employee who did not cure an unjustified refusal within six months forever loses the right to additional temporary partial benefits.... \u201d This result comports with the \u201cunambiguous, ... plain meaning\u201d of Code \u00a7 65.2-510(C), and we need not \u201cresort to the rules of statutory construction\u201d to divine legislative intent. <em>Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Med., </em>14 Va.App. 906, 910, 421 S.E.2d 201, 205 (1992). Contrary to claimant\u2019s argument, the statute does not exempt his \u201crefusal for medical reasons\u201d or establish distinctions between degrees of partial incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-510 provides, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">A. If an injured employee refuses employment procured for him <em>suitable to his capacity, </em>he shall only be entitled to the benefits provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-503 [permanent loss] and 65.2-603 [employer's duty to furnish medical care], ... during the continuance of such refusal, unless in the opinion of the Commission such refusal was justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">$ $ * $ * $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">C. A <em>cure of unjustified refusal pursuant to subsection A may not be established if the unjustified refusal lasts more than six months </em>from the last day for which compensation was paid before suspension pursuant to this section; however, the six-month period may be extended by the number of days a claimant is totally disabled if the disability commenced during such six-month period....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
