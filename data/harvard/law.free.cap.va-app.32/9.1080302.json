We disagree and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">When reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we must consider all of the evidence and reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). A conviction will be affirmed unless it appears from the evidence that the lower court\u2019s judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 502, 505, 297 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">On February 26, 1998, John Metcalf, an eighteen-year-old student at Pimmit Hills High School in Fairfax County, and a friend beat Markie Bowen and Cham Choup at a convenience store. The next day, Friday, February 27, 1998, Michael Choup, Cham\u2019s brother, called appellant and his brother, Sadat Sheikh, and told them about the fight and that \u201ctwo white guys\u201d were responsible. Appellant and the Choups were all members of the TRG gang. Appellant was \u201cone of the head guys\u201d in the gang. Appellant and his brother then called several other gang members to beat Metcalf and his friend. The group assembled at the Choups\u2019 house where they planned an assault on Metcalf and his friend. They left the Choups\u2019 home together in appellant\u2019s brother\u2019s car and in a green Rodeo driven by Peter Hanvinehed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The gang members drove to Pimmit Hills High School looking for their intended victims. They wore blue bandannas over their faces and were armed with bats and sticks. Once they arrived at Pimmit Hills High School, Markie Bowen, one of the participants in the previous day\u2019s fight with Metcalf, ran out and told the gang members, \u201cthe guy\u2019s here, he\u2019s coming.\u201d Appellant got out of his brother\u2019s car and into the back seat of the Rodeo behind the driver, Hanvinehed. Michael Choup was riding in the front passenger\u2019s seat and Markie Bowen got in next to appellant in the back and behind Choup. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>told Michael Choup that when Metcalf came out, \u201cWe\u2019re going to bang him up.\u201d Appellant planned to \u201cjump out and start whipping his ass with the bat....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Metcalf came out of the school and got into seventeen-year-old David Albrecht\u2019s Monte Carlo. Albrecht was a friend from school who agreed to give Metcalf a ride home. Metcalf had explained to Albrecht earlier that gang members might be looking to retaliate for the prior day\u2019s incident. When Metcalf saw the gang members in appellant\u2019s brother\u2019s car, wearing the bandannas, he and Albrecht drove from the high school to try and \u201close them.\u201d Only the Rodeo was able to keep up with Albrecht\u2019s car. During the gang\u2019s pursuit of Metcalf and Albrecht, Michael Choup repeatedly said, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill this mother f- \u2014 -, I\u2019m going to kill him\u201d and that he was going to \u201ccap\u201d Metcalf. Appellant, in a later statement to Detective Robert Murphy, stated that he understood from Choup\u2019s statements that Choup had a \u201cstrap\u201d or a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">At about 12:30 p.m., fifteen minutes after the cars left Pimmit Hills High School, Albrecht drove up to the back doors of George C. Marshall High School in Fairfax County so Metcalf could run into the back of the school. Hanvinched pulled within five feet of the passenger side of the Monte Carlo. Choup pulled out a thirty-eight-inch pump rifle. Hanvinched leaned back so Choup could get a clear shot. Choup fired at least three times into the Monte Carlo. Metcalf ducked down and was unharmed, but one of the shots fatally struck Albrecht on the right side of his head. In his statement to the police, appellant said he knew Albrecht had been shot and that he told Choup, \u201cYou got your revenge now. Let\u2019s get the f\u2014 out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">On the evening of March 1, 1998, after listening to a taped statement given by Michael Choup that \u201cimplicated him by name,\u201d appellant gave a statement to Detective Robert Murphy of the Fairfax County Police Department describing his actions and those of his fellow gang members that culminated in Albrecht\u2019s killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>II. <em>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Sheikh does not dispute that a \u201cmob\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-38 had formed for the purpose of physically assaulting Metcalf. Additionally, Sheikh does not question the application of the transferred intent doctrine. Rather, Sheikh maintains the evidence is insufficient to prove he was a member of the mob that killed Albrecht because he did not share Choup\u2019s intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-41 states: \u201cAny and every person composing a mob which shall maliciously or unlawfully shoot, stab, cut or wound any person, or by any means cause him bodily injury with intent to maim, disable, disfigure or kill him, shall be guilty of a Glass 3 felony.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-38 defines \u201cmob\u201d as \u201cany collection of people, assembled for the purpose and with the intention of committing an assault or a battery upon any person----\u201d There is no requirement that the \u201cmob\u201d agree on the manner or nature of such assault or battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">In <em>Harrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 1, 396 S.E.2d 680 (1990), we held that \u201c[t]he statutory definition of a mob requires that the act of assembling be done for a specific purpose and with a specific intent \u2014 to commit an assault or a battery without lawful authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 396 S.E.2d at 682. In <em>Harrell, </em>we decided that a mob had never, in fact, formed where a group of about twenty lingering party guests congregated outside a neighboring house. <em>See id. </em>at 11, 396 S.E.2d at 684-85. Thus, when one person committed a battery upon the party\u2019s host and his neighbor, \u201c[t]here [was] no chain of circumstances establishing, ... that after [the first victim] was struck the assault [on the second victim] was any more than an offense committed by one aggressive individual from among a boisterous crowd.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 396 S.E.2d at 685. Accordingly, we found the evidence insufficient to convict under a mob action theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">The evidence here, however, proved that the purpose of appellant\u2019s meeting with other gang members was to assault Metcalf. There is no dispute as to the intentions of the group. Appellant, in his statement to Detective Murphy, said, \u201cwe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>talked out a plan saying we were going to go up there and jump this guy,____ We were going to jump them, you know, beat the s\u2014 out of them, f\u2014 their faces up and s\u2014 because they f \u2014 ed my boy\u2019s face up. Then we went up there.\u201d Appellant himself planned to \u201cjump out and start whipping [Metcalfs] ass with the bat....\u201d The evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Sheikh intended to physically assault Metcalf and joined a mob that shared the same intent. Appellant knew that Choup had a rifle and knew of Ghoup\u2019s repeated statements of intent to kill or \u201ccap\u201d Metcalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Finding the evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
