Robert Lane (\u201chusband\u201d) cross-appeals, contending the trial court erred by finding that the parties\u2019 circumstances did not warrant either reduction or termination of spousal support and in denying his motion to do so on that ground. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the trial court erred in finding the parties\u2019 spousal support agreement subject to modification, but we affirm its decision denying husband\u2019s petition to modify his support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">The parties were divorced by decree of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County in 1988. There was no equitable distribution hearing. Instead, counsel for the parties, but not the parties themselves, signed a final decree of divorce which incorporated by reference some of the terms to which the parties had agreed in their settlement agreement. The final decree stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that husband\u2019s spousal support obligation would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>remain in effect until the death of either of the parties or until wife\u2019s remarriage. The final decree provided further that wife would receive thirty percent of husband\u2019s retirement pay, but it made no provision for the distribution of any other property. It contained no express waivers. The final decree was entered on December 13, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The parties entered into a subsequent agreement memorialized in a consent decree on March 14, 1989, which increased the level of spousal support from $300 per month to $500 per month. On September 3, 1997, husband petitioned to have his support obligation terminated on grounds of materi\u00e1l change in circumstances. The trial court concluded that husband\u2019s spousal support obligation was subject to modification under Code \u00a7 20-109(A), but determined that no reduction or termination of support was justified by the changes in circumstances proven by husband. Although the court found that the circumstances of both parties had changed since the final decree was entered, it concluded that husband\u2019s financial status remained \u201cmuch better\u201d than the financial status of the wife. The court therefore denied husband\u2019s petition for termination or modification of support.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Wife noted her objection to the court\u2019s ruling that the spousal support was subject to the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-109(A) allowing modification of the award and that Code \u00a7 20-109(B) did not apply. Husband noted objections to the court\u2019s ruling as well, contending the court erroneously applied the standards of Code \u00a7 20-107.1 in denying his petition for modification of his support obligation. Wife noted her appeal to this Court, and husband cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">As written in 1988, Code \u00a7 20-109(C)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>[I]f a stipulation or contract signed by the party to whom such relief might otherwise be awarded is filed before entry of a final decree, no decree or order directing the payment of support and maintenance for the spouse, suit money, or counsel fee or establishing or imposing any other condition or consideration, monetary or nonmonetary, shall be entered except in accordance with that stipulation or contract. If such a stipulation or contract is filed after entry of a final decree and if any party so moves, the court shall modify its decree to conform to such stipulation or contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The Virginia Supreme Court has defined stipulation to mean \u201can agreement between counsel respecting business before a court.\u201d <em>Burke v. Gale, </em>193 Va. 130, 137, 67 S.E.2d 917, 920 (1951). In order to constitute a stipulation, an agreement between the parties incorporated into their final decree need only have been signed by their counsel. <em>See id. </em>Such stipulations or agreements cannot be modified. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cIf the stipulation was agreed to there can be no objection to it.\u201d); Code \u00a7 20-109. <em>Cf. Kunz v. Jarnigan, </em>25 Ark.App. 221, 756 S.W.2d 913, 915 (1988) (stipulation constituting a complete settlement of the parties\u2019 marital rights held not modifiable). However, Code \u00a7 20-109(C) is clear in its requirement that an agreement between the parties, whether by stipulation or by contract, be signed by the \u201cparty to whom such relief might ... be awarded,\u201d in order for the terms of the agreement to become non-modifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The final decree was signed by neither party. Thus, according to the plain language of Code \u00a7 20-109, no agreement or stipulation was established by the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">However, the parties\u2019 subsequent consent decree meets the requirements of Code \u00a7 20-109 and constitutes a stipulation as contemplated by the statute. It is a \u201ccontract or agreement,\u201d <em>Orlandi v. Orlandi </em>23 Va.App. 21, 26, 473 S.E.2d 716, 719 (1996), signed by wife, the party seeking relief under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Durrett v. Durrett, </em>204 Va. 59, 63, 129 S.E.2d 50, 53 (1963) (\u201c \u2018A consent decree is a contract or agreement between the parties to the suit, entered of record in the cause with the consent of the court, and is binding unless secured by fraud or mistake.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Barnes v. American Fertilizer Co., </em>144 Va. 692, 720, 130 S.E. 902, 911 (1925))). As the parties\u2019 consent decree was filed after the entry of the properly signed final decree by agreement of the parties, it becomes the governing agreement between the parties, <em>see Parrillo v. Parrillo, </em>1 Va.App. 226, 230-31, 336 S.E.2d 23, 25-26 (1985), and pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109 its provisions regarding support cannot be modified. We, accordingly, find the trial court erred in ruling to the contrary and reverse its decision that the spousal support award was subject to modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Because the agreement incorporated into the consent decree is not subject to modification under Code \u00a7 20-109, we reject husband\u2019s claim that the trial court erred by not reducing or eliminating his support obligation. Given the non-modifiable status of the spousal support obligation, the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition to modify his support obligation was not erroneous. \u201c We do not hesitate ... where the correct conclusion has been reached but the wrong reason given, to sustain the result and assign the right ground.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beverly Health and Rehab. Servs., Inc. v. Metcalf, </em>24 Va.App. 584, 596, 484 S.E.2d 156, 162 (1997) (quoting <em>Robbins v. Grimes, </em>211 Va. 97, 100, 175 S.E.2d 246, 248 (1970)). Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to deny husband\u2019s requested support modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>Reversed in part and affirmed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\">. The trial court appears to have relied on the current language of Code \u00a7 20-109, although in 1988 the statute was not subdivided. However, the governing language from the 1988 statute is identical to that of the statute in its present form. The parties have adopted the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>references to those subparts, and we follow suit herein for ease of reference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">. The statute\u2019s reference to the \"party to whom such relief might otherwise be awarded\u201d signifies the payee party, who, but for the existence of the property settlement agreement, would be entitled to claim spousal support under Code \u00a7 20-107.1. Contrary to husband\u2019s assertions, it is irrelevant that husband did not sign the consent decree, because only wife may be deemed the \"party to whom such relief might otherwise be awarded\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-109. <em>See Lindsay </em>v. <em>Lindsay, </em>218 Va. 599, 602-03, 238 S.E.2d 817, 818-19 (1977) (payee ex-spouse was \"party to whom relief might otherwise be awarded\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-109, and was entitled to seek enforcement of consent decree modifying support award included in earlier final decree of divorce).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b175-6\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AzZ\">concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">In determining whether spousal support ordered in a final decree of divorce is modifiable, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-109(A), the trial judge must distinguish between (1) court ordered support decreed pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.1 and (2) support derived from \u201ca stipulation or contract signed by the party to whom [support] might otherwise be awarded\u201d and decreed pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(C). I agree with the majority opinion that the final decree was not signed by either party; therefore, Code \u00a7 20-109(C) did not limit the trial judge\u2019s authority to modify the support ordered by the final decree. The final decree awarded custody of the parties\u2019 child to the wife and contained the following provision regarding spousal support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">ORDERED that [the husband], shall pay [the wife], the sum of $800.00 per month as spousal support beginning December 1, 1988, and on the first day of each succeeding month until death of either party or remarriage of Complainant; for any period when custody of [the child] shall be changed to [the husband], spousal support shall be increased to $500.00 per month in lieu of child support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">I disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cConsent Order,\u201d which the trial judge entered three months after the final decree, was \u201ca stipulation or contract signed by the party to whom such relief might otherwise be awarded.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-109(C). The first paragraph of the Consent Order states that \u201cTHIS CAUSE came on to be heard upon the joint motion of the parties to voluntarily transfer custody of the parties\u2019 minor child ... from the [wife] to the [husband] and upon argument of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Adjudicating this motion, the Consent Order specifies the judge\u2019s findings and ruling on spousal support as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>AND IT APPEARING TO THE COURT that on the 13th day of December, 1988, this court entered a Decree of Divorce a <em>vinculo matrimonii, </em>which contained certain provisions concerning custody of [the child], rights of visitation, and payments of support; that subsequent to that date, the parties have agreed to voluntarily transfer custody of said child from the [wife] to the [husband], and to maintain the same visitation rights for the new non-custodial parent and to clarify the issue of support; for other good cause shown, the motion ought to be granted, it is hereby</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\"><em>% </em>H* \u2756 \u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">ADJUDGED, ORDERED, AND DECREED that the [husband] shall pay the [wife] the sum of $500.00 per month as spousal support beginning on the first day of the month immediately following the date of the execution of this agreement, and on the first day of each succeeding month until the death of either party or remarriage of the complainant. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Although, when the Consent Order was presented to the judge, the wife was acting as her own counsel and signed the Consent Order in that capacity \u201cpro se,\u201d her signature did not render the Consent Order a \u201cstipulation or contract\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 20-109(C). Her signature on the Consent Order merely indicated that it was an agreed adjudication of the issues before the court. In the absence of extraordinary language in a court\u2019s order or decree acknowledging the filing of \u201csuch a stipulation or contract\u201d and the parties\u2019 intent to have a \u201cpro se\u201d signature on that decree or order operate to invoke the limitations of Code \u00a7 20-109(C), the mere entry of a court order or decree which is signed by a party acting \u201cpro se\u201d does not satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 20-109(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The statute states that \u201c[i]f such a stipulation or contract is <em>filed </em>after entry of a final decree <em>and </em>if <em>any party so moves, the court shall modify </em>its decree to conform to such stipulation or contract.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-109(C) (emphasis added). Thus, I believe the statute contemplates a particular document signed by the parties, which has been filed with the court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>a court order, which has been entered to conform with that document. If the court order itself is to be considered as the \u201cstipulation or contract,\u201d I believe the court order must clearly specify that it is so and reference the limitations of Code \u00a7 20-109(C). To require any less would engender confusion as to whether the court order or decree is entered pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(A) and (B) or pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The record in this case clearly established that, with respect to spousal support, the Consent Order did no more than enforce one of the original provisions of the final decree, which stated that \u201cfor any period when custody of [the child] shall be changed to [the husband], spousal support shall be increased to $500.00 per month in lieu of child support.\u201d When the parties agreed to transfer the legal custody of the child from the wife to the husband per the Consent Order, they also sought to \u201cclarify\u201d that the condition in the final decree, which rendered the husband\u2019s increased payment to be \u201cin lieu of child support,\u201d was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">For these reasons, I would affirm the trial judge\u2019s ruling that spousal support was modifiable pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(A). I would also affirm the trial judge\u2019s refusal to modify the spousal support. The trial judge found that the wife lives a \u201cfrugal\u201d lifestyle, continues to repay a loan incurred during the marriage, and that the \u201csurplus in her budget ... should [allow her] ... to repay her contribution to the ... retirement system as well as repay the loan.\u201d Significantly, the trial judge ruled \u201c[i]t would be appropriate to review at a future time [the wife\u2019s] needs using the findings made during this hearing as a benchmark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The determination of the amount of support that is warranted is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>See Dukelow v. Dukelow, </em>2 Va.App. 21, 27, 341 S.E.2d 208, 211 (1986). In determining the needs of the wife, the trial judge thoroughly analyzed the financial evidence in the record. I find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
