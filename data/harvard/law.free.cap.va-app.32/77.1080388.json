Kramer (claimant). The Fund contends the commission erred in finding that (1) the issue of jurisdiction was <em>res judicata </em>because the Fund did not appeal the commission\u2019s April 14, 1998 decision; and (2) the commission had jurisdiction over claimant\u2019s claim on the ground that employer regularly employed three or more persons. Although we find the commission erred in ruling that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>its April 14, 1998 decision was <em>res judicata </em>with respect to the jurisdiction issue, we affirm the commission\u2019s finding that it had jurisdiction over the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">I. <em>Res Judicata</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In its April 14, 1998 opinion, the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s October 3, 1997 finding that the commission had jurisdiction over the claim because employer regularly employed three or more employees. The commission also affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s average weekly wage determination and the award of medical benefits and temporary total disability benefits, but it remanded the case to the deputy commissioner for a ruling on claimant\u2019s permanent partial disability (\u201cPPD\u201d) claim. Claimant included his PPD claim in his original claim for benefits, but the deputy commissioner did not address it at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">On October 28, 1998, the deputy commissioner issued an opinion granting claimant PPD benefits. The Fund appealed that decision to the full commission, contending the deputy commissioner erred in awarding PPD benefits and erred in finding that employer regularly employed three or more employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">On March 26, 1999, the commission issued a decision affirming the deputy commissioner\u2019s ruling awarding claimant PPD benefits. The commission also held that it no longer had jurisdiction over the issue of whether employer regularly employed three or more employees. The commission found that \u201c[t]he [April 14, 1998 decision] was an Award and final order as to those issues considered by both the Deputy Commissioner and Full Commission, and was not an interlocutory decision.\u201d The commission noted that the Fund did not appeal the April 14,1998 decision to this Court and, therefore, reasoned that the issues decided in the April 14, 1998 opinion were <em>res judicata </em>and the commission no longer had jurisdiction to hear those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Our holding in <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Harper, </em>26 Va.App. 522, 495 S.E.2d 540 (1998), controls this issue. In addressing a similar situation in <em>Harper, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Code \u00a7 65.2-706 provides that \u201c[n]o appeal shall be taken from the decision of one Commissioner until a review of the case has been had before the full Commission, as provided in Code \u00a7 65.2-705, and an award entered by it. Appeals shall lie from such award to the Court of Appeals.... \u201d \u201c[T]he words \u2018such award\u2019 ... [contained in \u00a7 65.2-706] mean final award, that is, a decision of the ... Commission granting or denying, or changing or refusing to change, some benefit payable or allowable under the ... Act and leaving nothing to be done except to superintend ministerially the execution of the award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 527, 495 S.E.2d at 543 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The commission\u2019s April 14, 1998 opinion affirming the deputy commissioner on the jurisdiction issue and its accompanying remand of the case to the deputy commissioner for a determination of claimant\u2019s entitlement to PPD benefits did not constitute a final award appealable to this Court. <em>See id. </em>While an award existed which determined claimant\u2019s average weekly wage and granted medical benefits and temporary total disability benefits, it was not an award that left \u201cnothing to be done.\u201d Under our holding in <em>Harper, </em>the Fund was not required to appeal the jurisdiction issue until after the PPD issue was fully determined on the merits by the commission on remand. In this case, the PPD claim was filed as part of the original claim and not as a claim separate and apart from the original claim for benefits. The commission\u2019s March 26, 1999 opinion was a final, appealable order because it disposed of the entire claim \u201cleaving nothing to be done except to superintend ministerially the execution of the award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fund filed a timely appeal from that decision and, therefore, we will address the issue of whether the commission erred in finding that it had jurisdiction over claimant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">II. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">On appeal, the Fund contends the commission erred in holding that employer regularly employed three or more employees within the Commonwealth and, therefore, erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>its April 14, 1998 finding that employer was subject to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">The threshold jurisdictional issue which the commission had to decide was whether the employer regularly had in his service three or more employees so as to come within the coverage of the Act. \u201c \u2018Employee\u2019 means ... [ejvery person ... in the service of another under any contract of hire or apprenticeship, written or implied, except ... one whose employment is not in the usual course of the trade, business, occupation or profession of the employer.\u201d Both full-time and part-time employees who are regularly employed to carry out the trade or business of the employer must be counted in determining the number of employees \u201cregularly in service\u201d to the employer. \u201cAny person hired by the employer to work in the usual course of the employer\u2019s business is an \u2018employee\u2019 under the Act regardless of how often or for how long he may be employed.\u201d The number of employees regularly in service of the employer is the number \u201cused to carry out the established mode of performing the work of the business ... even though the work may be recurrent instead of constant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"><em>Smith v. Hylton, </em>14 Va.App. 354, 356, 416 S.E.2d 712, 714 (1992) (citations omitted). \u201c[OJnce an employee proves that his or her injury occurred while employed in Virginia, an employer has the burden of producing sufficient evidence upon which the commission can find that the employer employed less than three employees regularly in service in Virginia.\u201d <em>Craddock Moving &amp; Storage Co. v. Settles, </em>16 Va.App. 1, 2, 427 S.E.2d 428, 429 (1993), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>247 Va. 165, 440 S.E.2d 613 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In affirming the deputy commissioner on the jurisdiction issue, the commission adopted the deputy commissioner\u2019s findings. The deputy commissioner found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">Although he did not include himself in the quarterly reports filed during certain periods, Mr. [Jeffrey D. Stewart] was clearly an employee of the corporation by virtue of his status as an officer. The majority of work performed by the business was done by him with the assistance of at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>two people. These employees were listed on quarterly reports. Moreover, there were other employees named by him that were not reflected on these reports, specifically, the claimant and Mr. [Crews]. At the time of the claimant\u2019s accident, it was anticipated that the claimant, Mr. [Stewart] and Chris [Stewart] would continue to perform similar services for the remainder of the summer break. We find this sufficient to invoke jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The testimony of Stewart and claimant, and employer\u2019s payroll reports, accounting records, and 1995 W-2 wage and tax statement copies amply support the commission\u2019s findings. That evidence established that at various times during the year preceding claimant\u2019s injury by accident, employer \u201c \u2018used [three or more employees] to carry out the established mode of performing the work of the business ... even though the work [might have been] recurrent instead of constant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>14 Va.App. at 356, 416 S.E.2d at 714 (citation omitted). In addition, the commission was entitled to accept claimant\u2019s testimony that he and Chris Stewart had been hired to work the remainder of the summer with Jeff Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Employer argues the deputy commissioner impermissibly relied upon certain documents filed with the Virginia Employment Commission in violation of Code \u00a7 60.2-623. The commission found the error to be harmless, stating: \u201cOur review of the evidence ... leads us to conclude that the deputy commissioner did not find that those reports were determinative on the jurisdictional issue. Indeed, she relates, \u2018There were other employees named by [the employer] that were not reflected on these [quarterly] reports....\u2019\u201d The direct evidence and inferences drawn from that evidence support the commission\u2019s finding that employer regularly employed three or more persons and was, therefore, subject to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction. Accordingly, we find as a matter of law that employer failed to sustain its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision finding that it had jurisdiction under the Act over claimant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ac\">concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">I concur in Part II and in the judgment affirming the award. I do not join in Part I because I believe the commission correctly held that <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Harper, </em>26 Va.App. 522, 495 S.E.2d 540 (1998), does not decide the <em>res judicata </em>issue presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Following an evidentiary hearing in <em>Harper, </em>the deputy commissioner denied the employee\u2019s claim for benefits because her employer did not employ three or more persons. <em>See </em>26 Va.App. at 526, 495 S.E.2d at 542. On its review, the commission found that the employer did employ three or more persons and was subject to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the commission remanded the case for a determination by the deputy commissioner regarding the employee\u2019s claim for benefits. <em>See id. </em>The jurisdictional ruling was \u201cinterlocutory and not determinative] of the controversy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528, 495 S.E.2d at 543. More importantly, the commission\u2019s ruling in <em>Harper </em>was not accompanied by the entry of an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">This case arises in a significantly different procedural posture. The record establishes that Derek Kramer filed his initial claim alleging he was injured by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with Santa\u2019s Helpers Chimney Sweeps. The commission made the following findings concerning the proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">[T]he Deputy Commissioner in her Opinion of October 3, 1997, made findings regarding the status of [Kramer] and employer under the Act, calculated [Kramer\u2019s] pre-injury average weekly wage, and found that [Kramer] sustained a compensable injury' on May 15, 1995. Pursuant to those findings [, the deputy commissioner] entered an Award for both wage loss benefits and medical benefits. The jurisdictional and pre-injury average weekly wage issues were brought before the Full Commission, and the Commission affirmed the findings below. The affirmation was an Award and final order as to those issues considered by both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Deputy Commissioner and Full Commission, and was not an interlocutory decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The record supports those findings. Specifically, the record reflects that the deputy commissioner entered \u201c[a]n award ... on behalf of Derek Kramer against Santa\u2019s Helpers providing for payment of temporary total disability benefits ... and medical benefits ... for as long as necessary.\u201d On review, the commission ruled that \u201c[t]he award ... is AFFIRMED as MODIFIED: temporary total disability benefits shall be paid to Derek M. Kramer in the weekly amount of $213.33 for the period May 15, 1995 through August 31, 1995 ... [and that] medical care and treatment ... shall remain the employer\u2019s responsibility for as long as necessary.\u201d On April 14,1998 the commission entered its award in favor of Kramer and remanded only the issue of permanency.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">By statute, the commission\u2019s award has particular significance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">The award of the Commission, as provided in [Code] \u00a7 65.2-704, if not reviewed in due time, or an award of the Commission upon such review, as provided in [Code] \u00a7 65.2-705, shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact. No appeal shall be taken from the decision of one Commissioner until a review of the case has been had before the full Commission, as provided in [Code] \u00a7 65.2-705, and an award entered by it. Appeals shall lie from such award to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided in the Rules of the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A). Applying this statute, the Supreme Court has held that the term \u201caward\u201d means \u201ca decision of the ... Commission granting or denying, or changing or refusing to change, some benefit payable or allowable under the ... Act and leaving nothing to be done except to superintend ministerially the execution of the award.\u201d <em>Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Henderson, </em>229 Va. 266, 269, 329 S.E.2d 48, 50 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The commission\u2019s award for temporary total disability benefits was a ruling on the merits of the case, granting a benefit to Kramer payable under the Act. Nothing about the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>was interlocutory. Indeed, the award \u201cadjudicat[ed] the principles of [the] cause.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-405(4), recodifying Code \u00a7 17-116.05(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The issue becomes even clearer upon an examination of <em>Holly Farms Foods, Inc. v. Carter, </em>15 Va.App. 29, 422 S.E.2d 165 (1992). Addressing the effect of an award, we noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">[T]he commission expressly noted that, even though it found a compensable occupational disease, it was unable to \u201center an award\u201d due to a lack of evidence identifying periods of disability. Instead, as the commission noted, \u201c[t]his decision is not final until the entry of the award of the Deputy Commissioner establishing periods of compensable disability.\u201d Especially in light of the commission\u2019s express recognition that its decision would not become final until the final determination of the periods of disability, we will not conclude that the deputy commissioner\u2019s duties on remand were merely \u201cministerial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 34-35, 422 S.E.2d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The entry of an award conferring a benefit to Kramer under the Act is a significant, controlling fact that distinguishes this case from <em>Harper. </em>When the commission entered its award for temporary total disability benefits on April 14, 1998, it remanded the case to the deputy commissioner solely to determine Kramer\u2019s permanency rating. On review of the permanency issue, the commission correctly ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzC\">The issue of whether Santa\u2019s Helper Chimney Sweeps is an \u201cEmployer\u201d under the Act, and [Kramer\u2019s] status under the Act were decided in the Commission\u2019s Opinion of April 14, 1998. No timely appeal of that final, non-interlocutory, order was noted by any party. Therefore, that portion of the Opinion, as well as the findings regarding [Kramer\u2019s] pre-injury average weekly wage, are binding on the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">For these reasons, I would affirm the commission\u2019s March 26,1999 award on all issues.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
