Robinson\u2019s psychiatric condition was causally related to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>injury by accident. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Michalene L. Robinson sustained a work-related injury on January 11, 1995, when her thumb was caught in a- machine. The next day, Dr. Richard Holm, an orthopedist, performed surgery on Robinson to repair a deep laceration and fracture of her right thumb. He released her to light duty to begin on January 16, 1995, instructing her not to use her right hand at work. When Robinson visited Dr. Holm on January 20, he returned her to work beginning January 23 and \u201cwith the restriction that she do no work with her right thumb.\u201d He also recommended physical therapy and informed her \u201cthat it may be a year before [she] obtain[s] a fixed and stable medical condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In March, Dr. Holm noted that Robinson \u201cwas extremely concerned as she was having increasing pain.\u201d Dr. Holm also noted that her pain resulted from \u201cover use\u201d and notified Georgia-Pacific that Robinson was to avoid unnecessary heavy gripping. Early in May, Robinson, Dr. Holm, and a Georgia-Pacific representative \u201chad a very extended discussion ... concerning [Robinson\u2019s] treatment course ... [and] the goal of her recovery.\u201d Dr. Holm again asked Georgia-Pacific \u201cto restrict heavy lifting, gripping and pulling activities with [her] right hand.\u201d He gave Robinson additional medication for her pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Robinson fainted at work on May 20,1995, and was hospitalized. Robinson reported to the attending physician that she had \u201cbeen in good health ... until January ... when she injured her thumb.\u201d Robinson said she had stress at work because of a conflict with a supervisor and her inability to use her hand; she also mentioned the death of a grandchild, which occurred May 19. The treating physician gave her medication for anxiety, admitted her to the hospital, and diagnosed her as having syncopal episode, hypokalemia, and moderate stress anxiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Two days after her hospitalization, Dr. Holm recommended that Robinson consult with Dr. Bryan Spader, a psychiatrist. In that report, Dr. Holm noted that Robinson \u201cis having a great deal of difficulty returning to her job\u201d and noted that \u201cdiscussions have been held with [Georgia-Pacific] to try to modify her work environment.\u201d Dr. Holm further stated that \u201cRobinson continues to have problems with what appears to be a relatively minor injury causing a major change in her lifestyle.\u201d Several days later, Dr. Holm again evaluated Robinson and expressed the \u201cconcern ... that [Robinson] is having a post-traumatic stress reaction.\u201d He found Robinson unfit for work pending her psychiatric examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The record reveals that Robinson was evaluated by three psychiatrists \u2014 Dr. Bryan Spader, Dr. Merritt Foster, and Dr. James Corcoran. The commission considered various reports from these psychiatrists and found that Robinson\u2019s psychiatric treatment resulted from and was necessitated by her injury by accident. Georgia-Pacific contends that no credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">By statutory mandate, \u201can award of the Commission ... shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A). Thus, we have often expressed our standard of review as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">In reviewing the commission\u2019s decision, we are guided by well-settled principles. \u201c[I]t is fundamental that a finding of fact made by the Commission is conclusive and binding upon this court on review.\u201d \u201c[T]hat contrary evidence may be in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the Commission's findings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-9\"><em>Sneed v. Morengo, </em>19 Va.App. 199, 204, 450 S.E.2d 167, 171 (1994) (citations omitted). \u201cThe scope of a judicial review of the fact finding function of a workers\u2019 compensation commission [, therefore,] is \u2018severely limited, partly in deference to the agency\u2019s expertise in a specialized field.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metropolitan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>Cleaning Corp. v. Crawley, </em>14 Va.App. 261, 266, 416 S.E.2d 35, 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Applying equally well-settled principles, the Supreme Court has held that the \u201cquestion [of causation] raised by \u2018conflicting expert medical opinions\u2019 is one of fact.\u201d <em>Eccon Constr. Co. v. Lucas, </em>221 Va. 786, 790, 273 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1981). Thus, the commission\u2019s \u201cfinding upon conflicting medical evidence that a certain condition does or does not exist is ... a conclusive finding of fact.\u201d <em>McPeek v. P.W. &amp; W. Coal Co., </em>210 Va. 185, 188, 169 S.E.2d 443, 445 (1969). \u201cThe deference that we give to the commission\u2019s fact finding on medical questions is based upon the \u2018unwisdom of an attempt by ... [courts] uninitiated into the mysteries [of the medical science debate] to choose between conflicting expert medical opinions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stancill v. Ford Motor Co., </em>15 Va.App. 54, 58, 421 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Given these principles of appellate review, we have held that \u201c[t]he commission\u2019s findings are binding even if the weight of the evidence is contrary to those findings.\u201d <em>Kane Plumbing v. Small, </em>7 Va.App. 132, 136, 371 S.E.2d 828, 831 (1988). We apply this standard because \u201c[a] greater number of medical opinions does not necessarily constitute a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Honaker, </em>9 Va.App. 336, 339, 388 S.E.2d 271, 273 (1990). \u201cThe probative weight to be accorded [medical] evidence is for the Commission to decide; and if it is in conflict with other medical evidence, the Commission is free to adopt that view \u201cwhich is most consistent with reason and justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>C.D.S. Const. Services v. Petrock, </em>218 Va. 1064, 1070, 243 S.E.2d 236, 240 (1978). In its review of this case, the commission decided that the opinions of Dr. Spader and Dr. Corcoran were \u201centitled to greater weight\u201d than those of Dr. Foster. <em>Honaker, </em>9 Va.App. at 339, 388 S.E.2d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Dr. Spader noted in his initial report on May 5, 1995, that Robinson expressed anxiety about difficulties performing routine tasks with her hand after her injury. She also expressed lifestyle difficulties, such as loss of libido, loss of sleep, irrita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>bility, and thoughts of suicide following the accident. Robinson believed that, within her limitations, she was \u201cdoing her job well\u201d after her injury, yet, \u201cwas being harassed by supervisors.\u201d Dr. Spader also reported other events in Robinson\u2019s life about which she was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">In his evaluation report, Dr. Spader expressed a belief that Robinson was suffering from \u201cMajor Depression, single episode ... [,] symptoms suggestive of [Post-traumatic stress disorder], and there may be some symptoms suggestive of dysthymia and an Axis II Disorder.\u201d In a letter to Dr. Holm, Dr. Spader stated that his \u201cevaluation suggested presence of a Major Depression with sleep and appetite disturbance, irritability, crying more readily, loss of energy and some suicidal thoughts shortly after the accident began.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">By letter of June 14, 1995, Dr. Holm informed Georgia-Pacific that Robinson\u2019s psychiatric condition placed Robinson and potentially her fellow workers at risk. He reiterated that he had \u201cnothing to indicate this is not a reaction to her injury of January 1995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">At Georgia-Pacific\u2019s request, Dr. Foster examined Robinson on two occasions. In an extensive report on June 16, Dr. Foster opined that Robinson\u2019s emotional illness had its genesis \u201ctwo to three years prior to her recent illness.\u201d He further opined \u201cthat her emotional illness culminated in her inability to accept criticism and adopt corrective measures, finally resulting in the injury to her right hand which precipitated the current evaluation.\u201d Thus, he concluded \u201cthat the injury to her right hand ... [did not cause] her current emotional symptomatology [but] was rather a product of her emotional illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">On August 18, 1995, Dr. Holm reported that the fracture of Robinson\u2019s thumb had healed, that her joint was arthritic, that Robinson \u201cclinically is having pain in her thumb,\u201d and that \u201cshe is complaining of pain over the crush wound site and also proximal to the radial styloid.\u201d He continued to restrict her from work until he could learn \u201cwhether ... she is psychologically able to return to work.\u201d On October 13, 1995, Dr. Holm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>noted that Robinson continued to have \u201ctenderness in her laceration site consistent with a radial sensory nerve injury.\u201d Although he recommended that she return to work, he again placed restrictions on heavy lifting, gripping, and pulling. Dr. Holm also noted that her psychiatric condition remained untreated.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Robinson began treatment with Dr. Corcoran in October 1995. In a letter of October 16,1997, Dr. Foster reported that he had reviewed Dr. Corcoran\u2019s reports, which opined that Robinson suffers from Post-traumatic stress disorder and that her disability is a consequence of her January 11, 1995 injury. Dr. Foster stated that \u201cRobinson\u2019s injury ... does not fit the PTSD diagnosis ... [and that] there is no evidence in the records of the usual litany of purely subjective symptoms, irrespective of the provable objective signs such as the characteristic phobic avoidance.\u201d He reiterated his opinion \u201cthat the injury to her right thumb occurring in an accident on ... January 11,1995, was a product of her emotional illness rather than a cause of whatever emotional symptomatology is currently present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Over a period of a year and one-half, Dr. Corcoran treated Robinson and maintained his diagnosis of PTSD. He opined \u201cthat Ms. Robinson\u2019s disability is related to her work-related injury of January 11, 1995, and that as a result of that injury she is disabled from all work.\u201d He further noted that \u201cwhile she may indeed have had some difficulties prior to her injury the present disability was clearly set in motion as a result of her work-related injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Dr. Foster again examined Robinson in April 1998 and reported that his opinion remained that Robinson\u2019s injury \u201cwas a product of her emotional illness rather than a cause of whatever symptomatology is currently present.\u201d He also stated that Robinson \u201cdoes not now and has never demonstrated enough of the characteristic symptomatology to warrant a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">On May 11, 1998, Dr. Corcoran reported that his \u201copinion has not changed.\u201d He stated that Robinson \u201cmore than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>adequately meets criteria for post traumatic stress disorder, a diagnosis made not only by myself, but also by previous psychiatrists who saw her shortly after her \u2022 injury.\u201d He concluded that \u201c[ojverall her behavior, her complaints and my clinical findings are quite consistent with a post traumatic stress disorder coupled with a paranoid personality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Evaluating this evidence, the commission made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">After a careful review of Dr. Corcoran\u2019s treatment notes, it is clear that [Robinson] presented for psychiatric treatment that was related to her injury. Dr. Foster\u2019s account of Dr. Corcoran\u2019s February 20, 1996, office visit noted that Dr. Corcoran observed that [Robinson] was \u201cvery focused on ... her injury.\u201d On January 29, 1997, Dr. Corcoran noted that [Robinson] was \u201ctold she could not use hand as previously.\u201d On April 7, 1997, Dr. Corcoran noted that [Robinson] \u201cattributes all of her difficulty to her injury.\u201d On May 13, 1997, Dr. Corcoran noted that [Robinson] \u201cremains focused on her accident and how this has affected her.\u201d By June 30,1997, Dr. Corcoran\u2019s notes began reflecting [Robinson\u2019s] frustration she was experiencing in waiting for a decision about her entitlement to benefits. However, on February 27, 1998, Dr. Corcoran noted that the \u201cprocess [was] set in motion by injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">Although Dr. Foster disagreed with Dr. Corcoran\u2019s analysis and opinion, instead stating that [Robinson\u2019s] condition was established long before the accident, we are persuaded that [Robinson\u2019s] treatment with Dr. Spader and Dr. Corcoran was necessitated by the January 11, 1995, accident. No evidence has been presented that [Robinson\u2019s] treatment was unnecessary, nor has any evidence been presented opining whether the treatment would have been the same had the accident not happened. [Robinson] admitted to her troubles with management, which cannot result in a compensable disability. Dr. Corcoran factored in this compo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>nent of [Robinson\u2019s] condition, however, and opined that the injury triggered the extent of her condition. We agree....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">When the medical evidence conflicts, we do not reweigh the preponderance of the evidence after the commission has done so. <em>See Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Russell, </em>31 Va.App. 16, 20, 520 S.E.2d 839, 841 (1999); <em>Wagner Enterprises v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991). Our review is limited to determining whether the record contains credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s findings. <em>See id. </em>The record contains more than ample credible evidence to support the findings. Accordingly, we affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
