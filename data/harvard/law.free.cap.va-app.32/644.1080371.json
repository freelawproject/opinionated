On appeal, he contends the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">William Bruce, III, testified that he drove Troy Tarpley, Jose Piggott, and appellant to Rivermont Apartments on July 22, 1998. Tarpley and appellant exited the vehicle while Piggott remained in the car with Bruce. A group of people approached the car. Someone approached the passenger side and argued with Piggott. Bruce got out and told the group to move away from his car. Then, Bruce \u201cwas. knocked out.\u201d When he regained consciousness, someone told him that \u201csome guys had took off with [his] car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Piggott testified that he witnessed a group of people attack Bruce. Suspecting that the crowd might damage the vehicle, Piggott drove it to a safer location. At that time, he saw no one else in the car. When Piggott attempted to drive to another location, Tarpley grabbed Piggott and began to hit him. At that time, Piggott realized that Tarpley and appellant were in the back seat of the car. Tarpley \u201cwas choking\u201d Piggott and \u201csomebody was hitting him\u201d in his head. The evidence does not establish whether it was Tarpley or appellant who was hitting Piggott. Then, someone pulled Piggott from the car. Tarpley drove off in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Eric Hardy heard Bruce\u2019s car crash into a tree a short distance from the Rivermont Apartments. He testified that he pulled Tarpley and appellant out of the car. Tarpley was in the driver\u2019s seat, and appellant was in the front passenger seat. As appellant was pulled from the car, his shoes came off.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Investigator R.A. Turner investigated the reported larceny of Bruce\u2019s car. He found appellant\u2019s shoes in the front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>passenger compartment \u201cwedged in the car where the dash[board] and everything had been pushed back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Appellant moved to strike the evidence on the basis that he was a \u201cmere passenger\u201d and did not participate in the attack on Piggott or in the taking of the car. The trial court overruled the motion, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">In the case we\u2019ve got here, we\u2019ve got the owner of the vehicle being attacked by a mob and knocked unconscious. Then Mr. Piggott trying to get the vehicle away from the mob, and then the principal thief, Mr. Tarpley, grabbing him from behind and dragging him out of the vehicle at the same time that Mr. Hampton is in the back seat. If he had remained in the back seat and Tarpley drove the car off, I think I\u2019d wonder. I\u2019d have a reasonable doubt as to whether or not he had some participation in the crime, but rather than remaining in the back seat and doing nothing, or getting out of the vehicle and having nothing to do with its asportation, he got out and got in the front seat with the thief and drove away with him. It seems to me, under the circumstances of this case, with the violence and the getting out of the back seat and getting into the front, the inference to me is inescapable that he was countenancing the theft.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The trial court did not find that appellant assaulted or directly participated in the assault on Piggott. Instead, the court based the conviction on the fact that appellant got into the front passenger seat of the stolen vehicle with knowledge of the attack and theft, thereby countenancing and approving Tarpley\u2019s theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for grand larceny of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">The Commonwealth argues that because appellant was present at the commission of a crime without disapproving or opposing it, he was a principal in the second degree. In support of its argument, the Commonwealth asserts that no evidence established that appellant attempted to stop Tarpley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>from attacking Piggott, who was ultimately pulled out of the car. At some point, both Tarpley and appellant moved from the back seat into the front seat, .then drove away with Tarpley at the wheel. Appellant did not attempt to leave the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">As previously stated, appellant argues that he did not participate in the assault or theft and was a \u201cmere passenger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">\u201cWhen considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal of a criminal conviction, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and grant all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 548, 551, 513 S.E.2d 453, 455 (1999) (citing <em>Brooks v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 407, 414, 424 S.E.2d 566, 571 (1992)). \u201c \u2018An appellate court must discard all evidence of the accused that conflicts with that of the Commonwealth and regard as true all credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences reasonably deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lea v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 300, 303, 429 S.E.2d 477, 479 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">A principal in the second degree is one who is not only present at a crime\u2019s commission, but also commits some overt act, such as inciting, encouraging, advising, or assisting in the commission of the crime, or shares the perpetrator\u2019s criminal intent. <em>See Murray v. Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 282, 283, 170 S.E.2d 3, 4 (1969) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">While mere presence during the commission of a crime is not sufficient to convict a person as a principal in the second degree, the Supreme Court of Virginia held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">\u201cit is certain that proof that a person is present at the commission of a crime without disapproving or opposing it, is evidence from which, in connection with other circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>stances, it is competent for the jury to infer that he assented thereto, lent to it his countenance and approval, and was thereby aiding and abetting the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"><em>Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>179 Va. 96, 100, 18 S.E.2d 314, 316 (1942) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Because presence without disapproving or opposing the commission of a crime, in connection with other circumstances, is evidence that a defendant lent his countenance and approval to the crime, we must determine whether \u201cother circumstances\u201d were present in this case in addition to appellant\u2019s failure to disapprove- or oppose the actions of the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In <em>Foster, </em>the defendant lived with his wife in a house of prostitution, knowing it to be such. <em>See id. </em>at 98, 18 S.E.2d at 315. The Court concluded that the defendant benefited from the earnings of the prostitutes and contributed to the maintenance of the establishment. <em>See id. </em>at 100, 18 S.E.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">In <em>Pugliese v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 82, 428 S.E.2d 16 (1993), Davis shot and killed Beckmann in a van while the defendant was present. Prior to the shooting, the defendant knew Davis planned to cheat Beckmann out of some money, but contended he had no prior knowledge of Davis\u2019 intent to shoot Beckmann. <em>See id. </em>at 86, 428 S.E.2d at 20. In the van, Davis told the defendant he was going to shoot Beckmann. <em>See id. </em>The defendant remained in the van while Davis disposed of Beckmann\u2019s body. <em>See id. </em>Later, the defendant received part of Beckmann\u2019s money and assisted Davis in disposing of the van. <em>See id. </em>at 86-87, 428 S.E.2d at 20-21. The Court found that the defendant countenanced and lent his support to the commission of the murder and robbery by accompanying the perpetrator of the crime knowing of his announced intention to commit the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\"><em>Moehring v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 564, 290 S.E.2d 891 (1982), also is instructive. Faison and the defendant were hitchhiking. <em>See id. </em>at 566, 290 S.E.2d at 891. Keeling, leaving his keys in the ignition, went into a gas station to pay for gas he had just pumped. <em>See id. </em>Faison got into Keeling\u2019s vehicle and drove off. <em>See id. </em>The defendant was still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>across the road hitchhiking. <em>See id. </em>Faison drove north on-Route 17 and disappeared from sight. <em>See id. </em>at 566, 290 S.E.2d at 892. Several minutes later, Faison reappeared, driving south on Route 17. <em>See id. </em>He stopped, picked up the defendant, and drove off again. <em>See id. </em>Faison testified at trial that the defendant knew nothing of the theft and that the defendant implored him to stop for the police. <em>See id. </em>at 567, 290 S.E.2d at 892. The trial court convicted the defendant because he saw the vehicle being taken and then left the scene in the stolen vehicle. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and the reasonable inferences deducible from that evidence do not establish that Moehring aided Faison in the theft or that he shared Faison\u2019s intent to deprive Keeling of his truck. All that the prosecution proved was that two men were observed walking south along Route 17 in the early morning hours of March 23,1980; that each was attempting to \u201cthumb\u201d a ride from passing motorists; that one of the men, Faison, apparently despaired of success, left his fellow hitchhiker and went across the highway and stole a truck; that the other man, Moehring, continued walking and \u201cthumbing\u201d; and that some minutes later Moehring was given a ride in the stolen truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">When Faison committed his larceny of the truck, Moehring was across a double-lane highway some distance from the scene. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to regard him as a \u201clookout,\u201d or an accessory before the fact. And the mere acceptance by Moehring of a ride in the stolen vehicle (and like acceptance by another hitchhiker who was acquitted of the larceny of the truck) did not in any way aid Faison. Taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, -the evidence fails to meet either the overt act or shared intent requirements of <em>Triplett [v. Commonwealth, </em>141 Va. 577, 127 S.E. 486 (1925) ] and <em>Murray, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">Because larceny is a continuing offense, anyone who knows that personal property is stolen and assists in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>transportation or disposition is guilty of larceny. <em>Dunlavey v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 521, 35 S.E.2d 763 (1945). However, in the instant case there is no evidence that Moehring assisted in any way in the transportation or disposition of the truck he knew to be stolen. On the contrary, Faison testified it was the defendant who finally convinced him to abandon his flight and surrender to the police. The arresting officer noticed the exchange between Moehring and Faison prior to the time Faison stopped. The officer said \u201che [Moehring] reached over once and grabbed him or poked him or something to that effect.\u201d ... Neither do we find evidence that established beyond a reasonable doubt that Moehring countenanced or approved the theft of the truck by Faison, or wished the venture to succeed. The most that can be said with reasonable certainty is that this defendant-hitchhiker accepted a ride from the first person who stopped and that he knew that person was driving a stolen vehicle. This conduct does raise a suspicion of guilt. However, it is not sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed grand larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 567-68, 290 S.E.2d at 892-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Clearly, in <em>Foster </em>and <em>Pugliese, </em>\u201cother circumstances\u201d were present in addition to the defendant simply being present and not opposing the criminal act. In <em>Moehring, </em>there were no \u201cother circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In this case, no \u201cother circumstances\u201d are present. The trial court\u2019s ruling limits our analysis to whether appellant\u2019s conduct in not leaving the vehicle and moving into the front seat \u201ccountenanced\u201d Tarpley\u2019s criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">No evidence proved appellant participated in the theft or aided and abetted Tarpley by inciting, encouraging, advising or assisting him. No evidence proved appellant was a \u201clookout.\u201d No evidence proved appellant shared Tarpley\u2019s criminal intent. While larceny is a continuing offense, appellant did nothing to aid Tarpley in stealing the car or in driving it away. Appellant\u2019s conduct in remaining in the vehicle and moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>into the front passenger seat is consistent with the hypothesis that he did so for his own comfort and convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
