On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in refusing to suppress evidence seized during execution of a search warrant. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u2018the burden is upon [the defendant] to show that the ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u2019\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted). While we are bound to review <em>de novo </em>the ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause, we \u201creview findings of historical fact only for clear error<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ... give due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The evidence proved that on the afternoon of February 12, 1997, five police officers proceeded to appellant\u2019s apartment to execute a search warrant. Before the officers approached the residence, Officer Shapiro, who was in a surveillance vehicle, saw appellant and another male arrive by car, park, take a black bag out of the trunk, and enter the apartment. Fifteen minutes later, the other male left, at which time the police decided to execute the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Four of the officers prepared to enter through the front door, and the fifth, Sergeant Russell, was to guard the rear of the apartment to prevent anyone from escaping out of a rear window. As the officers approached the front door, they saw two men, Manuel and Hawkins. Manuel was on the front porch, and Hawkins was exiting from the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Officer Rogers testified that Manuel was \u201ccoming off the porch ... [and] trying to exit towards the street.\u201d Rogers pursued and apprehended Manuel. Russell assisted him, leaving no one to prevent occupants in the apartment from fleeing out of the rear window.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Hawkins exited and was closing the front door behind him when Officer Shapiro approached. Shapiro was \u201cnumber one in line\u201d and was supposed to ram the front door, if necessary. Shapiro and other officers \u201cstarted announcing\u201d their identity and purpose as Hawkins exited. Shapiro did not try to apprehend Hawkins. Two seconds after Hawkins closed the door, Shapiro turned the knob and found that the door was unlocked. He opened the door and entered, yelling, \u201csearch warrant, police, everybody down.\u201d Officer Capelli followed Shapiro into the house a few seconds later and repeatedly yelled his identity and purpose. After entering the apartment, Shapiro located and arrested appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Upon seeing Manuel on the porch and Hawkins leaving through the front door, Officer Payne \u201cimmediately attempted to stop [Hawkins].\u201d She shouted numerous times for Hawkins to come off the porch and \u201cget to the ground,\u201d but he refused. A struggle ensued in the front yard of the house, and \u201c[i]t took [several] officers to get [Hawkins] down.\u201d Payne testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>that the noise outside was so loud that officers in a marked unit a block or two away \u201cheard us yelling\u201d and \u201ccame to our assistance.\u201d Other officers assisted Payne in eventually subduing Hawkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence seized in the search of the residence, appellant claimed the officers violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures by failing to knock and announce their presence. The trial court denied the motion, finding that exigent circumstances justified the decision to enter the residence unannounced. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The validity of a search under the authority of a valid search warrant is \u201c \u2018judged in terms of its reasonableness within the meaning of the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 10 of the Constitution of Virginia.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 113, 117, 493 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1997) (quoting <em>Grover v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 143, 145, 396 S.E.2d 863, 864 (1990)). \u201cOur courts have consistently held that the protections afforded under the Virginia Constitution are co-extensive with those in the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Bennefield v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 729, 739-40, 467 S.E.2d 306, 311 (1996); <em>see also Lowe v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 346, 348 n. 1, 337 S.E.2d 273, 275 n. 1 (1985) (explaining that protections under Virginia\u2019s Constitution and statutes are \u201csubstantially the same as those contained in the Fourth Amendment\u201d); <em>Janis v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 646, 650-51, 472 S.E.2d 649, 652 (1996) (holding same); <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 737, 743, 420 S.E.2d 235, 239 (1992) (explaining that search and seizure protections are coextensive with federal constitutional protections); <em>Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 445, 451 n. 2, 371 S.E.2d 7, 10 n. 2 (1988) (holding that, if traffic checkpoint survives Fourth Amendment scrutiny, it is constitutional under Article I, \u00a7 10 of Virginia\u2019s Constitution), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>238 Va. 200, 380 S.E.2d 656 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Generally, police executing a search warrant must \u201c \u2018(1) knock; (2) identify themselves as police officers; (3) indicate the purpose for their presence; and (4) wait a reasonable time for the occupants to answer the door\u2019\u201d before entering a residence. <em>Lewis, </em>26 Va.App. at 117, 493 S.E.2d at 399 (quoting <em>Gladden v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 595, 598, 400 S.E.2d 791, 793 (1991)). In <em>Commonwealth v. Woody, </em>13 Va.App. 168, 170, 409 S.E.2d 170, 171 (1991), we noted two exceptions to this rule allowing for unannounced entries: \u201c(1) when officers \u2018have probable cause to believe that their peril would be increased if they announced their presence\u2019 or (2) when officers have probable cause to believe \u2018that an unannounced entry is necessary to prevent persons within from escaping or destroying evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 409 S.E.2d at 171 (quoting <em>Heaton v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 137, 138, 207 S.E.2d 829, 830 (1974); also citing <em>Keeter v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 134, 141, 278 S.E.2d 841, 846 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Relying on <em>Heaton </em>and <em>Keeter </em>and citing <em>Woody, </em>we again applied the probable cause standard in reviewing the reasonableness of an unannounced entry in <em>Spivey v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 715, 722, 479 S.E.2d 543, 547 (1997). Four months after our decision in <em>Spivey, </em>the United States Supreme Court decided a case involving exceptions to the knock-and-announce rule. <em>See Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 137 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997). In <em>Richards, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[i]n order to justify a \u2018no-knock\u2019 entry, the police must have <em>a reasonable suspicion </em>that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394, 117 S.Ct. at 1421 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Because the protections afforded under Virginia\u2019s Constitution are coextensive with those contained in the Fourth Amendment, we apply the legal standard adopted by the United States Supreme Court in interpreting the Fourth Amendment and determining cases thereunder. Therefore, in analyzing the applicability of an exception to the \u201cknock and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>announce\u201d requirement, we hold that the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d standard adopted in <em>Richards </em>is the proper legal standard. Accordingly, we no longer follow the stricter \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard applied in <em>Woody </em>and its progeny, including <em>Spivey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The evidence established that the approaching officers, armed with a valid search warrant, saw two individuals in the front of appellant\u2019s residence. One individual, Manuel, stood on the porch, while the other, Hawkins, closed the front door. At that moment, the approaching officers repeatedly announced their identity and purpose and ordered the men to submit to the officers\u2019 authority. Manuel fled and Hawkins resisted orders to come off the porch and lie down on the ground, creating a great deal of noise and confusion and requiring most of the executing officers to subdue them. The remaining officers opened the unlocked door, identified themselves as police officers with a search warrant and entered the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Based on the loud disturbance taking place in front of appellant\u2019s residence and the fact that three of the five officers were involved in apprehending two recalcitrant suspects outside the premises to be searched, we find the Commonwealth sufficiently established that the officers had a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence would be dangerous or futile. Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence, and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-12\">. \u201cIn Virginia, questions of fact are binding on appeal unless 'plainly wrong.\u2019 \" <em>McGee, 25 </em>Va.App. at 198 n. 1, 487 S.E.2d at 261 n. 1 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
