Campbell (husband) and Katherine C. Campbell (wife) were divorced by final decree of the trial court, entered April 23, 1998, which, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201caffirmed and ratified, and ... incorporated\u201d a post-separation \u201cStipulation Agreement\u201d (agreement). On July 14, 1999, wife petitioned the court to \u201cappoint a Special Commissioner,\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cto conduct a sale\u201d of property specified in the agreement, \u201cso ... [husband] can satisfy\u201d certain related terms with the resulting proceeds. Husband responded with a \u201cDemurrer and Motion to Dismiss the ... Petition,\u201d arguing that the parties waived any claim to relief afforded by Code \u00a7 20-107.3, including the appointment of a special commissioner in accordance with Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(3), by express terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The trial court conducted an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, considered the argument of counsel, and sustained husband\u2019s motion, denying wife an opportunity to present evidence. Wife appeals, contending that the trial court misinterpreted the agreement and erroneously refused to appoint the special commissioner. Finding that wife had previously agreed to waive the requested relief, we affirm the disputed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In accordance with express terms of the agreement, wife waived \u201call right, title and interest in ... Aerosolv,\u201d the property in issue, \u201cor any other products ... in which husband has a direct or indirect interest.\u201d The agreement, however, further provided that \u201c[t]he parties contemplate the sale of Aerosolv ... on or before March 1, 1997,\u201d and required husband to apply a portion of the resulting proceeds to several specified purposes. Elsewhere in the agreement, the parties covenanted that, \u201c[i]f Aerosolv doesn\u2019t sell, Wife shall have the right to terminate the lease\u201d with Katec, Inc., an asset transferred to husband, to certain office premises deeded to wife, and \u201csell the [office] property, ... retaining] the proceeds ... as her sole separate property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">With respect to their respective rights and remedies, the parties agreed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">each ... voluntarily, knowingly, intelligently and intentionally waives the right to have the court decree as to the property of the parties, including by way of illustration and not- by way of limitation, the right to have the court' execute the remedy provided by Code of Virginia, Section 20-107.3 (Virginia\u2019s Equitable Distribution law).... <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Both, however, reserved the right to pursue enforcement of the agreement \u201cin any court of competent jurisdiction by petition ... or other procedure compatible with the rules of such tribunal.\u201d Once incorporated \u201cinto any decree which may be entered in any action between the parties,\u201d the terms of the agreement were \u201cto be enforceable in the same manner as any provision of such decree pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109.1 ..., including, without limitation ... the use of the contempt powers of the court, [and] ... confinement in jail or the imposition of a fine ..., notwithstanding the remedies avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>able under the general law ... in <em>the absence of contract.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">It is well established that \u201cmarital property settlements entered into by competent parties upon valid consideration for lawful purposes are favored in the law.\u201d <em>Cooley v. Cooley, </em>220 Va. 749, 752, 263 S.E.2d 49, 52 (1980). Such \u201cagreements are contracts subject to the same rules of formation, validity, and interpretation as other contracts.\u201d <em>Bergman v. Bergman, </em>25 Va.App. 204, 211, 487 S.E.2d 264, 267 (1997) (citing <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>3 Va.App. 510, 513, 351 S.E.2d 593, 595 (1986)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">When the terms of a disputed provision are clear and definite, it is axiomatic that they are to be applied according to their ordinary meaning. Where there is no ambiguity in the terms of a contract, we must construe it as written, and ... not ... search for the meaning ... beyond the pertinent instrument itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-8\"><em>Smith, </em>3 Va.App. at 514, 351 S.E.2d at 595-96 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">As acknowledged by the parties in the subject agreement, Code \u00a7 20-109.1 authorizes the court to \u201caffirm, ratify and incorporate by reference in its decree dissolving a marriage ... any valid agreement between the parties, or provisions thereof,\u201d which \u201cagreement or provision ... shall be deemed for all purposes to be a term of the decree, and enforceable in the same manner as any provision of such decree.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-109(C), formerly Code \u00a7 20-109, provides that, within limitations not pertinent to the instant appeal, a court may not depart from the terms and conditions of a \u201cstipulation or contract\u201d addressing \u201csupport and maintenance for the spouse, suit money, or counsel fee or establishing or imposing any other condition or consideration, monetary or nonmonetary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-109 and -109.1 are specifically referenced and sanctioned by Code \u00a7 20-107.3(1). Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>it is apparent that the legislature intended to impose the same restrictions on a court in making an equitable distribution award as \u2022... in making awards of support and maintenance. Specifically, to the extent that the parties have already stipulated to a particular disposition of their property, the court may not decree</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">inconsistent relief in equitable distribution pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3. <em>Parra v. Parra, </em>1 Va.App. 118, 128, 336 S.E.2d 157, 162 (1985). A contrary rule would invite divorce litigants to abandon agreements, favored by \u201cpublic policy,\u201d in pursuit of a \u201cbetter result from the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 336 S.E.2d at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Here, husband and wife clearly and unequivocally elected to rely upon the agreement to identify and establish their respective interests relative to the separate and marital estates, child custody, support, and a myriad of like issues incident to the marriage. To the exclusion of relief otherwise available, both expressly looked to the agreement, either in contract or as a provision of the decree, to safeguard their respective rights. As a result, the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 are not available to remedy wife\u2019s claims arising from the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Contrary to wife\u2019s argument on appeal, adherence to the clear language of the agreement does not \u201cdepriv[e] [her] and the ... child of their rights under the agreement.\u201d Once affirmed, ratified and incorporated into the decree of divorce pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109.1, the agreement became, \u201cfor all purposes ... a term of the decree, ... enforceable in the same manner as any provision of such decree.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-109.1. Hence, both parties are free to access the equitable powers of the court to enforce the decree, including the terms of the agreement. <em>See, e.g., McLoughlin v. McLoughlin, </em>211 Va. 365, 368, 177 S.E.2d 781, 783 (1970) (court may enforce agreement incorporated into decree through \u201ccontempt power\u201d); <em>Mayers v. Mayers, </em>15 Va.App. 587, 589-90, 425 S.E.2d 808, 809 (1993) (court may order sale of property to enforce divorce decree incorporating agreement); <em>Owney v. Owney, </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Va.App. 255, 259, 379 S.E.2d 745, 748 (1989) (incorporated agreement enforceable through \u201ccontempt power\u201d or otherwise as \u201cbinding ... the parties\u201d); <em>Fry v. Schwarting, </em>4 Va.App. 173, 178, 355 S.E.2d 342, 345 (1987) (incorporated agreement enjoys \u201cfull force and effect of a court\u2019s decree\u201d); <em>Parra, </em>1 Va.App. at 129, 336 S.E.2d at 163 (incorporated agreement does not diminish \u201ccontractual dignity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the trial court, expressly preserving the right of both parties to access the trial court for enforcement of the agreement through the decree, with such relief, if any, as the court may deem appropriate, or to pursue any contractual remedies otherwise available.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">.
