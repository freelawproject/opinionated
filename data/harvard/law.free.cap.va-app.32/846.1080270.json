(father) appeals from the dismissal of his challenge to the adoption of his son, J.B., by the child\u2019s maternal grandmother, G.F.M. (grandmother). The trial court granted grandmother\u2019s demurrer on the ground that the challenge was untimely under Code \u00a7 63.1-237, which requires that such challenges be made within six months following entry of the final order of adoption, even if fraud or lack of notice to or personal jurisdiction over any person is shown. On appeal, father contends (1) application of the statute\u2019s six-month limitation period violated his due process and equal protection rights under the facts of this case, which include his allegations that grandmother committed extrinsic and intrinsic fraud such that father never received notice of the proceedings and the court never obtained personal jurisdiction over father; and (2) the circuit court erroneously failed to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>and to consider the issue of visitation. We hold that application of the time limitation imposed in Code \u00a7 63.1-237 was unconstitutional under the facts alleged in father\u2019s petition and, therefore, that the circuit court erroneously granted grandmother\u2019s demurrer. We also hold the trial court did not err in refusing to act on father\u2019s request for visitation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for J.B. because, unless and until the adoption order is set aside, father lacks standing to make such requests. We reverse the ruling of the trial court granting the demurrer, vacate its order of dismissal, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Because this case involves the granting of a demurrer, we accept as true, for purposes of reviewing this motion only, all facts alleged in the petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-273; <em>Runion v. Helvestine, </em>256 Va. 1, 7, 501 S.E.2d 411, 415 (1998). \u201cA demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. Under this rule, the facts admitted are those expressly alleged, those which fairly can be viewed as impliedly alleged, and those which may be fairly and justly inferred from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Rosillo v. Winters, </em>235 Va. 268, 270, 367 S.E.2d 717, 717 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">In late September 1995, father, his approximately fourteen-month-old son J.B., and the child\u2019s biological mother C.B., were involved in an automobile accident in which C.B. was killed and J.B. was seriously injured. For ten months prior to the accident, father, C.B. and J.B. resided together. J.B. had \u201cspent the majority of his life in [the] home\u201d shared by father and C.B. That \u201chousehold did not include [grandmother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>G.F.M.],\u201d C.B.\u2019s mother. The record does not reveal where J.B. and C.B. resided for the first four months of J.B.\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Following the accident, J.B. was hospitalized, and father \u201cstayed at his side ... for several weeks.\u201d It was father\u2019s understanding that J.B. would require constant medical care following his release from the hospital, and father and grandmother agreed that grandmother would care for J.B. in her home following his release from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">At the time of the accident, father, a native Spanish speaker, could not read English. After C.B.\u2019s death, father relied on grandmother for assistance in completing paperwork. On October 12, 1995, at grandmother\u2019s request, father signed a \u201cConsent to Adoption\u201d form by which he purported to consent to grandmother\u2019s adopting J.B. The caption on the form read, \u201cIn the matter of an adoption of a child known as [J.B.] ... by [G.F.M., grandmother].\u201d Father signed the consent in grandmother\u2019s lawyer\u2019s office, in the presence of a notary but without counsel or an interpreter. Father was not aware of the content of the form he signed and relied on grandmother\u2019s representations that his execution of the form \u201cwas merely to allow [grandmother] to have access to medical information and accompany [J.B.] to appointments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">After father signed the consent form, grandmother petitioned the circuit court to adopt her grandson, J.B., including with her petition the \u201cConsent to Adoption\u201d form executed by father. In her petition, she falsely represented that J.B. had lived in her home \u201ccontinuously for his whole life\u201d and that J.B.\u2019s mother, C.B., also had resided \"with grandmother until the time of her death. The court ruled that, pursuant to Code \u00a7 63.1-223(E), it was \u201cproper to proceed without the investigations and report required by Section 63.1-223,\u201d and by order entered October 24, 1995, it decreed J.B. the adopted child of grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">Other than father\u2019s execution of the consent to adoption form, which he could not read, father received no notice of the adoption. He was not served with a copy of the petition or the final order. The order was entered against his wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Following C.B.\u2019s death and J.B.\u2019s release from the hospital, J.B. resided primarily with grandmother, but both before and after entry of the adoption order, father \u201c[saw] and care[d] for [J.B.] several times per week, including overnight visits in [father\u2019s] home on weekends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">In February 1997, father remarried in a ceremony held in grandmother\u2019s home. Father and his new wife \u201ccontinued the established pattern of frequent and prolonged visitation with [J.B.] in their home and [grandmother\u2019s] home. Some of these visits lasted for two weeks or more, and at least one included a trip out of state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">In February 1998, father and his new wife informed grandmother that they wished to have J.B. live in their household. At that time, grandmother informed father that she had adopted J.B. in October 1995. Grandmother has prevented father from having any additional contact with J.B. since that time and has served father and his wife with trespassing notices to prevent them from coming to her home to see J.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">On September 24, 1998, father filed a petition to set aside the adoption order, claiming grandmother committed extrinsic and intrinsic fraud, and that application of the six-month statute of limitations to prevent a challenge \u201cbased on lack of personal jurisdiction, lack of notice, duress, and fraud\u201d violated his due process and equal protection rights. He sought to have the statute declared unconstitutional as applied to him, to have the adoption order declared void, and to be awarded regular visitation with his son until his parental rights were restored. He also sought appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Grandmother filed a demurrer, asserting that the statute was constitutional and barred father from seeking relief. She also contended that father lacked standing to request visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">The trial court held that the petition and consent for adoption provided it with jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 63.1-220.3(C)(6) to enter the final adoption order. With the passage of more than six months time following that entry, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>court held that Code \u00a7 63.1-237 prevented father from attacking the order. It stated expressly, \u201cThe court does not see the need to pass upon the constitutionality of the statute,\u201d and it did not do so, despite father\u2019s repeated requests for consideration of this issue. It also said, \u201cI see nothing ... preventing the birth father and his wife [from] fil[ing] a petition for the adoption of his birth-son who is now legally the child of the grandparents. It may well be that the best interests of the child would govern the outcome of that action which may or may not be the same outcome that now exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Father filed a motion to reconsider, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">CONSTITUTIONALITY OF CODE \u00a7 63.1-237 AS APPLIED TO FATHER</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Code \u00a7 63.1-237 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-11\">After the expiration of six months from the date of entry of any final order of adoption from which no appeal has been taken to the Court of Appeals, the validity thereof shall not be subject to attack in any proceedings, collateral or direct, for any reason, including but not limited to fraud, duress, failure to give any required notice, failure of any procedural requirement, or lack of jurisdiction over any person, and such order shall be final for all purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">This statute roughly tracks the language of the Revised Uniform Adoption Act, except that the Uniform Act provides for a one-year limitation period. <em>See </em>Revised Unif. Adoption Act (RUAA) \u00a7 15(b) (amended 1971), 9 U.L.A. 203 (1999); <em>see also </em>Uniform Adoption Act \u00a7 3-707(d) (1994), 9 U.L.A. 97-98 (providing that, without exception, a decree of adoption \u201cis not subject to a challenge begun more than six months after the decree or order is issued\u201d). The commentary accompanying the RUAA \u201cexplains that it is designed to impose a very short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>statute of limitation\u201d because \u201c \u2018[t]he policy of stability in a family relationship, particularly when a young minor is involved, outweighs the possible loss to a person whose rights are cut off through fraud and ignorance.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKinney v. Ivey, </em>287 Ark. 300, 698 S.W.2d 506, 507 (1985) (quoting 9 U.L.A. 48 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Father concedes that literal application of the statute would bar his petition to set aside the adoption. The adoption was effected by order entered October 24, 1995; his petition was filed on September 24, 1998, well outside the six-month limitation period. He contends, however, that application of Code \u00a7 63.1-237\u2019s limitation period to bar his challenge to the validity of the adoption violated his due process and equal protection rights. We agree that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-6\">The due process clauses of the Federal and Virginia Constitutions provide that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-7\">All actions of the General Assembly are presumed to be constitutional. Thus, courts will declare an enactment unconstitutional only when it clearly is repugnant to some provision of either the state or federal constitution. The party challenging the enactment has the burden of proving its unconstitutionality, and if a reasonable doubt exists as to its constitutionality, the doubt must be resolved in favor of its validity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-8\">Generally, due process is satisfied if an enactment has a \u201creasonable relation to a proper purpose and [is] neither arbitrary nor discriminatory.\u201d Thus, under the general rule, a statute is not violative of due process if it withstands a \u201crational basis\u201d test. When, however, a statute affects a fundamental right or a suspect classification, its constitutionality will be judged by the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-9\"><em>Hess v. Snyder Hunt Corp., </em>240 Va. 49, 52-53, 392 S.E.2d 817, 820 (1990) (citations omitted). When a statute \u201csignificantly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right, it cannot be upheld unless it is supported by sufficiently important state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>interests and is closely tailored to effectuate only those interests.\u201d <em>Zablocki v.

Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 256-58, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 2990-91, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-6\">In the vast majority of cases, state law determines the final outcome---- In some cases, however, this Court has held that the Federal Constitution supersedes state law and provides even greater protection for certain <em>formal </em>family relationships.... In these cases the court has found that the relationship of love and duty in a recognized family unit is an interest in liberty entitled to constitutional protection. \u201c[S]tate intervention to terminate [such a] relationship ... must be accomplished by procedures meeting the requisites of the Due Process Clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 256-58, 103 S.Ct. at 2991 (quoting <em>Santosky v.

The Court has drawn a clear distinction between \u201ca mere biological relationship and an actual relationship of parental responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259-60, 103 S.Ct. at 2992.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-11\">The difference between the developed parent-child relationship ... and the potential relationship ... is both clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>significant. When an unwed father demonstrates a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by \u201ccom[ing] forward to participate in the rearing of his child,\u201d his interest in personal contact with his child acquires substantial protection under the Due Process Clause. At that point it may be said that he \u201cact[s] as a father toward his children.\u201d ... [T]he mere existence of a biological link does not merit equivalent constitutional protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 261, 103 S.Ct. at 2993 (quoting <em>Caban v. Mohammed, </em>441 U.S. 380, 389 n. 7, 392, 99 S.Ct. 1760, 1766 n. 7, 1768, 60 L.Ed.2d 297 (1979)). Therefore, a biological parent who participates in the rearing of his or her child has a fundamental right to continue to participate in that relationship unless the relationship is altered or terminated by due process of law. <em>See id.; see also McKinney, </em>698 S.W.2d at 508; <em>Wade v. Geren, </em>743 P.2d 1070, 1073-74 (Okla.1987) (affirming trial court\u2019s ruling that father who had established relationship with child had due process right to notice of grandparents\u2019 adoption petition and that grandparents\u2019 failure to disclose father\u2019s identity and pending paternity action constituted fraud which rendered the adoption decree void, despite statute providing that void decree could not be attacked after one year).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">In father\u2019s case, based on the facts alleged in his petition to set aside the adoption, father had a fundamental right to have his already-established relationship with his biological child not terminated without due process. Because the limitation period contained in Code \u00a7 63.1-237 affected father\u2019s fundamental right to maintain that relationship with his son, we evaluate its constitutionality, as applied to the facts of this case, under the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test. <em>See Hess, </em>240 Va. at 52-53, 392 S.E.2d at 820. The statute \u201csignificantly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right,\u201d and \u201cit cannot be upheld unless it is supported by sufficiently important state interests and is closely tailored to effectuate only those interests.\u201d <em>Zablocki, </em>434 U.S. at 388, 98 S.Ct. at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>We agree that the state has a compelling interest in \u201c \u2018[preserving] stability in a family relationship, particularly when a young minor is involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKinney, </em>698 S.W.2d at 507. We disagree, however, that application of the six-month statute of limitation under the facts of this case is sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of stability while simultaneously preserving father\u2019s fundamental right to continue the pre-existing relationship with his biological child. The father\u2019s petition to set aside the adoption alleges that the child resided with his mother and father for ten months prior to being injured in a car accident at fourteen months of age. Father remained at his child\u2019s bedside throughout the course of his hospitalization. Although father and grandmother agreed that grandmother would take care of the child upon his release from the hospital because he would require constant attention due to his injuries, father did not abandon his relationship with his son. To the contrary, the child routinely resided with father overnight on the weekends, and father \u201c[saw] and care[d] for\u201d the child during the week, as well. When father remarried about one and one-half years later, he and his new wife \u201ccontinued the established pattern of frequent and prolonged visitation with [J.B.] in their home and [grandmother\u2019s] home. Some of these visits lasted for two weeks or more, and at least one included a trip out of state.\u201d Under the facts alleged, father was no stranger to his child. Therefore, allowing father to attack the order of adoption more than six months after its entry based on grandmother\u2019s alleged fraud, and the resulting lack of notice and personal jurisdiction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>would not have jeopardized the state\u2019s compelling interest in maintaining the stability of the family relationship. Grandmother\u2019s refusal to allow father any contact with the child likely has been more disruptive than an order setting aside the adoption would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Assuming without deciding that father had a duty to act diligently to preserve his rights, no evidence indicates that he failed to do so. <em>Cf. Drummond v. Drummond, </em>123 N.M. 727, 945 P.2d 457, 462 (Ct.App.1997) (in applying equitable estoppel to hold that adopting grandparents could not assert statute of limitations defense to bar mother\u2019s challenge to adoption, noting that no evidence showed mother did not act diligently in failing to challenge adoption earlier because \u201cthere was never a change of living circumstances until after the statute of limitations had run\u201d). He was unable to read English and reasonably relied on grandmother\u2019s representations that the purpose of the \u201cConsent to Adoption\u201d form was merely to allow grandmother access to the child\u2019s medical records since she would be assuming primary responsibility for the child\u2019s medical care. Until grandmother told father of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>the adoption over two years later, father had no reason to know that his parental rights had been terminated. He and grandmother both continued to care for the child as they had agreed to do prior to the adoption, and no substantive changes occurred in the relationship. <em>Cf. id. </em>Grandmother\u2019s fraud in misrepresenting to father the effect of the Consent to Adoption form and in misrepresenting to the court the parties\u2019 living arrangements prior to the adoption constituted extrinsic and intrinsic fraud sufficient to require the denial of grandmother\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">In summary, we hold, in regard only to grandmother\u2019s demurrer, that application of the six-month statute of limitation to father was unconstitutional and that the adoption decree was void <em>ab initio </em>based on grandmother\u2019s alleged fraud and the resulting lack of notice to and personal jurisdiction over father. Therefore, the trial court erroneously granted grandmother\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">VISITATION AND APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN <em>AD LITEM</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKA\">Father also contests the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant him visitation and to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem. </em>We hold, however, that father lacked standing to make such a request as long as the order of adoption remains in effect; thus, we hold that the trial court did not err in failing to grant visitation. Code \u00a7 20-124.1 provides that only a person \u201cwith a legitimate interest\u201d has standing to request custody or visitation and that \u201c[a] party with a legitimate interest ... shall not include any person ... whose parental rights have been terminated by court order, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\u201d <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 63.1-233 (providing that final order of adoption divests birth parents of right to petition for visitation). Therefore, father will not have standing to request visitation unless or until the trial court rules in his-favor on the merits by setting aside the adoption order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>same reasons, the court had no duty to act on father\u2019s request for the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">For these reasons, we reverse the decision of the trial court, vacate its order dismissing father\u2019s petition, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">\n<em>Reversed, vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-9\">. For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, the court must accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint or petition. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-273; <em>Runion v. Helvestine, </em>256 Va. 1, 7, 501 S.E.2d 411, 415 (1998). In subsequent stages of the proceedings, however, the court, as the finder of fact, remains free to review the evidence independently and to conclude that it does not support the allegations in the complaint or petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-10\">. In its order granting the demurrer, the circuit court considered a few additional facts not included in father's petition. Because grandmother posed no objection to the court\u2019s consideration of these facts at the trial level, we include these facts on appeal in reviewing the lower court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b904-5\">. Although the court may have believed it acquired personal jurisdiction based on father\u2019s execution of the Consent to Adoption form, the acquisition of personal jurisdiction is based on the receipt of notice which complies with the Due Process Clause. <em>See Price v. Price, </em>17 Va.App. 105, 112, 435 S.E.2d 652, 657 (1993) (citing <em>Kulko v. Superior Ct., </em>436 U.S. 84, 91, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 1696, 56 L.Ed.2d 132 (1978)). Due process requires \" 'notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019 \u201d <em>Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 550, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1190, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965) (quoting <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)). In this case, like in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number><em>Armstrong, </em>father \"did not have ... the slightest inkling of the pendency of [the] adoption proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548, 85 S.Ct. at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">We assume without deciding that father\u2019s execution of the Consent to Adoption form, filed by grandmother along with the petition for adoption, constituted an appearance before the court sufficient to permit the court to infer father\u2019s receipt of notice and submission to the jurisdiction of the court. Nevertheless, father\u2019s petition to set aside alleged that he had no understanding of the content of the form and relied on the representations of grandmother \u2014 who could reasonably have been expected to know of the language barrier \u2014 that the Consent to Adoption form was merely to facilitate her oversight of the child\u2019s medical care. Under these circumstances, execution of the form was not \"notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d Once the court became aware of these allegations, it had a duty to evaluate the adequacy of the notice and jurisdiction. <em>See In re Rabatin, </em>83 Ohio App.3d 836, 615 N.E.2d 1099, 1102 (1992) (holding that mother was \"presumed to have had actual notice of the adoption, and to have effectively waived the notice requirement\u201d where she signed a consent to adoption form and the record contained no evidence that she was \"unable to read or otherwise could not understand the consent form she signed\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b906-8\">. Contrary to the statement of the trial court in its letter opinion, this lack of standing would also prevent father from having any meaningful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>ability to petition to adopt J.B. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 63.1-233 (providing that final order of adoption divests birth parents \"of all legal rights and obligations in respect to the child\u201d); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 647-48, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1211, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972) (noting that equal protection violation resulting from Illinois statute providing for automatic termination of parental rights of unwed father on death of mother was not remedied by fact that father had right to petition for adoption of children because Illinois law considered him \"a stranger to his children,\u201d provided him \"no priority in adoption proceedings,\u201d and required him \"to establish not only that he would be a suitable parent but also that he would be the most suitable of all who might want custody of the children\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b907-9\">BUMGARDNER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AB-\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">I respectfully dissent from the majority. I believe the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">The father brought his petition under Code \u00a7 8.01-428(D). That section preserves the common law \u201cindependent action\u201d for obtaining equitable relief from a judgment. <em>See </em>Kent Sinclair &amp; Leigh B. Middleditch, Jr., <em>Virginia Civil Procedure </em>\u00a7 11.4, at 479 (3rd ed.1998). The elements of that action are well defined and include \u201c \u2018the absence of fault or negligence on the part of the [petitioner].\u2019 \u201d <em>Charles v. Precision Tune, Inc., 243 </em>Va. 313, 318, 414 S.E.2d 831, 833 (1992) (citation omitted). The father\u2019s fault or negligence in signing a document he could not read is apparent from his pleading. Thus, the petition fails to plead sufficient facts to permit his action. <em>See id. </em>The demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>I would affirm the trial court and refrain from declaring the statute of limitations unconstitutional.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
