Island Creek Coal Company contends the evidence did not support the award. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The parties stipulated that Miller received a communication of a diagnosis of occupational disease on July 13,1998 and that he was last injuriously exposed to coal dust while working in Island Creek\u2019s coal mine. The record also contains a report from Dr. Kishor Pathak in which he opined, after reviewing Miller\u2019s x-rays, that Miller has \u201csimple pneumoconiosis category p/q, 1/2\u201d and emphysema.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">The commission forwarded Miller\u2019s x-rays to the Medical College of Virginia\u2019s Pulmonary Committee for its review and report. The committee consisted of three doctors, all of whom are \u201cB\u201d readers. <em>See Penley v. Island Creek Coal Co., 8 </em>Va.App. 310, 318, 381 S.E.2d 231, 236 (1989) (noting that \u201c[t]he rating of \u2018B\u2019 apparently denotes a reader of greater proficiency and expertise than \u2018A\u2019 readers\u201d); <em>see also Tiller v. Island Creek Coal Co., </em>67 VWC 136, 137 (1988) (where the commission has noted that \u201cB\u201d readers are \u201cphysicians who have received special training in the interpretation of chest x-rays and the application of the I.L.O. and U.I.C.C. Cincinnati standards which have been adopted by the Commission as a guide in determining [pneumoconiosis]\u201d). The committee reviewed the x-rays and reported that it found parenchymal abnormalities consistent with pneumoconiosis but no pleural abnormalities consistent with pneumoconiosis. Dr. Kevin R. Cooper, a member of the committee, testified by deposition that Miller\u2019s x-ray was typical of mild asbestosis. Dr. Daniel A. Henry, another member of the committee, also testified by deposition that Miller\u2019s x-ray patterns were consistent with asbestosis. Dr. Henry further testified that the committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>does not \u201cknow what the exposures are of any of the people whose films that we read.\u201d Three doctors who reviewed Miller\u2019s x-ray at Island Creek\u2019s request reported that it was negative for pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Affirming the deputy commissioner\u2019s award to Miller, the commission found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-5\">A preponderance of the evidence proved [Miller] has pneumoconiosis. Dr. Pathak believed [Miller] has coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. The pulmonary committee, while opining the x-rays were not consistent with coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, stated the x-rays were consistent with a number of diseases including asbestosis. Asbestosis is a type of pneumoconiosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-6\">Since the medical evidence establishes [Miller] has a pneumoconiosis and the employer stipulated he was exposed to coal dust, [Code] \u00a7 65.2-504(C) mandates the finding that [Miller] is conclusively presumed to have coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis. As held in <em>Fleming v. Lambert Coal Co., </em>74 OWC 183 (1995), where there is a question whether the claimant has coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis or another type of pneumoconiosis, Code \u00a7 65.2-504(0 provides that it shall be conclusively presumed a claimant has coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis if a claimant with pneumoconiosis is injuriously exposed to coal dust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Island Creek appeals from this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Code \u00a7 65.2-504(C) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-10\">In any case where there is a question of whether a claimant with pneumoconiosis is suffering from coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis or from some other type of pneumoconiosis such as silicosis, it shall be conclusively presumed that he is suffering from coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis if he has had injurious exposure to coal dust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">In addition, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act states that \u201c[p]neumoconiosis ... includ[es] but [is] not limited to silicosis and asbestosis.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B)(17).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Applying these statutes to the evidence in the record, the commission ruled that Miller \u201cis conclusively presumed to have coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis because the majority of experts believe he has some form of pneumoconiosis and the parties have stipulated to his injurious exposure to coal dust.\u201d We hold that credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s findings and that the commission\u2019s ruling is consistent with Code \u00a7 65.2-504(C). Accordingly, we affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
