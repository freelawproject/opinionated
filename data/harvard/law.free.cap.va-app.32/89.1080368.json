On appeal, employer argues that: (1) the commission applied an improper standard in determining whether claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome constituted an injury by accident; and (2) the evidence was insufficient to show a causal relationship be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tween the injury and claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">On February 4, 1998, claimant, an airplane fueler, was connecting a fuel hose to an aircraft in extremely cold weather. He was wearing protective gloves. As claimant \u201cstarted to elevate the nozzle and hose to the adapter on the aircraft,\u201d he felt the sudden onset of pain extending from the tip of the fingers of his right hand down his right shoulder. He lost strength in his right hand and had to use his left hand to support his right hand and arm. He completed the fueling assignment and removed his glove. He noticed a puncture wound on the dorsum of his right hand. Claimant continued his refueling duties, although he experienced pain and numbness in his right hand and arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">When he could no longer work, he reported the incident to his supervisor and sought treatment in the emergency room of Columbia Pentagon City Hospital. Dr. James Eschew diagnosed an \u201cacute contusion with flap laceration \u2014 deep bruise with cut.\u201d Claimant was released to return to work the following day with instructions to keep his right hand clean and dry for four days.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Claimant returned to work and performed' his regular duties. On February 19, 1998, he again sought emergency room treatment, reporting a history of right hand numbness of two weeks duration. The emergency room record referred to the February 4, 1998 injury. Claimant was diagnosed as suffering from dysesthesia in the fingers of his right hand. The disability form completed by the emergency room physician contained a diagnosis of \u201cprobable carpal tunnel syn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>drome.\u201d Claimant was given lifting restrictions but did not return to work because the employer did not have light duty work available. Claimant testified that he never experienced the right arm symptoms prior to the February 4, 1998 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Claimant was eventually referred to Dr. Edward Alexander, an orthopedic surgeon, to address his continuing complaints of right hand numbness. In an office note dated March 16, 1998, Dr. Alexander reported that x-rays of the wrist and thumb showed no arthritis. At that time, Dr. Alexander believed claimant suffered from \u201csynovitis in the thumb carpometacarpal joint which should settle down.\u201d On April 28, 1998, Dr. Alexander reported that claimant\u2019s \u201cright hand remains numb in the pattern of the median nerve distribution.\u201d On May 14, 1998, Dr. Alexander noted that since the February 4, 1998 injury, claimant suffered from \u201cnumbness\u201d in the median nerve. Because claimant also reported pain in his left shoulder from a prior injury, Dr. Alexander clarified that he was only treating claimant for \u201cthe injury of 02/04/98, when he was fueling a plane and had his arm give way because of pain, sustaining a laceration to the dorsum of the hand.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Claimant underwent an MRI examination of his right hand and wrist, which showed \u201cdefinite mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.\u201d Dr. Alexander opined that claimant\u2019s right carpal tunnel syndrome was directly related to the February 4, 1998 incident and injury. Dr. Alexander recommended that claimant undergo surgical correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">On May 16, 1998, claimant was evaluated by Dr. Leo Goldhammer, a neurologist. Dr. Goldhammer diagnosed a \u201c[tjraumatic injury of the distal nerves to the digits and dorsum of the hand\u201d and \u201cfr]ight sided carpal tunnel syn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>drome, mild to moderate form.\u201d Dr. Goldhammer offered no conclusive opinion as to the cause of claimant\u2019s right carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">At employer\u2019s request, claimant was examined by Dr. Kevin Hanley, an orthopedist, on September 1, 1998. Dr. Hanley diagnosed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, right greater than left. Based on the history given to him by claimant, Dr. Hanley concluded that the puncture wound sustained on February 4, 1998 did not cause the carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Dr. Paul A. Devore, claimant\u2019s family physician, examined claimant on September 15, 1998. Dr. Devore opined that claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome was causally related to his work injury. \u201cThe puncture wou[n]d of the right hand is a distraction from the fact that he did indeed develop a carpal tunnel type neuropathy of that hand/wrist area as a result of the incident of 2/4/98.\u201d Dr. Devore also concluded the neuropathy that resulted in claimant\u2019s right hand \u201cwas due to <em>abnormal physical stress placed on the hand as he was trying to lift that refueling hose with this exceedingly painfully punctured right hand.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Claimant proceeded on the basis of an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101. In its opinion, the commission held that the \u201cburden is on [claimant] to show that he suffered <em>an injury by accident </em>arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d (Emphasis added). The commission found that claimant suffered an \u201cidentifiable incident\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-101, stating the following: \u201c[T]he \u2018identifiable incident\u2019 in this case commenced when the claimant felt a sudden onset of pain in the right arm while lifting the fuel hose and adapter above shoulder level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Concluding that claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel injury was causally related to the February 4,1998 incident, the commission found \u201cthe opinion of Dr. Alexander, the treating physician, to be more persuasive.\u201d The commission made it clear \u201cthe puncture wound did not cause claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome, ... the puncture wound is separate from the carpal tunnel syndrome\u201d and \u201cthe weight of the evidence establishes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the claimant experienced right arm and hand symptoms immediately after the precipitating event.\u201d Accordingly, the commission awarded disability compensation benefits for claimant\u2019s \u201cinjury by accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">II. INJURY BY ACCIDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">This case represents the next step in a long Tine of cases addressing the compensability of carpal tunnel syndrome. Proceeding on a theory of \u201cinjury by accident\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101, claimant alleged that his right carpal tunnel syndrome was a compensable work-related injury. The commission agreed and found that claimant proved an \u201cidentifiable incident\u201d on February 4, 1998, and a causal connection between that incident and claimant\u2019s condition. In so doing, the commission held that carpal tunnel syndrome may be a compensable \u201cinjury by accident\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101 or a compensable \u201cordinary disease of life\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-401, depending upon the cause and how the condition develops. Whether carpal tunnel syndrome may be incurred as a result of an injury by accident under Code \u00a7 65.2-101, or whether a carpal tunnel syndrome <em>must always </em>be considered an occupational disease, is an issue of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-100 to -1310, \u201ca claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence either an \u2018injury by accident\u2019 or an \u2018occupational disease.\u2019 \u201d <em>A New Leaf, Inc. v. Webb, </em>257 Va. 190, 195, 511 S.E.2d 102, 104 (1999) (citations omitted). The term \u201cinjury by accident\u201d is defined as an \u201cidentifiable incident or sudden precipitating event [that results] in an obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body.\u201d <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 589, 385 S.E.2d 858, 865 (1989) (citation omitted); <em>see Chesterfield Co. v. Dunn, </em>9 Va.App. 475, 476, 389 S.E.2d 180, 181 (1990). An \u201cinjury by accident\u201d requires proof of \u201c(1) an identifiable incident; (2) that occurs at some reasonably definite' time; (3) an obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body; and (4) a causal connection between the incident and the bodily change.\u201d <em>Dunn, </em>9 Va.App. at 476, 389 S.E.2d at 181.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u201cIt is apparent from the language employed by the drafters of the Act that it was originally intended to provide coverage for the most frequently recurring kinds of industrial accidents, e.g., injuries immediately resulting from hazards of the workplace such as blows from falling objects ...

The more difficult issue through the years has been \u201cwhether an injury resulting from repetitive trauma, continuing mental or physical stress, or other cumulative events, amounts to an \u2018injury by accident\u2019 within the meaning of [the Act].... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 385 S.E.2d at 859-60.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><em>Southern Express v. Green, </em>257 Va. 181, 186, 509 S.E.2d 836, 839 (1999). Because carpal tunnel syndrome has been treated as a cumulative trauma injury in numerous cases, and more recently the General Assembly has provided special coverage for the condition as an \u201cordinary disease of life\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-401, we must determine whether the condition may also be compensable as an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d when it is causally related to a single, identifiable incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In the most recent Supreme Court decision addressing carpal tunnel syndrome, <em>The Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, </em>251 Va. 186, 467 S.E.2d 795 (1996), the Court held as a matter of law that <em>repetitive motion injuries </em>such as \u201ccarpal tunnel syndrome\u201d and \u201ctenosynovitis\u201d are not compensable conditions under the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 189-91, 199, 467 S.E.2d at 797-98, 802. In determining that these conditions did not constitute <em>occupational diseases, </em>the Supreme Court made it clear that \u201cjob-related impairments resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion, however labeled or however defined, are, as a matter of law, not compensable under the present provisions of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 467 S.E.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In response to <em>Stenrich, </em>in 1997 the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 65.2-400 to provide that \u201ccondition[s] of carpal tunnel syndrome are not occupational diseases but are ordinary diseases of life as defined in [Code] \u00a7 65.2-401.\u201d The General Assembly also amended Code \u00a7 65.2-401 to provide that the elements required to prove a compensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ordinary disease of life must be \u201cestablished by clear and convincing evidence, (not a mere probability).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See also National Fruit Prod.

Parks, </em>246 Va. 429, 433-34, 436 S.E.2d 600, 602 (1993) (holding that a torn rotator cuff was not a compensable \u201coccupational disease\u201d under the Act because the condition was not a disease, but rather was an injury caused by repetitive trauma); <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. at 589, 385 S.E.2d at 865 (concluding that \u201cinjuries resulting from repetitive trauma, continuing mental or physical stress, or other cumulative events, as well as injuries sustained at an unknown time, are not \u2018injuries by accident\u2019 within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.1-7 [now Code \u00a7 65.2-101]\u201d); <em>Aistrop v.

However, these cases do not preclude a finding that carpal tunnel syndrome, in an appropriate case supported by credible evidence in the record, may be the result of an \u201cidentifiable incident,\u201d bringing the injury within the purview of Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The Supreme Court has consistently recognized that a claimant may recover compensation benefits by meeting the requirements of an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>101. <em>See Green, </em>257 Va. at 187, 509 S.E.2d at 839 (citing <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. at 589, 385 S.E.2d at 864-65; <em>Aistrop, </em>181 Va. at 293, 24 S.E.2d at 548 (other citations omitted)). While a majority of the cases have addressed carpal tunnel syndrome as either a repetitive injury or an occupational disease, none have considered whether the condition may be the result of one single act or identifiable incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The Act makes a distinction between an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d and an \u201coccupational disease.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-101 (defining \u201cinjury\u201d); Code \u00a7 65.2-400 (defining \u201coccupational disease\u201d); <em>see also Holly Farms v.

Additionally, the Supreme Court has recognized that the term \u201cdisease\u201d does not equate with the term \u201cinjury.\u201d <em>Stenrich, </em>251 Va. at 193 n. 1, 467 S.E.2d at 799 n. 1. The term \u201cinjury\u201d does not include a disease in any form, as used in Code \u00a7 65.2-101, but is \u201clanguage of limitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, \u201cjust because a doctor opines that a particular impairment is a disease does not necessarily make it so.... [Wjhether a claimant suffers from a disease within the contemplation of the Act is a mixed question of law and fact, and whether a proper definition has been used to test the authenticity of a doctor\u2019s opinion is strictly a legal one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 467 S.E.2d at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u201cA disease is a condition which may arise from any number of causes, including trauma, that impairs the function of the body or any part thereof.\u201d <em>Perdue Farms, Inc. v. McCutchan, </em>21 Va.App. 65, 71, 461 S.E.2d 431, 434 (1995). \u201cThe distinction between injury and disease lies in the \u2018obvious sudden mechanical or structural\u2019 aspect of injury.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>A. Larson, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 41.13 (noting that the traditional distinction between \u201coccupational diseases\u201d and \u201caccidental injuries\u201d was \u201cboth the fact that [diseases] could not be said to be unexpected, since they were recognized as inherent hazard of continued exposure to conditions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>particular employment, and the fact that [diseases] were gradual rather than sudden in onset\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In light of these distinctions, we conclude that a claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome may be compensable as an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d or an \u201coccupational disease,\u201d depending on how it develops. <em>See Rocco Turkeys, Inc. v.

Accordingly, we hold that carpal tunnel syndrome may qualify as an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101 or as an \u201coccupational disease\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-401, depending upon its pathology or how it is incurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would differentiate one type of injury by accident from all others, an outcome not sanctioned by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">We must also determine whether the commission applied the proper burden of proof in finding that claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome was compensable under the Act. Because claimant suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome, a condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tion specifically provided for in Code \u00a7 65.2-401, employer argues that claimant was required to prove his claim \u2014 even if an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d \u2014 by a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard. The commission rejected employer\u2019s argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">Code Section 65.2-400 defining the term \u201coccupational disease\u201d was amended to provide that, effective July 1, 1997, carpal tunnel syndrome would not [be] considered an occupational disease but is an ordinary disease of life as defined in 65.2-401. <em>This does not, as urged by the employer, mean that, by extension, all carpal tunnel cases should be subject to the higher burden of proof under Section 65.2-401 of clear and convincing evidence rather than a mere preponderance.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">If such were the true [sic], any claimant alleging carpal tunnel syndrome as a compensable consequence of his industrial accident would be required to meet the statutory burden under that Code Section. This is inconsistent with existing case law. The intent of the General Assembly when amending Section 65.2-400 was to delineate which Code Section carpal tunnel syndrome should be considered when the claimant was proceeding under an occupational disease theory, <em>not to require claimant\u2019s [sic] to meet a higher burden of proof in all carpal tunnel syndrome cases, regardless of the theory.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">(Emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">We conclude the commission applied the proper burden of proof in determining whether claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome was compensable under the Act. While the heightened burden of proof of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d is required for those \u201cordinary disease of life\u201d claims brought under Code \u00a7 65.2-401,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a claimant is required to prove an \u201cinjury by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>accident\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101 by only a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Webb, </em>257 Va. at 195, 511 S.E.2d at 104; <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. at 584, 385 S.E.2d at 862 (citing <em>A.N.

Thus, it is clear that \u201c[t]he claimant had' the burden of establishing, <em>by a preponderance of the evidence, </em>and not merely by conjecture or speculation, that [he] suffered an injury by accident which arose out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d <em>Central State Hosp. v.

As he lifted the hose and adapter above his shoulders, he felt the sudden onset of pain extending from the fingers of his right hand to his right shoulder. The disability form completed by the emergency room physician contained a diagnosis of \u201cprobable carpal tunnel syndrome.\u201d Claimant was eventually referred to Dr. Alexander, who diagnosed him as suffering from right carpal tunnel syndrome. Dr. Alexander ultimately opined that claimant\u2019s right carpal tunnel syndrome was directly related to the February 4, 1998 incident and he recommended that claimant undergo surgical correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u201cMedical evidence is not necessarily conclusive, but is subject to the commission\u2019s consideration and weighing.\u201d <em>Hungerford Mechanical Corp. v. Hobson, </em>11 Va.App. 675, 677, 401 S.E.2d 213, 214 (1991). In its role as fact finder, the commission was entitled to weigh the medical evidence. The commission did so and specifically found Dr. Alexander\u2019s opinion \u201cto be more persuasive,\u201d while rejecting the contrary medical opinions. <em>See Fingles Co. v. Tatterson, </em>22 Va.App. 638, 641, 472 S.E.2d 646, 647 (1996) (the opinion of a treating physician is entitled to great weight). Dr. Alexander\u2019s opinion, coupled with claimant\u2019s testimony, constitutes credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding that claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>proved a causal connection between his right carpal tunnel syndrome and his February 4,1998 injury by accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">This conclusion is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green, 257 </em>Va. 181, 509 S.E.2d 836. In <em>Green, </em>the Supreme Court considered \u201cwhether chilblains that the claimant suffered as a result of being exposed to cold temperature in a walk-in cooler during a four-hour period constituted an \u2018injury by accident\u2019 under [the Act].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 509 S.E.2d at 837. When the claimant filed her claim for compensation benefits, she alleged an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101. Outlining the appropriate test, the Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">[T]o establish an \u201cinjury by accident,\u201d a claimant must prove (1) that the injury appeared suddenly at a particular time and place and upon a particular occasion, (2) that it was caused by an identifiable incident or sudden precipitating event, and (3) that it resulted in an obvious mechanical or structural change in the human body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 187, 509 S.E.2d at 839 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In <em>Green, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the claimant\u2019s chilblains were <em>not </em>an \u201c \u2018injury of gradual growth ... caused by the cumulative effect of <em>many acts done or many exposures </em>to conditions prevalent in the work, no one of which can be identified as the cause of the harm____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 509 S.E.2d at 841 (citations omitted). Rather, the evidence established that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">the chilblains were \u201cthe result of some particular piece of work done or condition encountered on a definite occasion----\u201d <em>[Aistrop, </em>181 Va. at 293, 24 S.E.2d at 548]. In other words, Green\u2019s chilblains resulted from a single exposure to cold temperature on a definite occasion during the performance of a specific piece of work, i.e., an \u201cidentifiable incident.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. at 589, 385 S.E.2d at 865. It was not caused by repeated exposures over a period of months or years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">Similar to the situation in <em>Green, </em>the evidence in the instant case proved that claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome was <em>not </em>an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>injury of gradual growth or the result of cumulative trauma. Indeed, the commission specifically found that claimant\u2019s injuries occurred while performing a single act, stating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\">The record establishes, and we so find, that <em>the \u201cidentifiable incident\u201d in this case commenced when the claimant felt a sudden onset of pain in the right arm while lifting the fuel hose and adapter above shoulder level. </em>He then lost strength shortly thereafter in his right arm. At some juncture during this incident the claimant also suffered a puncture wound to the dorsum of his right hand. As in a motor vehicle accident that can cause more than one structural or mechanical change in the body so too did this incident cause greater than one bodily change. The event causing these two insults to the body must be viewed as a unitary whole rather than two disparate occurrences. Regardless of the sequence, the injuries occurred while claimant was performing a <em>single act.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">(First emphasis added). Here, credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant proved (1) that his carpal tunnel syndrome appeared suddenly at a particular time and place and upon a particular occasion, (2) that it was caused by an identifiable incident or sudden precipitating event, and (3) that it resulted in an obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the human body. <em>See id. </em>at 187, 509 S.E.2d at 839. Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome constituted an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-9\">. Employer also contends the evidence does not support the alternative conclusion that claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome was a compensable consequence of the puncture wound to his hand on February 4, 1998. Claimant did not allege a compensable consequence injury, and the commission found that \"the puncture wound did not cause claimant\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\">. The record establishes that claimant\u2019s original claim included an injury to his left shoulder and to his right hand and arm as a result of the February <em>4, </em>1998 incident. However, the deputy commissioner found that claimant failed to prove causation of the left shoulder injury, and the full commission affirmed. Accordingly, the only issue before us is the claim for right carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">. We note that the amendment deleted from the statute the words \u201cto a reasonable medical certainty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\">.

In <em>Begley, </em>the claimant \"identified a sudden, specific precipitating event, and her testimony [was] uncontradicted and [was] corroborated by the medical evidence.\u201d The commission found that the claimant\u2019s injury \"was not a cumulative trauma injury, but an injury by accident compensable under the [Act], The claimant described a sudden onset of pain which occurred at a specific time and place while performing a single act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\">.
