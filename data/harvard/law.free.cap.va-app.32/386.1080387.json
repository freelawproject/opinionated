(\u201cemployer\u201d) and Travelers Indemnity Company of Illinois appeal the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s decision that the employer failed to enforce a safety rule and that Lynnecia Hagins\u2019 initial claim for benefits was not barred by the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">From September 1995 until November 1995, Hagins worked at Gwaltney of Smithfield in the Production Department. She was given instructions on \u201chand safety\u201d and was aware of the employer\u2019s published safety rule: \u201cNever put any body part, object or clothing into operating or cycling machinery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">In November 1995, Hagins was transferred to the Sanitation Department. Upon her transfer to the Sanitation Department, crew leader Chuck Jones and employee Russell Collins trained Hagins for one day on cleaning procedures. After her training, Hagins did not work in the pigs\u2019 feet room again until February 12, 1996. On February 13, 1996, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>cleaning the pigs\u2019 feet machine, Hagins turned the machine on, washed it with a hose and, in an effort to remove a piece of meat that was stuck, placed her right hand into the stationary-tray at the bottom of the machine that was designed to funnel the debris down a hole. Her hand was caught in the machine and was amputated. Hagins has not returned to work after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">On April 19, 1996, Hagins filed an application seeking an award for medical benefits and compensation for temporary total disability from February 14, 1996 and continuing from that date. The employer defended on the grounds that the accident was caused by Hagins\u2019 willful breach of a reasonable rule or regulation and that she was not disabled as alleged. The matter was heard before a deputy commissioner on September 10,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">At the hearing, Hagins testified that her direct supervisor, Jones, \u201cshowed [her] just stick your hand in it \u2014 [Jones] showed me to just stick your hand in and just scoop [the debris] down the hole.\u201d She testified that she was directed to stick her hand in the tray. She further stated that Jones demonstrated to her how to clean the tray by \u201cjust [sticking] his hand in there and just scoop[ing] it down the hole.\u201d Hagins was asked how she cleaned out the debris that \u201cbecame stuck in the machine.\u201d She replied, \u201cI always stuck my hand in and scooped it down the hole.\u201d She stated that the machine would be on and that she put her hand in the tray because \u201c[t]hat was the way [Jones] did it, the way, the way he showed [her].\u201d She testified that there were no signs instructing how to clean the machine or prohibiting the placement of hands in the tray area. When asked specifically about the incident, Hagins testified that she put her hand in the tray because \u201c[t]hat\u2019s the way [Jones] did it and that\u2019s the way I, I did it that week that I was there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Joyce Wright, a co-worker of Hagins, testified that on at least one occasion, Jones instructed her to use her fingers to remove meat that was stuck in the tray when the high-pressured hose did not work even though the machine was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>running. Wright also testified that she saw both Jones and George Eure, another supervisor, use their hands to clean the machine while it was running. Her testimony farther revealed that she was never \u201cinstructed to turn the machine off before placing [her] hands in that tray.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Jones testified that he did not instruct Hagins to place her hands in the tray of the pigs\u2019 feet machine. According to Jones, Hagins was taught to clean the pigs\u2019 feet machine by using a high-powered water spray and he instructed her not to place her hands in the moving equipment. When meat debris became stuck in the stationary tray, Hagins allegedly was instructed to remove it with a water hose and, if the water hose method failed, she was taught to disengage the machine before using a mechanical object to loosen the blockage. Jones said that he never placed his hands in moving equipment and that if he ever did, it would have been improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">During the same direct examination, however, Jones admitted that he stuck his hand in the machine \u201c[o]n occasions\u201d when he thought no one was watching him. On cross-examination, Jones further admitted to putting his hand in the tray to knock debris down the hole when he was by himself. He stated that he would not be in trouble for doing so, \u201cbecause [when he] did that, it would be when [he] was by [himself].\u201d According to Jones, \u201ceverybody takes shortcuts sometime [sic] and sometime [sic], you know, if you get away with it, you get away with it.\u201d On redirect examination, Jones testified that nine times out of ten the machine would have been off if he placed his hand in the tray to clear debris.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion, dated October 10, 1996, found that Hagins violated a safety rule and denied her application for compensation and lifetime medical benefits. The commission issued an opinion dated August 18, 1997, reversing the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion on the issue of whether or not the employer enforced the safety rule. Appellants appealed the commission\u2019s decision to this Court. We remanded the matter to the commission based upon our determination that the commission\u2019s ruling was not a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>decision in the case because the nature and extent of Hagins\u2019 disability had not been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The commission remanded the matter to the deputy commissioner regarding the nature and extent of disability. The deputy commissioner heard evidence and issued an opinion. Appellants requested review, and both parties filed written statements. The commission issued a ruling on May 14, 1999 re-affirming its determination that the employer failed to enforce a safety rule and that Hagins\u2019 initial claim for benefits was not barred by the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5). Gwaltney and Travelers appeal the adverse ruling of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">II. <em>WILLFUL BREACH OF A REASONABLE SAFETY RULE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The commission\u2019s findings of fact are binding on appeal if supported by credible evidence. <em>See Rose v. Red\u2019s Hitch &amp; Trailer Servs., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 55, 60, 396 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1990); Code \u00a7 65.1-98. When, however, there is \u201cno conflict in the evidence, the question of the sufficiency thereof is one of law.\u201d <em>City of Norfolk v. Bennett, </em>205 Va. 877, 880, 140 S.E.2d 655, 657 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-306 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">When compensation not allowed for injury or death; burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">A. No compensation shall be awarded to the employee or his dependents for an injury or death caused by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">* * * ifs * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">5. The employee\u2019s willful breach of any reasonable rule or regulation adopted by the employer and brought, prior to the accident, to the knowledge of the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">* $ $ $ $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-13\">B. The person or entity asserting any of the defenses in this section shall have the burden of proof with respect thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Accordingly, employer bore the burden of proving that Hag-ins\u2019 conduct was in \u201cwillful\u201d disregard of a reasonable safety rule established by employer and made known to her. In <em>Brockway v. Easter, </em>20 Va.App. 268, 456 S.E.2d 159 (1995), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">To prevail on the defense of a willful violation of a safety rule, employer must prove that: (1) the safety rule was reasonable; (2) the rule was known to the employee; (3) the rule was promulgated for the benefit of the employee; and (4) the employee intentionally undertook the forbidden act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abr\"><em>Id. </em>at 271, 456 S.E.2d at 161 (citation omitted). The forbidden act in this case involved Hagins using her hand to remove meat debris from the tray without first disengaging the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u201cWhether the [safety] rule is reasonable and applies to the situation from which the injury results, and whether the claimant knowingly violated it, is a mixed question of law and fact to be decided by the commission and reviewable by this Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271-72, 456 S.E.2d at 161. The question whether an employee was guilty of willful breach of a safety rule, however, is a question of fact. <em>See id. </em>at 272, 456 S.E.2d at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Although the evidence is sufficient as a matter of law to demonstrate that Hagins violated the safety rule, when the defense of willful violation of a safety rule is raised by the employer, \u201cthe employee may rebut the defense by showing that the rule was not kept alive by bona fide enforcement or that there was a valid reason for [her] inability to obey the rule.\u201d <em>Buzzo v. Woolridge Trucking, Inc., </em>17 Va.App. 327, 332, 437 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1993). Whether the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that the safety rule was not strictly enforced is a mixed question of law and fact, and the commission\u2019s ruling is not binding on appeal. <em>See Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. Kremposky, </em>227 Va. 265, 270, 315 S.E.2d 231, 234 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Nevertheless, we hold that the commission correctly decided that Hagins successfully rebutted the employer\u2019s defense of willful breach of the safety rule. The evidence revealed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>at least one supervisor occasionally used his hand to remove stuck meat debris without fear of any disciplinary consequences from the employer. Jones\u2019 testimony indicates that although he used his hands to remove meat debris from the tray approximately one time out of ten while the machine was operating, he could not recall whether he used his hands when training Hagins on the machine. Wright\u2019s testimony indicates that she witnessed Jones on several occasions remove meat debris from the tray by using his hands and that she was instructed by Jones to use her hands to remove meat debris while the machine was running. Furthermore, Wright regularly used her hands to remove stuck meat debris while the machine was engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Based upon this evidence, employer\u2019s safety rule was not being enforced strictly. \u201cProof of a pattern or practice of failing to discipline employees guilty of willful violations of a safety rule defeats the defense afforded an employer by [Code \u00a7 65.2-306], ... when such violations occur under circumstances charging the employer with knowledge and acquiescence.\u201d <em>Kremposky, </em>227 Va. at 270-71, 315 S.E.2d at 234 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Jones was Hagins\u2019 crew leader and was responsible for her training. He was also responsible for enforcing the safety rules. We agree with the commission that \u201c[h]is testimony that he was aware that employees sometimes took short cuts proves that someone in a supervisory capacity representing the employer was aware that the safety rule was being violated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We find credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision that the safety rule was not strictly enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">III. <em>NATURE AND EXTENT OF LIABILITY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Because the commission was correct in reversing the deputy commissioner and allowing Hagins\u2019 claim under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5), the commission correctly remanded the case to the deputy commissioner for the determination of the nature and extent of her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>IV. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">For the reasons stated above, the commission\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-13\">. Employer initially presented the claim as coming under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5), \"[t]he employee\u2019s willful breach of any reasonable rule.\u201d The deputy commissioner decided that issue. On appeal, the full commission in its resolution of the Code \u00a7 65.2 \u2014 306(A)(5) issue, used the language \"willful misconduct,\u201d which is pertinent to Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(1). Because the issue in this case was argued under Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5) and not Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(l), and because the issue is Hagins' \u201cwillful breach of any reasonable safety rule\u201d and not \"willful misconduct,\u201d our analysis is limited to Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
