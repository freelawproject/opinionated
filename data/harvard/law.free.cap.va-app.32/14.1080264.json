Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-14\">It shall be unlawful for (i) any person who has been convicted of a felony ... to knowingly and intentionally carry about his person, hidden from common observation, any weapon described in \u00a7 18.2-308 A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-18\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) forbids carrying about the person, hidden from common observation, \u201cany dirk, bowie knife, switchblade knife, ballistic knife, razor, slingshot, spring stick, metal knucks, or blackjack; ... or ... any weapon of like kind....\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-19\">Upon arresting Delcid, a previously convicted felon, for another offense, the police discovered upon his person, hidden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>from common observation, a \u201cbutterfly knife.\u201d The knife is not described in the record. However, it was displayed before the trial court, was received as an exhibit, and is physically a part of the record. We have examined it. The knife consists of a single blade with a two-part hinged handle, which folds to enclose the blade. A person holding one part of the closed handle can flip the other part open, leaving the blade exposed and locked, thus creating a straight-bladed knife approximately nine inches long. The blade is four inches long, with a sharp point. One edge of the blade is sharpened. The other is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The Commonwealth contended at trial that the knife was a dirk or a weapon of like kind. In <em>Richards v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 242, 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d 177, 179 n. 2 (1994), we defined a dirk as \u201cany stabbing weapon, having two sharp edges and a point, including daggers, short swords, and stilettos.\u201d The trial court railed that the knife was \u201ca dirk with one side ... a one-sided, sharp edge of a dirk [which] falls within the statute that says any weapon of like kind.... \u201d Delcid argues on appeal that the knife could not be a dirk, because it had but one sharp edge and was thus excluded from the definition of a dirk set forth in <em>Richards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u201cThe judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). \u201cThe determination of whether a particular knife falls within the meaning of a term used in the statute is a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>18 Va.App. at 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d at 179 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The knife does not fit the definition of a dirk established in <em>Richards. </em>Therefore, we must inquire whether it is a \u201cweapon of like kind.\u201d To be so, it must first be a weapon. \u201cWeapon\u201d is a commonly used word. In construing the statute, we assume, in the absence of contrary expression, that the legislature intended that the word be given its usual and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>accepted meaning. <em>See Stein v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 65, 69, 402 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1991). Webster\u2019s dictionary defines \u201cweapon\u201d thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">An instrument of offensive or defensive combat: something to fight with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\"><em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>1326 (1977). Common experience teaches that bladed instruments may be possessed and used for non-aggressive as well as aggressive purposes. In the former instance, they are deemed implements; in the latter, weapons. Any given bladed instrument may fall into either category or both, depending on the circumstances and purpose surrounding its possession and use. Thus, determination whether a given bladed instrument is an implement or a weapon requires consideration not only of the physical character of the instrument itself, but also of the circumstances surrounding its possession and use.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The knife in question is useful as a weapon of like kind to a dirk. Its fixed blade, sharp point, and single-sharpened edge afford unquestionable utility as a stabbing weapon, useful in the same manner as a dagger, stiletto, or dirk. Furthermore, when asked by Officer Heimberger whether \u201che had any weapons on him,\u201d Delcid replied \u201cthat he did, he had a knife in his pocket.\u201d The officer then removed from Delcid\u2019s pocket the butterfly knife that is the subject of this case. Officer Heimberger had come on the scene in response to a call from a 7-11 \u201cfor disorderly subjects refusing to leave.\u201d Arriving on the scene, he saw Delcid and another person who matched the description given in the complaint. Delcid had in his hand two beers, one of which was open. He discarded the beers upon the approach of the police car. These circumstances of disorder, productive of a police complaint, suggest aggressive conduct and intent. These circumstances, coupled with the physical characteristics of the knife and Delcid\u2019s own acknowledgment of it as a weapon, support the trial court\u2019s determination that the knife was a weapon of like kind to a dirk.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">In <em>Ricks v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 442, 499 S.E.2d 575 (1998), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>The trial judge erroneously relied on the purported purpose of Ricks\u2019 possession of the knife to convict Ricks of the offense.... [T]he language of the statute does not provide that the purpose for carrying the knife is relevant. Rather, the physical characteristics of the knife determine whether the knife is a weapon contemplated by the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 445, 499 S.E.2d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">As noted in the dissent, a criminal statute must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth and in favor of the accused. Thus, carrying concealed a non-weapon does not violate Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A), even though that non-weapon may be <em>\u201cof </em>like kind\u201d to a dirk. For the offense to be committed, the object carried concealed must be a weapon. The purpose for which it is created and employed is a critical distinction between an implement and a weapon. Thus, while the specific purpose for which the item is possessed is not itself an element of the crimes defined by Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-308(A) and 18.2-308.2, that purpose is one of the defining characteristics of the item in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Thus, the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the knife was a \u201cweapon\u201d described in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b63-9\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 \u201cdoes not prohibit generally the carrying of knives hidden from common observation.\u201d <em>Ricks v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 442, 444, 499 S.E.2d 575, 576 (1998). Rather, by reference to Code \u00a7 18.2-308, it proscribes concealing the following specific kinds of knives: \u201cany dirk, bowie knife, switchblade knife, ballistic knife, razor ... or ... any weapon of like kind.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A). When we apply these penal statutes, \u201c[i]t is elementary that ... [they are] to be strictly construed against the state and in favor of the liberty of a citizen.\u201d <em>Cox v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 22, 25, 255 S.E.2d 462, 464 (1979). \u201cSuch statutes cannot be extended by implication or construction, or be made to embrace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>cases which are not within their letter and spirit.\u201d <em>Berry v. City of Chesapeake, </em>209 Va. 525, 526, 165 S.E.2d 291, 292 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The trial judge \u201c[found] this [knife] is a dirk.\u201d Elaborating, the judge said, \u201c[t]his is a dirk with one side---- I think a one-sided, sharp edge of a dirk falls within the statute that says a weapon of like kind as those enumerated.\u201d I agree with the majority opinion\u2019s description of the knife as consisting \u201cof a single blade with a two-part hinged handle, which folds to enclose the blade,\u201d and that the blade has one sharpened edge. Although the majority opinion concedes the knife does not fit the definition of a dirk, it concludes \u201cthat the knife was a weapon of like kind to a dirk\u201d and \u201c[t]he knife in question is useful as a weapon of like kind to a dirk.\u201d I disagree with those conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In recent opinions, the Supreme Court and this Court have addressed the definition of a dirk. In <em>Wood v. Henry County Public Schools, </em>255 Va. 85, 495 S.E.2d 255 (1998), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a] \u2018dirk\u2019 is defined as \u2018a long straight-bladed dagger formerly carried [especially] by the Scottish Highlanders[,] 2. a short sword formerly worn by British junior naval officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95 n. 6, 495 S.E.2d at 261 n. 6 (citation omitted). That definition is consistent with our earlier holding that \u201c[a] \u2018dirk\u2019 or weapon of like kind is any stabbing weapon having two sharp edges and a point, including daggers, short swords and stilettos.\u201d <em>Richards v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 242, 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d 177, 179 n. 2 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Neither of these definitions encompasses the knife at issue, which has a blade that folds into its handle by the physical effort of the user. The knife at issue in this case was fit to be carried in a pocket and does not have a fixed blade. Indeed, the Supreme Court recently held that \u201ca pocketknife is neither a dirk, bowie knife, switchblade knife, ballistic knife, nor a weapon of like kind.\u201d <em>Wood, </em>255 Va. at 95, 495 S.E.2d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">The knife at issue, just as any ordinary pocketknife, may be used for stabbing purposes. That fact, however, is not germane to the \u201cletter and spirit\u201d of the statute. <em>Berry, </em>209 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>at 526, 165 S.E.2d at 292. To read the statute so broadly as to apply its proscription to a pocketknife, which, when opened, may be used to stab, impermissibly extends the statute by implication and applies it to cases not clearly described by the language of the statute. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 298, 300, 295 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that other evidence suggested aggressive conduct and intent sufficient to support the trial judge\u2019s determination that the knife was a weapon of like kind to a dirk. A mere accusation of disorderly conduct is not indicative of aggressive conduct or intention to use a knife as a weapon. The evidence proved that Delcid was standing outside the store with beer, which he discarded upon the arrival of the police. The police officer testified that before he frisked Delcid he asked if \u201che had any weapons on him.\u201d He said Delcid replied \u201cthat he did, he had a knife in his pocket.\u201d Delcid then allowed the officer to take the knife without any struggle. Delcid \u201cmade no threatening remarks, uttered no words that would reasonably incite a breach of the peace, [and] made no threatening movements toward the officers.\u201d <em>Ford v. City of Newport News, </em>23 Va.App. 137, 144, 474 S.E.2d 848, 851 (1996). Further, there is no evidence that Delcid was ever charged with disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The majority also found compelling Delcid\u2019s response when the officer asked if he had a weapon. Neither Delcid\u2019s statement nor the nature of the police call that led to its discovery is relevant to our inquiry.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">Unless a claim is made that a circumstance specified in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B) (listing exclusions from coverage) or (C) (exempting certain individuals from coverage) is applicable, the language of the statute does not provide that the purpose for carrying the knife is relevant. Rather, the physical characteristics of the knife determine whether the knife is a weapon contemplated by the statute. Therefore, even if the trial judge believed [the accused] did not use the knife for [a sporting purpose] and believed [the accused] was not carrying it \u201cfor ordinary purposes,\u201d the knife did not have the physical characteristics of the weapons speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>fied in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(ii) and, thus, could not be deemed a \u201cweapon of like kind as those enumerated.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(v).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><em>Ricks, 27 </em>Va.App. at 445, 499 S.E.2d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">For these reasons, I would reverse the conviction. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
