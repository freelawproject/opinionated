On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the offense charged in the indictment. Finding that the unproven allegation of the indictment, the ownership of the premises, was mere surplusage, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">Guided by familiar principles, we consider the record \u201c \u2018in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. In so doing, we must discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 385, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">On March 18, 1999, Mary Mitchell, together with her mother, brother and son, returned from church to a residential dwelling occupied by the four in the city of Richmond. Defendant, then \u201cliving in and out\u201d of the home, was present when the family arrived. Shortly thereafter, Mitchell discovered that \u201csodas\u201d and \u201chamburger\u201d were missing and \u201cconfronted\u201d defendant, prompting an argument that culminated with Mitchell ordering defendant from the house. Defendant \u201cleft in an angered manner\u201d and, once outside, was seen \u201cwalking up and down\u201d a nearby street. \u201c[A]bout 15 minutes\u201d later, Mitchell\u2019s brother discovered a fire in the \u201cdownstairs\u201d area of the home, alerted the others, and everyone escaped through the \u201cback entrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Moments prior to the fire, Kenneth Jones, a neighbor \u201cacross the street,\u201d observed defendant \u201ckneel down\u201d \u201cbeside the [Mitchell] residence,\u201d rise and \u201call of the sudden a blaze of fire comes out.\u201d As Jones ran \u201ctowards the fire,\u201d defendant \u201cjust stood right there ... and ... walked away.\u201d After Jones extinguished the fire with \u201cdirt and mud,\u201d he noticed defendant \u201cpeep back around the corner,\u201d and alerted a \u201ccorrectional officer,\u201d then also at the scene. As the two men approached defendant, he fled, but Jones pursued and apprehended him for police.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Richmond Police Detective Michael J. Wyatt, an expert \u201cin the nature of arson and the nature and cause and origin of fires,\u201d testified that his investigation of the fire disclosed that the cause was neither \u201celectrical\u201d nor \u201cmechanical,\u201d but \u201cincendiary in nature,\u201d a fire which \u201chas to be set.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The subsequent indictment of defendant, as amended, alleged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">[o]n or about March 18, 1999, in the City of Richmond, [he] did feloniously, unlawfully and maliciously burn[ ], or by use of explosive device destroy[ ] an occupied dwelling or manufactured home, <em>belonging to Joseph O\u2019Brian. </em>Virginia Code Section 18.2-77.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Defendant argues on appeal that the evidence failed to prove that the \u201cdwelling ... belonged] to Joseph O\u2019Brian, resulting in a fatal variance between an allegation of the indictment and the requisite proof\u2019 to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">\u201cAn indictment is a written accusation of a crime ... intended to inform the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.\u201d <em>Hairston v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 211, 213, 343 S.E.2d 355, 357 (1986); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-220. \u201cIt is elementary that what need not be proved need not be alleged,\u201d although \u201csometimes [the indictment] alleges something that ... was not necessary to allege,\u201d requiring proof of \u201cwhat ... has [been] alleged unless the unnecessary allegation can be rejected as surplusage.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Commonwealth, </em>141 Va. 541, 555, 127 S.E. 368, 373 (1925). \u201c \u2018If the unnecessary word or words ... in the indictment describe, limit or qualify the words which it was necessary to insert therein, then they are descriptive of the offense charged in the indictment and cannot be rejected as surplusage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hairston, </em>2 Va.App. at 214-15, 343 S.E.2d at 357 (quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>141 Va. at 560, 127 S.E. at 374). However, to become indispensable, \u201cthe unnecessary language must have a <em>material </em>effect on the offense charged and on the proof required to convict under that charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 343 S.E.2d at 359 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Here, the indictment charged defendant with a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-77(A), which provides, in pertinent part, \u201c[i]f any person maliciously (i) burns, or by use of any explosive device or substance destroys, in whole or in part, or causes to be burned or destroyed, ... any <em>dwelling house ... whether belonging to himself or another, </em>... he shall be guilty of a felony, punishable\u201d as prescribed by the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) \u201c[T]he term \u2018dwelling house\u2019 \u201d has been de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>fined, in the context of Code \u00a7 18.2-77, as \u201ca place which human beings regularly use for sleeping.\u201d <em>Marable v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 505, 513, 500 S.E.2d 233, 237 (1998) (citing <em>Rash v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 22, 26-27, 383 S.E.2d 749, 751 (1989)). Thus, to prove the dwelling house element of Code \u00a7 18.2-77(A), the Commonwealth need not establish ownership of the premises, only routine habitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Defendant acknowledges that \u201cit may not have been necessary to allege in the instant indictment whose house was burned,\u201d but relies upon <em>Etheridge v. Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 328, 171 S.E.2d 190 (1969), in support of his contention that, once charged, such proof was necessary to a conviction. In <em>Etheridge, </em>the indictment alleged that the accused \u201cdid unlawfully, feloniously and maliciously shoot at or into a dwelling house, to-wit: <em>the residence of Edna Harper </em>located at Route 2, Box 224, Galbush Road, Chesapeake, Virginia,\u201d a violation of former Code \u00a7 18.1-152. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 171 S.E.2d at 191 (emphasis added). However, the evidence at trial established that Edna Harper, although present in the dwelling at the time of the offense, resided elsewhere. <em>See id. </em>In reversing the conviction, the Court concluded that the Commonwealth \u201cchose to specify\u201d the dwelling house \u201cor residence involved as that of Edna Harper,\u201d a description of \u201cthat which was necessary to be alleged\u201d that \u201ccannot ... be treated as surplusage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329-30, 171 S.E.2d at 191-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In contrast, the subject indictment makes no reference to the resident or residents of the subject dwelling house, but, instead, specifies only the owner of the property, an unnecessary allegation. The language in <em>Etheridge, </em>\u201cthe residence of Edna Harper,\u201d modified \u201cwords ... necessary to\u201d the indictment, dwelling house, which requires habitation or residency, by definition, and, therefore, could not \u201cbe rejected as surplus-age.\u201d <em>Hairston, </em>2 Va.App. at 214, 215, 343 S.E.2d at 357, 357. The extraneous language now before the Court qualified ownership, a circumstance immaterial to the offense and clearly unnecessary to a successful prosecution of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Accordingly, we find the evidence sufficient to prove the offense charged in the indictment and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-77(B) provides for a reduced penalty \"when such building ... is unoccupied.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
