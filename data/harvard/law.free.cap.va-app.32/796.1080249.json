On appeal, he argues the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the Commonwealth was required to prove that he was the triggerman in both killings. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below, granting to that evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Juares v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 154, 156, 493 S.E.2d 677, 678 (1997). Appellant was charged with twelve felonies, including four capital murder charges for the killing of Richard Harris, Jr. (Harris) and Chakeisha Carter (Carter). Two indictments charged appellant with capital murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7), for the killing of more than one person as part of the same act or transaction, and two indictments charged appellant with capital murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8), for the killing of more than one person within a three-year period.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-7\">F-97-3771-RWD ... On or about October 14, 1997, in the City of Richmond, Christopher Allen Burlile did feloniously, unlawfully, willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation, kill and murder Richard Harris Jr. while as part of the same act or transaction, did willfully, deliberately] and with premeditation kill another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">F-97-3772-RWD ... On or about October 15, 1997, in the City of Richmond, Christopher Allen Burlile did feloniously, unlawfully, willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation, kill and murder Chakeisha Carter while as part of the same act or transaction, did willfully, deliberately] and with premeditation kill another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-9\">F-98-2677-RWD ... On or about October 14, 1997, in the City of Richmond, Christopher Allen Burlile did feloniously, unlawfully, willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation kill and murder one Richard Harris [Jr.] and within a three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>(3) year period, did kill and murder another, namely: Chakeisha Carter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">F-98-2676-RWD ... On or about October 15, 1997, in the City of Richmond, Christopher Allen Burlile did feloniously, unlawfully, willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation kill and murder one Chakeisha Carter and within a three (3) year period, did kill and murder another, namely: Richard Harris Jr.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">At trial, the evidence established that Dawn Harper, Harris\u2019s girlfriend, saw appellant shoot Harris with a shotgun in the evening of October 14, 1997. Later that night, appellant and another individual broke into the Carter residence and Chakeisha Carter was shot and killed. Carter\u2019s mother, Charlene Carter, testified that she did not know who shot her daughter. Carter\u2019s brother, Shea Carter, did not see the individuals involved in the crime, but he heard two voices when they entered the residence. Shotgun shells at the Harris murder scene matched the shells found at the Carter residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">At the conclusion of the evidence, defense counsel requested the trial court to give the following jury instruction: \u201cTo find the defendant guilty of capital murder, you must find that he was the triggerman in two murders.\u201d The trial court rejected defense counsel\u2019s proposed jury instruction and, instead, instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">To find the defendant guilty of capital murder, you must find that he was the triggerman in at least one of the murders. In the second murder, you may find that he was the triggerman or a princip[al] in the second degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Prior to jury deliberation and upon motion of both the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and defense counsel, the trial court \u201ccombine[d]\u201d indictments F-97-3771 and F-97-3772 to charge appellant with one capital murder in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7) and \u201ccombine[d]\u201d indictments F-98-2676 and F-98-2677 to charge appellant with one capital murder in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8). On each of the capital murder charges, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the jury found appellant guilty and recommended life imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\u201c[An appellate] court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises. It is elementary that a jury must be informed as to the essential elements of the offense; a correct statement of the law is one of the essentials of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201c[W]hen a principle of law is vital to a defendant in a criminal case, a trial court has an affirmative duty properly to instruct a jury about the matter.\u201d <em>Jimenez v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 244, 250, 402 S.E.2d 678, 681 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that, to convict appellant of capital murder under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8), the Commonwealth was required to prove he was the \u201ctriggerman\u201d in both the murders of Harris and Carter. Thus, the narrow issue raised in this appeal is whether Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8) requires proof that the defendant was the triggerman in the two killings alleged. We find no such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8) defines capital murder as \u201c[t]he willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of more than one person within a three-year period.\u201d Although we have not addressed the precise issue raised by appellant, the Supreme Court addressed a substantially similar challenge in <em>Graham v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 487, 464 S.E.2d 128 (1995). In <em>Graham, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7), which prohibits the \u201cwillful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of more than one person as a part of the same act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>transaction,\u201d requires proof that the defendant was the triggerman in each murder referenced in the indictment. <em>See id. </em>at 492, 464 S.E.2d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">The Court in <em>Graham </em>thoroughly reviewed the legislative intent of the capital murder statute and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">The language of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7) evidences a legislative determination that the described offense is qualitatively more egregious than an isolated act of premeditated murder. This result is accomplished by the addition of a gradation crime to the single act of premeditated murder. Under this subsection, the gradation crime is the defendant\u2019s killing of more than one person as part of the same act or transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 491, 464 S.E.2d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Relying upon its decisions in <em>Briley v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 563, 273 S.E.2d 57 (1980), and <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 331 S.E.2d 422 (1985), the Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJE\">Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7) does not require proof that a defendant charged with capital murder, in the premeditated killing of more than one person as part of the same act or transaction, was the triggerman in each murder referenced in the indictment. Rather, <em>this section requires proof only that the defendant was the triggerman in the principal murder charged, </em>and that he was at least an accomplice in the murder of an additional person or persons as part of the same act or transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-8\"><em>Graham, </em>250 Va. at 492, 464 S.E.2d at 130 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7), Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8) requires the addition of a gradation crime to the single act of premeditated murder. <em>See id. </em>at 491, 464 S.E.2d at 130. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8) of the capital murder statute, the gradation or nexus crime is the killing of \u201cmore than one person within a three-year period.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8) requires \u201cproof only that the defendant was the triggerman in the principal murder charged, and that he was at least an accomplice in the murder of an additional person or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>persons\u201d within a three-year period. <em>Graham, </em>250 Va. at 492, 464 S.E.2d at 130.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Applying these principles to the instant case, we conclude that the trial court did not err in rejecting appellant\u2019s proffered instruction because it contained an erroneous statement of the law. <em>See Woodard v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 24, 28-29, 448 S.E.2d 328, 330-31 (1994). Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, the Commonwealth was not required to prove that appellant was the triggerman in both killings. Rather, Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8) requires proof that the defendant was the triggerman \u201cin the principal murder charged\u201d and at least an accomplice in another killing within a three-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Although the jury instruction, as given, failed to include the exact language from <em>Graham, </em>any error would be harmless. The jury\u2019s verdict form clearly identified the principal murder charged to be that of Richard Harris and the second murder within three years to be that of Chakeisha Carter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, the evidence, including the eyewitness account of Dawn Harper, established beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was the triggerman in the killing of Harris. Thus, any error in failing to include the <em>Graham </em>language \u2014 \u201cin the principal murder charged\u201d \u2014 was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-9\">. Appellant\u2019s conviction for capital murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31 (7), for the killing of more than one person as part of the same act or transaction, is not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\">. Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Harward v. Commonwealth, 229 </em>Va. 363, 330 S.E.2d 89 (1985), is misplaced. In <em>Harward, </em>the defendant was convicted of capital murder, in violation of former Code \u00a7 18.2-31(e), for the willful, deliberate and premeditated killing of a person during the commission of, or subsequent to, rape. <em>See id. </em>at 364, 330 S.E.2d at 90. The Supreme Court held that the statute \"only prescribes the murder of a rape victim and cannot be extended to include the murder of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 330 S.E.2d at 91. The Court did not consider whether a defendant accused of the premeditated killing must also be the immediate perpetrator of the gradation or nexus crime. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\">. The verdict form stated that appellant \"did kill Richard Harris, Jr., and, within a three year period, did kill Chakeisha Carter....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
