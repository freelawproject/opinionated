He was sentenced to a total term of life plus 133 years in the penitentiary, with seventy-five years suspended. On appeal, Webb argues that the trial court erred by failing to conduct a pretrial hearing to address an alleged conflict of interest by his court-appointed trial counsel arising from the fact that his counsel was not being adequately compensated because of the statutorily capped court-appointed attorney\u2019s fee system. He also contends that the statutory limitation of Code \u00a7 19.2-163 is unconstitutional because it imposes an inflexible and inadequate cap on court-appointed attorneys\u2019 fees. Because the record fails to demonstrate that Webb was prejudiced by the fees allowed his counsel or that counsel\u2019s legal representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness due to the fee allowance, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">On January 30, 1997, Webb and a codefendant robbed employees of a Friendly\u2019s restaurant in Henrico County. During the robbery, the codefendant shot and killed the restaurant manager. The court determined that Webb was indigent and appointed Steven D. Benjamin, an experienced criminal defense attorney, to represent Webb.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">One week before trial and nearly seven months after indictment, Benjamin moved to dismiss the charges, asserting that (1) the statutory cap on attorneys\u2019 fees contained in Code \u00a7 19.2-163 is unconstitutional, (2) the compensation allowable under Code \u00a7 19.2-163 is inadequate and operated to deny Webb his right to conflict-free and effective assistance of counsel, and (3) the statutory compensation scheme causes a conflict of interest because it creates a financial disincentive for a lawyer to effectively represent his or her client. At the time Benjamin filed the motion to dismiss, he.had already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>expended more than ninety hours working on the case, exceeding the time for which compensation would be allowed under the statute by more than thirty hours.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 6, 1998, the day of trial, Benjamin objected to the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct a pretrial hearing on the alleged conflict of interest. The trial court took the motion under advisement and proceeded with trial. The day after trial, the court conducted a hearing on the motion to dismiss and subsequently denied the motion, finding the statutorily capped court-appointed attorney\u2019s fee system did not create a conflict of interest in this case and no evidence in the case indicated that Webb received \u201canything but effective assistance of counsel.\u201d The court ruled that the statutory compensation scheme was not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\n<em>A. Post-trial Evidentiary Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Webb argues that the court-appointed compensation scheme creates a financial disincentive and burdens and impairs an attorney\u2019s ability to represent his or her client, thus creating an \u201cactual\u201d conflict of interest. Webb, citing <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 569, 400 S.E.2d 540 (1991), argues that the trial court, which had a duty to inquire and take \u201cadequate steps\u201d to determine the extent of the alleged conflict, erred in failing to conduct the inquiry prior to trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>He argues that when an objection is made and a conflict of interest is claimed and shown to exist prior to trial, prejudice and ineffective assistance of counsel are presumed and reversal is automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The trial court denied the motion, holding that Webb received competent and effective assistance of counsel. The court further ruled that the statutory compensation scheme is not unconstitutional. The record supports the trial judge\u2019s underlying factual determination and legal conclusion that no conflict of interest existed. We will not disturb the factual finding in the absence of plain error. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u201cThe sixth amendment fundamental right to effective assistance of counsel is so basic to a fair trial that an infraction of that right can never be dismissed as harmless error.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>11 Va.App. at 573, 400 S.E.2d at 542; <em>see also Holloway v. Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 489-90, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 1181, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978) (stating that where a Sixth Amendment violation taints the entire criminal proceeding, the violation can never be considered harmless). In order to prove ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must first demonstrate that his \u201cattorney\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Second, the defendant must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for this deficient conduct the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. Prejudice against a defendant\u2019s case is presumed when \u201can actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1719, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). \u201cHence, if the defendant shows that his counsel actively represented actual conflicting interests that adversely affected his counsel\u2019s performance, prejudice is presumed.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>11 Va.App. at 573, 400 S.E.2d at 543. \u201cUnless the trial court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists, the court need not initiate an inquiry.\u201d <em>Cuyler, </em>446 U.S. at 347, 100 S.Ct. at 1717.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>In <em>Carter, </em>defense counsel moved to withdraw after allegations of misconduct were levied against counsel by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and were acknowledged by the trial court. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney alleged that defense counsel harassed the victim\u2019s mother and pressured her into signing a release of the victim\u2019s psychological records. The mother revoked the release. The trial court conducted a hearing, which focused on the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation of misconduct rather than the revocation of the release. The trial court did not rule on defense counsel\u2019s alleged impropriety; rather, the court informed the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney that he could initiate whatever disciplinary action he deemed appropriate. After the hearing, defense counsel moved to withdraw, contending that a conflict of interest had arisen which forced counsel to protect their own interests rather than the defendant\u2019s interest. Defense counsel asserted that the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s threat of initiating disciplinary proceedings would hamper their ability to properly defend their client during the impending trial. The trial court denied the motion to withdraw without making further inquiry. The defendant was subsequently convicted on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We held in <em>Carter </em>that when defense counsel moved to withdraw, arguing that their representation of the defendant was compromised because of their own interests, the trial judge knew or should have known that a possible conflict of interest existed. We held that when a trial court fails to initiate an inquiry when the court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists, the law presumes the conflict resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Carter, </em>11 Va.App. at 573-74, 400 S.E.2d at 543. We vacated the convictions and remanded the case to the trial court for the purpose of conducting a hearing to determine whether a conflict of interest actually existed that denied the defendant his right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Here, no factual basis supports Webb\u2019s argument that his attorney had a conflict of interest or that a purported conflict was reasonably apparent to the trial judge, requiring a pretrial inquiry. Benjamin asserts that the alleged conflict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>interest was initially raised by Webb during an interview with a forensic psychologist who had been designated to evaluate Webb\u2019s competency to stand trial. The psychologist stated, as an example of Webb\u2019s inability to rationally communicate and cooperate with his attorney, that Webb believed Benjamin could not render adequate representation because Benjamin was court-appointed and because the statutory compensation scheme does not provide an economic incentive for court-appointed attorneys representing indigent defendants to provide the same level and quality of representation as they would for non-indigent clients. Based on Webb\u2019s statement to the psychologist, the trial court was not obligated to conduct a pretrial inquiry on whether Benjamin had a conflict of interest by continuing to represent Webb.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Additionally, Benjamin proved that Virginia is ranked fifty-first amongst the states and the District of Columbia for allowable compensation for court-appointed attorneys and that the disparity between Virginia and the other states is overwhelming. Benjamin also introduced evidence that recent developments in criminal law, including bifurcated proceedings in felony cases and technological advancements in evidence gathering and legal research, have increased the burdens, obligations, and overhead costs of court-appointed attorneys in adequately preparing cases. Although Benjamin made a bare claim that this situation creates a potential conflict of interest because an attorney must choose between not being adequately compensated or not adequately representing his client, Benjamin neither alleged nor presented evidence that he labored under an actual conflict of interest. Understandably, he did not allege that he was unable or unwilling to zealously represent Webb because of financial constraints or considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Moreover, his claim that the court-appointed compensation scheme created a financial disincentive to provide competent, quality representation in this case is belied by the record. By Benjamin\u2019s own account, he expended countless hours for which he was fully aware he would not receive compensation and, even after he filed the motion to dismiss asserting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>conflict, Benjamin continued to vigorously represent and defend Webb at trial. We note, as did the trial court, that Benjamin never moved to withdraw from representation. Although we acknowledge the apparent dilemma created by an attorney\u2019s ethical obligation to zealously represent his or her client and the economic constraints on the time he or she can devote to a case, we will not overturn a criminal conviction merely because the dilemma exists where no actual conflict is shown to exist and no ineffective assistance of counsel is proven.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Given counsel\u2019s level of representation of his client, it could not reasonably have been apparent to the trial court that an actual conflict of interest existed. The evidence does not prove that Benjamin had an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected his representation of Webb. Webb had a hearing, as we provided in <em>Carter, </em>to consider whether a conflict of interest existed and whether he was prejudiced. <em>See Carter, </em>11 Va.App. at 574, 400 S.E.2d at 543 (vacating and remanding for hearing to determine if counsel labored under a conflict of interest). The trial court conducted the hearing, albeit at the end of trial, and concluded counsel failed to establish that an actual conflict of interest existed or that Webb was prejudiced. We find the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s determination that defense counsel had no actual conflict of interest that rendered his representation of Webb ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\n<em>B. Constitutionality of Code \u00a7 19.2-163</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Webb argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-163 creates an actual conflict of interest because the fee caps are unreasonably low and inflexible. Webb reasons that because the compensation scheme of Code \u00a7 19.2-163 is so low and inflexible, the statute negates the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Gideon v. Wain</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>wright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), and the Sixth Amendment guarantee that an indigent defendant shall be entitled to effective assistance of counsel, thus rendering the statute unconstitutional. Additionally, Webb argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-163 is unconstitutional because it violates his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u201c \u2018In assessing the constitutionality of a statute[,] ... [t]he burden is on the challenger to prove the alleged constitutional defect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 848, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994) (quoting <em>Perkins v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 7, 14, 402 S.E.2d 229, 233 (1991)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cEvery act of the legislature is presumed to be constitutional, and the Constitution is to be given a liberal construction so as to sustain the enactment in question, if practicable.\u201d <em>Bosang v. Iron Belt Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>96 Va. 119, 123, 30 S.E. 440, 441 (1898). \u201cWhen the constitutionality of an act is challenged, a heavy burden of proof is thrust upon the party making the challenge. All laws are presumed to be constitutional and this presumption is one of the strongest known to the law.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Day, </em>200 Va. 764, 770, 107 S.E.2d 594, 598 (1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\"><em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 293, 298-99, 498 S.E.2d 451, 454 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Due process is satisfied if an enactment has a \u201c \u2018reasonable relation to a proper purpose and [is] neither arbitrary nor discriminatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Etheridge v. Medical Ctr. Hosps., </em>237 Va. 87, 97, 376 S.E.2d 525, 530 (1989) (quoting <em>Duke v. County of Pulaski, </em>219 Va. 428, 437-38, 247 S.E.2d 824, 829 (1978)). Therefore, under the general rule, a statute is not violative of due process if it withstands the \u201crational basis\u201d test. <em>See Etheridge, </em>237 Va. at 97, 376 S.E.2d at 530. When legislation affects a \u201c \u2018fundamental right,\u2019 the constitutionality of the enactment will be judged according to the \u2018strict scrutiny\u2019 test, i.e., the law must be necessary to promote a compelling or overriding governmental interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97-98, 376 S.E.2d at 530 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-163 affects a fundamental right. \u201cThe right to have the assistance of counsel is a \u2018fundamental\u2019 right, although such right is not explicitly set out in the Constitution of Virginia.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Edwards, </em>235 Va. 499, 505, 370 S.E.2d 296, 298-99 (1988); <em>see also Browning v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 295, 298, 452 S.E.2d 360, 362 (1994) (finding that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is a fundamental right guaranteed to an accused by the Bill of Rights of the Virginia Constitution). Therefore, the fee caps in Code \u00a7 19.2-163 must be subjected to strict scrutiny and can be justified only if the legislation is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. <em>See generally Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, </em>494 U.S. 652, 657, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The Due Process clause requires that an indigent defendant receive an \u201cadequate opportunity to present [his] claims fairly within the adversary system.\u201d <em>Ross v. Moffitt, </em>417 U.S. 600, 612, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 2444-45, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974). The General Assembly has provided for a system where counsel is appointed to represent indigent defendants in the absence of waiver of counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute provides a scheme and guidelines for compensating court-appointed counsel based upon an hourly rate to be set by the Supreme Court for time and effort expended with a cap for the types of cases. The issue is whether the legislation proscribing statutory caps on court-appointed attorneys\u2019 fees is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">On March 3, 1994, the General Assembly adopted House Joint Resolution No. 147, authorizing a study and report examining the costs and effectiveness of the policies, practices, and priorities of Virginia\u2019s criminal justice system. <em>See </em>H.R. Res. 147, Va. Gen. Assem. (1995). Although the statutory fee caps for court-appointed attorneys\u2019 fees were not specifically mentioned in the resolution and the results of the study were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>not published,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the resolution mentioned the overall increase in the criminal court caseload and that spending for the judiciary, prosecution, and court-appointed criminal defense lawyers also continued to grow. The resolution noted that continued or increased funding of current criminal justice policies, practices, and priorities would come only at the expense of other pressing public needs in education and economic and human resource development. We cannot say the General Assembly was -wrong in how it established its budgetary priorities. Accepting for purposes of this opinion Webb\u2019s contention that the statutory caps on attorneys\u2019 fees must be subjected to strict scrutiny and that they can be upheld only if they are justified by a compelling state interest, we cannot say on this record that the state has deprived indigent defendants of their constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel by the method that it has budgeted and appropriated funds for this purpose. Code \u00a7 19.2-163 has structured a fee schedule for payment of fees that recognizes and incorporates the different needs and circumstances of representing indigent defendants for different types of offenses in the various courts. The statute provides for different hourly rates for different types of cases, including a higher hourly rate for more serious cases, and funds for \u201creasonable expenses incurred.\u201d Although in some instances determining whether legislation is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest may require that the least restrictive approach be utilized, here we must look to whether the statute addresses the needs and financial demands inherent in defending against a criminal prosecution. In doing so, we find that Code \u00a7 19.2-163 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest; and, therefore, it is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Additionally, Webb has failed to show that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to him. He failed to show that the statutory cap on court-appointed attorneys\u2019 fees as applied to his attorney deprived him of his constitutional right to effective counsel and due process. As the trial court found, Benjamin rendered competent and effective assistance of counsel, and, in fact, worked many hours in excess of the number of hours that would be compensated within the statutory authorized maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"Atm\">Finally, Webb claims the statutory compensation scheme renders any indigent defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel a nullity because it forces the court-appointed attorney to choose between two masters, the indigent defendant and the financial cost of doing business. However, to the extent Webb asserts that all court-appointed attorneys labor under this conflict of interest, he is precluded from raising this argument. \u201c[Generally, a litigant may challenge the constitutionality of a law only as it applies to him or her.\u201d <em>Coleman v. City of Richmond, </em>5 Va.App. 459, 463, 364 S.E.2d 239, 241-42 (1988). \u201cThat the statute may apply unconstitutionally to another is irrelevant; one cannot raise third party rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 364 S.E.2d at 242. <em>But see Lewis v. Iowa Dist. Court for Des Moines County, </em>555 N.W.2d 216, 217-19 (Iowa 1996) (finding that court-appointed attorneys had standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statutory fee schedule in which the attorneys alleged violations of indigent defendants\u2019 rights because defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel and attorney\u2019s right to fair compensation are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d). To the extent Webb claims that the statutory caps for court-appointed counsel fees for indigent defendants are woefully inadequate, redress must come from the General Assembly. On this record, we do not find that the fee schedule is so inadequate as to violate the Sixth or Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Accordingly, we find that Code \u00a7 19.2-163 is not unconstitutional, and we affirm Webb\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\">. Code \u00a7 19.2-163 provided, as of the date of trial in this case, a maximum fee of $735 for the representation of a defendant charged with a felony punishable by confinement for more than twenty years; for representation in connection with any other felony charge, $265; and for any misdemeanor punishable by confinement, $132. Count-appointed counsel also may receive reimbursement for \u201creasonable expenses incurred\u201d in the defense of an indigent client. The statute provided for \"a reasonable fee\u201d for defending capital cases with no cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">For multiple violations of the same offense tried in the same proceeding, a single fee shall be allowed. The fees are based on time and effort expended and were to be compensated at the hourly rates established by the Supreme Court guidelines of $40 for out-of-court work and $60 for in-court work.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The General Assembly amended the statute in 1997 to provide for increases in 1998 and 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\">. A lawyer also has an ethical obligation to participate in serving the disadvantaged; thus, representing the disadvantaged for a \"nominal\u201d fee cannot, on its face, be deemed to create an actual conflict of interest. <em>See </em>Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility EC2-27 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\">. The General Assembly has also provided for a system of public defenders in certain localities. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-163.1 to -163.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b393-5\">. In 1985, the General Assembly adopted House Joint Resolution No. 324 authorizing a study and report on the defense of indigent defendants in the Commonwealth. The published results of that study recommended that a 100% increase in the maximum fee schedule was necessary to bring the fees up to the national average. The report recommended that a minimum 15% increase be instituted. The report stated that the increase in the maximum fee schedule was essential in order to meet the constitutional obligation of providing counsel to indigent defendants. <em>See </em>H.R.
