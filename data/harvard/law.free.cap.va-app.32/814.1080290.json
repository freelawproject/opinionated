Lewis Waltrip, II, Inc./Jamestown Building Corporation (Waltrip), of responsibility for benefits due Michael L. Edwards (claimant) pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act). Relying upon the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A), the commission found Waltrip insulated from liability, absent both proper notice of the accident and \u201cat least sixty days notice of the hearing to ascertain compensability.\u201d The Fund contends that actual notice to Waltrip of the injury, though untimely, removed the claim from the reach of Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A) but, if not, Waltrip was sufficiently aware of the scheduled hearing to satisfy the statutory mandate. Finding that the commission correctly construed and applied Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A) to the instant circumstances, we affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The salient facts are substantially uncontroverted. While employed by Jim Doyan, an uninsured contractor, claimant suffered an industrial injury to his right eye on April 6, 1998. Although Doyan learned of the accident and injury immediately after the occurrence, neither Doyan nor claimant advised Waltrip, claimant\u2019s statutory employer, of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">On June 29, 1998, claimant lodged a \u201cClaim for Benefits\u201d with the commission, resulting in a \u201cNotification Letter\u201d to both Doyan and Waltrip, dated July 28, 1998, which reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>the pending claim and requested related documentation. George Jeffries, \u201cgeneral manager\u201d for Waltrip, testified that, \u201cwithin 15 minutes\u201d of receiving the notice, he telephoned Waltrip\u2019s \u201con the job\u201d superintendent to determine \u201cif he knew anything about this.\u201d The superintendent disclaimed \u201cknowledge of it happening,\u201d and Doyan denied claimant had been in his employ.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Within a week thereafter, Jeffries spoke to a \u201cclaims adjuster\u201d for Waltrip\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, and suspended his investigation of the accident after she advised, \u201clet\u2019s just ride this thing along and see what happens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">Waltrip filed a \u201cFirst Report of Accident\u201d on November 16, 1998, and the commission, on December 8, 1998, issued \u201cNotice of [a] Hearing\u201d scheduled for January 19, 1999. Waltrip appeared at the proceedings and denied liability, relying upon lack of timely notice of both the accident and hearing, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A). Deputy Commissioner Andrea White Lee awarded claimant benefits against Doyan, but, citing Code \u00a7 65.2-600(D), relieved Waltrip of liability because Waltrip had not received timely notice of the accident, without \u201creasonable excuse\u201d by claimant, resulting in \u201cprejudice\u201d to Waltrip. Code \u00a7 65.2-600(D). Claimant appealed to the full commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Affirming the deputy on appeal, albeit \u201c[f]or different reasons,\u201d the commission relied upon Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A) to deny the claim, reasoning that, in default of notice of the accident within thirty days of occurrence, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A) and (D), Waltrip, as statutory employer, was entitled to sixty days notice of the scheduled hearing in accordance with Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-600 (formerly Code \u00a7 65.1-85) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>A. Every injured employee or his representative shall immediately on the occurrence of an accident or as soon thereafter as practicable, give or cause to be given to the employer a written notice of the accident. <em>If notice of accident is not given to a statutory employer, such statutory employer may be held responsible for ... awards of compensation rendered by the Commission if (i) he shall have had at least sixty days\u2019 notice of the hearing to ascertain compensability of the accident, and (ii) the statutory employer was not prejudiced by lack of notice of the accident.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-4\">s}s \u00a3 H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">D. <em>No compensation or medical benefit shall be payable unless such written notice is given within SO days after the occurrence of the accident </em>or death, unless reasonable excuse is made to the satisfaction of the Commission for not giving such notice and the Commission is satisfied that the employer has not been prejudiced thereby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">(Emphasis added). Such notice must be provided to <em>both </em>\u201cthe employer\u201d and \u201cany statutory employer.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A); <em>see Race Fork Coal Co. v. Turner, </em>237 Va. 639, 644, 379 S.E.2d 341, 343-44 (1989); <em>Wagner Enterprises v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 896-97, 407 S.E.2d 32, 36 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">In adjudicating claims arising under the Act, the commission and judiciary have accorded equal dignity to written and actual notice to employers. In <em>Department of Game and Inland Fisheries v. Joyce, </em>147 Va. 89, 136 S.E. 651 (1927), the Supreme Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">[Wjhere there was no written notice but ... where a foreman or superior officer had actual knowledge of the occurrence of an accident or death within a reasonable time after the accident or death occurred and no prejudice to the employer\u2019s rights was shown, this was sufficient notice under ... the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 97, 136 S.E. at 654; <em>see Kane Plumbing v. Small, </em>7 Va.App. 132, 138, 371 S.E.2d 828, 832 (1988) (knowledge by Small\u2019s supervisor of his injury was notice to actual employer). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Following <em>Kane, </em>this Court also deemed actual notice to a <em>statutory </em>employer sufficient compliance with the notice requirements of Code \u00a7 65.1-85 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A)). <em>See Wagner Enterprises, </em>12 Va.App. at 897, 407 S.E.2d at 36-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">However, notice of the accident, whether written or actual, must also be timely, \u201cgiven within 30 days after the occurrence ..., unless reasonable excuse is made to the satisfaction of the commission ... and the commission is satisfied that the employer has not been prejudiced thereby.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-600(D). The resolution of claims attended by untimely notice to actual employers, guided by a Code \u00a7 65.2-600(D) analysis, is not unique in our jurisprudence. However, a paucity of decisions have addressed the responsibility of a similarly situated statutory employer, with <em>Race Fork </em>the seminal opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">In <em>Race Fork, </em>the commission held the statutory employer, Race Fork Coal Company, responsible for a previous award of the commission to an injured worker, despite an absence of notice to Race Fork of either the accident or compensability hearing, a decision subsequently affirmed by this Court. <em>See </em>237 Va. at 642, 379 S.E.2d at 342-43. In reversing on appeal, the Supreme Court expressly declined to dismiss the claim against Race Fork, recognizing that an employee \u201cmay not know the relationship between his employer and some third party, who may be a statutory employer at the time of ... injury, and ... may not reasonably discover that relationship within a period of 30 days thereafter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644, 379 S.E.2d at 343-44. However, the Court concluded that due process entitled Race Fork to a <em>\u201cde novo </em>hearing\u201d to adjudicate the respective \u201crights to benefits under the Act,\u201d <em>provided </em>that the claimant tendered to the commission a \u201creasonable excuse for not giving [timely] notice\u201d of the accident and Race Fork had not been prejudiced by a default in notice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 644, 379 S.E.2d at 344. Thus, the Court sought to at once preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>the interest of- the injured worker and safeguard the right of the statutory employer, without proper notice of the accident, to a hearing on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Mindful of prior judicial construction and application of the notice requirements prescribed by Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A) and (D) and its precursors, the General Assembly, in 1997, amended Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A) to render a statutory employer, without \u201cnotice of the accident,\u201d responsible for related compensation awarded by the commission, if such statutory employer is afforded sixty days notice of the attendant hearing and \u201cwas not prejudiced by lack of notice of the accident.\u201d Thus, the amendment established a liability test unique to those statutory employers without timely notice of the accident, one apart from the reasonable excuse/prejudice inquiry prescribed for actual employers by Code \u00a7 65.2-600(D), and the commission applied the revised Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A) analysis to the instant claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">\u201cWell established \u2018principles of statutory construction require us to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 563, 566, 454 S.E.2d 3, 4 (1995) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen new provisions are added to existing legislation by amendment, we presume that the legislature \u2018acted with full knowledge of and in reference to the existing law upon the same subject and the construction placed upon it by the eourts[,]\u2019 ... that the legislature acted purposefully with the intent to change existing law.\u201d <em>Burke v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 183, 188, 510 S.E.2d 743, 745-46 (1999) (citations omitted). When \u201c \u2018the several provisions of a statute suggest a potential for conflict or inconsistency,\u2019 \u201d we must construe such \u201c \u2018provisions so as to reconcile them and to give full effect to the expressed legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Herrel v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 579, 585, 507 S.E.2d 633, 636 (1998) (citation omitted). Finally, \u2018\u201c[t]he construction afforded a statute by the public officials charged with its administration and enforcement is entitled to be given weight by a court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lynch v. Lee, </em>19 Va.App. 230, 232, 450 S.E.2d 391, 392 (1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>Here, the legislative, administrative and judicial history of Code \u00a7 65.2-600 clearly suggests that the legislature intended, by the amendment, that the potential responsibility of a statutory employer for a claim under the Act, absent timely notice of the related accident, be resolved upon considerations different from those enumerated in Code \u00a7 65.2-600(D), applicable to actual employers. The attenuated, oftentimes remote, relationship between the statutory employer and the worker, together with the need to preserve the rights and responsibilities of each, required a balancing of competing interests through a distinct procedural course. Thus, the legislature, while mandating notice of an accident within thirty days of the occurrence to both statutory and actual employers, fashioned a threshold inquiry specific to a determination of responsibility under the Act upon a statutory employer without <em>timely </em>notice of the accident. Under such circumstances, the statutory employer must have received at \u201cleast sixty days notice of the hearing to ascertain compensability of the accident\u201d and suffered no prejudice from \u201clack of notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">Applying Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A) to the instant record, the commission correctly concluded that Waltrip neither received timely notice of the accident nor at least sixty days notice of the hearing. Accordingly, the commission properly ruled that Waltrip was \u201cnot responsible for the award of compensation\u201d to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-8\">.
