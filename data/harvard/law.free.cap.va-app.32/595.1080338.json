Gardner contends the record establishes a fatal variance between the indictment, which charged she obtained her grandfather\u2019s money, and the evidence, which she alleges proved she obtained a bank\u2019s money. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The grand jury\u2019s indictment charged that \u201cGardner did feloniously and fraudulently obtain, by false pretense ..., United States currency of a value greater than $200.00, the property of George Gardner[, her grandfather], with the intent to defraud him ... [in violation of Code \u00a7] 18.2-178.\u201d At trial, the evidence proved that Gardner\u2019s grandfather maintained a savings account at Wachovia Bank. On May 1, 1998, Gardner appeared at the bank and presented to a teller a withdrawal slip for $725 from her grandfather\u2019s account. The teller informed her that \u201cthere was a block put on this account.\u201d One-half hour later, Gardner returned to the bank with the same withdrawal slip, which contained additional writings, including the notation that \u201cLatasha is allowed to receive and sign this [withdrawal slip].\u201d The withdrawal slip contained the writing \u201cGeorge Gardner, Sr.\u201d and the account number. The teller accepted the withdrawal slip, processed the transaction, and gave Gardner $725.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">A detective testified that several weeks after the withdrawal, Gardner admitted she signed her grandfather\u2019s name on the deposit slip. She explained that her grandfather had authorized her to do so. Gardner\u2019s grandfather testified, however, that he did not authorize Gardner to withdraw money from his bank account. He also testified that the handwriting of his name on the withdrawal slip was not his signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>A manager employed by the bank testified that the withdrawal slip was \u201cdrawn on the account of [Gardner\u2019s grandfather].\u201d He further testified that \u201cbefore [the funds were] actually taken off of [Gardner\u2019s grandfather\u2019s] account,\u201d the bank learned Gardner was not authorized to obtain the funds. The bank referred the investigation of the unauthorized withdrawal to the branch office where the transaction occurred and did not debit Gardner\u2019s grandfather\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, Gardner\u2019s attorney made a motion to strike the evidence, alleging that the evidence proved the money belonged to the bank, not to Gardner\u2019s grandfather. The trial judge denied the motion and convicted Gardner of the offense charged in the indictment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 18.2-178 provides as follows: If any person obtain, by any false pretense ..., from any person, with intent to defraud, money or other property which may be the subject of larceny, he shall be deemed guilty of larceny thereof....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">This statute requires the Commonwealth to prove the following elements: \u201can intent to defraud, an actual fraud, use of false pretenses for the purpose of perpetrating the fraud, and accomplishment of the fraud by means of the false pretenses used for that purpose.\u201d <em>Quidley v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 963, 965, 275 S.E.2d 622, 624 (1981). The evidence in this record clearly proved each of those elements beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Gardner contends, however, that a fatal variance exists between the indictment and the evidence because the victim of her conduct was the bank and not her grandfather. She relies upon principles stated in <em>Bennet v. First &amp; Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>233 Va. 355, 360, 355 S.E.2d 888, 891 (1987) (noting that a depositor\u2019s \u201cfunds become the property of the bank immediately on deposit, and the bank becomes the debtor of the depositor\u201d), and <em>Central Nat\u2019l Bank v. First and Merchants </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>Nat'l Bank of Richmond, </em>171 Va. 289, 303, 198 S.E. 883, 888 (1938) (stating \u201c[t]he general rule ... that a depositor\u2019s funds in a bank are unaffected by any unauthorized payment\u201d). We hold that the proof established the elements of the offense as they pertain to her grandfather\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Rejecting an appellant\u2019s contention in <em>Quidley </em>that \u201ca fatal variance\u201d existed, the Supreme Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABb\">[Tjhere is no [statutory] requirement that the intended victim suffer actual pecuniary loss. Ultimate financial gain or loss to the victim is immaterial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">The crime is complete when the fraud intended is consummated by obtaining the property sought by means of the false representations, and the offense is not purged by ultimate restoration or payment to the victim. It is sufficient if the fraud of the accused has put the victim in such a position that he may eventually suffer loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">221 Va. at 966, 275 S.E.2d at 625 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The evidence proved that Gardner gave a teller a withdrawal slip, containing false and forged information, to obtain money from her grandfather\u2019s account on deposit at the bank. When the bank paid money to Gardner pursuant to the tenor of the withdrawal slip, the bank provisionally accepted the withdrawal slip as a debit transaction for Gardner\u2019s grandfather\u2019s account. Although the bank did not complete the process of posting the debit transaction to the account after the bank learned of the fraud, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 8.4-213(l)(C), the evidence clearly established that Gardner used her grandfather\u2019s name and account number as the means to obtain the cash withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The general principles stated in <em>Bennet </em>and <em>Central National Bank </em>do not control the resolution of this issue. We recognize that the Uniform Commercial Code significantly defines the relationship between a drawee bank and its account customers and provides remedies as between a drawee bank and its account customers for the payment of forged instruments. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.4-401 through 8.4-407. The issue presented here, however, is not the abstract nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the bank\u2019s underlying civil liability to Gardner\u2019s grandfather. Rather, the issue is the nature of the transaction Gardner engaged in when she made the withdrawal. In that transaction, Gardner intended to withdraw funds her grandfather placed on deposit with the bank. In honoring the withdrawal slip, the bank paid cash to Gardner upon its provisional determination that the transaction was authorized. Resolving an analogous issue, the Court in <em>United States v. Pavloski, </em>574 F.2d 933 (7th Cir.1978), ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">In arguing that the check forging activities did not constitute embezzling or converting moneys and funds of the union, [the appellant] relies on the commercial law doctrine that a drawee bank pays its own funds, not those of its depositor, when it honors a forged check. Because of this doctrine, he argues, in legal effect he did not embezzle the union\u2019s funds, but rather converted funds of the hank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax4\">[However], \u201cfunds\u201d of the union were converted to the use of [appellant] when the bank debited the account of the union, as it did when each forged check was honored. That these reductions in funds were temporary would not exonerate [appellant] from liability....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 935-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">When Gardner \u201cobtained [the money] ... through use of the fraudulent [withdrawal slip], the crime charged was complete at that instant.\u201d <em>Quidley, </em>221 Va. at 966, 275 S.E.2d at 625. At the moment the transaction occurred, the bank honored a demand to pay funds held for the account of Gardner\u2019s grandfather. The bank\u2019s later discovery of the forgery and its decision not to debit Gardner\u2019s grandfather\u2019s account do not provide a basis to conclude that the transaction, when it occurred, was unrelated to Gardner\u2019s grandfather\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">For these reasons, we hold that no variance existed between the indictment and the proof. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
