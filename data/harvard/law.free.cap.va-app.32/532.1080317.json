(Holtzman) appeals a final circuit court judgment upholding a decision by the Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) denying reimbursement from the Petroleum Storage Tank Fund (Tank Fund).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the DEQ denied its request, Holtzman appealed pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:1 through 9-6.14:25. The circuit court ruled that the agency\u2019s decision was not \u201carbitrary or capricious resulting in a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the evidence supports the circuit court\u2019s order affirming the DEQ\u2019s decision denying reimbursement from the Tank Fund. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The evidence established that on November 5, 1993, Holtzman notified the DEQ of its intent to remove certain underground storage tanks from a gas station in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In December 1993, the tanks were replaced. During the tank removal process, Holtzman discovered \u201cmildly contaminated soils but saw no evidence of a leaking tank or line during any part of the excavation.\u201d Upon further investigation, the company learned that \u201cthe product lines had been replaced in the early 1980\u2019s due to leaks.\u201d Approximately 2,900 tons of soil were excavated from the Harrisonburg site and laboratory analysis of the \u201cbackfill material in the basins\u201d showed the petroleum hydrocarbon level in the soil was 160 parts per million. Holtzman notified the DEQ of these findings on December 8,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">On December 15,1993, the DEQ informed Holtzman that, in accordance with applicable regulations, it was required to perform a \u201cRelease Investigation Report\u201d upon a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>contaminated soils. That report, submitted by the company on January 31, 1994, disclosed that nine underground tanks had been removed from the site, no holes were found in any of the tanks, and samples of the soils alongside and beneath the tanks showed petroleum hydrocarbon levels ranging from 24 to 57 parts per million. A sample of \u201cbackfill material\u201d from around the diesel tank showed petroleum hydrocarbon in the soil of 160 parts per million and samples of \u201cbackfill material\u201d from the main excavation showed 129 and 42 parts per million. In February 1994, without prior notice to the DEQ, Holtzman incinerated the 2,900 tons of contaminated soil at a total cost of $140,705.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Based on the Release Investigation Report and addendum information, the Valley Regional Office of the DEQ found no \u201csignificant release\u201d and that \u201cthe risk in the urban setting would be extremely low.\u201d The regional office recommended \u201cthat the case should be closed.\u201d In its letter dated October 20, 1994, the DEQ notified Holtzman that it was closing its investigation and that no further \u201ccorrective action\u201d would be required unless \u201csignificant environmental or health/safety problems develop in this area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 62.1-44.34:11, Holtzman made a formal request on March 22, 1995 for reimbursement from the Tank Fund for the clean-up costs. Holtzman alleged that the removal of the contaminated soil constituted an \u201cabatement activity\u201d within the meaning of Virginia Regulation 680-13-02 \u00a7 6.3(A)(4) and, based on its interpretation of the applicable regulations, the clean-up costs were reimbursable.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">On July 18, 1995, the DEQ denied Holtzman\u2019s request for reimbursement. In a letter dated October 11, 1995, the DEQ explained its reasons for denying the claim, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">[Rjeview of the file indicates that the denials stem from the excavation of soils <em>without approval by the Regional Office.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADg\">* <em>* </em>* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">... [T]he Agency is required by law to determine whether the activities submitted for reimbursement <em>were ap</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>\u2022proved </em>or <em>would have been approved </em>had they been timely presented to the Agency for consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">Valley Regional Office (VRO) files indicate that your client failed to contact VRO staff to determine whether soil removal would be approved. Moreover, VRO files indicate that the removal would not have been approved had your client timely requested such consideration. Among other things, (1) even the highest TPH result showed minimal contamination; (2) the site is in a location with public water, meaning there was no threat of a drinking water impact; and (3) there were no basements nearby, meaning there was no threat of a building vapor impact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Holtzman sought review by the DEQ\u2019s Reconsideration Panel (Panel). In its opinion letter dated May 28, 1995, the Panel issued its final decision denying Holtzman\u2019s request for reimbursement. The Panel considered the issue before it to be \u201cwhether the removal of the soil from the Rolling Hills site was necessary for corrective action.\u201d Because Holtzman did not seek prior approval from the DEQ before incinerating the soil and consistent with the regulations and policy then in effect, the Panel determined whether the excavation would have been approved had the DEQ been properly notified. On reconsideration, the Panel affirmed the denial of Holtzman\u2019s claim, stating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">Soil excavation and removal may be conducted when implementing a corrective action plan or as part of a Phase II initial abatement. <em>The regulation and Agency guidance indicate that initial abatement activities do not normally include removal of soil with low levels of contamination, as the focus is instead on abatement of fire, vapor and explosion hazards.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">The course of events at your site indicated that the soil was removed as part of site reconstruction and not as part of corrective action. The fact that the soil already had been excavated before you reported a release establishes that the soil removal was not conducted as an abatement activity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>Equally important, during the meeting you acknowledged that the soil was removed to allow for site reconstruction rather than for environmental considerations (corrective action).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">Given the preceding facts, we must conclude that the soil excavation was not a necessary, approvable corrective action activity. Because the soil excavation was not a necessary corrective action activity, the subsequent disposal activity also was not a necessary corrective action activity. Thus, costs incurred as a result of the soil excavation are not approved for reimbursement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">On July 31, 1996, Holtzman appealed the DEQ\u2019s final decision to the circuit court. The circuit court affirmed the DEQ\u2019s decision, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">In reviewing the record, I must afford the agency decision a presumption of official regularity, and I must take into account the experience and specialized competence of the [Board] and DEQ. I am not to substitute my own judgment for that of the agency. While I find Holtzman\u2019s position quite reasonable in this case, I cannot find that the agency\u2019s decision was arbitrary or capricious resulting in a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The circuit court denied Holtzman\u2019s motion for reconsideration, concluding that it could not \u201csubstitute [its] judgment\u201d for the \u201cfactual determination^]\u201d by the \u201cagency officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Judicial review of agency decisions is authorized by the VAPA. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17. Issues of law specified in the statute \u201cfall into two categories: first, whether the agency ... acted within the scope of [its] authority, and second, whether the decision itself was supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Johnston-Willis Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988). Although many circumstances involve \u201cmixed questions\u201d of both \u201claw and fact,\u201d issues are sometimes \u201coversimplified\u201d as \u201clegal\u201d or \u201cfactual,\u201d a distinction that is signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>cant to judicial review of an administrative decision. <em>Id. </em>at 248, 369 S.E.2d at 7. The separate standards of review determine the degree of deference, if any, to be given to an agency\u2019s decision on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 246, 369 S.E.2d at 9.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1e\">Where the issue is whether there is substantial evidence to support findings of fact, great deference is to be accorded the agency decision. Where the issue falls outside the specialized competence of the agency, such as constitutional and statutory interpretation issues, little deference is required to be accorded the agency decision. <em>Where, however, the issue concerns an agency decision based on the proper application of its expert discretion, the reviewing court will not substitute its own independent judgment for that of the agency but rather will reverse the agency decision only if that decision was arbitrary and capricious. </em>Finally, in reviewing an agency decision, the courts are required to consider the experience and specialized competence of the agency and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency acted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The DEQ, acting in conjunction with the Board, is the Virginia agency charged with administrating the Tank Fund. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.34:10 through 62.1-44.34:13; Code \u00a7\u00a7 10.1-1182 through 10.1-1187. The DEQ possesses the requisite experience and competence necessary to determine levels of contamination and the reimbursement due \u201cowners and operators\u201d for the reasonable costs incurred for their environmental clean-up efforts. As such, its interpretations of the statutes and regulations governing the Tank Fund\u2019s reimbursement policies are entitled to deference by a reviewing court and should only be overturned when found to be arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Fralin v. Kozlowski, </em>18 Va.App. 697, 701, 447 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">III. TANK FUND REIMBURSEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Holtzman argues that it was required under VR 680-13-02 \u00a7 6.3 to remove and dispose of the contaminated soil at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>its Harrisonburg site simply because there was a confirmed release of petroleum in the environment. In seeking reimbursement, Holtzman interprets VR 680-13-02 \u00a7 6.3(A)(4) to mean that the costs for <em>any </em>\u201cabatement activity\u201d under this subsection are reimbursable. Applying the plain meaning of the term \u201cabate,\u201d Holtzman contends an activity that \u201creduc\u00e9is] or lessen[s]\u201d soil contamination falls within the meaning of the regulations. Because the excavation in the instant case resulted in a reduction or lessening of the petroleum hydrocarbon levels in the soil, Holtzman concludes that the clean-up efforts were reimbursable. We hold that the trial judge did not err in affirming the DEQ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The Tank Fund was established to reimburse \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d costs incurred by \u201cowners and operators\u201d of underground petroleum storage tanks \u201cin taking corrective action for any release of petroleum into the environment____\u201d Code \u00a7 62.1-44.34:ll(A)(2)(a). A \u201crelease\u201d means \u201cany spilling, leaking, emitting, discharging, escaping, leaching, or disposing from an underground storage tank or facility into ... subsurface soils....\u201d Code \u00a7 62.1-44.34:10. The regulations provide for reimbursement in, among others, the following two instances: (1) where there is <em>\u201ccorrective action </em>necessary to protect human health and the environment,\u201d VR 680-13-03 \u00a7 21(A)(1) (emphasis added); or (2) where the owner or operator conducts a \u201cboard approved <em>corrective action plan.\u201d </em>VR 680-13-03 \u00a7 21(A)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Because Holtzman\u2019s activities were not conducted pursuant to a \u201cboard approved corrective action plan,\u201d the sole issue before us is whether the excavation of the contaminated soil constituted \u201ccorrective action necessary to protect human health and the environment.\u201d In making this determination, we note that effective March 1, 1995, DEQ policy required that \u201ccorrective action activities be authorized by the appropriate Regional Office in order to be eligible for reimbursement.\u201d However, consistent with the regulations and policy in effect at the time of the instant case, reimbursement for \u201ccorrective action\u201d activities would be proper if Holtzman\u2019s activities \u201cwere approved or <em>would have been approved </em>had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>they been timely presented to the Agency for consideration.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The DEQ\u2019s denial of reimbursement costs from the Tank Fund was consistent with the applicable regulations, was supported by the evidence in the record, and was not arbitrary and capricious. The DEQ concluded that \u201cthe soil excavation itself was not a necessary corrective action activity\u201d and that \u201cthe subsequent disposal activity also was not a necessary corrective action activity.\u201d The phrase \u201ccorrective action\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">all actions necessary to abate, contain and cleanup a release from an underground storage tank, to mitigate the public health or environmental threat from such releases and to rehabilitate state waters in accordance with [Sections 5 and 6] of VR 680-13-02.... The term does not include those actions normally associated with closure or change in service as set out in [Section 7] of VR 680-13-02 or the replacement of an underground storage tank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">VR 680-13-03 \u00a7 1. Thus, any one of the activities enumerated in Sections 5 and 6 of VR 680-13-02 may constitute \u201ccorrective action,\u201d including the following: \u201c[rjelease investigation and confirmation steps\u201d; \u201c[reporting and cleanup of spills and overfills\u201d; and \u201csite characterization.\u201d VR 680-13-02 \u00a7\u00a7 5.3, 5.4, 6.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">As applied in the instant case, the term \u201ccorrective action\u201d also includes those activities conducted as \u201cinitial response\u201d measures under Section 6.2 or \u201cinitial abatement measures\u201d under Section 6.3. <em>See </em>VR 680-13-02 \u00a7\u00a7 6.2, 6.3. The clear language of Section 6.2 requires that upon a confirmed release of petroleum, owners and operators must: (1) report the release to the Board within twenty-four hours; (2) take immediate actions to prevent further release; and (3) identify and mitigate fire, explosion, and vapor hazards. <em>See </em>VR 680-13-02 \u00a7 6.2. The DEQ has interpreted VR 680-13-02 \u00a7 6.2 to include those activities involving \u201chazards\u201d to \u201chuman health, safety and the environment,\u201d which \u201cmust be initiated immediately.\u201d As applied to the instant case, Holtzman may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>recover its costs for clean-up as an \u201cinitial response\u201d activity under Section 6.2 because that regulation addresses those activities used to \u201cmitigate fire, explosion, and vapor hazards,\u201d none of which was present here. Indeed, in its final decision, the DEQ concluded that \u201c[t]he regulations and Agency guidelines indicate that initial abatement activities do not normally include removal of soil with low levels of contamination, as the focus is instead on abatement of fire, vapor and explosion hazards.\u201d Because Holtzman\u2019s activities were not performed as an \u201cinitial response\u201d activity, reimbursement would not have been proper under VR 680-13-02 \u00a7 6.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Holtzman contends that it conducted an \u201cinitial abatement measure\u201d under VR 680-13-02 \u00a7 6.3. The DEQ\u2019s April 29, 1992 \u201cGuidance Memorandum\u201d characterizes the following activities as appropriate \u201cPhase I Initial Abatement Measures\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">[A]ll those activities which for human health, safety and the environment <em>must be initiated, immediately. </em>Examples of these activities include emptying the tank, free product removal, mitigation of vapor hazards and excavation/proper disposal of saturated soils immediately surrounding an [underground storage tank] being removed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">(Emphasis added). These initial abatement measures \u201cmay be undertaken <em>without </em>Regional Office approval,\u201d and the DEQ will \u201crequire [the party] to justify any questionable Initial Abatement Measures\u201d before it will reimburse those expenses. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Although Holtzman did not seek prior approval in this case, the DEQ concedes that costs may be recovered under Section 6.3 if the \u201cinitial abatement measures\u201d would have been approved had the company timely notified the DEQ of its actions. Here, Holtzman contends that any \u201cabatement activity\u201d that reduces or lessens contamination levels in the soil is reimbursable.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">In response, the DEQ argues there were no \u201chazards\u201d to remedy and, therefore, the initial abatement measure would not have been approved. Additionally, the DEQ contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>excavation of the contaminated soil was performed in the process of replacing the tank system, as opposed to the \u201cresult of release confirmation, site investigation, abatement, or corrective action activities.\u201d VR 680-13-02 \u00a7 6.3(A)(4). Thus, the DEQ concludes, the circuit court properly affirmed the DEQ\u2019s denial for reimbursement under Section 6.3 of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Contrary to Holtzman\u2019s argument, the regulations do not provide a catch-all reimbursement provision for <em>any </em>\u201cabatement activity.\u201d Rather, VR 680-13-02 \u00a7 6.3 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">A. Unless directed to do otherwise by the board, owners and operators must perform the following abatement measures:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">i~c <em>% </em>ifc sf:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">4. <em>Remedy hazards posed by contaminated soils </em>that are excavated or exposed as a result of release confirmation, site investigation, <em>abatement, </em>or corrective action activities. If these remedies include treatment or disposal of sods, the owner and operator must comply with applicable state and local requirements[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">(Emphasis added). By express terms of the regulation, to qualify for reimbursement under this section, Holtzman was required to show: (1) the existence of \u201chazards posed by contaminated soils,\u201d and (2) the hazard was the result of an \u201cabatement, or corrective action activit[y].\u201d VR 680-13-02 \u00a7 6.3(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Holtzman failed to establish the first prong of this test. As noted in the initial Regional Investigation Report, Holtzman reported that it discovered <em>\u201cmildly contaminated soils </em>but saw <em>no evidence of a leaking tank or line </em>during any part of the excavation.\u201d (Emphasis added). Upon further investigation, Holtzman learned that \u201cthe product lines had been replaced in the early 1980\u2019s due to leaks.\u201d According to DEQ records, Holtzman reported \u201cthat there were some \u2018hot spots\u2019 around some of the old pipelines but that the basin soils were okay.\u201d The DEQ agreed, stating that there was an \u201cinsignifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>cant release\u201d and that the soil \u201ccould have been used as \u2018clean fill.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, the DEQ closed its investigation of the site on October 20, 1994 and concluded \u201cfurther corrective action is not required at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Without prior notification to the Board, Holtzman incinerated the 2,900 tons of contaminated soil. In a letter explaining its denial for reimbursement, the DEQ concluded that the removal would not have been approved as \u201ccorrective action\u201d because there was \u201cminimal contamination,\u201d \u201cno threat of drinking water impact,\u201d and \u201cno threat of a building vapor impact.\u201d On review by the Panel, the DEQ further concluded that \u201cinitial abatement activities do not normally include removal of soil with low levels of contamination, as the focus is instead on abatement of fire, vapor and explosion hazards.\u201d The record supports the finding that Holtzman did not prove the level of contamination was substantial enough to require an excavation of soil so as to fall within the parameters of an initial abatement measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We accord great deference to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of the regulations it is responsible for enforcing. <em>See Hilliards v. Jackson, </em>28 Va.App. 475, 479, 506 S.E.2d 547, 550 (1998); <em>Arellano v. Pam E. K\u2019s Donuts Shop, </em>26 Va.App. 478, 483, 495 S.E.2d 519, 521 (1998). The term \u201chazard\u201d has been defined as \u201ca thing or condition that might operate against success or safety ... a possible source of peril, danger, duress or difficulty.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1041 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In the present case, Holtzman presented no evidence regarding an abatement of \u201cfire, explosion, and vapor hazards\u201d or the presence of high levels of contamination. Moreover, the record supports the following findings made by the DEQ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">[The] site is in an urban area with public water, no basements and a relatively deep water table. In addition, none of the test results showed significant contamination, including the test results from the excavated soil piles. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>evidence supports the conclusion that this was a low risk site with minimal contamination in a limited area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u2756 * * H* \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">The course of events at your site indicated that the soil was removed as part of site reconstruction and not as part of corrective action. The fact that the soil already had been excavated before you reported a release establishes that the soil removal was not conducted as an abatement activity. Equally important, during the meeting you acknowledged that the soil was removed to allow for site reconstruction rather than for environmental considerations (corrective action).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The DEQ concluded that Holtzman\u2019s actions were not necessary to \u201cremedy hazards posed by contaminated soils,\u201d and like the circuit court, we will not substitute our own independent judgment for the factual determinations of the DEQ. Because the DEQ\u2019s decision was not arbitrary and capricious, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\">.
