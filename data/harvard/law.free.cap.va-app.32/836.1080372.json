Winckler contends 1) the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that to support a conviction for capital murder, robbery must have been a motivating factor in the killing of Hanna; and 2) the Commonwealth offered insufficient evidence to prove capital murder under the theory of \u201cmurder committed in the commission of robbery.\u201d We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">We review the evidence pertinent to a defendant\u2019s challenged jury instruction in the light most favorable to the defendant. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 524, 526, 414 S.E.2d 401, 401 (1992) <em>(en banc). </em>On July 4, 1997, Stacy Hanna came to the City of Richmond from Lynchburg and moved into an apartment on Belmont Avenue, which she shared with Dana Vaughn, Robin Thurkill, Kelly Tibbs, and occasionally Tracy Bitner. Winckler lived nearby and was part of the social circle that included Hanna and her apartment mates. These women were all lesbians. Bitner and Tibbs previously had been romantically involved but had ended the relationship prior to Hanna\u2019s arrival in Richmond. Soon after Hanna moved into the Belmont Avenue apartment, she developed a romantic attachment to Tibbs, but Hanna \u201cended up liking [Tibbs] more than [Tibbs] liked [Hanna].\u201d On July 24, 1997, Tibbs and Winckler had a violent altercation with Hanna, because Tibbs believed Hanna had lied about a romantic relationship between Tibbs and another individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">On the afternoon of Saturday, July 26, 1997, Vaughn, Hanna, and Tibbs met in the Belmont Avenue apartment with Bitner, Winckler, and Stephanie Cull, another member of Hanna\u2019s circle of friends. Winckler, Tibbs, Bitner, and Cull left in Cull\u2019s car to pick up Thurkill from her job at a local restaurant. On the way to pick up Thurkill, the women began to complain about Hanna\u2019s recent fabrications concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Tibbs, and they agreed that \u201cthey were going to kick [Hanna\u2019s] butt, teach her a lesson for lying.\u201d Later in the evening, these women, along with Hanna and Vaughn, attended a party at a friend\u2019s home, during which Vaughn fell ill. The group left the party in Cull\u2019s car. Cull drove the vehicle, while Tibbs and Bitner rode in the front seat; Hanna, Vaughn, and Winckler rode in the back. They proceeded to Marsh Field in Chesterfield County and parked next to a small building. There, all the women exited the car except for Hanna and Vaughn, who continued to feel ill. Tibbs eventually returned to the car and remained with Vaughn while Hanna joined the others, who were standing just a few feet in front of the vehicle. The women had decided to give Hanna a \u201cbutt kicking\u201d for lying about Tibbs.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Soon after Hanna exited the vehicle and joined Winckler, Bitner, and Cull, Tibbs also rejoined the group, leaving Vaughn alone in the car. The women walked to the other side of the small building, where Tibbs and Winckler began to hit and kick Hanna. Bitner also joined in the assault. Bitner, Winckler, and Tibbs began to cut Hanna with razor-bladed box cutters. Within minutes, Vaughn observed Hanna\u2019s back covered with blood. Vaughn also saw Winckler strike Hanna with a belt and then throw a cinder block on Hanna as she lay on the ground. The assault lasted approximately ten minutes, after which Tibbs, Bitner, Cull, and Winckler returned to the car and drove a \u201ccouple [of] miles\u201d away, leaving Hanna at Marsh Field. When the women became concerned that Hanna would report the assault, they returned to Marsh Field. They concluded it was necessary to kill and \u201cget rid of\u2019 Hanna.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Upon returning to Marsh Field, Cull told the other women to put Hanna in the trunk of the car because Hanna \u201cwas going to get blood everywhere.\u201d Winckler and Tibbs did so despite Hanna\u2019s pleas to be allowed to ride in the passenger compartment. The women drove away from the scene for a second time, with Hanna striking the interior of the trunk with her hands. In response to Hanna\u2019s banging on the trunk, Cull stopped the car; Winckler got out and opened the trunk. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Hanna asked to be taken to a telephone so she could call her mother; Winckler said \u201cno,\u201d shut the trunk and got back in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The women continued driving and discussed whether they should take Hanna to a hospital. Winckler and Bitner opposed doing so, fearing Hanna would report their actions. Bitner stated that Hanna\u2019s \u201ctongue needed to be cut out\u201d so she could not report them; Winckler stated that Hanna\u2019s \u201cfingers need[ed] to be cut off\u2019 so she could not make a written report. Cull stopped the car along an unidentified back road. All the women except Vaughn got out and opened the trunk for a second time. By this time, Hanna was \u201cbleeding really bad.\u201d Winckler demanded Hanna\u2019s rings and watch. Hanna refused at first but finally complied, asking that she be allowed to keep one ring. Winckler refused. During this stop, Cull cut Hanna on the leg with a box cutter and at least one of the women spat on her. After they sealed Hanna in the trunk again, they drove on.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The group finally arrived at Nash Road, where they got Hanna out of the trunk and walked her down the deserted road. Cull cut Hanna on the back with a box cutter, and Hanna fell to the ground. Bitner, Tibbs, and Winckler dragged her approximately 100 yards further and there stopped to remove Hanna\u2019s clothes, which belonged to Tibbs. Winckler stabbed Hanna in the chest with a box cutter and held her in the mud while Bitner slit Hanna\u2019s throat with another box cutter. Winckler and Bitner returned to the car, Tibbs remaining with Hanna for a few more minutes. Once back at the car, Bitner boasted that she had cut Hanna\u2019s throat, stuffed mud in her mouth, and stabbed Hanna \u201cnear the heart saying I want your heart bitch, give me your heart, why won\u2019t you die.\u201d Winckler admitted she stabbed Hanna \u201cover and over again\u201d as well, and Tibbs said she had \u201cstuck a stick\u201d in Hanna\u2019s chest. Once the women returned to the car, they left the scene. As they drove away, Winckler announced that if any of them reported what had just happened, \u201cthe same thing could happen to them.\u201d The women disposed of Hanna\u2019s blood-stained clothes and other evidence in a trash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>receptacle near Matchpoint Apartments, then returned to the Belmont Avenue apartment and cleaned themselves. Tibbs later told Vaughn that one of them had carved the word \u201cliar\u201d in Hanna\u2019s back.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">On Sunday, July 27, 1997, City of Richmond and Chesterfield County police officers went to the Belmont Avenue apartment to investigate and later took the women to the Richmond police department for questioning. Chesterfield County Detective Rick Mormando interviewed Winckler and taped her statement. During the interview, Mormando recovered Hanna\u2019s watch from Winckler\u2019s wrist, and Winckler admitted taking it from Hanna while Hanna was in the trunk of Cull\u2019s car. Winckler told Mormando that when she and the other women had opened the trunk for the second time on the previous night, she told Hanna, whom she described as \u201cscared sh \u2014 less,\u201d to \u201cgive me your watch, [and] give me your rings.\u201d When asked why she took the watch, Winckler replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just liked it.\u201d She stated that Hanna was physically incapable of resisting when Winckler demanded the watch and rings. She further stated that Hanna only surrendered the watch and rings because \u201cshe was scared sh \u2014 less that [I was] going to do something else to her.\u201d Winckler told Mormando that she and the other women had already decided to kill Hanna when they drove to Nash Road. She also confessed that she stabbed Hanna in the chest and \u201ctried to push her face in the mud ... to suffocate her....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">On January 14, 1998, a jury found Winckler guilty of robbery, abduction, and capital murder. The jury fixed her sentence at thirty years incarceration for the robbery conviction, ten years incarceration for the abduction conviction, and death for the capital murder conviction. The trial court set aside the death sentence and imposed a sentence of imprisonment for life on the capital murder conviction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Winckler contends: 1) the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that, to convict Winckler of capital murder, robbery must have been a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d for the killing; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>and 2) the evidence was insufficient to prove that robbery motivated Winckler to kill Hanna and the trial court, therefore, should either have struck the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the capital murder charge or set aside Winckler\u2019s conviction for capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">\n<em>JURY INSTRUCTION ON CAPITAL MURDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Winckler proffered two jury instructions on capital murder,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which the trial court refused.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Winckler contends the court\u2019s ruling constituted reversible error, arguing that the two proffered instructions were necessary and proper statements of applicable law requiring the Commonwealth to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>prove that robbery was a motivating factor for the homicide in order to sustain a conviction of capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The issues raised on appeal are identical to those in our recent decision in <em>Tibbs v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 687, 525 S.E.2d 579 (2000), which governs this case. In <em>Tibbs, </em>we held that to support a capital murder conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4), the Commonwealth was not required to prove the robbery was a motivating factor for the homicide that was committed. <em>See id. </em>at 705, 525 S.E.2d at 587-88. Rather, a conviction for capital murder will be sustained on appeal where \u201csufficient evidence [is] presented from which the fact finder can conclude that the killing and robbery were \u2018interdependent objects of a common criminal design.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706, 525 S.E.2d at 588 (quoting <em>Edmonds v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 303, 310, 329 S.E.2d 807, 813, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 975, 106 S.Ct. 339, 88 L.Ed.2d 324 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Based on our decision in <em>Tibbs </em>and the case law which underlies it, we find that the proposed instructions misstated the law and that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that robbery must have been a motivating factor for Hanna\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">\n<em>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE TO PROVE CAPITAL MURDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">\u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of evidence on appeal, \u2018the appellate court must examine the evidence and all inferences reasonably deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 54, 64, 521 S.E.2d 293, 298 (1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em>255 Va. 516, 521, 499 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1998)). We find the evidence sufficient to support Winckler\u2019s conviction of capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">\u201cMurder in the commission of a robbery is a killing which takes place before, during, or after the robbery and is so closely related thereto in time, place, and causal connection as to make the killing part of the same criminal enterprise as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>the robbery.\u201d <em>George v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 264, 277-78, 411 S.E.2d 12, 20 (1991) (citations omitted). As noted in <em>Tibbs, </em>to sustain a conviction for capital murder, \u201csufficient evidence must be presented from which the fact finder can conclude that the killing and robbery were \u2018interdependent objects of a common criminal design.\u2019 \u201d 31 Va.App. at 706, 525 S.E.2d at 588. Where the defendant is motivated by the dual purpose of robbing the victim and committing another felonious act against the victim that results in death, the robbery and murder are parts of the same criminal enterprise. <em>See George, </em>242 Va. at 280, 411 S.E.2d at 21-22. The defendant\u2019s possession of some \u201cfruit of the robbery\u201d may show \u201cconclusively that the violence against [the victim] and the trespass to his [property]\u201d are \u201cso closely related in time, place, and causal connection as to make the killing, as a matter of law, a part of the same criminal enterprise [as the robbery].\u201d <em>Briley v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 532, 544, 273 S.E.2d 48, 55-56 (1980) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Taylor, </em>31 Va.App. at 64, 521 S.E.2d at 298. Winekler does not deny her participation in Hanna\u2019s murder. She concedes that she was motivated at the outset of the evening to cause grievous physical harm to Hanna. In the course of that evening, as Winekler and her cohorts were transporting the weak and badly injured Hanna to the site where they planned to kill her, the group stopped, opened the trunk of the car, and Winekler demanded that Hanna surrender her watch and jewelry. Hanna protested, but her will was overborne by Winekler due to Hanna\u2019s state of helplessness and terror. Winekler then sealed Hanna in the trunk again and the group continued on to the location where they murdered her.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Hanna\u2019s helplessness and intimidation were the direct result of the initial assault committed by Winekler, Tibbs, and Bitner. Her helpless and intimidated state was magnified and exacerbated by her confinement in the trunk of Cull\u2019s car, from which she pleaded to be released. Winckler\u2019s demand for and acquisition of Hanna\u2019s property took advantage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Hanna\u2019s extremely debilitated condition, which Winekler had helped to create. In addition, Winekler and her .companions attempted to conceal their crimes of assault and battery and robbery by taking the helpless and terrified Hanna to a deserted location and murdering her. Winekler was found soon after the murder in possession of a \u201cfruit of the robbery,\u201d viz. Hanna\u2019s watch. Possession of the \u201cfruit of the crime,\u201d together with the other evidence in the case, may show \u201cconclusively that the violence against [the victim] and the trespass to [her property]\u201d were \u201cso closely related in time, place, and causal connection as to make the killing, as a matter of law, a part of the same criminal enterprise [as the robbery].\u201d <em>Briley, </em>221 Va. at 544, 273 S.E.2d at 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Based upon this record, we find the jury had sufficient evidence upon which to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the robbery and murder were interdependent objects of a common criminal design, and, accordingly, to find Winekler guilty of capital murder. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm Winckler\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\">.
