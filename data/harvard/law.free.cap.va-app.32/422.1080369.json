Penn argues (1) that the circuit court erred in deeming him to be a \u201cprisoner\u201d within the meaning of the statute, and (2) that the court erroneously founded its jurisdiction to try his case on Code \u00a7 53.1-205. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">On January 10,1998, Penn was arrested for public drunkenness. He was charged under Code \u00a7 18.2-388 and placed in an \u201cisolation cell\u201d at the Martinsville City Jail, a local detention facility. While Penn was being held in the cell, Sergeant John Robertson observed Penn attempting to hide a small cellophane bag in the front of his pants. Robertson then searched Penn and found the bag secreted in Penn\u2019s groin. The bag contained a green leafy substance, later determined to be marijuana. Penn was charged under Code \u00a7 53.1-203(6) with possession of marijuana by an inmate. Sgt. Robertson testified that persons held on charges of public intoxication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>usually are kept in custody until they become sober, at which time they are released upon posting a personal recognizance bond. Bond was set the morning following Penn\u2019s arrest for public drunkenness, and, upon posting bond, Penn was released pending trial on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">At Penn\u2019s bench trial for felony possession of marijuana, Penn argued that the charge should be dismissed on two grounds: 1) the evidence failed to establish that Penn was a \u201cprisoner\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 53.1-203(6); and 2) the court lacked jurisdiction to try the matter under Code \u00a7 53.1-205, because that statute limits the court\u2019s jurisdiction to persons confined in \u201cstate correctional\u201d facilities, and the Martinsville City Jail did not qualify as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The court rejected these arguments and proceeded to trial of the case. At the conclusion of the evidentiary phase of the trial, Penn moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the ground that the evidence failed to prove he was a \u201cprisoner\u201d within the meaning of the statute. In denying the motion, the court declined to read Code \u00a7 53.1-203(6) in the narrow fashion urged by Penn, and found that Penn was a \u201cprisoner\u201d within the intent of the statute. Penn was found guilty as charged, and he was sentenced to thirty days in jail, suspended on condition of six months supervised probation. Penn noted his appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\n<em>MEANING OF \u201cPRISONER\u201d IN CODE \u00a7 53.1-203(6)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Penn argues that his detention in the Martinsville City Jail was not an \u201cimprisonment\u201d within the intent of Code \u00a7 53.1-203(6), but was, rather, merely a \u201cdetention\u201d until he was sober enough to be released. On that ground, he contends he should have been convicted only of the misdemeanor offense of unlawful possession of marijuana in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.1(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Code \u00a7 53.1-203 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>It shall be unlawful for a prisoner in a state, local or community correctional facility ... to ... Procure, sell, secrete or have in his possession a controlled substance classified in Schedule III of the Drug Control Act ... or marijuana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The issue on appeal presents a question of statutory interpretation, which \u201cis the prerogative of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Sims Wholesale Co., Inc. v. Brown-Forman Corp., </em>251 Va. 398, 404, 468 S.E.2d 905, 908 (1996). As such, it presents a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. See Rusty\u2019s Welding Service, Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 127, 510 S.E.2d 255, 259 (1999) <em>(en banc). </em>In construing the language of a statute, we \u201c \u2018 \u201cmust take the words as written\u201d \u2019 ... and give them their plain meaning.\u201d <em>Krampen v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 163, 167, 510 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1999) (quoting <em>Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 166, 169, 497 S.E.2d 896, 897 (1998) (quoting <em>Birdsong Peanut Co. v. Cowling, </em>8 Va.App. 274, 277, 381 S.E.2d 24, 26 (1989))).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u201cPrisoner\u201d generally is defined as \u201c[a] person who has been apprehended by a law-enforcement officer and is in custody, regardless of whether the person has yet been put in prison.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1213 (7th ed.1999); <em>see Mabe v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 439, 440-41, 417 S.E.2d 899, 900 (1992) (Code \u00a7 53.1-203\u2019s reference to \u201cprisoner in a ... correctional facility\u201d refers to individual\u2019s status as one lawfully in custody, and appellant who fled custody while on work release from county jail was \u201cin every sense a prisoner in a correctional facility\u201d); <em>see also </em>Rollin M. Perkins &amp; Ronald N. Boyce, <em>Criminal Law </em>566 (3d ed.1982) (one is a prisoner because he is \u201cin the custody of any person who had lawfully arrested him\u201d). Code \u00a7 53.1-203(6) uses the word \u201cprisoner\u201d in this general sense, supplying no specific definition for the term. Because \u201c[i]n construing the language of a statute, the Court \u2018must take the words as written\u2019 ... and give them their plain meaning,\u201d <em>Krampen, </em>29 Va.App. at 167, 510 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>at 278 (citation omitted), we find that Penn was a prisoner within the meaning of Code \u00a7 58.1-203(6) and that the statute applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Penn\u2019s reliance on <em>Mabe </em>is misplaced; indeed, <em>Mabe </em>supports the result reached here. <em>Mabe </em>concerned an inmate of the Washington County Jail who was assigned to work outside the jail at a senior citizens\u2019 center. After working at the center for four or five hours, Mabe escaped and was recaptured two days later. Mabe argued that his conviction under Code \u00a7 53.1-203(1) was improper, because the statute stated that it was unlawful for a prisoner to \u201c[ejscape from a correctional facility or from any person in charge of such prisoner,\u201d and he was neither \u201cin\u201d a correctional facility at the time of his escape, nor in the charge of a correctional officer, as required under the statute. We upheld his conviction, holding that the term \u201cin\u201d did not narrow the ambit of the statute to prisoners physically inside correctional facilities. <em>See Mabe, </em>14 Va.App. at 440-41, 417 S.E.2d at 900. The statute \u201crefers to the <em>status </em>of the escapee [as a prisoner], not to the circumstances of escape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441, 417 S.E.2d at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We also find no merit in Penn\u2019s further argument that under Code \u00a7 18.2-388<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he was merely a detainee for detoxification, that he was thus free to leave upon becoming sober, and that therefore he was not imprisoned. Contrary to Penn\u2019s argument that he was placed in a detention cell for the sole purpose of becoming sober and being subsequently released, the record reveals that he was arrested on a charge of public drunkenness and was held in jail pending his posting of a recognizance bond. Because Penn was <em>arrested </em>under the statute, he cannot claim to have been free to leave at any time. His argument on this ground thus fads. In short, Penn was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>prisoner within the meaning of Code \u00a7 53.1-203(6), and was subject to prosecution under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\n<em>JURISDICTION OF THE. TRIAL COURT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Penn further contends that even if he were a \u201cprisoner\u201d within the intent of Code \u00a7 53.1-203(6), the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate his case because the explicit terms of Code \u00a7 53.1-205<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> grant jurisdiction only over persons confined in <em>state </em>correctional facilities. Penn argues that the holding cell in the Martinsville jail is a \u201clocal detention facility,\u201d not a \u201cstate correctional facility.\u201d Although he concedes that Code \u00a7 53.1-203, which prohibits possession of marijuana by \u201cprisoners,\u201d refers to \u201cstate, local, or community correctional facilities],\u201d he argues that if the legislature intended the jurisdiction conferred in Code \u00a7 53.1-205 to be coterminous with the prohibitions of Code \u00a7 53.1-203, the statute must state so expressly. Because it does not, he argues the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over his case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> Although Penn is correct that Code \u00a7 53.1-205 applies only to prisoners in state correctional facilities, he misconstrues the statute as conferring jurisdiction. \u201c \u2018Jurisdiction\u2019 means the power of a court to hear and determine a cause, which power is conferred by a constitution or by statute, or both.\u201d <em>Erickson-Dickson v. Erickson-Dickson, </em>12 Va.App. 381, 388, 404 S.E.2d 388, 392 (1991) (citation omitted). Although the summary title of Code \u00a7 53.1-205 is \u201cJurisdiction for trial of prisoners,\u201d this statute, like its predecessor, former Code \u00a7 53-295, may be construed as \u201ca venue statute, not limiting the general criminal jurisdiction conferred upon [the] circuit courts by\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.1-513 and 19.2-239. <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 143, 147, 207 S.E.2d 833, 836 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>(1974). As the Supreme Court has observed, the \u201cuse of the word \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 in the summary title [of a- statute] is not controlling. The summary title is not part of the body of the statute, and in the proper context, the word \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 may be used to mean venue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 207 S.E.2d at 836 (citing <em>County School Bd. v. Snead, </em>198 Va. 100, 106-07, 92 S.E.2d 497, 503 (1956)). Code \u00a7 53.1-205 presents such a context. Code \u00a7 53.1-205 provides that \u201cthe jurisdiction, proceedings, trial, and judgment in a criminal proceeding against a person confined in a state correctional facility shall be as is provided for in other cases of criminal prosecution.\u201d It does not, in itself, establish jurisdiction to try the offense or issue in this case, and by its own terms makes plain that a criminal proceeding against a person confined in a state correctional facility shall be governed by the same statutory rules \u201cas [are] provided for in other cases of criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(holding that former Code \u00a7 53-295 did not expressly limit jurisdiction in prosecutions of state prisoners).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Statutes governing \u201cother cases of criminal prosecution\u201d include those establishing jurisdiction. Code \u00a7 17.1-513 establishes the general jurisdiction of the circuit courts. It provides that \u201c[t]hey shall ... have original jurisdiction of all indictments for felonies and of presentments, informations and indictments for misdemeanors.\u201d <em>See Owusu v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 671, 673, 401 S.E.2d 431, 431 (1991) (former Code \u00a7 17-123 (predecessor to Code \u00a7 17.1-513) provided the circuit courts with jurisdiction over all felonies committed in the Commonwealth). Code \u00a7 19.2-239 provides that \u201c[t]he circuit courts ... shall have exclusive original jurisdiction for the trial of all presentments, indictments and informations for offenses committed within their respective circuits.\u201d <em>See Curtis v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 622, 629, 414 S.E.2d 421, 425 (1992) <em>(en banc) </em>(Code \u00a7 19.2-239 limits circuit courts\u2019 jurisdiction to the trial of all presentments, indictments and informations for offenses committed within their respective circuits). It follows that, as held in <em>Brown, </em>215 Va. at 147, 207 S.E.2d at 836, Code \u00a7 53.1-205 establishes the locus or venue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>of proceedings, the jurisdiction \u201cto hear and determine the cause\u201d being granted by Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.1-513 and 19.2-239.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In this case, the Circuit .Court of the City of Martinsville had original and exclusive jurisdiction to try Penn pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.1-513 and 19.2-239. Penn was tried in that court, the site of the charged offense as well as the location in which he was detained. In sum, Penn\u2019s claim that the court lacked jurisdiction to try the matter is without merit, and we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-10\">. The statute reads: \"It is unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess marijuana____ Any person who violates this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be confined in jail not more than thirty days.... \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\">. The statute reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">If any person ... is intoxicated in public ... he shall be deemed guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor. In any area in which there is a court-approved detoxification center a law enforcement officer may authorize the transportation ... of public inebriates to such detoxification center in lieu of arrest; however, no person shall be involuntarily detained in such center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\">. The statute states: <em>\"Jurisdiction for trial of prisoners; nature of proceedings. </em>Subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-203 and 53.1-204, the jurisdiction, proceedings, trial and judgment in a criminal proceeding against a person confined in a state correctional facility shall be as is provided for in other cases of criminal prosecution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b474-15\">. Because Penn limited his claim of error to the issue of jurisdiction, the question of whether venue was proper was waived and will not be addressed in this opinion. <em>See Brown, </em>215 Va. at 147, 207 S.E.2d at 837.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
