Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). On appeal, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless the findings are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them. <em>See McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In December, 1997, State Police Trooper R.A Ruiz was traveling west on Route 47, just outside the town limits of South Hill, Virginia, when he observed Wallace traveling in the opposite direction. Ruiz noted that Wallace was driving well below the posted speed limit. Ruiz saw Wallace drift once \u201cto the right-hand side crossing the white line, or the fog line, on the right side of the road,\u201d and decided to continue observing Wallace to determine whether he was driving while intoxicated. After Ruiz turned his car to follow Wallace, Wallace accelerated, and Ruiz increased his following speed to match. Wallace then made a right turn without signaling, and Ruiz observed that Wallace continued accelerating as he went through the turn, as indicated by a \u201cweight transfer\u201d at the rear of the vehicle, the right rear shifting up as the left rear shifted down in the course of the turn. Ruiz was approximately 400 feet behind the vehicle at this point. Wallace made \u201canother abrupt turn\u201d without signaling, giving rise again to the weight shift earlier noted. Wallace was not speeding, however, and Ruiz\u2019s vehicle was the only car follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ing Wallace into the turns, some 400 feet away. There is no evidence that Wallace ever lost control over the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Wallace made a third abrupt turn into a private driveway without using a turn signal and turned the vehicle\u2019s lights off. Ruiz, who was two or three houses away from Wallace when he made the turn, pulled into the driveway behind Wallace, activated his emergency lights, exited his cruiser, and approached Wallace\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Ruiz determined that Wallace was the operator of the vehicle. In response to the trooper\u2019s request, Wallace produced a registration card for the vehicle but could not produce a driver\u2019s license. When Ruiz asked him his name, Wallace identified himself as \u201cStevey Edmonds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Based on the odor of alcohol Ruiz detected in the course of his conversation with Wallace, Ruiz had Wallace step out of his vehicle and sit with Ruiz inside the police cruiser. There, Ruiz administered a number of field sobriety tests, which Wallace could not successfully complete. Ruiz also had the state police dispatcher conduct a check on the name provided to him by Wallace, and the dispatcher determined that the license issued to Stevey Edmonds had been suspended. Ruiz decided to conduct further agility tests outside the vehicle. Because Wallace complained of being cold during the tests inside the cruiser, Ruiz offered to retrieve Wallace\u2019s coat from his vehicle before performing the agility tests. Wallace agreed, and Ruiz retrieved Wallace\u2019s coat from the vehicle. To check for weapons, Ruiz patted down the outside of the coat and felt a hard object in the right-hand pocket. Ruiz retrieved the object to determine if it was a weapon, and found what appeared to be a bag of cocaine powder, crack cocaine and marijuana. Ruiz placed the bag in his pants pocket and returned, with the coat, to the cruiser. Wallace acknowledged the coat belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">The Commonwealth contends that because Wallace stopped his car before Ruiz activated his emergency lights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Wallace was not \u201cseized\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. We disagree. While no Virginia appellate court has addressed this question, a number of our sister states have established that if an officer stops his police cruiser behind a parked vehicle to conduct an investigation and activates his cruiser\u2019s flashing lights before he approaches the vehicle, an ensuing encounter with the vehicle\u2019s occupants will be construed as a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes. <em>See Lawson v. Maryland, </em>120 Md.App. 610, 707 A.2d 947, 951 (1998); <em>Oregon v. Walp, </em>65 Or.App. 781, 672 P.2d 374 (1983); <em>Washington v. Stroud, </em>30 Wash.App. 392, 634 P.2d 316 (1981). \u201c[T]he test for existence of a \u2018show of authority5 is an objective one: not whether the citizen perceived that he was being ordered to restrict his movement, but whether the officer\u2019s words and actions would have conveyed that to a reasonable person.\u201d <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 628, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 1551, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991); <em>see United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980) (a Fourth Amendment seizure occurs when, in view of all surrounding circumstances, \u201ca reasonable person would not have believed that he was free to leave\u201d). A driver in Wallace\u2019s position, with Ruiz\u2019s cruiser parked behind him and its emergency lights flashing, would reasonably have believed he or she was not free to leave the scene. Thus, Wallace was seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u201c\u2018Ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause\u2019 ... involve questions of both law and fact and are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u201d <em>McGee, </em>25 Va.App. at 197-98, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (quoting <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 691, 116 S.Ct. at 1659). In performing this Fourth Amendment analysis, \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. at 1663).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The trial court found that Wallace\u2019s \u201cattempt to elude\u201d Officer Ruiz, viewed in conjunction with other evidence before the court, justified the stop.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find no error in the court\u2019s decision. \u201c[W]hether [a] stop was justified is dependent upon whether \u2018the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search [would] warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action was appropriate.\u2019\u201d <em>Quigley v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 28, 32, 414 S.E.2d 851, 853-54 (1992) (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21-22, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)) (internal quotation omitted). <em>See also Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (\u201c[F]light ... is the consummate act of evasion: it is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Wallace contends the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that his \u201cattempt to elude\u201d was sufficient to justify the stop. He argues that pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-817, a person is not considered to be \u201celuding\u201d unless the person has received a \u201cvisible or audible signal by a law-enforcement officer.\u201d Although Wallace correctly notes that he received no signal to stop and that his conduct did not violate that statute, his behavior was nevertheless sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. We have previously observed that evasive behavior in the presence of the police is a pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion. <em>See Commonwealth v. Eaves, </em>13 Va.App. 162, 166, 408 S.E.2d 925, 927 (1991) (\u201cEvasive action is a factor which can support an inference of a consciousness of guilt.\u201d); <em>see also Wardlow, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 120 S.Ct. at 676. The trial court \u201c[v]iew[ed] the evidence as a whole,\u201d including Wallace\u2019s momentary swerve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>out of the lane of travel, his initially slow speed followed by sudden acceleration when Ruiz began to follow him, and his \u201celusive\u201d series of sudden turns made without decelerating, followed by his sudden stop in a residential driveway. This course of conduct, viewed as a whole, was sufficient to \u201c \u2018warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u201d that an investigatory stop was appropriate. <em>Quigley, </em>14 Va.App. at 32, 414 S.E.2d at 854 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21-22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We also find no merit to Wallace\u2019s further argument that the trooper\u2019s search of the coat and ultimate retrieval of the evidence used to convict him was illegal. At the time Ruiz instructed Wallace to return with him to the state police cruiser, Ruiz had detected the odor of alcohol on Wallace, providing Ruiz with reasonable suspicion that Wallace was driving while intoxicated in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. He was therefore authorized to conduct field sobriety tests on Wallace to determine whether such a violation had taken place. In the course of conducting this investigation, Ruiz discovered that the driver\u2019s license issued to \u201cStevey Edmonds,\u201d the name by which Wallace had identified himself, was expired. Ruiz thus had probable cause to arrest Wallace for driving in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-301. When Wallace asked Ruiz to retrieve Wallace\u2019s coat, Ruiz was thus entitled to conduct a pat-down search for weapons. \u201c[I]f the police have probable cause to effect an arrest, a limited search may be justified even in the absence of a formal arrest.\u201d <em>Poindexter v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 730, 733-34, 432 S.E.2d 527, 529 (1993) (citing <em>Cupp v. Murphy, </em>412 U.S. 291, 295-96, 93 S.Ct. 2000, 2003-04, 36 L.Ed.2d 900 (1973)) (footnote omitted). \u201cSo long as probable cause to arrest exists at the time of the search ... it is unimportant that the search preceded the formal arrest if the arrest \u2018followed quickly on the heels of the challenged search.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 733, 432 S.E.2d at 529 (quoting <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 310, 312, 387 S.E.2d 505, 506-07 (1990)) (additional citation omitted). The search of Wallace\u2019s coat was therefore lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>For these reasons, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"AP\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-14\">. Wallace was also convicted of assault and battery, which was among the enumerated bases for appeal in his petition to this Court. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>a three-judge panel granted the petition, Wallace failed to brief the question. The issue is thus waived. <em>See Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 445, 423 S.E.2d 360 (1992); <em>Fitzgerald v. Bass, </em>6 Va.App. 38, 366 S.E.2d 615 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-10\">.

It was the trooper\u2019s opinion that this car\u2014 that this defendant was driving to elude. And ... the defendant himself admitted that he was driving to elude.... So that would confirm, in my view, the officer\u2019s suspicion of what he saw.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
