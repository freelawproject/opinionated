Appellant contends the trial court (1) erred when it found Joey was \u201cseverely disabled\u201d and \u201cunable to live independently and support himself\u2019 within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-124.2 and (2) abused its discretion by failing to deviate from the support guidelines based upon Joey\u2019s independent financial resources. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Rinaldi and Dumsick were divorced on November 29, 1982. Pursuant to the decree, Rinaldi paid child support to Dumsick for the support of Joey, who, on October 2, 1998, reached the age of nineteen. Joey was born with cerebral palsy, which has created a brain deficit known as \u201cleft hemiplegia.\u201d Joey\u2019s condition has caused cognitive impairments and deficits with reasoning, language, memory and attention. Joey has limited use of his left limbs and limited vision in his left eye. His intelligence quotient (IQ) score of 67 is in the mentally retarded range, and he has the reading, language and math skills of a fifth grader. Joey also suffers from \u201cintractable seizures\u201d which cause uncontrollable twitching of his left side and can develop into grand mal convulsions with loss of consciousness. These1 seizures come without warning and the frequency has been increasing over the past two years, now occurring on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Joey is a full time student in the Fairfax County public schools. He is involved in vocational training and studying office technology and automotive technology. Joey presently works an average of seven and one-half hours per week at a Giant Food Store loading groceries into cars. He is paid $5.25 per hour. The money Joey earns is deposited directly into his bank account. He uses these funds for personal \u201cfrills,\u201d or non-necessities. When he reached the age of eighteen, Joey began receiving disability payments from the Social Security Administration. These payments average $800 per month, but fluctuate depending upon the amount of money Joey earns at Giant Food. This money is also deposited in Joey\u2019s personal bank account for his personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>In anticipation of Joey reaching age nineteen, Rinaldi filed with the trial court a motion to terminate child support. Dumsick subsequently filed a motion for an increase in, and continuation of, child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">On October 22, 1998, the trial court conducted an <em>ore terms </em>hearing on both motions. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-124.2(0 the trial court ordered the continuation of monthly support for Joey in the amount of $498.13 based on its finding that he is \u201cseverely and permanently mentally or physically disabled,\u201d \u201cunable to live independently and support himself,\u201d and \u201cresides in the home of the parent seeking or receiving child support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">II. <em>ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Rinaldi concedes the permanency of Joey\u2019s condition, as well as the fact that Joey resides in the home of Dumsick. On appeal, Rinaldi challenges the trial court\u2019s findings that Joey is severely disabled and that Joey is unable to live independently and support himself. Additionally, Rinaldi appeals the trial court\u2019s refusal to deviate from the guidelines in view of Joey\u2019s earned income from Giant Foods and his Supplemental Security Income (SSI) received as a result of his disability. Rinaldi maintains that the court abused its discretion by failing to (1) use Joey\u2019s income as a dollar-for-dollar offset against the guideline amount of child support payable by the father; or (2) add Joey\u2019s income to Rinaldi\u2019s income, calculate the guideline amount of child support based upon Rinaldi\u2019s increased income figure, and then give Rinaldi a credit against his child support obligation in an amount equal to Joey\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Code \u00a7 20-124.2(0 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court may order \u201cthe continuation of support for any child over the age of eighteen who is (i) severely and permanently mentally or physically disabled, (ii) unable to live independently and support himself, and (in) resides in the home of the parent seeking or receiving child support.\u201d In reviewing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>sufficiency challenge on appeal, \u201cwe consider the evidence in the fight most favorable to the party prevailing in the trial court.\u201d <em>Schoenwetter v. Schoenwetter, </em>8 Va.App. 601, 605, 383 S.E.2d 28, 30 (1989). \u201c[DJecisions concerning child support rest within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Barnhill v. Brooks, </em>15 Va.App. 696, 699, 427 S.E.2d 209, 211 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">At trial, Dumsick\u2019s evidence proved that since Joey was nine months old, he has received medical care for both his physical disability and his mental disability. His physical disability includes the loss of peripheral vision in his left eye, the inability to use his left arm and hand, and the occurrence of random, \u201cintractable seizures.\u201d His mental disability includes limited reasoning and judgment capabilities and an IQ showing \u201cborderline retardation.\u201d Joey\u2019s treating physician testified that, in her expert medical opinion, his disability was \u201cmoderate to severe\u201d compared to other problems which she has seen in her medical practice and that Joey would be unable to support himself as \u201can independent adult person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Joey\u2019s pediatrician also rendered his expert medical opinion, stating that Joey is not capable of living independently at the present time. According to him, Joey\u2019s cerebral palsy has caused a left hemiplegia that has affected Joey\u2019s motor skills. Joey had a stroke during his prenatal period or during early infancy which left him weak on his left side. He is cognitively impaired and has deficits in reasoning, language skills, memory and attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Dumsick also presented expert testimony from a career and transition expert with the Fairfax County public schools who works with physically disabled children. She testified that recent testing showed Joey possessing reading, math and language skills consistent with a fifth or sixth grader. She then explained the practical, vocational hardships imposed by these limitations in Joey\u2019s basic skills. She also testified that Joey is not self-supporting and is not capable of living independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Finally, Dumsick testified that Joey could not use his left hand, had limited vision in his left eye, and suffers from seizures. These seizures occur on a weekly basis and have become more frequent over the past couple of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Rinaldi presented no contrary expert testimony, medical or otherwise. Rinaldi\u2019s only evidence was that Joey calls his father now and then and holds a part-time job as a courtesy clerk for Giant Foods.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Joey\u2019s treating physician described his condition as \u201cmoderate to severe.\u201d From this statement, and based on the overwhelming, credible evidence, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Joey\u2019s disability was severe and that he could not support himself and live independently is not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">B. <em>Calculation of Support and Failure to Deviate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Code \u00a7 20-108.2 delineates the presumptive amount of child support based on the combined monthly adjusted parental gross income. That code section specifically provides that gross income \u201cshall not include benefits from public assistance programs as defined in \u00a7 63.1-87, federal supplemental security income benefits, or child support received.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Based upon that statutory exclusion, we held in <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 684, 472 S.E.2d 668 (1996), that a non-custodial parent is not entitled to a credit or reduction in his or her child support obligation as a result of the SSI benefits the custodial parent receives for the disabled child\u2019s disability. <em>See id. </em>at 695, 472 S.E.2d at 674. We stated, \u201c \u2018SSI benefits received by a disabled child are intended to supplement other income, not substitute for it ... [, and] the noncustodial parent\u2019s child support obligation is not impacted by the receipt of SSI on the behalf of the disabled child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694-95, 472 S.E.2d at 673 (quoting <em>Kyle v. Kyle, </em>582 N.E.2d 842, 846 (Ind.Ct.App.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Rinaldi does not dispute the gross income calculation but argues that the trial court abused its discretion in not deviat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ing from the presumptive support obligation based on the SSI and wages from employment received by Joey. Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">[T]here shall be a rebuttable presumption in any judicial or administrative proceeding for child support ... that the amount of the award which would result from the application of the guidelines set out in \u00a7 20-108.2 is the correct amount of' child support to be awarded. In order to rebut the presumption, the court shall make written findings in the order, which findings may be incorporated by reference, that the application of such guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case. The finding that rebuts the guidelines shall state the amount of support that would have been required under the guidelines, shall give a justification of why the order varies from the guidelines, and shall be determined by relevant evidence pertaining to the following factors affecting the obligation, the ability of each party to provide child support, and the best interests of the child: * }\u25a0\u00ab \u2756 * <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">9. Independent financial resources, if any, of the child or children....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">In this case, the trial court expressly declined to deviate from the guidelines. Accordingly, it did not make any finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate. In determining whether application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate, we believe the trial court properly could consider, as an independent financial resource of the child both his SSI and his wages from part-time employment. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B)(9); <em>Barker v. Hill, </em>949 S.W.2d 896, 897-98 (Ky.Ct.App.1997) (rejecting an automatic credit or offset to the noncustodial parent\u2019s support obligation, but stating that it would be appropriate to view the disabled child\u2019s SSI benefits as independent financial resources of the child).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">However, the child support guidelines in Code \u00a7 20-108.2 are presumed to be correct unless rebutted. The guidelines must be followed unless the trial court finds that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>application would be unjust or inappropriate. Regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to deviate based on the SSI benefits received by Joey, we hold that \u201c[t]here is nothing inherently unjust or inappropriate about making a father support his child, if he is able to do so, before looking to a government welfare program that is intended to supplement the resources of the needy.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>949 S.W.2d at 898. Regarding the court\u2019s failure to deviate based on Joey\u2019s wages, we note that the evidence established gross wages of $170 per month but did not reflect the net income actually received by Joey.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The decision not to deviate from the guidelines is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and is to be determined upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances in each case. We cannot say the trial court\u2019s decision was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. The order of support is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
