Because we find that O\u2019Brien failed to market his residual work capacity adequately, we reverse the commission\u2019s award and enter final judgment for Wall Street. We do not address the other issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On October 15, 1996, O\u2019Brien, a forty-eight-year-old college graduate and supervisor trainee, suffered a compensable injury to his head and neck. In early December 1996, he was released to light-duty employment. He moved to his parents\u2019 home in New York, registered with the New York Employment Commission and thereafter obtained a part-time job at Stonybrook Yacht Club, doing general maintenance and cleaning twelve to sixteen hours per week at $8.50 per hour. His pre-injury average weekly wage was $680. He attempted a second part-time job at a grocery store but found the required effort inconsistent with his injuries. He testified that his treating physician had recommended for him a twenty-hour workweek, preferably at four hours per day. After December 23,1996, O\u2019Brien continued his job at the yacht club, but made no further effort to find additional, other, or more lucrative employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Noting O\u2019Brien\u2019s part-time employment with Stonybrook Yacht Club and his attempt at the other part-time job, but holding that he had not adequately marketed his residual capacity after December 23, 1996, the deputy commissioner awarded him temporary total disability benefits through December 23, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Both parties sought review. The full commission found that O\u2019Brien\u2019s injury was compensable and that he had adequately marketed his residual work capacity. It remanded the case to the deputy commissioner to receive evidence of O\u2019Brien\u2019s earnings from his light-duty employment and to determine his partial disability benefits beginning December 23, 1996. The deputy commissioner did so and entered an award. Wall Street again sought review on the issues of marketing residual work capacity and sufficiency of the evidence to support an award after December 23,1996. The full commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s award on both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Where an employee\u2019s disability is partial, to establish his entitlement to benefits, he must prove that he made a reasonable effort to market his residual work capacity. <em>See Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority v. Harrison, </em>228 Va. 598, 601, 324 S.E.2d 654, 655-56 (1985); <em>Manis Construction Co. v. Arellano, </em>13 Va.App. 292, 293, 411 S.E.2d 233, 234 (1991). In determining whether a partially disabled employee has adequately marketed his residual work capacity, the commission should consider the following criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">(1) the nature and extent of the employee\u2019s disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">(2) the employee\u2019s training, age, experience and education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">(3) the nature and extent of the employee\u2019s job search effort;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">(4) the employee\u2019s intent in conducting his job search;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">(5) the availability in the area of jobs suitable for the employee, considering his disability; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">(6) any other matter affecting the employee\u2019s ability to find suitable employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-11\"><em>National Linen Service v. McGuinn, </em>8 Va.App. 267, 272, 380 S.E.2d 31, 34 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">The determination of whether a partially disabled employee has adequately marketed his residual work capacity lies within the fact finding judgment of the commission, and its decision on that question, if supported by credible evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>See Ford Motor Company v. Hunt, </em>26 Va.App. 231, 239, 494 S.E.2d 152, 156 (1997). However, that decision, to be affirmed, must be based upon credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The record establishes without contradiction that after December 23, 1996, O\u2019Brien made no effort to obtain more suitable and lucrative employment than his custodial job at Stonybrook Yacht Club. He produced no evidence of the availability or non-availability in the New York area of jobs more consistent with his education and capabilities. He produced no evidence of any effort on his part to secure or even to seek such employment. The record unquestionably established an abandonment of effort on his part after December 23, 1996. Inasmuch as the record establishes an absence of effort on his part, it fails to support the commission\u2019s finding that his efforts were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The judgment of the commission is reversed. Its award of benefits after December 23, 1996 is vacated. Final judgment is rendered for Wall Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
