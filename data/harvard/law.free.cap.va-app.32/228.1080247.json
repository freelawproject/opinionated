Smith (appellant) appeals from her bench trial conviction for driving while intoxicated in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, her third such offense within five years. On appeal, she contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence of her blood alcohol concentration because her arrest was invalid and, therefore, did not support the taking of the sample under Virginia\u2019s implied consent law. We hold that appellant\u2019s arrest was valid because it occurred at the scene of the accident within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-81, and we affirm her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">On appeal of a criminal conviction, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). So viewed, the Statement of Facts filed in this case indicates that on April 8, 1998, appellant drove her car from the eastbound lane of Manchester Boulevard in Fairfax County onto the curb, striking a street sign at the intersection of Manchester Boulevard and Manchester Lakes Drive. Appellant backed up but hit the sign again. She eventually returned to the roadway, turned right onto Manchester Lakes Drive, and brought her car to a stop in front of a townhouse located in a cul-de-sac about 100 yards away. Uncontradicted evidence established that the location where appellant brought her vehicle to a stop was visible from the intersection where the downed sign was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Off-duty Sheriffs Deputy Wrenn observed appellant\u2019s vehicle leave the roadway. He spoke briefly to appellant before she pulled away from the sign, asking her if she was hurt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>She did not respond. At the same time, a tow truck passed Wrenn and offered assistance. Wrenn told the driver to follow appellant\u2019s car. The tow truck driver followed appellant to the spot where she parked, pulled in behind appellant and took her keys. Wrenn followed appellant and the tow truck on foot, catching up with them about a minute later.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Deputy Wrenn did not identify himself to appellant as a law enforcement officer and did not exercise his authority as an officer because Officer Lucas, responding to a citizen complaint that a vehicle had felled the sign, arrived on the scene quickly thereafter. Lucas said appellant bore no visible injuries but appeared \u201cout of it\u201d \u2014 her eyes were glazed, she had a slight odor of alcohol about her person, she \u201ctook time to process things,\u201d her speech was \u201cslow and methodical,\u201d and her movements were \u201cslow and uneasy.\u201d She admitted having consumed alcohol \u201cearlier.\u201d Lucas arrested appellant for driving while intoxicated and misdemeanor \u201cHit and Run.\u201d Subsequent blood alcohol concentration testing showed a level of .26%.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The Commonwealth disposed of the hit and run charge by <em>nolle prosequi. </em>At trial on the charge of driving while intoxicated, appellant objected to admission of the blood alcohol test results into evidence on the ground that Officer Lucas lacked authority to make the warrantless arrest because the misdemeanor offense did not occur in Lucas\u2019 presence and because Lucas did not arrest her at the scene of the accident. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that appellant\u2019s striking the sign, fleeing the scene and parking her vehicle at the scene of the arrest were \u201call part of the same transaction.\u201d Appellant made the same argument in her motions to strike and in a subsequent motion to set aside her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-81, a police officer \u201cmay arrest, without a warrant, any person who commits any crime in the presence of the officer and any person whom he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>reasonable grounds or probable cause to suspect of having committed a felony not in his presence.\u201d Ordinarily, an officer may effect a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor only if the offense was committed in his presence. <em>See Durant v. City of Suffolk, </em>4 Va.App. 445, 447-48, 358 S.E.2d 732, 733-34 (1987). The statute provides certain exceptions, including one for automobile accidents involving misdemeanors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">[An] officer may, <em>at the scene of any accident involving a motor vehicle, </em>... or at any hospital or medical facility to which any person involved in such accident has been transported, ... on any of the highways ... of the Commonwealth, <em>upon reasonable grounds to believe, </em>based upon personal investigation, including information obtained from eyewitnesses, <em>that a crime has been committed by any person then and there present, apprehend such person without a warrant of arrest.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-81 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, Virginia\u2019s \u201cimplied consent\u201d law, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">Any person ... who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway ... in this Commonwealth shall be deemed thereby, as a condition of such operation, to have consented to have samples of his blood, breath, or both blood and breath taken for a chemical test to determine the alcohol, drug, or both alcohol and drug content of his blood, if he is arrested for violation of \u00a7 18.2-266 or \u00a7 18.2-266.1 or of a similar ordinance within two hours of the alleged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(A). If the blood or breathalyzer test reveals a blood alcohol concentration of .08% or more, the Commonwealth is entitled to a rebuttable .presumption that the person was intoxicated. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-269; <em>Castillo v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 482, 486, 465 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1995). However, for an arrestee to be deemed to have given implied consent under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, the arrest must have been lawful. <em>See Durant, </em>4 Va.App. at 448-49, 358 S.E.2d at 734. If the arrest is not lawful, consent for blood alcohol testing is not implied, and the results of any such test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>are not admissible for the purpose of providing a rebuttable presumption of intoxication. <em>See Castillo, </em>21 Va.App. at 487-93, 465 S.E.2d at 148-52; <em>Durant, 4 </em>Va.App. at 448-49, 358 S.E.2d at 734. Therefore, because the misdemeanor offenses for which appellant was arrested were not committed in the presence of the arresting officer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the warrantless arrest was lawful and the certificate admissible only if the arrest occurred \u201cat the scene of [the] accident.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Appellant contends that her arrest did not occur at the scene of the accident within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-81.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The word \u201cscene\u201d is not defined in the statute, and we have not previously had occasion to consider the scope of an officer\u2019s authority to make a warrantless arrest \u201cat the scene of any accident.\u201d <em>Cf. Duck v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 567, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>573, 383 S.E.2d 746, 749 (1989) (noting that record was insufficient for court to determine whether trooper\u2019s action in stopping accused, whom she saw leave accident and travel as passenger in an uninvolved vehicle to a location less than half a mile away, \u201cand \u2018escorting\u2019 him back to the scene of the accident constituted an arrest away from the scene of the accident, exceeding her authority under Code \u00a7 19.2-81 to make a warrantless arrest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We are guided by principles of statutory construction. Although penal statutes should be strictly construed, this principle does not \u201centitle[ ] [an accused] to a favorable result based upon an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979). \u201c[A] statute should be read to give reasonable effect to the words used \u2018and to promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayhew v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 484, 489, 458 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1995) (quoting <em>Jones v. Conwell, </em>227 Va. 176, 181, 314 S.E.2d 61, 64 (1984)). A statute should, if possible, be construed to \u201c \u2018effect rather than defeat a legislative purpose evident from the history of the legislation.\u2019\u201d <em>Scott v. Scott, </em>16 Va.App. 815, 819, 433 S.E.2d 259, 262 (1993) (quoting <em>Ambrogi v. Koontz, </em>224 Va. 381, 389, 297 S.E.2d 660, 664 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Here, it is evident that the legislature intended for the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-81, <em>inter alia, </em>to facilitate the timely arrest of persons in motor vehicle accidents involving alcohol or other intoxicants so that they may be tested under the implied consent law to determine their blood alcohol content. Code \u00a7 19.2-81 currently provides that an officer may, under certain circumstances, effect a warrantless arrest of a person \u201cat the scene of any [motor vehicle] accident ... or at any hospital or medical facility to which any person involved in such accident has been transported\u201d if the officer has \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d the person has committed a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Prior to 1985, the statute permitted arrest \u201cat the scene of any accident\u201d only. <em>See </em>1985 Va. Acts ch. 507 (codified at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u00a7 19.2-81 (1983 Repl.Vol. &amp; Supp.1985)). Under that version of the statute, the Virginia Supreme Court held that the hospital to which a driver injured in an accident was taken was not an extension of the accident scene. <em>See Thomas v. Town of Marion, </em>226 Va. 251, 254, 308 S.E.2d 120, 122 (1983). As a result, it held that the officer\u2019s warrantless arrest of the driver at the hospital was invalid and that the implied consent law did not validate the blood alcohol analysis conducted after arrest. <em>See id. </em>In 1985, the legislature expanded the scope of Code \u00a7 19.2-81 to validate a post-accident arrest made at a hospital or medical facility, <em>see </em>1985 Va. Acts ch. 507, implicitly acknowledging the need for prompt testing for intoxicants in certain accident cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">A Delaware Superior Court has held, under a similar statute, that determining whether a warrantless arrest occurred \u201cat the scene of a motor vehicle accident\u201d is \u201ca fact-based question whose answer will vary from case to case.\u201d <em>State v. Rizzo, </em>634 A.2d 392, 400 (Del.Super.Ct.1993) (interpreting Del.Code Ann. tit. 21, \u00a7 701). That court held that Delaware\u2019s statute permits a warrantless arrest if it occurs \u201cbefore the suspect has, <em>by any reasonable temporal and/or lineal criteria, </em>left the scene of a motor vehicle accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (emphasis added). Although we do not adopt the precise formulation used in <em>Rizzo, </em>we find the Delaware standard instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">A similar principle already well-established in Virginia law is the doctrine of <em>res gestae </em>as interpreted to aid in application of the felony-murder statute. <em>See Haskell v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 1033, 1043-44, 243 S.E.2d 477, 483 (1978).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\"><em>Res gestae, </em>a principle generally associated with an exception to the hearsay evidence rule, pertains not only to what is said but to what is done as well. The <em>res gestae </em>of the underlying crime begins where an indictable attempt to commit the felony is reached and ends where the chain of events between the attempted crime or completed felony is broken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Berkeley v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 279, 286, 451 S.E.2d 41, 45 (1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Applying <em>res gestae </em>to felony-murder, the Virginia Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe felony-murder statute applies where the killing is so closely related to the felony in time, place, and causal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Haskell, </em>218 Va. at 1043-44, 243 S.E.2d at 483. <em>Haskell </em>involved an unsuccessful robbery attempt. The robbers beat the victim and held him down but found no money on his person. <em>See id. </em>at 1036, 243 S.E.2d at 479. The robbers attempted to leave the scene, but the victim tried to prevent their escape and was shot and killed by one of the robbers other than Haskell. <em>See id. </em>at 1037, 243 S.E.2d at 479. The Court rejected Haskell\u2019s argument that the killing did not occur in the commission of a felony. It held the evidence established that \u201cthe killing occurred within five feet of the spot where [the victim] was beaten and searched, and within moments after the victim had regained his feet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1043, 243 S.E.2d at 483. Because the killing was so closely related to the robbery in \u201ctime, place, and causal connection\u201d and \u201cthe two crimes were inextricably interwoven,\u201d the Court upheld Haskell\u2019s conviction for felony-murder. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We hold that the time and place elements of the <em>res gestae </em>doctrine are applicable by analogy to a court\u2019s determination whether a warrantless arrest occurs \u201cat the scene of any accident\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-81. \u201cThe continuation of events \u2018covered by the term <em>res gestae </em>depends upon the circumstances of each particular case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berkeley, </em>19 Va.App. at 286, 451 S.E.2d at 45 (quoting <em>Cluverius v. Commonwealth, </em>81 Va. 787, 805 (1886) (citation omitted)). Whether an arrest occurred at the scene of an accident, like the question whether a murder occurred in the commission of a felony, depends upon whether the relevant factors are linked by time and place, <em>Haskell, </em>218 Va. at 1043-44, 243 S.E.2d at 483, or \u201cby any reasonable temporal and/or lineal criteria,\u201d <em>Rizzo, </em>634 A.2d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>In light of the above, we hold that appellant was arrested at the scene of the accident within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-81. The evidence established that the arresting officer arrived at the intersection at which the accident occurred within minutes of its occurrence. From that intersection, he could see the tow truck and the house where appellant\u2019s vehicle was parked. He then proceeded directly to that location, which was about 100 yards away, arriving twenty to thirty seconds later. Officer Lucas arrived on the scene so quickly that Deputy Sheriff Wrenn, the off-duty officer who observed the accident, found it unnecessary to exercise his authority. Under a <em>res gestae </em>analysis of time and place, we hold that Officer Lucas\u2019 arrest of appellant \u2014 at this location and so close in time to the accident \u2014 met the lineal and temporal requirements necessary to constitute an arrest at the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">For these reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\">. \" 'An offense is committed within the presence of an officer, within the meaning of [Code \u00a7 19.2-81], when he has direct personal knowledge, through his sight, hearing, or other senses that it is then and there being committed.' \" <em>Durant, </em>4 Va.App. at 447, 358 S.E.2d at 733 (quoting <em>Galliher v. Commonwealth, </em>161 Va. 1014, 1021, 170 S.E. 734, 736 (1933)). Here, although the offense was committed in the presence of Deputy Wrenn, Wrenn did not make the arrest. Lucas did not observe appellant\u2019s commission of the offense, and the observations of Wrenn could not be imputed to Lucas for purposes of permitting Lucas to make an arrest for an offense committed in his presence under Code \u00a7 19.2-81. <em>See Penn v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 399, 402-06, 412 S.E.2d 189, 190-93 (1991), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>244 Va. 218, 420 S.E.2d 713 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">. Appellant contends that the phrase, \"the scene of any accident,\" in Code \u00a7 19.2-81 should be construed as co-extensive with the phrase, \"the scene of the accident,\u201d in Code \u00a7 46.2-894, Virginia\u2019s \"hit-and-run\" statute. Because appellant\u2019s hit-and-run charge was disposed of by <em>nolle prosequi </em>and never considered by the court, we see no reason to analyze the meaning of the challenged phrase in the hit-and-run statute. We note, however, that the hit-and-run statute contains language significantly different from the statute under which appellant was convicted. Code \u00a7 46.2-894 requires a driver involved in an accident to \u201cstop as close to the scene of the accident as possible without obstructing traffic,\u201d and the purpose of the statute is to \"facilitate accident investigation and to preserve public order.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 769, 771, 418 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1992). Code \u00a7 19.2-81, by contrast, permits an officer to make a warrantless arrest of a motor vehicle driver, under certain conditions, \"at the scene of any accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
