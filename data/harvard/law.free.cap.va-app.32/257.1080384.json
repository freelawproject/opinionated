On appeal, appellants contend the commission erred in finding that: 1) claimant\u2019s hand eczema was an occupational disease and 2) claimant proved that her hand eczema was a compensable occupational disease. We agree and reverse the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">Claimant was employed by appellant, The Genie Company, at a coil form position. She positioned tank coils onto hot boards that came out of a sider machine and then guided the boards into another machine that applied glue to them. She testified that she did not have contact with the glue and did not touch the boards after they went into the second machine. She noticed in September 1997 that her hands were sore, cracked, and peeling and had begun to bleed. On October 16, 1997, claimant sought medical treatment for her condition and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>was removed from the coil form job. At that time, she had been working at the coil form position for approximately two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">At the hearing before the deputy commissioner, claimant testified that the problems with her hands did not begin until she started working at the coil form position. On cross-examination, she admitted that she washed dishes by hand and used household cleaning products to clean her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Claimant\u2019s hand eczema was diagnosed and treated by Dr. Stephen Phillips. Dr. Phillips\u2019 office notes from his initial examination of claimant on October 16, 1997 state, \u201cI am not sure if this is entirely due to work she has been doing for a long time without any problems. It may be that the job of grabbing small parts aggravates an underlying tendency for dermatitis.\u201d Dr. Phillips prescribed a topical cream and advised claimant to avoid repeated grasping. On October 30, 1997, Dr. Phillips examined claimant again and wrote in his office notes, \u201cI am not certain if this is due to work but seems to be aggravated by handling materials.\u201d On December 16, 1997, Dr. Phillips noted that claimant\u2019s condition was greatly improved and advised claimant to avoid grasping with her right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">On January 30, 1998, Dr. Phillips answered a series of questions propounded by appellants\u2019 counsel. Dr. Phillips wrote, \u201cThe underlying tendency to develop eczema is not a work related illness or injury, but an acute flare such as this may be precipitated by physical trauma such as handling the hot boards.\u201d Dr. Phillips also listed contact with household cleaners, keeping hands wet for prolonged periods, or even frequent hand or dish washing as potential causes of eczema such as claimant developed. Dr. Phillips opined that claimant\u2019s attack of eczema was related to her employment at The Genie Company but stated that the underlying condition of hand eczema is not a work-related disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">On April 14, 1998, Dr. Phillips wrote that he could not state with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that claimant\u2019s condition was an occupational disease because hand eczema is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>a \u201c \u2018disease of life.\u2019 \u201d He also stated that claimant\u2019s eczema was not characteristic of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The commission ruled that claimant\u2019s hand eczema was an occupational disease pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-400 and affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s award of benefits. Appellants argue that claimant\u2019s hand eczema is a non-compensable ordinary disease of life and that claimant failed to prove that her hand eczema was compensable because her treating physician opined that the condition does not have its origin in a risk of the employment and is not characteristic of claimant\u2019s employment. We agree and reverse the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u201c[T]he issue whether a worker has suffered an impairment that constitutes a compensable disease is a mixed question of law and fact and, hence, a Commission finding on the question is not conclusive and binding upon this Court but is properly subject to judicial review.\u201d <em>Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, </em>251 Va. 186, 192, 467 S.E.2d 795, 798 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-400 states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">A. As used in this title, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term \u201coccupational disease\u201d means a disease arising out of and in the course of employment, but not an ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">B. A disease shall be deemed to arise out of the employment only if there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\">1. A direct causal connection between the conditions under which work is performed and the occupational disease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-11\">2. It can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>3. It can be fairly traced to the employment as the proximate cause;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">4. It is neither a disease to which an employee may have had substantial exposure outside of the employment, nor any condition of the neck, back or spinal column;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">5. It is incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">6. It had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and flowed from that source as a natural consequence, though it need not have been foreseen or expected before its contraction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">Code \u00a7 65.2-401 states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">An ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment may be treated as an occupational disease for the purposes of this title if each of the following elements is established by clear and convincing evidence (not a mere probability):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">1. That the disease exists and arose out of and in the course of employment as provided in \u00a7 65.2-400 -with respect to occupational diseases and did not result from causes outside of the employment, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">2. That one of the following exists:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">a. It follows as an incident of occupational disease as defined in this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-13\">b. It is an infectious or contagious disease contracted in the course of one\u2019s employment in a hospital or sanitarium or laboratory or nursing home as defined in \u00a7 32.1-123, or while otherwise engaged in the direct delivery of health care, or in the course of employment as emergency rescue personnel and those volunteer emergency rescue personnel referred to in \u00a7 65.2-101; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-14\">c. It is characteristic of the employment and was caused by conditions peculiar to such employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">Under Code \u00a7 65.2-400, a disease arises out of the employment if it meets all of the enumerated criteria for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>causation set forth in Paragraph B. In this case, claimant failed to prove all of the conditions specified in the statute. Specifically, Code \u00a7 65.2-400(B)(4) states that the disease cannot be one to which an employee would have substantial exposure outside of the employment. Dr. Phillips wrote that hand eczema can arise from a variety of sources outside the work environment, including contact with household cleaners, keeping hands wet for prolonged periods, and frequent hand or dish washing. Code \u00a7 65.2-400(B)(5) requires that the disease be incidental to the character of the business. On April 14,1998, Dr. Phillips opined that claimant\u2019s hand eczema was not an occupational disease and was not characteristic of her employment. Instead, he wrote that her condition was a \u201cdisease of life.\u201d Therefore, we find that claimant\u2019s hand eczema was an ordinary disease of life and was not an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Under Code \u00a7 65.2-401(1), an ordinary disease of life may be treated as an occupational disease if the employee proves by clear and convincing evidence that the disease arose out of and in the course of the employment as provided in Code \u00a7 65.2-400. As discussed above, the evidence failed to show that claimant\u2019s hand eczema arose out of and in the course of her employment pursuant to the causation criteria specified in Code \u00a7 65.2-400(B). Therefore, claimant\u2019s hand eczema is not compensable as an ordinary disease of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Additionally, in <em>Ashland Oil Co. v. Bean, </em>225 Va. 1, 3-4, 300 S.E.2d 739, 740 (1983), the Supreme Court of Virginia held that a disability resulting from the aggravation of a preexisting disease of life was not compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, Dr. Phillips stated that eczema is a disease of life, and he opined that claimant had an underlying tendency for the condition and only the flare-up for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>which he treated her was related to her employment. Therefore, the aggravation of claimant\u2019s underlying tendency for hand eczema is not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">For these reasons, we hold that claimant\u2019s hand eczema is a non-compensable disease of life and reverse the commission\u2019s award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\">. Although <em>Ashland </em>was decided before the enactment of Code \u00a7 65.2-401, we have cited it with approval in <em>Teasley v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., </em>14 Va.App. 45, 49-50, 415 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1992). Further, the language of Code \u00a7 65.2-401 requires that an ordinary disease of life be traced to the employment as its proximate cause, which is wholly consistent with the holding in <em>Ashland.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
