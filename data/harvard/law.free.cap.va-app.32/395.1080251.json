Williams contends the trial judge committed reversible error by (1) admitting in evidence a non-testifying accomplice\u2019s out-of-court confession to police and (2) refusing to provide the accomplice\u2019s confession to Williams\u2019 counsel before ruling on its admissibility. A panel of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Court, with one judge dissenting, affirmed the convictions. <em>See Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 378, 517 S.E.2d 246 (1999). Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The grand jury indicted Williams for killing Vareck Griffin in the commission of robbery, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-31 (capital murder), robbery, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-58, using a firearm in the commission of capital murder, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, and using a firearm in the commission of robbery. <em>See id. </em>The evidence at trial proved that early in the morning on December 1, 1996, someone shot and killed Vareck Griffin in Norfolk, Virginia, in an apartment where Griffin and others sold \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. One of the two men who operated the cocaine enterprise testified that he left Griffin alone in the apartment to sell cocaine to any potential customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Five and one-half months after Griffin was killed, the police arrested Damyel Harris for \u201cmore than 11 charges.\u201d The detective who interrogated Harris was investigating a homicide unrelated to Griffin\u2019s killing and had been searching for Harris in connection with that unrelated homicide. The detective testified that \u201c[w]hen we started asking [Harris] about the [unrelated] homicide, [Harris] started talking about a different homicide and started giving details, and that\u2019s when [the detective] ... realized that [Harris] wasn\u2019t talking about [the unrelated homicide] but another homicide.\u201d During the interrogation, Harris gave an extensive statement in which he confessed to participating in the robbery of Griffin and said Williams killed Griffin.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The Commonwealth called Harris as its witness. When Harris asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to testify, the trial judge admitted in evidence Harris\u2019 confession and overruled Williams\u2019 objection that use of the confession violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him. In addition to Haras\u2019 confession, the Commonwealth proved through the testimony of three witnesses that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Williams had made statements, which the Commonwealth contends linked Williams to the murder and robbery of Griffin.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge convicted Williams of capital murder, robbery, and using a firearm in the commission of both felonies. Williams contends on appeal that the trial judge committed reversible error by admitting Harris\u2019 confession in evidence and by refusing to provide Harris\u2019 confession to his counsel for review before the judge ruled on its admissibility. In its brief on this rehearing <em>en banc, </em>the Commonwealth concedes that the trial judge\u2019s admission of Harris\u2019 confession was error, <em>see Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 139, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 1901, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999) (holding that \u201c[t]he admission of the untested confession of [a codefendant] violated petitioner\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights\u201d), and that the judge also erred in refusing to permit Williams\u2019 counsel to see the confession before the judge ruled on its admissibility. The Commonwealth contends, however, that both errors were harmless. We hold that the admission of Harris\u2019 confession was not harmless error. Because the trial judge\u2019s error in refusing to permit Williams\u2019 counsel to see Harris\u2019 confession will not recur if Williams is retried, we need not address whether that error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Although Confrontation Clause error is of constitutional magnitude, it is subject to harmless error analysis. <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1438, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). Constitutional error is harmless, however, only if \u201cthe beneficiary of the constitutional error ... prove[s] beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). \u201cThe test, therefore, is not whether laying aside the erroneously admitted evidence there was other evidence sufficient to convict beyond a reasonable doubt ..., but, more stringently, Vhether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompson v. Leeke, </em>756 F.2d 314, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>316 (4th Cir.1985) (citation omitted). In other words, even if \u201cthe other evidence amply supports the ... verdicts, [error is not harmless when] the disputed testimony may well have affected the ... decision.\u201d <em>Cartera v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">An \u201cemphasis and perhaps overemphasis, upon the [concept] of \u2018overwhelming evidence\u2019 \u201d has the effect of clouding the relevant question \u201c Vhether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 23, 87 S.Ct. at 827 (footnote and citations omitted). As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[t]he correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the [evidence] were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. at 1438; <em>see also Olden v. Kentucky, </em>488 U.S. 227, 232, 109 S.Ct. 480, 483, 102 L.Ed.2d 513 (1988). Thus, \u201ca harmless error analysis ... [is not] simply a sufficiency of the evidence analysis.\u201d <em>Hooker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 454, 458, 418 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhE\">Whether such an error is harmless in a particular ease depends upon a host of factors.... These factors include the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\"><em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. at 1438. Thus, <em>\u201cVan Arsdall </em>requires a court to consider several specific factors\u2014 more than just sufficiency of the evidence \u2014 when deciding whether the Confrontation Clause error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Howard v. Gavin, </em>810 F.Supp. 1269, 1275 (S.D.Ga.1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">Here we apply a more stringent standard against the government. In a sufficiency analysis we review the evidence to determine whether the government has satisfied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>minimum required in order for a reasonable juror to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In performing harmless error analysis, however, the standard cuts more sharply against the government: there must be no reasonable possibility that the unconstitutionally obtained evidence contributed to the conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 960 (11th Cir.1990) (citing <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 23, 87 S.Ct. at 827).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Among the verdicts obtained in this case was one finding Williams guilty of capital murder. To support a conviction for capital murder that is predicated upon murder in the commission of robbery, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4), the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201ca killing which takes place before, during, or after the robbery and is so closely related in time, place, and causal connection as to make the killing part of the same criminal enterprise as the robbery.\u201d <em>George v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 264, 277-78, 411 S.E.2d 12, 20 (1991). In other words, the evidence must \u201csupport a conclusion that the killing and theft were interdependent objects of a common criminal design.\u201d <em>Quesinberry v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 364, 374, 402 S.E.2d 218, 224 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">An application of the <em>Van Arsdall </em>factors reveals that the trial judge\u2019s error in admitting Harris\u2019 confession was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Harris\u2019 confession was central to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. <em>Cf. Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 201, 503 S.E.2d 233, 239 (1998) (holding trial judge\u2019s error in admitting accused\u2019s admission concerning the falsity of her signature was not harmless because it was the most important evidence proving forgery); <em>Watson v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 659, 666, 454 S.E.2d 358, 362-63 (1995) (holding the influence of the inculpatory statements upon the jury was not harmless where those statements constitute the principal evidence establishing his knowledge and control of contraband). Assuming the damaging potential of Harris\u2019 confession was realized, it established the essential causal connection linking the killing to the rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>bery. <em>See Satterwhite v. Texas, </em>486 U.S. 249, 259, 108 S.Ct. 1792, 1798-99, 100 L.Ed.2d 284 (1988) (holding that expert\u2019s testimony on \u201cfuture dangerousness was critical to the death sentence\u201d and was thus not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In pertinent part, Harris\u2019 confession recounted the following events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">[M]e and [Williams] met up one night.... He told me that we could do a hit, get some crack, a little bit of money.... I asked him where was it at. He said Park Place. I said no, I\u2019m too hot out here; I been chilling out. I said, do the guys know me? So he was like, no, they don\u2019t know neither one of us. So, we went around to the house, walked up the stairs. I knocked on the door; [Williams] stood on the side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">When the guy opened the door, he had a gun in his hand. [Williams] punched the guy; the gun fell. Both of them went reaching for the gun. I grabbed a bottle and hit the guy in the head. Then [Williams] grabbed the guy. We shut the door; [Williams] grabbed the guy, took him to the back. He told me to look up under the couch and grab the dope and look on the table and grab the scales. So when I was reaching for the scales, I heard a gunshot, one gunshot. And I heard the guy say, please don\u2019t kill me. So then I went up under the couch and found the drugs. That\u2019s when I heard two more gunshots above five seconds later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">Then [Williams] came running out the door. He went straight out the door and I yelled his name. He told me not to yell his name; he kept running across the street. So I ran over there to him, went up in the hallway and he said, we\u2019ll meet ... on the back street and split up everything. So when we got around there on the back street, he counted out ninety some dollars. He said he needed the money for something, like that and told me I could take the high side of the crack and that\u2019s what we did. He told me he\u2019ll sell the scales and give me some money the next day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Although the Commonwealth produced at trial three witnesses who testified that Williams made statements implicating himself in a killing, we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the improperly admitted testimony did not affect the verdict. Indeed, we cannot even conclude that the testimony of those witnesses and the other circumstantial evidence were sufficient, without Harris\u2019 statement, to prove that Williams killed Griffin, that a robbery occurred, or that a robbery bore the essential causal connection to the killing. As to those elements, Harris\u2019 confession was crucial, indeed essential, to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. \u201cThere was no physical evidence such as fingerprints ... or human blood evidence to link [Williams to the events that occurred in the apartment].\u201d <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 548, 552, 523 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Harris\u2019 confession was not cumulative of the other evidence the Commonwealth presented at trial. Jesse Keene testified that Williams informed him that he had been \u201clay[ing] low\u201d because, when Williams and Harris went to the apartment, \u201cthe other kid that was there got killed in the process.\u201d Keene further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">Q. Did [Williams] tell you anything else about what happened at [the apartment]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">A. Other than that, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">Q. Did he tell you how the kid that was at [the apartment] got killed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Keene\u2019s testimony clearly is insufficient to prove that Williams shot Griffin or that a robbery occurred. Although the trier of fact arguably might infer from Keene\u2019s testimony that Griffin was shot while Williams and Harris were at the apartment and that either Williams or Harris may have committed the murder, it is impossible to determine from Keene\u2019s testimony who in fact shot Griffin. It is just as likely that Williams was \u201clay[ing] low\u201d because he was present at the apartment when Harris or someone else shot Griffin (and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>therefore, feared being accused of the murder) as that Williams was \u201clay[ing] low\u201d because he shot Griffin.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Jason Carter testified that while he and Williams were in jail, he overheard Williams tell another prisoner that Williams was in the apartment when Griffin was shot and killed. In pertinent part, he testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">Q. What did you hear [Williams] say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">A. I heard him say that he went into the house and ... [Griffin] was the only one there, and he went for the gun and he tussled\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">Q. Who had the gun originally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">A. [Griffin].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">Q. Who went for the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">A. [Williams].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">Q. Did he say what happened after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-13\">A. He said he got the gun from him and he was shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-14\">Q. Who was shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-15\">A. [Griffin],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-16\">Q. Did he say who shot [Griffin]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-17\">A. No. He just say he grabbed the gun from him. I was believing that he had shot him because by the way he was talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-18\">Q. Did he say why [Griffin] got shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-19\">A. I guess because he tried to give up the fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-20\">Q. Did he say why he went to the house where [Griffin] was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-21\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-22\">Q. Did he say if he went alone or with someone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-23\">A. It was with someone else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-24\">This testimony does not clearly establish that Williams shot Griffin and clearly fails to prove a robbery occurred. Moreover, because Carter was Griffin\u2019s cousin, and Carter testified to being \u201cclose\u201d to Griffin, we cannot conclude that the trier of fact would nonetheless have believed Carter\u2019s testimony, despite his bias, had Harris\u2019 statement been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Thomas Liggins testified that he met Williams in jail. Liggins admitted to having been convicted of two felonies and of making a false statement. He also testified that other charges were pending against him at the time of Williams\u2019 trial. Admitting further that, in return for his testimony, the Commonwealth agreed to a suspended sentence on his pending felony charge and to other consideration, Liggins testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">Q. What did [Williams] tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">A. That he shot somebody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">Q. Did he tell you where he shot this person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">Q. Did he tell you who it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">Q. Did he tell you the circumstances of how he shot this person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">A. No. He just say he ain\u2019t had no mask on, he had to shoot him....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\">Q. Did he tell you what was happening when he shot the person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-14\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-15\">Q. Did he tell you whether he was alone or with someone else when he shot this person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-16\">A. He was with someone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-17\">Q. Did he tell you if it was a man or a woman that he shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABs\">A. He ain\u2019t say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-18\">Q. Did he say whether he did the shooting or the other person did the shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-19\">A. He said he did the shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-20\">Q. Did he tell you what the other person did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-21\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-22\">Q. What did he say the other person did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-23\">A. He said he hit him with a bottle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-24\">Q. Did he tell you whether this happened in a house or outside on the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>A. No, he ain\u2019t say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">Q. Did he tell you about any other crimes besides the shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Even if the trier of fact believed Liggins, his testimony established neither that Williams was in the apartment where Griffin was killed nor that a robbery occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Simply put, we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that, had the trial judge not considered Harris\u2019 confession, he would nonetheless have convicted Williams of the murder of Griffin in the commission of robbery. The effect of Harris\u2019 confession, inculpating Williams, on a trier of fact\u2019s view of the entirety of the evidence .cannot be overstated. When the issue is \u201cthe potential for harm caused by the erroneous admission of evidence which tends to support the [fact finder\u2019s] credibility determination^] ... we must presume that such evidence had the potential to influence the [fact finder] into accepting the properly admitted evidence as more credible and, thus, to taint the [fact finder\u2019s] determination of the facts.\u201d <em>Lilly, </em>258 Va. at 553, 523 S.E.2d at 210. Evidence which the trier of fact would normally hold as not credible or inconclusive can suddenly become convincing when corroborated by the accusatory confession of one who was intimately involved in the execution of the crime. Indeed, during the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument, the trial judge noted that after he heard the testimony of Keene, Carter, and Liggins, which occurred before the Commonwealth introduced Harris\u2019 confession, the trial judge had written in his notes, \u201cno robbery proved yet.\u201d The prejudicial impact of Harris\u2019 confession clearly was significant and undermines confidence in the verdict. In view of the generalized nature of the other testimony, we cannot conclude \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the [improperly admitted confession] did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 827. Thus, the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the improperly admitted evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>harmless. Therefore, we reverse the convictions and remand for retrial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
