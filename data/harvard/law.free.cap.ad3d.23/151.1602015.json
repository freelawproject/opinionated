The evidence establishes that the police had reasonable suspicion justifying their seizure of defendant, who met a detailed description of a man carrying a gun. The information the police relied on came from a source that was not anonymous, but rather had identifying characteristics that rendered it reliable, including a partial name and callback number <em>(see People v Herold, </em>282 AD2d 1, 5-6 [2001], <em>lv denied </em>97 NY2d 682 [2001]; <em>compare Florida v J.L., </em>529 US 266 [2000]). Furthermore, this information was corroborated by defendant\u2019s conduct, which was suggestive of criminality. When the officer confronted defendant in a store, defendant turned toward the officer while moving his hand toward his waistband <em>(see People v Benjamin, </em>51 NY2d 267, 270-271 [1980]; <em>People v Jenkins, </em>292 AD2d 188 [2002], <em>lv denied </em>98 NY2d 711 [2002]). Accordingly, the officer lawfully grabbed defendant\u2019s hand as a self-protective measure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>and, in doing so, observed a knife in defendant\u2019s waistband. This observation led to the lawful recovery of the knife and other contraband. Concur\u2014Buckley, P.J., Tom, Mazzarelli, Marlow and Catterson, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
