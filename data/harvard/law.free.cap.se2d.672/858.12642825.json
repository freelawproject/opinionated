KINSER.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this wrongful death action, the sole issue is whether a plaintiff claiming to be the administratrix of a decedent's estate, but who filed the action prior to qualifying as such, is entitled to a nonsuit as a matter of right under Code \u00a7 8.01-380. Because the plaintiff was not a legal entity at the time she filed the action and therefore lacked standing to do so, the action is a nullity. Accordingly, no valid action was pending that could be nonsuited. We will therefore reverse the circuit court's judgment granting a nonsuit and denying the defendants' motions to abate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   David Gray Bazemore (decedent) died on March 14, 2005, while hospitalized at Johnston Memorial Hospital (the Hospital). On March 9, 2007, a complaint was filed in the circuit court, naming as the plaintiff \"Wanda Bazemore, Administratrix for the Estate of David Gray Bazemore, Deceased.\" Wanda Bazemore, the decedent's wife, had not, however, qualified as administratrix of her husband's estate when she filed the complaint, naming as defendants the Hospital, Martin Monahan, M.D., and William Baker, M.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the complaint, Bazemore alleged that Dr. Monahan and Dr. Baker were negligent in their care and treatment of the decedent and that their negligence was a proximate cause of the decedent's injuries and death. Bazemore further claimed that the Hospital was not only vicariously liable for the doctors' alleged negligence but also directly negligent for failing to institute necessary procedures and protocols to ensure the decedent received appropriate medical care. Finally, Bazemore alleged the defendants committed an assault and battery on the decedent's person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Each defendant filed a motion to abate the action and strike it from the docket. Relying on Code \u00a7 8.01-50(B), which states, \"Every [wrongful death action] shall be brought by and in the name of the personal representative of such deceased person within the time limits,\" they claimed Bazemore had never qualified as the personal representative of the decedent's estate and she, therefore, lacked standing to file the action. Thus, according to the defendants, the action was a nullity and should be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wanda Bazemore qualified as administratrix of the decedent's estate on August 22, 2007. She subsequently filed a motion to nonsuit the action. After a hearing on the parties' respective motions, the circuit court granted Bazemore's motion to nonsuit and denied the defendants' motions to abate the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a letter opinion, the circuit court concluded that Code \u00a7 8.01-380 required the court to grant the nonsuit as a matter of right. Quoting the decision in\n   <em>\n    Nash v. Jewell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2074642\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/227/230/#p237\">\n    227 Va. 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20S.E.2d%20825\">\n    315 S.E.2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 829 (1984), the circuit court stated that a \"`[p]laintiff has an absolute right to one non-suit. The election is his and if he insists upon taking the non-suit within the limitations imposed by the statute, neither the trial court nor opposing counsel can prevent him from doing so.'\" The court further stated that since Bazemore exercised the right to a nonsuit, it could not consider the issues raised in the motions to abate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the defendants assign error to the circuit court's denying the motions to abate and granting Bazemore's motion to nonsuit. They claim Bazemore lacked standing to file the action because she was not the decedent's qualified personal representative, thereby rendering the action a nullity. Because the assigned error presents only a question of law, we will review the circuit\n   court's ruling de novo.\n   <em>\n    Sheets v.

It is correct, as Bazemore points out, that the pleading at issue in\n   <em>\n    Nerri\n   </em>\n   was invalid and without legal effect because it had been signed by an attorney whose license to practice law in the Commonwealth had been administratively suspended by the Virginia State Bar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632979\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/429/\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The reason why an action is without legal effect, however, is of no consequence.

Neither\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake House, Harmon, Brake, Cook,\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Wells\n   </em>\n   involved the issue before us today. No party in those cases questioned whether a legal proceeding that is a nullity can nevertheless be nonsuited. However, when the issue was squarely presented in\n   <em>\n    Nerri,\n   </em>\n   we clearly held that a proceeding that has no legal effect, i.e., one that is a nullity, cannot be nonsuited.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=270%20Va.%2028\">\n    270 Va. at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632979\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/429/\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the language in\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake House\n   </em>\n   and other cases upon which Bazemore relies is not controlling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Subsection B of Code \u00a7 8.01-50 vests the right of action for wrongful death in a decedent's personal representative.\n   <em>\n    Kone,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=272%20Va.%2059\">\n    272 Va. at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12636026\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/630/744/#p746\">\n    630 S.E.2d at 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since Wanda Bazemore had not qualified as the personal\n   representative of her husband's estate when this wrongful death action was filed, the named plaintiff, which was not a legal entity at that time, lacked standing to file the action. The action is therefore a nullity and cannot be nonsuited. Thus, we will reverse the circuit court's judgment granting a nonsuit and denying the defendants' motions to abate, and dismiss the action with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and dismissed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-276, the General Assembly abolished \"pleas in abatement.\" In this opinion, we will nevertheless refer to the pleading as a motion to abate since that is the caption used by the defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Because the circuit court decided this case on written motions without an evidentiary hearing, we will summarize the facts as alleged in the pleadings.\n    <em>\n     See Parker-Smith v.

As the defendants correctly note, the question decided in\n    <em>\n     Douglas\n    </em>\n    concerned the inability of a plaintiff to \"relate back\" her qualification as a personal representative of a decedent's estate to the original date of the filing of the action.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"809146\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/251/363/\">\n     251 Va. at 365-66\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=467%20S.E.2d%20474\">\n     467 S.E.2d at 475-76\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus,\n    <em>\n     Douglas\n    </em>\n    is inapposite.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
