The petitions were heard on 12, 26, and 27 July 2007.

The certifications read: \"I, Holly Groce, Attorney Advocate, do hereby accept service of the attached Summons in Proceeding for Termination of Parental Rights and Petition for Termination of Parental Rights, and acknowledge receipt of the same in the above-entitled proceeding pending in the General Court of Justice, Iredell County, North Carolina, and service by an officer is hereby expressly waived.\" The Acceptance of Service of Process certifications are entitled \"In the Matter of: [J.A.P.], a minor child[,]\" and \"In the Matter of: [I.M.P.], a minor child.\" The summonses and the Acceptance of Service of Process certifications are paginated consecutively in the record. Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    C.T.\n   </em>\n   where no summons was issued regarding R.S., summonses were issued referencing both J.A.P. and I.M.P.

We hold that where a juvenile's guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   is represented by an attorney advocate in a termination of parental rights proceeding, service of summons on the attorney advocate constitutes service on the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem.\n   </em>\n   Service of summons on the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem,\n   </em>\n   in turn, constitutes service on the juvenile, as expressly stated in N.C.

At one point, the plan for these children was TPR. It was learned that all services had already been offered to this family many times. They cooperate well while Social Services is involved, and then apparently, as soon as Social Services becomes uninvolved, things go back to the same way or worse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On February 20, 2003, social worker made a home visit and found four baby goats, a rabbit, and a ferret running free in the house. There were still roaches, but it was not as bad. There were goat feces, rabbit feces, ferret feces, and possibly other type[s] of animal feces in most of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   While social worker was visiting the home, the goat got up on the couch and urinated on the couch. The children report to social worker that the goats \"pee on their bed,\" and \"pee on their homework,\" and father and the children all want the goats to be outside, but the mother indicated that she would get rid of the children and the father before she got rid of the goats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Respondent stipulated in open court that \"the allegations contained in the Juvenile Petitions were true as of the date the petitions were filed and that there exist[ed] a factual basis for the Court to conclude as a matter of law and to adjudicate the minor children neglected children.\" An order adjudicating the minor children neglected was entered on 15 May 2003. On 1 July 2003, an order continuing nonsecure custody with DSS was entered, with Respondent ordered to \"have no pets or animals at her residence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Between July 2003 and July 2007, numerous review and permanency planning hearings were held, and the permanent plan for the minor children fluctuated between termination of parental rights/adoption, reunification, guardianship, or some combination thereof. Although the trial court returned the children to the physical custody of Respondent on 25 November 2003, the children were again removed from Respondent's home on or about 18 May 2004 after a squirrel, rats, a hamster, and animal feces were found in the home. Respondent absconded with the children to Texas for a period of time prior to DSS taking custody of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In its order terminating Respondent's parental rights, the trial court made numerous findings of fact in support of its determination that the minor children were neglected, including:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   8. That [Respondent is] not [a] fit and proper person[ ] to have custody of the minor children in that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   a. The Iredell County Department of Social Services has been extensively involved with this family since March 5, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   b. Examples of behavior manifesting recurring concerns of neglect by the Respondent[ ] in the form of improper supervision, inappropriate discipline, and the condition of the home include:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 The Respondent [ ] used very poor judgment in hitchhiking with the children on numerous occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 [Respondent] took the children dumpster-diving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 The home was found to have below minimal standards with animal feces/urine on the floor, throughout the home and in the bedding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 Goats were found to be living inside the home and a dead and decaying\n   chicken was observed in the bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 Roaches infested the house and were in the food and in the bedding, and the mother required the children to eat roach-infested food and sleep in roach-infested beds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 The children were found to be very dirty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The minor child [J.A.P.] stated that the Respondent [ ] would slap him if he did not eat the food. The minor child [J.A.P.] reported that he felt that his mom loved the goats more than him. The Social Worker confronted the Respondent [ ] about the animals living in her home on numerous occasions to little or no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   c. The Respondent [] used corporal punishment to discipline the minor children. That a number of services including in-home aide services were offered to the Respondent [ ] as well as parenting classes, domestic violence classes, and individual and family counseling. She chose not to participate in these services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   e. A family services case plan was then developed for the Respondent [ ] and signed [ ]. The plan included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   a provision that animals were to be removed from the home and not allowed in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   h. The [Respondent's] pattern has been that she was able to respond to agency expectations and would make steps toward making her home safe and healthy for the minor children, and then the Department would visit the home and find that conditions in the home had reverted to the condition described in paragraph 8b above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   k. In March of 2005, the minor child [S.N.P.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   reported that she had been sexually abused by Virgil a.k.a. \"Froggy\" Howard, the [Respondent's] adult son by a previous marriage and the minor child's half-brother. The court ordered the Respondent [ ] not to allow \"Froggy\" to be in the presence of the minor children; the Respondent [] disregarded the Court's order, allowing \"Froggy\" to transport the minor child [I.M.P.] to a church function and to transport the family to therapy, including [I.M.P.] and [J.A.P.], to therapy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   l. The minor child [I.M.P.] had to be hospitalized due to fears about \"Froggy\" at the time of his release from custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   o. The Guardian ad Litem Rachal Hannibal reported that when the minor children were residing with the Respondent Mother, the house was chaotic, with no rules or structure. Ms. Hannibal observed the minor children to say and do whatever they wanted, and that they did not listen to the Respondent [ ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   q. The [ ] Parents [of the minor children] have a history of domestic violence. In March of 2005, the minor children were present during a domestic violence dispute between the [ ] Parents, which was traumatic for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   y. The Court finds from the credible evidence that it is highly probable, based on past performance, that neither parent would change his or her parenting practices, or disregard of court orders, and that if either or both children were returned to either or both parents, they would be subjected to the same conditions described above and to continuing neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As Respondent did not challenge any of the trial court's findings of fact, these findings are binding on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Baker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4753586\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/312/34/\">\n    312 N.C. 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20S.E.2d%20670\">\n    320 S.E.2d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Regardless, there is clear, cogent, and convincing evidence to support the trial court's findings of fact. In turn, we hold the trial court's findings of fact support its conclusion that the minor children were neglected within the meaning of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-101 and, thus, that grounds existed to terminate Respondent's parental rights. Accordingly, we overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   B. Additional Grounds for Termination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Respondent also asserts that the trial court erred in concluding that grounds existed to terminate her parental rights because she willfully left the minor children in placement outside the home for more than 12 months without showing to the satisfaction of the court that reasonable progress under the circumstances had been made in correcting those conditions which led to the removal of the children, pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(2), and because Respondent failed to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care for the juveniles for a period of six months prior to the filing of the termination petitions, pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a)(3). However, as only one ground is necessary to support the termination of parental rights, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1111(a), we need not address whether the findings of fact support termination based on N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 7B-1111(a)(2) or (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   C. Best Interests of the Children\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   By Respondent's next assignment of error, she asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the best interests of the minor children would be served by terminating Respondent's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Once grounds for termination are established, the trial court must proceed to the dispositional stage where the best interests of the child are considered. There, the court shall issue an order terminating the parental rights unless it determines that the best interests of the child require otherwise. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-1110(a) (2007). The trial court's determination of the child's best interests lies within its sound discretion and is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    In re T.L.B.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8411175\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/167/298/\">\n    167 N.C.App. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=605%20S.E.2d%20249\">\n    605 S.E.2d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In its order terminating Respondent's parental rights, the trial court made the following unchallenged findings of fact concerning its best interests inquiry:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   a. Since the minor children, [J.A.P.] and [I.M.P.], have been in the custody of the Department, they have improved in ways that the Guardian ad Litem Rachal Hannibal and foster parent Sally Wright have described as increased maturity and learning to accept limits on their behaviors; the children are better socialized, are more stable, happier and better-adjusted. The children are also interacting better with their peers and authority figures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   b. [J.A.P.] remains in the care of Perry and Sally Wright, where he has resided since May 3, 2006. He has found a sense of comfortableness and stability in this home that he has never had before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   c. Both [I.M.P.] and [J.A.P.] are doing well in school, with [I.M.P.] receiving all As and Bs and [J.A.P.] receiving all As on their most recent report cards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   d. Both [I.M.P.] and [J.A.P.] continue to receive therapy, case management services, and medication management services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   e. [I.M.P.] and [J.A.P.] visit each other consistently and continue to include each other in their extracurricular activities and celebrations. Their foster families have helped to make sure that the children have ongoing contact in order to maintain their sibling bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   f. Sally Wright testified that she and her husband wish to adopt the minor child [J.A.P.] should he become free for adoption. Ms. Wright has also recently indicated that she would like to provide a placement in her home for [I.M.P.] as well, despite the fact that she also has two biological teenage sons who reside in the home. [I.M.P.]'s visits in the Wrights' home have been increased; she seems comfortable in\n   their home and gets along well with Mr. and Mrs. Wright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   g. [J.A.P.] had indicated that it is his first desire to be reunited with the Respondent[ ], but if this does not happen, he would like to remain in the home of the Wrights'. [I.M.P.] has indicated that she would like to see the Respondent [] to say goodbye, but does not wish to reside with her anymore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Based upon these findings, we cannot conclude that the trial court's decision is manifestly unsupported by reason. We thus find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's conclusion that termination of Respondent's parental rights is in the children's best interests. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   By Respondent's final assignment of error, she asserts she was prejudiced by the trial court's failure to file the written order terminating her parental rights within 30 days of the completion of the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   A trial court must enter a written order regarding its decision on termination of parental rights within 30 days of the completion of the hearing. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 7B-1109(e) and 7B-1110(a) (2007). Non-compliance with these statutory time requirements does not warrant a new termination hearing, however, absent a showing of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    In re J.L.K.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8997210\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/165/311/\">\n    165 N.C.App. 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=598%20S.E.2d%20387\">\n    598 S.E.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    disc. review denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3793476,3799505,3801974,3800535,3795417,3797691,3800412,3797917\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/359/68/\">\n    359 N.C. 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=604%20S.E.2d%20314\">\n    604 S.E.2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In the present case, the termination hearing was held on 12, 26, and 27 July 2007 and the trial court entered the written order 82 days later, on 17 October 2007. While Respondent claims that she was prejudiced by the delay in filing, she offered no evidence in support of this bare assertion. This Court has previously held that despite an 89-day delay in reducing the termination order to writing, \"vacating the TPR order\" was \"not an appropriate remedy for the trial court's failure to enter the order within 30 days of the hearing\" where \"neglect and abandonment had been proven by clear, cogent and convincing evidence as the grounds upon which respondent's parental rights were being terminated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=604%20S.E.2d%20314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=604%20S.E.2d%20314\">\n    at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=598%20S.E.2d%20387\">\n    598 S.E.2d at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, neglect was proven by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence as the grounds upon which Respondent's parental rights were being terminated. Furthermore, the trial court announced its adjudication of neglect and its decision to terminate Respondent's parental rights in open court on 27 July 2007. Accordingly, we conclude that the delay in reducing the trial court's order to writing did not prejudice Respondent and, thus, does not warrant reversal of the trial court's termination of Respondent's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the reasons stated, the order of the trial court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Judges CALABRIA and STEELMAN concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The Court's opinion in\n    <em>\n     K.A.D.\n    </em>\n    is silent as to whether summons was issued to K.A.D.'s guardian\n    <em>\n     ad litem,\n    </em>\n    although the opinion reflects that a guardian\n    <em>\n     ad litem\n    </em>\n    had been appointed for K.A.D.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Footnote 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3.\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    At that time, Respondent's oldest child, S.N.P., who is not a subject of this appeal, was two years old.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4.\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    S.N.P. is Respondent's oldest daughter, who is not a subject of this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5.\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    \"Froggy,\" who was awaiting trial for sexual assault allegedly perpetrated upon S.N.P., made bail and was released from custody around May 2006.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
