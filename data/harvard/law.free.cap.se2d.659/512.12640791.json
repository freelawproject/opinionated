Prior to trial, McCain filed a motion to suppress, claiming that evidence was seized from him in violation of his constitutional rights. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, and convicted McCain on all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   McCain appealed to the Court of Appeals. In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions.\n   <em>\n    McCain v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 0110-06-3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201319451\">\n    2007 WL 1319451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 8, 2007). McCain appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the early morning hours of August 9, 2005, Officer R.V. Worsham (\"Worsham\"), of the City of Danville Police Department, observed a vehicle (\"the vehicle\") parked in front of a house on Sublett's Alley in the City of Danville. The two occupants of the vehicle walked up to the house in front of which the vehicle was parked and, in less than a minute, returned to the vehicle. Worsham was familiar with the house because he was involved in a transaction \"months\" earlier in which an informant made a controlled purchase of cocaine there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When the vehicle left, Worsham followed in his police vehicle. Worsham observed that the vehicle's rear license plate had a plastic border that covered the expiration date of the license plate. He intended to stop the vehicle for that reason, but \"before [he] could get to it to stop it for that, it was [improperly] backing out into North Main Street.\" Worsham initiated a traffic stop. Worsham stopped the vehicle within sight of the house where Worsham had first seen the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Worsham approached the vehicle and asked the driver, Kelly Hartman (\"Hartman\"), for her license. McCain was the front seat passenger. McCain, whom Worsham already knew, identified himself truthfully. Worsham obtained Hartman's information and went back to his car to check her driver's license and to call for \"back-up\" assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hartman's driver's license was reported suspended. Worsham went back to the vehicle and asked McCain if he had a license, so that he could drive the vehicle without it being towed. McCain told Worsham that his license also was suspended. Because both drivers' licenses were suspended, Worsham needed to conduct an inventory of the vehicle's contents and have it towed. When Officer E.K. Thompson (\"Thompson\") arrived on the scene, Worsham explained to him what had occurred and asked Thompson to watch the passenger side of the vehicle while Worsham got the driver out. Worsham asked the driver to exit the vehicle. She did so and consented to a search of her person and the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thompson went to the passenger side of the car and asked McCain to exit the car. Thompson asked McCain if he could perform a \"frisk\" or \"pat-down\" search on McCain. Up to that point, McCain had complied with every request made by the officers. McCain declined to give Thompson permission for the search. However, Thompson ordered McCain to place his hands on the vehicle and performed a pat-down search on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thompson testified that McCain seemed nervous as Thompson began to pat him down and that Worsham had told him that he thought McCain was \"edgy.\" When McCain removed his hands from the car, Thompson grabbed McCain by the arm and put him back on the car and said, \"Look, don't be coming off the car like that cause I take that as a sign of aggression towards me.\" Thompson continued the pat-down and found keys in McCain's pocket. Later during the pat-down search, Thompson asked McCain if he had any weapons on his person, and McCain said that he had a gun, at which time Thompson removed a gun from McCain's waistband and placed him under arrest. During a search incident to the arrest, Worsham discovered cocaine in McCain's pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The neighborhood where the traffic stop occurred had been patrolled by Worsham for almost five years and was \"known for the drugs, known for shots fired, being called [in] all the time[,] . . . probably at least once a night shift.\" In fact, Thompson, who also regularly patrolled the area, testified that, \"for officer safety,\" he conducts a pat-down search of every person he interacts with in that neighborhood, whether they want him to or not. Thompson testified, \"If I'm getting out for a reason to talk to somebody I would definitely pat them down for my safety.\" The trial court found that McCain was seized for purposes of the pat-down search, but that his detention for that purpose was constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   McCain claims that he was subjected to an unlawful seizure and search and that all evidence obtained as a result thereof should have been suppressed. The Commonwealth contends that, under the circumstances, the police officer's seizure and search of McCain was constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A defendant's claim that evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

Worsham and Thompson detained McCain solely because of the actions of the driver. Neither officer articulated a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity implicating McCain, and viewing the circumstances objectively, none existed. Also, McCain's actions gave the officers no legitimate reasonable suspicion that he was armed and dangerous. Although the character of the location and the time are relevant factors, they did not provide either officer a particularized and objective basis for suspecting McCain was armed and dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Worsham may have had a hunch that McCain was involved with drugs because of the neighborhood and the house McCain visited; however, such a hunch does not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion. The officers' interaction with McCain during the traffic stop in no way supported this hunch, because the officers did not observe or notice any drugs, odor of drugs, or drug paraphernalia in the vehicle. Further, the officers did not notice any physical or mental impairment that would indicate drug use by McCain, and there were no physical or other characteristics observed by the officers that indicated McCain might be armed and dangerous. Although he may have appeared to be nervous, McCain identified himself when requested, did not make any furtive movements, and cooperated with the police officers until Thompson asked permission to do a pat-down search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   does not permit a generalized policy that authorizes a police officer to frisk all persons. The totality of the circumstances, namely, the time of day, the location in a \"high crime\" area, and the fact that Worsham had months earlier conducted a controlled cocaine purchase from the house McCain visited on Sublett's Alley, did not create reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify detaining and frisking McCain. No additional circumstances developed during the course of the traffic stop that would support a reasonable suspicion that McCain was involved in criminal activity or was armed and dangerous. Therefore, we hold that McCain was seized and frisked in violation of his\n   rights under the Fourth Amendment, and his motion to suppress should have been granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because the evidence seized from McCain should have been suppressed, there would be insufficient evidence to sustain convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and the related firearms and weapons offenses. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate McCain's convictions, and dismiss the indictments against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed, vacated and dismissed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CARRICO, Senior Justice, dissents and files opinion in which KOONTZ and KINSER, JJ., join.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Senior Justice CARRICO, with whom Justice KOONTZ and Justice KINSER join, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I agree with the majority that to justify a \"pat-down search,\" the rule is that \"the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts\" showing that \"criminal activity may be afoot\" and that the suspect \"may be armed and presently dangerous.\"\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

The drug buy obviously made a lasting impression upon him; it was still fresh in his mind; and it is a relevant circumstance in an objective assessment of the reasonableness of his actions. Furthermore, Officer Thompson testified that when he arrived on the scene Officer Worsham told him before he patted down the defendant that the house \"was\n   <em>\n    known\n   </em>\n   for selling drugs\" (emphasis added), indicating that Officer Worsham had recent information that the house was a continuing site of drug activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The foregoing are specific and articulable facts that would, as I see the case, warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that criminal activity,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the purchase of illicit drugs, may have been afoot on the defendant's visit to the house in question.

When an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others, it would appear to be clearly unreasonable to deny the officer the power to take necessary measures to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon and to neutralize the threat of physical harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p21\">\n    392 U.S. at 23-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p21\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   And the concern for officer safety does not change because the suspect happens to be, as the defendant was in this case, a passenger in a motor vehicle. \"[T]he same weighty interest in officer safety is present regardless of whether the occupant of the stopped car is a driver or passenger.\"\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.
