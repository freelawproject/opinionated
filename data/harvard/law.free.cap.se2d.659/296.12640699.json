We also consider the issue whether certain provisions in the Roanoke City Subdivision Ordinance\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the Subdivision Ordinance) provided adequate standards, in compliance with Code \u00a7 15.2-2242(1), for rendering discretionary decisions granting exceptions under that Ordinance. Finally, we consider whether neighboring landowners may seek a declaratory judgment regarding a locality's application of a subdivision ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2004, George Leonard Boone, president of Boone Homes, Inc., a land development company, began working with officials from the City of Roanoke (the City) to obtain approval of a subdivision plat providing for the construction of about 60 single-family homes in southern Roanoke. Boone planned to build this housing development, known as \"Wilton,\" on about 50 acres of mountainous land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Boone worked with R. Brian Townsend, the City's Director of Planning, Building, and Economic Development, to obtain approval of the Wilton subdivision plat. Townsend was the subdivision agent authorized by the City Council and the City Planning Commission, under former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 31-5(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 31-65,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to make decisions regarding exceptions to the Subdivision Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December 2004, Townsend conditionally approved a portion of the subdivision plat for the Wilton development. The approved portion of the plat incorporated the following exceptions to the Subdivision Ordinance requirements: 1) an exception from the 10% maximum grade requirement for local streets, as set forth in former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7 31-70, to allow for a maximum grade of 16% for one local street; 2) an exception from the minimum requirement for local streets of a 30-foot-wide paved surface, as set forth in former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7 31-90(b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to permit several streets 22 feet in width; 3) an exception from the maximum length for cul-de-sac streets of 600 feet, as set forth in former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7 31-70, to permit a cul-de-sac street of 1800 feet; and 4) permission to construct street blocks up to a maximum length of 1800 feet, a departure from former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7 31-67,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which states that blocks longer than 1200 feet, or less than 360 feet, \"may be cause for disapproval of the preliminary plat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Boone requested several of these exceptions in order to construct an access road, named Wilton Park Drive, leading into the Wilton development. Under Boone's plan, Wilton Park Drive would intersect with Peakwood Drive, an existing main road in a residential area of the City known as Prospect Hills. To construct Wilton Park Drive, Boone planned to demolish a house he owned on a one-acre lot that connects the Wilton property with Peakwood Drive and construct the entry to Wilton Park Drive on that lot. The proposed Wilton Park Drive would have a downward grade of 16% and, like all the proposed roads in the Wilton subdivision, would end in a cul-de-sac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In October 2005, Jacqulyn C. Logan and 15 additional landowners who own homes on Peakwood Drive near the proposed Wilton subdivision filed a bill of complaint for declaratory judgment against the Roanoke City Council, the City Planning Commission, Townsend, and Boone Homes, Inc. (collectively, the defendants). Logan and the additional complainants (collectively, Logan) alleged that Peakwood Drive, a curved road located on a mountainside, would be \"unsafe and inappropriate\" for the additional vehicle traffic that would result from construction of the Wilton subdivision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Logan also alleged in the bill of complaint that the Subdivision Ordinance was both facially invalid and invalid as applied to the approval of the Wilton subdivision plat. Logan asserted the following particular claims relevant to this appeal: 1) former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 31-65 and -90(b) were unlawful because they stated less stringent standards for granting exceptions to the Subdivision Ordinance than the standards provided in Code \u00a7 15.2-2242(1); 2) in violation of Code \u00a7 15.2-2255, the City Council improperly delegated to its subdivision agent the authority to grant exceptions under the Subdivision Ordinance involving public improvements; 3) former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 65 and -90(b) failed to provide adequate standards to guide the subdivision agent's decisions whether to grant exceptions under the Ordinance; 4) the subdivision agent lacked authority under Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-2242 and -2255 to grant exceptions relating to public improvements; 5) the subdivision agent acted arbitrarily and capriciously when he granted the exceptions; and 6) the approval of plans for proposed Wilton Park Drive violated former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7 31-8\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the plans would alter the boundaries of lots in Prospect Hills and would alter Peakwood Drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendants filed demurrers to the bill of complaint. The circuit court sustained the demurrers regarding Logan's claims one, two, and four, as listed above, and granted Logan leave to amend those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After Logan filed an amended bill of complaint, the defendants again filed demurrers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Among other things, the defendants contended that Logan did not have a private right of action to challenge enforcement of the Subdivision Ordinance as applied to the Wilton subdivision plat. The circuit court held that the amended bill of complaint was not significantly different from Logan's original pleading, and again sustained the demurrers regarding claims one, two, and four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The case proceeded to a five-day bench trial, in which the circuit court heard evidence relating to each of the granted exceptions. Following the trial, in a letter opinion, the circuit court dismissed Logan's remaining claims. The circuit court held that Logan could seek a declaratory judgment under Code \u00a7 8.01-184 to determine the adequacy of standards for granting exceptions under the Subdivision Ordinance, and the propriety of the particular decisions Townsend made concerning the Wilton subdivision plat. The circuit court concluded that former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 31-65 and -90 contained definite and sufficient standards under Code \u00a7 15.2-2242(1) to guide the subdivision agent in exercising his discretion under those provisions. The circuit court also held that Logan failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the subdivision agent acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in granting the challenged exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We awarded Logan this appeal. We also granted the defendants' assignments of cross-error, in which they assert that Logan did not have a right of action to challenge the subdivision agent's application of the Subdivision Ordinance in approving the Wilton subdivision plat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    A. Delegation of Authority to Subdivision Agent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Logan argues that the City Council was prohibited by Code \u00a7 15.2-2255 from adopting a provision in its Subdivision Ordinance that delegated to its subdivision agent the authority to approve exceptions involving public improvements. The statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The administration and enforcement of subdivision regulations insofar as they pertain to public improvements as authorized in \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-2241 through 15.2-2245 shall be vested in the governing body of the locality in which the improvements are or will be located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Except as provided above, the governing body shall be responsible for administering and enforcing the provisions of the subdivision regulations through its local planning commission or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Code \u00a7 15.2-2255.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Relying on the Dillon Rule of strict construction, Logan contends that the first paragraph of Code \u00a7 15.2-2255 removes the category of public improvements from the general authority of a local governing body to delegate matters concerning the application and enforcement of its subdivision ordinance. Thus, Logan contends that only a local governing body, not its designated agent, may grant exceptions pertaining to public improvements as part of the subdivision plat approval process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In response, the defendants contend that the first paragraph of Code \u00a7 15.2-2255 addresses situations in which real property is subject to the subdivision ordinances of both a county and a municipality. According to the defendants, in such situations, the administration and enforcement of subdivision ordinance provisions pertaining to public improvements shall be vested in the governing body of the locality in which the improvements are located. Thus, the defendants assert that because approval of the Wilton subdivision plat did not involve public improvements located in more than one jurisdiction, this statutory provision did not prevent the City from delegating to Townsend the authority to grant exceptions relating to public improvements proposed for the Wilton subdivision. We agree with the defendants' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We examine the language of Code \u00a7 15.2-2255 in the context of related statutes that also address the application and enforcement of subdivision ordinances. Our consideration of the various statutes involves a pure question of law, which we determine de novo on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Such a construction would render meaningless the phrase \"in which the improvements are or will be located.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Instead, we conclude that the first paragraph of the statute is intended to address situations in which existing or proposed public improvements may be subject to the subdivision ordinances of more than one locality. Such circumstances may arise under the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-2248 and -2249.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under Code \u00a7 15.2-2248, in five specified counties, the subdivision regulations adopted by a municipality located within those counties shall apply in certain circumstances beyond the municipality's corporate limits into unincorporated regions of the county, if the municipal ordinance so provides. However, under Code \u00a7 15.2-2249, the subdivision regulations adopted by the local governing bodies of these five counties shall apply in all unincorporated areas of those counties, including those areas over which a municipality may extend the application of its subdivision ordinance, provided that any such municipality has been given the opportunity to approve or disapprove the county's proposed regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The General Assembly specifically contemplated that disagreements could arise under these provisions regarding whether the regulations of a county or a municipality should be applicable to a given area. To address this problem, Code \u00a7 15.2-2250 permits a municipality or a county, or both these parties, to petition the circuit court for the county in which the major part of the disputed territory lies, and the circuit court \"shall hear the matter and enter an appropriate order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632279\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/607/103/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Viewed in the context of these statutes, the legislative intent of Code \u00a7 15.2-2255 is plain. We conclude that the General Assembly intended to make certain that control over the development of public improvements not be subject to uncertainty on the part of local officials or to an unresolved dispute between a county and a municipality. By enacting Code \u00a7 15.2-2255, the General Assembly specified that with regard to public improvements authorized by the subdivision ordinance enabling statutes, the administration and enforcement of subdivision regulations will be controlled by the governing\n   body in which the improvements are or will be located. Accordingly, this provision removes any uncertainty regarding which jurisdiction shall exercise control over present and proposed public improvements physically located in a given jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In view of this statutory purpose, we hold that the first paragraph of Code \u00a7 15.2-2255 does not reflect a legislative intent to prevent a local governing body from delegating to an agent the responsibility to administer and enforce subdivision regulations pertaining to public improvements within that locality. In fact, such delegation is expressly authorized by the second paragraph of Code \u00a7 15.2-2255, subject to the restrictions imposed by the first paragraph concerning public improvements that may be within the joint control of more than one locality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Our conclusion is not altered by Logan's argument that the Dillon Rule of strict construction prohibits this result.

Logan contends that the former Subdivision Ordinance failed to articulate standards required by Code \u00a7 15.2-2242(1) to guide decisions regarding the approval of exceptions. According to Logan, the evaluative factors listed in former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 31-65 and -90(b) provided little or no guidance for the granting of exceptions. Logan also contends that the language in former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7 31-67 regarding block lengths lacked any substantive standard for permitting an exception under that section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Initially, we do not consider Logan's argument that former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7 31-67 was facially invalid because it lacked any standard to guide administrative review of its provisions.

However, this section also provided for an exception to that requirement, stating that \"[i]n cases where the cross slope will not permit a greater width,\" the agent may modify the minimum paved width requirement \"in a manner that will result in the best possible utilization of the land to be subdivided, giving consideration to the topography of the land and general character and density of the proposed subdivision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Upon our review, we hold that former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 31-65 and -90(b) prescribed adequate standards for the subdivision agent's exercise of delegated authority consistent with the directive of Code \u00a7 15.2-2242(1). The subdivision agent was required to consider several factors under former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7 31-65 before granting an exception to the stated ordinance requirements. That section also prohibited the agent from granting an exception to an ordinance requirement if the exception would be in conflict with any provision of any city ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Absent such a conflict, former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7 31-65 permitted the subdivision agent to grant an exception based on such factors as the size or shape of the parcel, its topography, the proposed land use, or other special conditions upon determining that compliance with the general subdivision ordinance requirements would be \"impractical.\" Under former Subdivision Ordinance \u00a7 31-90(b), the agent could not permit an exception from the minimum width requirement of 30 feet for payed local streets unless a situation presented by a \"cross slope\" indicated that such an exception was needed. This section further required that the agent consider the topography and character of the subdivision to achieve the best utilization of the land. Thus, we hold that the circuit court did not err in concluding that these provisions contained adequate standards to guide the subdivision agent's decisions whether to grant the allowable exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    C.

Logan contends that her case may be distinguished from the proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Shilling,\n   </em>\n   which did not include the locality as a party defendant but involved a neighboring landowner's suit against an adjoining property owner. Logan further maintains that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Shilling\n   </em>\n   is not controlling because in that case, we did not address a subdivision agent's interpretation of an ordinance or an agent's allegedly arbitrary and capricious actions granting exceptions to that ordinance.
