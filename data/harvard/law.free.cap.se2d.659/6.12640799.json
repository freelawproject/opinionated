Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction to consider defendant's petition, which we treat as a Petition for Writ of Certiorari. As such, defendant's Petition for Writ of Certiorari is denied. The State's Motion to Dismiss Petition for Review Under Rule 2 is dismissed as moot. The State's Motion to Deny Defendant's Motion for Petition for Writ of Certiorari is dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   By order of the Court in Conference, this 24th day of January, 2008.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
