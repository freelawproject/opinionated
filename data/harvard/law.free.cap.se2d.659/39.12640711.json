Erde (collectively, \"defendants\") appeal from order entered denying their motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Saft America Inc. (\"plaintiff\"), is a corporation engaged in the manufacture of batteries and other energy storage cells. Plaintiff conducts its business in Burke County, North Carolina. Plainview Batteries, Inc. (\"Plainview\"), and Energex Batteries, Inc. (\"Energex\"), are also involved in the battery and energy storage business. Plainview and Energex are corporations organized under the laws of the state of New York. Bernie R. Erde (\"Erde\") served as President and CEO of Plainview and Vice President of Energex. Erde owns forty-nine (49%) percent of Plainview's stock and fifty-one percent (51%) of Energex's stock. Russell Bleeker (\"Bleeker\") served as a corporate officer for both Plainview and Energex. In addition to overlapping management and ownership, Plainview and Energex share a common mailing address in Plainview, New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning in the 1990s, plaintiff established a business relationship with Plainview in which plaintiff sold Plainview several million dollars worth of goods. Until 2005, plaintiff dealt with Erde as Plainview's representative. In January 2005, Bleeker became more involved in the transactions between Plainview and plaintiff. Contracts and purchase orders executed by the parties identify Plainview as the purchaser. However, in correspondence with plaintiff, Bleeker and Erde made references to Plainview and Energex, which tended to group the companies together, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1. The 14 March 2005 email from Bleeker in which he describes himself as V.P. of Business Development (Princi[pal] as well) on the Energex side of the business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2. The 27 July 2005 email from Erde seeking assurance that Plainview/Energex really gets the best possible price[.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3. The 15 February 2006 email from Bleeker referring to \"business transference and asset purchase of Plainview\" by Energex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between July and November 2005, the business relationship between the parties became antagonistic due to conflicts over payments Plainview owed to plaintiff. On 20 October 2006, plaintiff filed suit against Plainview, Energex, Erde, and Bleeker, seeking damages under the following claims for relief: (1) recovery of the balance due plus interest, under plaintiff's contracts with Plainview; (2) breach of contract; (3) unjust enrichment; and (4) piercing the corporate veil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint identified seven specific purchase orders for which plaintiff was owed \"$244,850.54 plus accrued interest[.]\" Plaintiff contended that when it tried to obtain the amounts owed under its contracts with Plainview, Bleeker told plaintiff's representatives that Energex had \"acquired the assets of Plainview and that Plainview had been dissolved.\" Bleeker asserted the purchase of Plainview's assets by Energex served to insulate Energex from any responsibility for Plainview's debt due to plaintiff. Plaintiff also alleged that during 2005 \"Erde and Bleeker repeatedly represented Energex and Plainview to be parts of the same organization, at least with regard to purchasing goods from [plaintiff.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Bleeker filed an answer admitting that he was an officer of Energex, and that personal jurisdiction was properly exercised by North Carolina. Bleeker conceded that he had \"made representations regarding the connections of Plainview and Energex[,]\" but denied specifically saying the companies were \"part of the same legal corporate organization.\" Bleeker also admitted that \"Plainview owes some amount [of money] to [plaintiff] for past due accounts.\" Bleeker denied any individual personal liability under plaintiff's claim seeking to pierce the corporate veil. Plainview filed an answer and denied the material allegations of the complaint. Plainview also filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, which it later withdrew. Neither Bleeker nor Plainview are parties to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and attached an affidavit by Erde to each motion. On 5 April 2007, the trial court denied the motions by Plainview, Energex, and Erde to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, in an order concluding in pertinent part that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2. Plaintiff has properly pleaded and alleged a claim for piercing the corporate veil against the Defendants in this Matter;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   3. This Court has personal Jurisdiction over the Defendants; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   4.

During that\n   meeting, and in other discussions, both Bleeker and Erde informed SAFT that Plainview and/or Energex was planning to bid for various large government contracts and that the company would look to SAFT to meet its increased supply needs if SAFT in turn would raise Plainview's credit limit and extend the current repayment terms[.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   (15) Accordingly, in February, 2005, Erde, Bleeker and certain SAFT representatives met in New York to discuss new credit terms and Plainview and/or Energex's increased supply needs[.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   (16) After the February, 2005 Meeting, and based on the representations made by Erde and Bleeker regarding Plainview and Energex's new business model and increased sales, SAFT raised Plainview's credit limit to $200,000 and extended repayment terms[.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   (18) Upon information and belief, between February, 2005 and December, 2005, SAFT supplied Plainview with over $1,183,000.00 worth of goods. Orders for these goods were always placed by or on behalf of Plainview, regardless of whether the goods were to be used by Plainview or Energex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   As discussed in the majority opinion, Erde admitted in his affidavit that he was the president of Energex and vice president of Plainview, and that he had visited Plaintiff's factory in North Carolina \"in [his] role as a corporate officer of Plainview Batteries, Inc.\" Erde's affidavit and the uncontroverted allegations of Plaintiff's complaint show that Plaintiff had a long-standing business relationship with Plainview; that Erde is a corporate officer of both Plainview and Engergex; that Erde visited North Carolina at least once in connection with this commercial relationship; and that Erde was personally involved in negotiating and carrying out the contracts that gave rise to the instant lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Erde's connections to North Carolina arose from his actions as officer and principal shareholder of Plainview and Energex. On this basis, Erde asserts that, because his \"alleged acts in this case were undertaken in his official capacity and not as an individual,\" he \"lacked sufficient minimum contacts to permit the exercise of personal jurisdiction over him as an individual.\" Erde contends that \"any dealings I had with Plaintiff were solely in my capacity as an officer of Plainview Batteries, Inc.\" and that without evidence that he \"committed any act in his individual capacity that was outside Plainview's alleged corporate acts in North Carolina,\" he cannot be subject to personal jurisdiction. Erde's position, which was accepted by the majority, apparently is that actions taken by an individual in the course of his employment or in his \"official\" capacity do not \"count\" as part of a defendant's contacts with the forum state. I do not believe that this correctly states the law in North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   It is certainly true that, as noted by the majority, \"personal jurisdiction over an individual officer or employee of a corporation may not be predicated merely upon the corporate contacts with the forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Robbins v.

The record indicated that \"defendant Burns had no direct involvement with the day-to-day operations of [the corporate] defendant,\" that he \"had no contact with anyone in North Carolina regarding\" the events at issue, and that \"in fact, [he] was unaware\" of these events until after they were discovered by others.

However, it is important to note that these cases did not hold either that (1) personal jurisdiction over a defendant may only be based on the contacts he has with the state in the course of his private life; or, conversely, that (2) in assessing personal jurisdiction we may not \"count\" a defendant's contacts if they were made as part of his employment. Indeed, relevant precedent consistently interprets the requirement that a defendant act in his \"individual capacity\" to mean only that he must personally have minimum contacts with North Carolina, and not that these contacts must arise from his \"personal life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   This is clearly demonstrated by this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Godwin v. Walls.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Godwin,\n   </em>\n   the nonresident individual defendant was a truck driver who was a resident of Maryland and was employed by a North Carolina trucking corporation. While operating a truck in Virginia, defendant was involved in an accident that killed two North Carolina residents. Plaintiffs sued several defendants, including the truck driver, who argued that North Carolina had no personal jurisdiction over him. This Court first considered the jurisdictional requirements of Plaintiffs' claims for wrongful death or injury to property, which require that a defendant's tortious conduct occur in North Carolina. The accident occurred while defendant was working for a North Carolina company. However, this Court held that because the status of the company could not be imputed to him, North Carolina lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant as regards the claims requiring in-state actions. In contrast, jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium, although requiring injury to a North Carolina plaintiff, do not require that the claims be based on tortious conduct occurring in the state. Consequently, this Court held that personal jurisdiction could properly be exercised over defendant for these claims, based on actions personally taken by the defendant:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   [T]he emphasis upon the agency relationship ignores the issue for resolution in this appeal, namely, the exercise of personal jurisdiction by North Carolina courts over [the individual defendant], not [his corporate employer.] While a corporate entity is liable for any wrongful act or omission of an agent acting with proper authority, it does not follow an agent may be held liable under the jurisdiction of our courts for acts\n   or omissions allegedly committed by the corporation.... [P]laintiffs may not assert jurisdiction over a corporate agent without some affirmative act committed in his individual official capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <em>\n    Godwin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11918298\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/118/341/#p348\">\n    118 N.C.App. at 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=455%20S.E.2d%20473\">\n    455 S.E.2d at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

When the nonresident individual defendant contested personal jurisdiction, this Court upheld the exercise of personal jurisdiction, based upon the defendant's commercial transactions with the plaintiffs:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Here, defendant has engaged in sufficient contacts with North Carolina. He entered into a contract with North Carolina residents that those residents executed in North Carolina.... By negotiating within the state and entering into a contract with North Carolina residents, defendant purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within North Carolina with the benefits and protection of its laws.

In particular, the corporate actions of a defendant who is also an officer and principal shareholder of a corporation are imputed to him for purposes of deciding the issue of personal jurisdiction. On the other hand, personal jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   be based solely on a defendant's employment status as the agent or officer of a company with ties to North Carolina, or on personal connections to North Carolina that fall short of the requisite \"minimum contacts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Centura Bank v. Pee Dee Express,\n   </em>\n   this Court considered four individual nonresident defendants. All four had signed personal guarantees for loans pertaining to the subject of the lawsuit. Two were also officers of the company involved in the suit and had additional contacts with North Carolina. The other two were the spouses of these defendants, with no other contact besides the loan guarantees. This Court first noted:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   At the outset we note our Supreme Court has held \"where ... defendant is a principal shareholder of the corporation and conducts business in North Carolina as principal agent for the corporation, then his corporate acts may be attributed to him for the purpose of determining whether the courts of this State may assert personal jurisdiction over him.\" In the present case [the individual defendants] were officers and the only two shareholders in Pee Dee.... Therefore, [their] corporate acts ... can be imputed to them for the purpose of determining if they had sufficient minimum contacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    Centura Bank,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11914175\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/119/210/\">\n    119 N.C.App. at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=458%20S.E.2d%2015\">\n    458 S.E.2d at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Buying Group,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8567856\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/296/510/#p515\">\n    296 N.C. at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=251%20S.E.2d%20610\">\n    251 S.E.2d at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (citations omitted). The Court held that jurisdiction was properly exercised over the corporate actors with business activity in North Carolina, but not over their wives who merely signed a guarantee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   It is undisputed that Erde (1) was an officer and principal shareholder in both Plainview and Energex; (2) visited North Carolina at least once to conduct business with Plaintiff; and (3) negotiated the terms of pertinent contracts and was otherwise personally involved in the transactions at issue. \"The courts of this State are open to defendant for protection of his activities and to enforce the valid obligations which [Plaintiff] assumed by reason of the contract. The contract was to be performed in North Carolina and has a substantial connection with the State. Applying to these facts the law as\n   interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States, [I would] hold that assumption of\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over defendant by the courts of this State does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice within the contemplation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that defendant's contacts with the State are sufficient to satisfy due process requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Chadbourn, Inc. v.
