He received the money, in 1828, and on being called on for the money, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>1850, he denied having received it. This action being commenced in 1850, he relied on the statute of limitations as a bar. The plaintiff was nonsuited, at the trial, on that defense, and he appealed to this court.,</summary>\n<court data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b633-11\">[Cortland General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A2M\">September 14, 1852.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aa1\"><em>Mason, Shankland, Gray </em>and <em>Crippen, </em>Justices.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b633-5\"><em>W.

Hoyt, (5 Hill, 395,) establishes the doctrine that the duty of an agent, to receive money and pay it over, is broken if he does not pay it over in a reasonable time; and that an action will lie against him without a demand. The case of a foreign factor, and perhaps that of an attorney at law, are the only exceptions the case recognizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The defendant was not an attorney at law, and is not within the reason of the rule which exempts them from an action, without a previous demand. The statute of limitations was a valid defense to this action. Although the defendant may have acted dishonestly, by denying the receipt of the money, yet that is a matter of conscience, with which the court has nothing to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The defendant did not stand in the relation of a trustee, so as to deprive him of the benefit of the statute. (15 <em>Wend. </em>302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
