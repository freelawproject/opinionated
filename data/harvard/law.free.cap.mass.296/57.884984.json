On May 13, 1936, the case was tried before ... [a judge] and a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-15\">\u201cThe plaintiff's declaration reads as follows: 'And the plaintiff says that on or about May 29, 1933, he was in the employ of the defendant; that it was the duty of the defendant to furnish him with suitable machinery and appliances for the proper prosecution of his work as such employee; that it was the duty of the defendant to keep such machinery and appliances in repair and proper condition; that the defendant negligently failed to so furnish and so keep in repair and condition; whereby the plaintiff, while in said employ, and while in the exercise of due care and diligence, was injured, and suffered great bodily pain and mental anguish, and paid out large sums of money for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>medicines and medical attendance.\u2019 The answer is a general denial and contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to prove that the plaintiff was a journeyman painter in the employ of the defendant, a master painter. On the day of the accident, May 29, 1933, while the plaintiff and two other painters were working on a staging painting the outside of a house, a nut on the end of a bolt slipped its thread because of the rusty condition thereof, causing the bolt to slip through the end of the \u2018spreader,\u2019 thereby causing one end of the staging to fall, and in consequence the plaintiff fell to the ground, a distance of about fifteen feet, and sustained the injury complained of. There was other evidence tending to show the defendant\u2019s negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s due care. No written notice was given by the plaintiff to the defendant of the time, place and cause of the injury. Shortly after the accident, the defendant came to the scene of the accident and inspected the details thereof. This bill of exceptions contains all the evidence material to the issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cAt the close of the evidence, the defendant made a motion for a directed verdict, which was allowed and the . . . [plaintiff\u2019s] exception was duly saved. Before the allowance of the motion, the parties agreed and stipulated that if the case should have been submitted to the jury, judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff for $1000, otherwise for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The direction of a verdict for the defendant was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The defendant contends that on the evidence the \u201cnotice of the time, place and cause of the injury\u201d required by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 153, \u00a7 6, for the maintenance of an action under the employers\u2019 liability law (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 153, \u00a7 1), was not given. He contends also that the provision of St. 1935, c. 387, added by amendment to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 153, \u00a7 6, that \u201cWant of notice as required by this section shall not bar proceedings if it is shown that the employer, or any agent of the employer exercising superintendence, had knowledge of the injury, or if it is found as a fact that the employer was not prejudiced by such want of notice,\u201d is inapplicable because the accident occurred before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>this amendment took effect. These contentions are based on the assumption that this is an action under the employers\u2019 liability law. We do not discuss them for we are of opinion that this is an action at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The employers\u2019 liability law, first enacted as St. 1887, c. 270, and now embodied in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 153, \u00a7 1, and related sections, does not take away from an employee any cause of action which he had at common law. Even if a case is within the terms of the statute an employee may, if he chooses, bring an action at common law subject to the principles of law governing such actions. And the statutory requirement of notice, or excuse therefor, is not applicable to an action at common law. <em>Ryalls </em>v. <em>Mechanics\u2019 Mills, </em>150 Mass. 190, 193, 196. <em>Clare </em>v. <em>New York &amp; New England Railroad, </em>172 Mass. 211, 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The declaration does not purport to be a declaration under the statute. It does not refer expressly to the statute, follow closely the language of the statute or contain all the allegations essential to a declaration under the statute. See <em>Steffe </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, </em>156 Mass. 262, 263. It cannot rightly be said that this plaintiff \u201cinsists on relying upon the statute alone.\u201d <em>Ryalls </em>v. <em>Mechanics\u2019 Mills, </em>150 Mass. 190, 196. On the other hand the declaration alleges in substance all the essential elements of a cause of action at common law for personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence in failing to furnish the plaintiff \u201cwith suitable machinery and appliances for the proper prosecution of his work\u201d as an employee of the defendant and in failing to \u201ckeep such machinery and appliances in repair and proper condition.\u201d See <em>McPhail </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>280 Mass. 113, 118, and cases cited. Purely formal objections to the declaration, if any, not having been raised by demurrer, were waived by the defendant by going to trial on the merits. <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>170 Mass. 419, 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The evidence specifically set forth in the bill of exceptions warranted a finding that the plaintiff, while in the employ of the defendant, sustained a personal injury caused by a defective bolt or nut in a staging used by him in the course of his employment. This evidence with the evidence sum-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u2022manly described as \u201cother evidence tending to show the defendant\u2019s negligence\u201d warranted a finding that the defendant was negligent as alleged in the declaration. And the evidence did not require a finding that the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of injury or was guilty of contributory negligence. Indeed, as summarily stated in the bill of exceptions, there was \u201cevidence tending to show . . . the plaintiff\u2019s due care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">It follows that, though it must be taken that the verdict was directed by the judge with the declaration before him and in view of its averments <em>(Brasslavsky </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated </em>Railway, 250 Mass. 403, 404), such direction of a verdict for the defendant cannot be supported on the ground that a verdict for the plaintiff on the declaration was not warranted by the evidence. The case should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In accordance with the agreement of the parties judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff for $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
