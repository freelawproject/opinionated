Gardiner, niece of the testator, by paragraph \u201cA\u201d of the trust set forth in the sixth item of the will of John P. Hazlett, late of Boston, became payable out of principal when the income proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>insufficient. The Probate Court has held that the annuity is chargeable upon income alone and that resort cannot be had to the principal to make up past deficiencies. We incline to the view that this ruling was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The sixth item of the will establishes a trust of the entire residue of the estate for purposes specified in successive lettered paragraphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Paragraph \u201cA\u201d reads: \u201cTo keep the same safely invested, and ... to pay unto the said Elizabeth K. Gardner the sum of three thousand (3000) dollars per year by equal quarterly payments for and during the term of her natural life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Paragraph \u201cB\u201d provides for the payment of $65 a month to Nellie Kiley, the testator\u2019s housekeeper, during her fife and that she shall have a right to occupy the testator\u2019s homestead with the furniture and articles therein during her life, provided she shall keep the premises in repair and pay the expenses of maintenance, except taxes and insurance, which the trustee is to pay \u201cfrom the income\u201d of the trust. If Nellie Kiley should desire not to occupy the premises the trustee may sell and invest the proceeds and pay to her \u201cthe net income and interest arising therefrom.\u201d Down to this point there is no express statement as to whether the $3,000 per year payable to Elizabeth K. Gardiner or the $65 per month payable to Nellie Kiley are to come from income or from principal or from both, although the latter\u2019s life interest in the real estate and alternatively in its proceeds in the event of sale are in the nature of dispositions of usufruct or income.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">But paragraph \u201cC\u201d reads: \u201cAll the rest, and remainder of the net income arising from said trust fund, including all of said income after the death of the said Elizabeth K. Gardner and after the death of the said Nellie Kiley, or from my death, in case both the said Gardner and the said Kiley do not survive me, I direct my trustee to pay in equal shares unto the three children of my nephew, William A. Hazlett, . . . such share to each to be paid for and during the term of his natural life , . .\u201d This paragraph deals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>only with income, and its opening words as to \u201cthe rest, and remainder of the net income\u201d show that the testator has likewise had in mind only income in the provisions of paragraphs \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Paragraph \u201cD\u201d qualifies paragraph \"C\u201d in certain respects not here material.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Upon reaching paragraph \u201cE\u201d the testator for the first time, as we think, deals with the disposition of the principal by providing for the distribution of \u201csaid trust fund\u201d upon the deaths of the children of his nephew mentioned in paragraph \u201cC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">It is not necessary to recite all of the remaining details of this somewhat complicated trust. It is provided that in certain contingencies calling for payments of principal to legatees the trustee shall retain a sufficient amount to enable him to make the payments to Elizabeth K. Gardiner and to Nellie Kiley. But this is not equivalent to charging these payments upon the principal. See <em>Treadwell </em>v. <em>Cordis, 5 </em>Gray, 341, 351; <em>Tirrell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, 287 </em>Mass. 464, 469, 471. The events have not occurred which would bring those provisions into operation, and no such sums have been set apart. On the other hand, paragraph \u201cG\u201d of the trust and item \u201cNinth\u201d of the will both provide that in the event of failure of the gift to the children of the testator\u2019s nephew and subject to the rights of Nellie Kiley, if living, the trustee shall \u201cpay all said net income and interest arising from said trust fund\u201d to Elizabeth K. Gardiner, and paragraph \u201cH\u201d of the trust expressly empowers the trustee to pay to Elizabeth K. Gardiner such parts of the principal as he may deem necessary or advisable for her comfortable maintenance and support, thus adequately caring for her needs in the event that the income should prove insufficient. Moreover, paragraph \u201cH\u201d contains the further significant provision that \u201cAll payments, both of principal and of income as aforesaid shall be left solely to the discretion of my said trustee and his decision as to payments from principal or income shall be final and binding.\u201d In fact all payments which the trustee has made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>to Elizabeth K. Gardiner have been from income. There is nothing in the will which seems to us sufficient to overcome the implications arising from paragraph \u201cC,\u201d from paragraph \u201cH\u201d and from the entire structure of the trust. We think that Elizabeth K. Gardiner had no right to payments out of principal, unless the trustee in his discretion should decide to make them.</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">We have examined the many decisions cited by the appellant and by the respondent Kiley. We do not undertake to lay down any rule of law in opposition to them. This case is to be distinguished from cases where the will discloses an intent to charge a true annuity upon the fund as a whole, <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>124 Mass. 228, 236, <em>Parkhurst </em>v. <em>Ginn, </em>228 Mass. 159, 172, and even from cases where there is no express indication of the intent one way or the other, <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>169 Mass. 82, 84. An annuity may be charged upon income alone. None of the cases denies that possibility, and instances of that kind are not wanting. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>125 Mass. 83. <em>Bridge </em>v. <em>Bridge, </em>146 Mass. 373. <em>Forbush </em>v. <em>Home for Aged Women, </em>241 Mass. 433. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>266 Mass. 161. <em>Comstock </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>78 Conn. 606. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Trefouret, </em>117 Va. 186. <em>Stetfox </em>v. <em>Sugden, </em>Johns. Ch. 234. Other cases bearing upon the subject are <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>146 Mass. 501, 507, and <em>Tirrell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>287 Mass. 464, 471. The considerations which led to a different result in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Fellows, </em>131 Mass. 20, are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Costs of appeal as between solicitor and client are to be in the discretion of the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
