The answer is a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Pike and his daughter Mrs. Daw were joint tenants of the farm, upon which they lived with Mr. Daw, Pike\u2019s son-in-law. Pike died February 5, 1935. There was a contest over the appointment of an administrator for his estate. On March 14, 1935, the defendant was appointed. At the time of Pike\u2019s death he had on the farm three horses and about one thousand hens, which became assets of his estate. A few days later the supply of feed for the horses and poultry was exhausted. None of the heirs and no other person offered to assist in caring for this livestock or to furnish necessary grain, whereupon Daw with Mrs. Daw\u2019s consent ordered from the plaintiff the grain in question. \"The plaintiff looked to the estate and not to Daw for payment.\u201d The grain was delivered on February 15, February 21, March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>1 and March 9, all deliveries being after the death of Pike and before the appointment of the defendant as administrator. All the grain \u201cwas used in the reasonable feeding of the poultry and horses.\u201d Both parties seem to regard these words, quoted from the report, as meaning that the grain was so used before the defendant\u2019s appointment, and we deal with the case on that basis. The defendant was not aware of the ordering and delivery of the grain until March 30. Pike\u2019s estate was represented insolvent before this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s first count sets up a direct claim against the estate for the grain delivered and used. The second count is based upon an assignment from Mr. and Mrs. Daw to the plaintiff of any claim which they or either of them might have had against the estate on account of the grain. The plaintiff has had a verdict on each count for the full value of the grain. But as it is expressly stated that the plaintiff looked to the estate and not to Daw for payment, it is clear that neither Daw nor Mrs. Daw incurred any personal liability. It follows that neither of them under any theory of the law had any claim against the estate; that the plaintiff acquired nothing by the assignment; and that any judgment for the plaintiff must rest solely upon the verdict which has been returned on the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The question to be decided may be stated thus: Can a stranger who, under the circumstances disclosed, furnishes feed used in the necessary preservation of the livestock belonging to the insolvent estate of a deceased owner recover its value as a preferred claim from an administrator subsequently appointed?</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Broad considerations of justice favor a plaintiff who has thus not only performed an act of mercy but who has also saved for the estate assets which would otherwise have been lost. It would not be fair and just that creditors who have themselves done nothing should profit at his expense. If Pike had left a sufficient supply of grain on the farm, would it have been a wrongful interference with assets of the estate if a member of his household had continued to feed that grain to the livestock in the interval before the appointment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>of the administrator? <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Ladd, </em>114 Mass. 420, suggests that it would not be. See also <em>Brown\u2019s Administrator </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>22 Ind. 359, and cases cited in Woerner, Adm. (3d ed.) \u00a7 191. Yet the effect upon the estate is substantially the same where a member of the household procures someone to furnish grain at the expense of the estate. It would seem that the law should raise a promise based upon public policy and necessity on principles analogous to those upon which a promise is implied in favor of one who has supplied necessaries for the burial of the deceased, and that as the administrator has in no way bound himself personally by any act of his own, such liability, like that for expenses of burial, should be a direct charge upon the estate itself to be enforced by action against the administrator in his representative capacity and not in his individual capacity. See as to expenses of burial <em>Hapgood </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>10 Pick. 154; <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Muldoon, </em>139 Mass. 304; <em>Durkin </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>167 Mass. 577; <em>Joseph S. Waterman &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hook, </em>246 Mass. 522, 526; <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>280 Mass. 222, 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Such <em>quasi </em>contract binding upon the estate arises only where the need is immediate, absolute and imperative in order to preserve the estate itself and where that need would otherwise remain unsatisfied. Nothing less will justify the intervention of a stranger thus to impose a charge upon the estate outside the regular course of administration. Merely that the service performed was desirable or in some degree beneficial to the estate is not enough. It is upon this ground, we think, that the present case is to be distinguished from <em>Luscomb </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>5 Gray, 403, and <em>Yarrington </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>141 Mass. 450. It seems evident that the court in those cases and in several others, such as <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>287 Mass. 38, 45, in stating general rules, did not have in mind an exceptional case like this. <em>Mathie </em>v. <em>Hancock, 78 </em>Vt. 414, is distinguishable for similar reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">This decision is not at variance with the rule of <em>Kingman </em>v. <em>Soule, </em>132 Mass. 285, 288, under which an executor or administrator is liable personally and not in his representative capacity upon contracts made by himself. It derives further support in various aspects from <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Ela, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>5 Allen, 87, 90, <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Corcoran, </em>106 Mass. 286, <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>12 Conn. 212, 216, <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Whaley, </em>11 R. I. 543, <em>O\u2019Reilly </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>22 R. I. 151, <em>Murray\u2019s Estate, </em>56 Ore. 132, 136-138, <em>Estate of Bryant, </em>180 Penn. St. 192, and <em>Lenz </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>41 Wis. 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We are further of the opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is one of the \u201ccharges of administration\u201d which have priority over \u201cdebts\u201d under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 198, \u00a7 1. Clearly the nature of the claim would have given it that status, if the administrator himself had ordered the grain. Under the broad classification intended by the statute it is immaterial that because of peculiar circumstances the liability to which the estate is subject had its origin before his appointment. Judgment must be entered on the verdict returned by the jury on the first count. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 198, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
