L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 120. The only question is whether the evidence warranted the verdict returned by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s truck was proceeding easterly on Portland Street in Cambridge at about fifteen miles an hour, and was approaching Harvard Street, which crosses Portland Street at right angles. When the plaintiff\u2019s truck was about fifteen feet from Harvard Street, the defendant\u2019s truck, travelling in the same direction at somewhat greater speed, overtook the plaintiff\u2019s truck and went into the \u201cintersection\u201d (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 89, \u00a7 8; <em>Fournier </em>v. <em>Zinn, </em>257 Mass. 575) a little ahead of it. At the same time an automobile bearing New York registration plates was travelling southerly on Harvard Street. That automobile collided with the defendant\u2019s truck in the middle of the intersection, and then the right side of the defendant\u2019s truck collided with the left front of the plaintiff\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The defendant\u2019s servant who operated the defendant\u2019s truck testified that he had entered the intersection before he saw the New York automobile which was in the middle of Harvard Street, twenty or twenty-five feet from the intersection, travelling at twenty to twenty-five miles an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">To say nothing about speed (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 90, \u00a7 17), a majority of the court are of opinion that the jury could find the defendant\u2019s servant negligent in not seeing the New York automobile sooner than he did, even though he had the right of way under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 89, \u00a7 8. His situation was not so nearly identical with that of the operator of the plaintiff\u2019s truck that it can be ruled that both were negligent if one was. The jury could find negligence of the defendant\u2019s servant a proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s truck, even though negligence of the operator of the New York automobile contributed to the injury. <em>Feneff </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>196 Mass. 575, 581. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>212 Mass. 392, 397. <em>Meech </em>v. <em>Sewall, </em>232 Mass. 460. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Berkshire Street Railway, </em>292 Mass. 313, 315.
