Some requests by the plaintiff for rulings of law, including a request for a ruling that as \u201cmatter of law, the plaintiff was not a trespasser,\u201d were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>granted. Other requests by the plaintiff for rulings of law were refused. The judge made this specific finding: \u201cI do not find that the operator of the defendant\u2019s car was guilty of reckless and wanton conduct, but was guilty of negligence,\u201d and found for the defendant. A report to the Appellate Division was dismissed and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">According to the report \u201cthe sole issue raised by this report is whether or not the plaintiff was owed a duty greater than that owed to a trespasser. It is agreed that if the plaintiff was a trespasser, the finding for the defendant is to stand, but if the defendant owed the plaintiff a greater duty than that owed to a trespasser, the finding for the defendant is in error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The report, which \u201ccontains\u2019 all the evidence material to the questions reported,\u201d so far as it sets forth evidence or facts is as follows: \u201cIt is agreed by both parties that the metropolitan park commissioners on March 6, 1907, granted to the defendant\u2019s predecessors in accordance with the provisions of\u201d St. 1894, c. 288, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, and St. 1900, c. 413, \u00a7 1, \u201ca location of two tracks on Middlesex Fells Parkway in the reserved space between the two roadways, and that all formalities were complied with. The grant to the defendant\u2019s predecessors was of a location for two tracks, setting forth the limits at either end and the side lines thereof, and in the eighth clause the grant specifically defined the word \u2018location\u2019 as follows: \u2018The word \u201clocation\u201d shall be taken to mean herein any grass or reserved spaces within the location lies [sic] between roadways [sic] to a width not exceeding thirty two feet . . . .\u2019 The injury to the plaintiff was caused by her being struck by a street car operating on the tracks referred to in the above grant at a time when the plaintiff was between the rails of the track and was on her way from school to her home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The duty owed by the defendant to a trespasser was to refrain from injuring him by wilful, wanton or reckless conduct. <em>Santora </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>211 Mass. 464, 466, <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Union Street </em>Rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>way, </em>277 Mass. 369, 371. No greater duty was owed by the defendant to the plaintiff if she was merely a licensee. <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>234 Mass. 393, 396. <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>275 Mass. 485, 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">The report does not show that the plaintiff was in any more favorable position than that of a licensee. It is apparent from the agreement of the parties with reference to St. 1894, c. 288, that the Middlesex Fells Parkway was a \u201croadway or boulevard.\u201d See <em>Van Poppel </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>258 Mass. 389, 396. The plaintiff when struck by the defendant\u2019s car was on the defendant\u2019s location in said \u201croadway or boulevard\u201d for a purpose which was wholly unrelated to the business of the defendant. This case, therefore, is unlike the Van Poppel case where there was evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate in that case was killed on the same defendant\u2019s location on the Middlesex Fells Parkway near Fulton Street immediately after having alighted from a car operated by the defendant, and consequently it could have been found that such intestate was in a more favorable position than that of licensee as against the defendant. The plaintiff in the present case, however, was at most a licensee unless she had the rights of a traveller on a public way, a matter which depends on the nature of the defendant\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">According to the agreement of the parties the board of park commissioners granted the location to the defendant\u2019s predecessors and \u201call formalities were complied with,\u201d and this location was \u201cin the reserved space between the two roadways.\u201d The board had general authority under St. 1900, c. 413, \u201cto grant locations ... to street railways within the roads, boulevards, parks and reservations in its care and control.\u201d \u00a7 1. And since the Middlesex Fells Parkway was a \u201croadway or boulevard,\u201d under St. 1894, c. 288, \u00a7 3 (see now G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 92, \u00a7 35) the board had \u201csuch rights and powers in regard to the same as, in general, counties, cities and towns have over public ways under their control,\u201d which include the power and right under St. 1894, c. 324, \u00a7 1 (see now G. L. [Ter. Ed.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>c. 82, \u00a7 34, as amended by St. 1935, c. 309), to \u201creserve between the side lines thereof . . . special space for the use of street railways.\u201d The authority of the board to reserve space for the use of the defendant\u2019s street railway was ample. See <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Metropolitan District Commission, </em>270 Mass. 377, 379. Though the terms of the grant of the location are not set out in the report in full, the definition of \u201clocation\u201d in the grant which is set out in the report, and the agreement of the parties that the location granted to the defendant is \u201cin the reserved space between the two roadways,\u201d naturally import that the defendant\u2019s location was \u201ca special or reserved space set apart\u201d for its use under statutory authority and \u201cdistinguished from the remainder of the . . . [\u201croadway or boulevard\u201d] which was open to the use of the general public.\u201d <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>234 Mass. 393, 396. See also <em>Treen </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>253 Mass. 605. In <em>Van Poppel </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>258 Mass. 389, it was unnecessary to decide whether the defendant\u2019s location in the Middlesex Fells Parkway was a \u201cspecial space\u201d reserved for use of the defendant\u2019s street railway, but that case is not an authority to the contrary. See page 397. In the absence of special circumstances, a pedestrian crossing such a reserved space for a purpose unrelated to the business of the street railway does not have the rights of a traveller on a public way, but at most is a licensee. <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>234 Mass. 393. <em>Treen </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>253 Mass. 605. <em>Fernald </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>260 Mass. 78. <em>LaBelle </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>265 Mass. 482. <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>275 Mass. 485, 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">No special circumstances are shown taking this case out of the usual rule. No facts are set forth in the report tending to show that there was an established crosswalk at the place where the plaintiff attempted to cross the defendant\u2019s location or that the defendant invited or induced the plaintiff to cross at that place or, \u201cwith full knowledge of the facts, had acquiesced in and assented to the use ... by the public\u201d of that part of its location for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>such crossing. Compare <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>226 Mass. 87, 90-91. See <em>LaBelle </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>265 Mass. 482, 484-486.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
