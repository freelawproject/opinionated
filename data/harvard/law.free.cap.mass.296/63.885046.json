There was sufficient evidence to support the finding of the Industrial Accident Board that the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the employee for which the board has allowed compensation resulted from an injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The record discloses a mass of evidence, chiefly from medical experts on each side and highly contradictory. It is not our province to determine its weight. The finding must stand if it can be supported on any rational view of the evidence. <em>Jameson\u2019s Case, </em>254 Mass. 371. <em>De Pietro\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 381, 384. We shall therefore confine ourselves to an abbreviated summary of that portion of the evidence favorable to the employee which we deem adequate as a legal basis for the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The deceased employee went to work for the employer as a \u201cwire drawer\u201d in 1919. The room where he worked was very hot, and the air was full of dust so that sometimes he could not see anybody. He was exposed to much dust from wire coated with lime and wire covered with rust. He was exposed to dust from powdered soap. The room was full of lime dust. His clothes, face and mouth were covered with dust. Except for an attack of pneumonia in 1924, from which he recovered, the employee was well until 1930, when his health began to fail. He had difficulty in breathing. He had choking spells that lasted for hours. He complained of a tired feeling in his chest. From time to time he was unable to work. He last worked August 4, 1932, and after that was unable to work at all. He died February 12,' 1934. The family physician who treated the deceased and also a specialist in diseases of the chest who examined him before his death stated his physical condition in detail and both testified that in their opinion he was suffering from emphysema, which was described as \u201cdilation of the alveoli of the lungs,\u201d causing enlargement, destroying elasticity and resulting in atrophy of the wall, that this was caused by the inhalation of dust, and that death resulted from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">We discover nothing in the cross-examination of the claimants\u2019 experts or elsewhere in the record which amounted to a withdrawal of these opinions or which precluded the board from giving full weight to them. And it would be going much too far for us to rule that the conclusions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>board are vitiated merely because the single member who first heard the evidence may have been mistaken in stating that only two of the medical witnesses \u201chad an opportunity to examine the man during his lifetime,\u201d even if by the most strict construction of the record this was one of the \u201cfindings\u201d which the reviewing board affirmed and adopted. This is not enough to show that the reviewing board failed to give due consideration to the testimony of all the witnesses.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">This case is similar to a number of cases in which it has been held that a gradual accumulation of foreign material in the employee\u2019s system due to the conditions of his employment, causing definite physical harm, may be found to have brought about a compensable injury sustained at the time when the employee became unable to work. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 388. <em>O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 164. <em>Bergeron\u2019s Case, </em>243 Mass. 366. <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 497. <em>Fabrizio\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 352. <em>Langford\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 461. <em>De Filippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531. <em>Minns\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 459. <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>288 Mass. 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">2. No notice of injury was given as required by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 41. The board found, however, that the insurer was not prejudiced by want of notice. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 44. This finding was also supported by the evidence. It could be found that the employer knew the conditions of the employment. There was evidence that many times before August 4, 1932, the employee\u2019s foreman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>had been informed that the employee was unable to work and that \u201cthe job was very bad for him\u201d (see <em>Bloom\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 434); that the employee told the foreman about his condition and begged for a change of work; that within a week before the employee ceased work he was examined with reference to his lungs at the employer\u2019s \u201cHospital Department\u201d and that a record was made of the condition found and that on August 4 \u201cthe doctor at the shop\u201d said that the employee \u201ccouldn\u2019t work any more\u201d and sent him home. The employee filed a claim for compensation September 30, 1932, upon which apparently no hearing was held. The employee received medical and hospital treatment. The record shows that full and complete medical evidence was available to the insurer. The board could reasonably believe that the insurer\u2019s opportunity to gather and to preserve proof with respect to the other factors in the case, such as the amount and character of the dust to which the employee was exposed over the long period of years involved, was as good upon the filing of a claim in September, 1932, as it would have been if notice had been given in August of that year. Nothing depended upon immediate notice of a single occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\">The board found that the employee\u2019s condition \u201cwas better known to the employer than it was to the employee himself.\u201d If, as the insurer contends, this is not in itself quite equivalent to an express finding that the insured \u201c had knowledge of the injury\u201d (\u00a744), nevertheless we think that in view of the knowledge which could have been found to have been available to both the insured and the insurer of the employee\u2019s condition, and of its connection with his employment, his dismissal on order of the employer\u2019s physician, and the actual filing of a claim within less than two months after the employee ceased work, it cannot be said that there was no evidence at all to support the finding which the board did make that the failure to give formal notice as soon as practicable had not prejudiced the insurer. <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 36. <em>Gerald\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 229, 232. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 481, 484. <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>288 Mass. 96, 101. This case is distinguishable from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>Kangas\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 155, <em>Booth\u2019s Case, </em>289 Mass. 322, and <em>Hatch\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">3. The insurer in its brief has argued that certain evidence was wrongly admitted by the single member of the board who first heard the case. Without implying that there was any error in the rulings of the single member, it is enough now to say that the record does not show that these questions were pressed before the reviewing board, and therefore the Superior Court was not required to consider them. <em>Minns\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 459, 467. <em>Di Clavio\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 259, 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\"> The foregoing portion of the opinion relates to an argument by the insurer based on the following portion of the findings by the single member: \u201cThere is a wealth of medical testimony to be considered. The claimants produced two doctors, Dr. Michalski and Dr. Stivers. The insurer in presenting its case had a parade of medical experts, each an outstanding authority in his particular field. Of all the doctors who testified, however, on either side, only two of them had an opportunity to examine the man during his lifetime and only two were present at the autopsy that was performed. Dr. Stivers was the only doctor who examined the man during his lifetime and was also present at the autopsy. With this situation in mind I am unable to give as much weight to the testimony offered by medical experts in answer to hypothetical questions as I do to that of the doctors who examined him during his lifetime or who were present at the autopsy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">As to the foregoing findings, the insurer in his brief argued: \u201cThis specific portion of the finding clearly refers to the claimant's two doctors as being the two who examined the claimant during his lifetime, as otherwise the reference to the comparative weight which he gave testimony based on answers to hypothetical questions would be meaningless.\u201d \u2014 Reporter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
