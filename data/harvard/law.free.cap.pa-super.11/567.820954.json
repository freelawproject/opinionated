May 4, 1899, petition for rehearing filed. May 6, 1899, petition dismissed.

We see no error in this record. It has been held repeatedly that the judge need not set forth on the record his reason for refusing a license (see Netter\u2019s Appeal, ante, p. 566 and cases \u2022.there cited), also that the court is not confined in its investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>gation to the objections stated in the remonstrance. In Com. v. Kerns, 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 59, -where the remonstrance was precisely the same as in this, our Brother Oblady, speaking for the court, said : \u201c The reasons for the decree are not given, nor is it necessary that they should be on the record. In its investigation the court would not be limited by, nor confined to, the objections stated in the remonstrances. Under our license system, the legislature has imposed on the court of quarter sessions the duty of hearing and acting upon these applications; the power to judicially grant or refuse is lodged there. . Tfie legal presumption is that the matter was considered and decided within the statutory provisions; and that after a hearing resulting in a refusal of the license there was a legal reason for the decree.\u201d All the questions raised on the argument of the appeal were fully considered in the case cited, and it is unnecessary to discuss them further.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
