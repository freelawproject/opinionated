February 28, 1899, a general order of court Telating to hearings and providing that old licenses should be renewed where there is-no specific remonstrance. March 3, 1899, remonstrance filed.

The presumption is, that the petitioner was accorded a full hearing and that the license was refused for a legal reason. There is nothing on the record to show the contrary. The affidavits filed in support of the petition for a rehearing are nut part of the record and the facts therein alleged cannot be considered by us. An application for a rehearing is like a motion for a new trial, and a refusal thereof is ordinarily not reviewable on appeal. There is nothing in this case to take it out of the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
