Defendant offered in evidence the contract between defendant company and plaintiff and offered evidence tending to show a set-off. The magistrate entered judgment for the plaintiff for the amount of the claim $4.40. Defendant filed exceptions' to the magistrate\u2019s record which were dismissed by the court below. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-12\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in dismissing exceptions to magistrate\u2019s transcript and confirming the judgment of the magistrate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-13\"><em>W.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">By the 22d section of the Act of March 20, 1810, 5 Sm. L. 161, the judgment of the common pleas upon certiorari to the judgment of a justice of the peace in actions brought under that act was final, \u201c and,\u201d to quote the language of the act, \u201c no writ of error shall issue thereon.\u201d \" This was not changed by the Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 158, nor by the Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 212, establishing this court and defining its jurisdiction: Colwyn v. Tarbotton, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 179. The question was fully considered in that case-and we need not go over the ground again. It is true the act of 1810 refers, in terms, to justices of the peace only, but as was said in Spicer v. Rees, 5 R. 119, of the finality of the judgment of the common pleas on certiorari to the judgment of the mayor in civil actions, so it may be said of magistrates in Philadelphia, they are \u201c clothed with no other jurisdiction than that of an alderman who is virtually a justice, and whose proceedings can be dealt with by the courts of record only as such.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">The appeal is quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
