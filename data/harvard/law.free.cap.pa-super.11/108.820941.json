The lease was for the term of one year from September 18, 1896, and included the following clauses : \u201c A lawful continuance. of the tenancy of said term shall be deemed a renewal thereof for the further term of one year, to end at the expiration thereof without further notice and every further lawful continuance shall be deemed a further renewal for a like term, to end in like manner. And every renewal to hold over shall be subject to the provisions of this indenture.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-6\">The last clause in this lease was this: \u201c The notice to quit required by an act of assembly previous to proceedings to recover possession of the demised premises, and the benefits of the laws granting stay of execution, appeal, inquisition on real estate or exemption of property upon sale and execution or distress for rent, are hereby waived by the said party of the second part; \u201d that was by Russett.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-7\">After September 18, .1897, the landlord gave notice that he demanded immediate possession and there was some evidence of an arrangement between the parties that the tenant might remain there for a short time, and then go out. This the tenant failed to do and the proceedings recited were instituted. It also appears that at the la\u00a7t settlement of rent the landlord was paid two months\u2019 rent more than was necessary to pay the first year\u2019s rent, which he testified was taken under mistake of both parties supposing it was due and paid in settlement to the first of the year. The landlord stated positively that he did not rent the property to the tenant for the following year and did not receive the extra payment to apply on the second year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-8\">The defendant submitted the following points :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-9\">[1. The lease in this case providing that a lawful continuance of the tenant in possession, beyond the year served to extend the term for another year, and so on indefinitely, it was necessary, notwithstanding a waiver of notice to quit, for the plaintiff to give the usual three months\u2019 notice, or at the very least, some notice to the tenant before the expiration of any one year, in order to put himself in position to- dispossess the tenant, by proceedings under the act of December 14,1863. <em>Anstver: </em>Under the facts of this case and the terms of the lease we cannot affirm this point.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>[3.

E. </em>Shaffer, of <em>Shaffer &amp; </em>Shaffer, and <em>J. W. </em>Bouton, of <em>Bouton </em>Gallup, for appellee. ^</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AYv\">W. D. Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">This was a proceeding, under the Act of December 14, 1863, P. L. (1864) 1125, to recover possession of demised premises. There are two questions presented by the specifications of error, first, Was the landlord required, under the terms of the lease, to give notice, prior to the expiration of the term, to the tenant to quit, in order to be entitled to proceed under this act ? Second, Was there any evidence of a renewal of the lease which ought to have been submitted to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The lease under which the defendant came into possession of the premises contained this covenant: \u201c The notice to quit required by any act of assembly previous to proceedings to recover possession of the demised premises is hereby waived by the said party of the second part.\u201d This rendered it unnecessary for the landlord to give notice to quit prior to the end of the term: Hutchinson v. Potter, 11 Pa. 472 ; Wilgus v. Whitehead, 89 Pa. 131. Immediately upon the expiration of the term the landlord demanded possession, and there was no lawful continuance of the tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">There was no evidence whatever of a renewal of the lease. The contention of the defendant that the plaintiff accepted rent for two months of a new term has no foundation in the testimony. She testifies that the landlord demanded two months\u2019 rent, which he explicitly asserted was in arrear for the term which had expired, and the tenant complied with the demand and paid the amount. An examination of the account disclosed that the landlord had demanded rent which had already been paid. The defendant then asserted the right to create a new term, by applying the money so paid to rent which would have accrued after the expiration of the original term. The money so paid under a mistake of fact may be recovered. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>clear, upon defendant\u2019s own showing, that she knew when she paid the amount that the landlord believed she was paying rent for the term which had expired and that he received it upon that account. After the mistake was discovered, the landlord tendered the money back. The defendant now seeks to establish the right to a new term, by making an application of the payment different from that which was made by the parties at the time of the transaction; this she cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The plaintiff was entitled to binding instructions, under the evidence, and the grounds upon which the learned court below put such instructions did the appellant no harm: Wilcox v. Montour Iron Company, 147 Pa. 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
