The compensation of county commissioners is fixed by the Acts of May 7, 1889, P. L. 109, and May 13, 1889, P. L. 200, at a per diem compensation for the time actually and necessarily employed in the discharge of the duties of their office, allowance being made for traveling expenses necessarily incurred in the discharge of official duties. Hence it follows that commissioners were properly surcharged with hotel bills and railroad fares on attendance on a state convention of county commissioners. Attendance on such convention may be of marked public advantage but is not involved in the cause of business growing out of the management of county affairs, and is not directly provided for by statute. No allowance is made by law for hotel bills of commissioners even when engaged on strictly county business, only the bare cost of transportation is contemplated and this not as between the commissioner\u2019s home and his office.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Argued Feb. 17, 1899.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ab18\">Appeal, No. 23, Feb T., 1899, by defendant, from judgment of C.

Is the defendant entitled to credit for his personal expenses paid for meals and lodging at hotels while necessarily away from home and the commissioners \u2019 office transacting the business of the county?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-11\">2.

Is the defendant entitled to $3.50 per day for his time while attending said convention ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-13\">In Mansel v. Nicely, 175 Pa. 367, the question of county commissioners\u2019 compensation per day and the expenses which they may charge while absent from their office in the discharge of their official duties was considered. The act of May 7,1889, allowed the county commissioners to be paid out of the county funds the sum of $3.50 each, for each and every day actually and necessarily employed in the discharge of the duties of their office. This act was intended to cover all the charges and expenses of the county commissioners and to include their traveling expenses. But on May 13, 1889, P. L. 200, the legislature passed another act which provides that \u201c from and after the passage of this act directors of the poor and county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>commissioners of this commonwealth shall be allowed their traveling expenses necessarily incurred in the discharge of their official duties,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-4\">On page 376, Mr. Justice Fell, speaking for the court, says: \u201c All general laws upon the subject were repealed by the act of May 7, 1889. Two acts relating to the same subject were passed in the same year. The act of May 7 fixes the compensation of county commissioners at $3.50 per day, and provides: That the pay allowed by this act shall be in lieu of all other compensation and charges for the individual services and expenses of said commissioners. The act of May 13th allows county commissioners their traveling expenses necessarily incurred in the discharge of their official duties. It will be observed that the first act allows nothing for individual services and expenses, and the second act allows traveling expenses incurred in the discharge of official duties. For the purposes of construction, as these acts relate to kindred subjects and were passed within a week of each other, the entire scope of the legislation should be considered. The second act does not repeal any part of the first, but supplies something for which it had not provided. The first act took away the right of all allowance for individual expenses; the second conferred the right to traveling' expenses. It supplied an omission in the first act. An implied repeal is a question of intention, and the presumption against the intention to repeal is strengthened by the fact that both acts were under consideration by the legislature at the same time. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">\u201c Whenever the official duties of the commissioner call him from his home or his office to different parts of the county, or it may be of the state, his traveling expenses are incurred in the performance of an official duty, and he is entitled to an allowance for them under the act of May 13. Such an expense, we think, is the only one within the meaning of the act. The purpose of the legislation to exclude ail individual expenses and to allow only for traveling expenses incurred in the discharge of an official duty seems to be clear.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-6\">Now, when we turn to page 371 and find that the court below held that all the commissioner is entitled to charge in addition to his per diem is the actual .amount of traveling expenses, and that it would not cover his meals at the hotels, we are forced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>to the conclusion that this case does rule [that the commissioner cannot be allowed credit for hotel bills while away from his home and office on official business.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\">We are free to say that without the Nicely case we would have reached a different conclusion as to the acts of May 7 and 13, 1889. Our own conclusion would have been that when the legislature provided that the commissioner should be paid $3.50 per day and his traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of official duties, transportation, meals and lodging would have been included. . If I should employ a man to visit New York to transact business for me, agreeing to pay him $10.00 per day and traveling expenses, I think the law would compel me to pay his transportation and proper hotel bills. But while this exact point was not raised, discussed and decided specifically in the Nicely case, yet rightly interpreted, the decision of the lower court and of the Supreme Court seems to exclude meals and lodgings from traveling expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">And now, to wit: January 18,1899, upon due consideration the exceptions are all dismissed, except so much of the fifth and sixth exceptions as complain of the imposition of costs upon the defendant, which are sustained, because the judgment or decision is more favorable to the appellant than the report of the auditors, and therefore, let judgment be entered against the defendant as per decision filed December 12, 1898, with costs against the county of McKean: Act of April 14,1838, P.

L. 109, and Act of May 13, 1889, P. L. 200, sec. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The act of May 13, 1889, supra, gave the commissioners traveling expenses incurred in the discharge of their official duties, so the question for consideration is, What are traveling expenses ? Our contention is that the term \u201c traveling expenses,\u201d within the meaning of the act of May 13, supra, includes not only actual cost of transportation, but all other expenses necessarily incurred by the commissioner from the time he leaves the office on the business of the county until he returns, and necessarily includes meals en route and necessary hotel accommodations at the place away from the office where it is necessary for the commissioner to go to transact the business of the county devolving on him by virtue of his office. Any other construction would exclude a county commissioner from being reimbursed for money paid for horse feed while driving his own horse in going from place to place on county business, and would also mean that a county commissioner receiving $3.50 per day must pay out of his own pocket from $2.00 to $3.00 per day for hotel bills while away from his office on county business, thus leaving him for his services the paltry sum of from fifty cents to $1.50 per day. It also means that the business of the county which can for the interest of the taxpayers best be done by the commissioners in person, will be delegated to a great extent to others, who will be paid for their time and expenses by the county, while the commissioners remain in their office and draw their pay in full.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-5\">Two questions of importance are raised by the assignments of error in Mansel v. Nicely, 175 Pa. 367. One relates to the right of the appellee, a county commissioner of Lycoming county, to the allowance of $3.50 per day for each of the 306 days on which he was in attendance at his office, and the other to the allowance of the daily expenses of travel from his home to his office. Nothing else was discussed in that case and nothing else was considered or decided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-6\">His traveling expenses are incurred in the performance of an official duty, and he is entitled to an allowance for them under the act of May 13.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-7\">\u201c Traveling expenses necessarily incurred,\u201d used in the act of May 13, 1889, means such sums as the officer is necessarily obliged to pay out for his transportation and board while away from his office engaged in the business of the county.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The case of Reuben Withers v.

The defendant claimed for hotel bills incurred while in New York on firm business. The action was a bill for an accounting.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-5\"><em>Rufus B. </em>Stone, with him <em>Thomas F. </em>Richmond, county solicitor, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9A\">1.

Manifestly it is not: Dillon on Municipal Corporations (2d ed. 1873), sec. 172; Bussier v. Pray, 7 S. &amp; R. 447; Kilpatrick v.

Nicely, 175 Pa. 367.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AsFj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>October 9, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-4\">2. By the Act of May 13, 1889, P. L. 200, \u201ctraveling expenses necessarily incurred in the discharge of their official duties \u2019\u2019were distinguished and excepted. This act was passed only a week later than the one first above mentioned, which excludes all \u201c individual expenses.\u201d Both acts were pending at the same time. Hence if there had been no purpose to except traveling expenses distinguished from hotel bills, the end would in due course of legislation have been reached by simply striking out of the first act the word \u201c expenses.\u201d The first act was not amended and the second is therefore in the nature of a proviso. The word \u201c traveling \u201d if it has any significance, qualifies, defines and limits the character of the expenses excepted, and restricts them to cost of transportation. It means expenses peculiarly incident to travel. Meals and lodging' are not. The word \u201c mileage \u201d is defined by the lexicographer as \u201c fees paid for travel by the mile.\u201d Hence it is not synonymous with our interpretation of the term \u201c traveling expenses,\u201d and the suggestion of counsel for appellant that it would have been used to express such interpretation is not borne out. Nor would the term \u201c railroad fare \u201d be sufficiently comprehensive, for travel within the county for the inspection of bridges and public work might often be by the highway.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">The first act took away the right of allowance for all individual expenses; the second conferred the right to traveling expenses: Mansel v. Nicely, 175 Pa. 367.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Auq\">Smith, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The items of surcharge here complained of consist of hotel bills, attendance on a state convention of county commissioners held at Gettysburg, and railroad fare on such attendance. The controversy is with respect to the liability of the county for these items.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The obligation of the county to compensate its officers is wholly statutory. Unless it is created by statute, either in express terms or by necessary implication, it does not exist. \u201c An officer derives equally his authority and his compensation from the law, and when both are defined in the law, he can no more enlarge the one than the other: \u201d Brown v. Com., 2 R. 40. \u201c Where a positive law prescribes the manner and nature of the payment to be made to an officer, the directions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>law are and ought to be the only rule: \u201d Brown v. Com., 2 R. <em>40; </em>Albright v. County, 106 Pa. 582. Hence, to determine the question arising here, we have only to ascertain the authority of the county commissioners in the premises, and the compensation fixed by law for its exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">A county is a quasi corporation, and its corporate powers .are to be exercised by the commissioners: Kittanning Academy v. Brown, 41 Pa. 269; Act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 537, secs. 3, 4. Except on a few points, the powers of the commissioners are not expressly or directly defined by statute. But,' as public agents of the county, exercising its corporate powers, their authority must necessarily be commensurate with the scope of their duties in the premises: Van Kirk v. Clark, 16 S. &amp; R. 286. We cannot, however, regard their duties as requiring their attendance on a state convention of county commissioners. It may be conceded that a conference of the county commissioners of the state may prove of marked advantage, from an exchange of views, a comparison of experiences, of methods, and of results. But it is not involved hi the course of business growing out of the management of county affairs, and is not directly provided for by statute. Commissioners are selected, presumably, in view of their ability to perform the duties pertaining to the \u25a0office, and in the absence of legislative authority they cannot be permitted to further qualify themselves at the expense of the county. The surcharge for expenses incurred in attending the convention is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The compensation of county commissioners is fixed by the Acts of May 7, 1889, P. L. 109, and May 13, 1889, P. L. 200. The former provides a per diem compensation of $3.50 for the time \u25a0\u201c actually and necessarily employed in the discharge of the duties of their office,\u201d with a proviso that this \u201c shall be in lieu \u25a0of all other compensation and charges for the individual services and expenses of said commissioners.\u201d The latter act provides that, in the absence of any local law on the subject, commissioners \u201c shall be allowed their traveling expenses necessarily incurred in the discharge of their official duties.\u201d In Mansel v. Nicely, 175 Pa. 367, it was held that this applied \u25a0only to traveling expenses incurred by a commissioner \u201c when his official duties call him from his home or his office to different parts of the county, or it may be of the state,\u201d and did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>include the expense incurred in going from his home to his-office, and returning.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The hotel bills, though incurred in the transaction of county business, cannot be regarded as part of the traveling expenses for which the statute provides. A charge for board, while-transacting county business at the county seat, is not a \u201ctraveling expense \u201d within the meaning of the act, and a charge for board while transacting business elsewhere stands on no different footing. We regard the statute as providing only for the cost of transportation; the cost of subsistence, wherever-incurred, is provided for by salary or a per diem compensation.. The scale of living is peculiarly a personal matter, and varies-so largely, with the tastes and habits of individuals, that a satisfactory standard cannot well be established. The law therefore leaves each to fix it at his own discretion and at his own expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The balance found by the auditors, in favor of the county, and against the appellant, was $49.77. An item, however, of $17.50, surcharged by the auditors, was allowed by the court, reducing the balance to $82.27, and the judgment should be-for this amount. Thus modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
