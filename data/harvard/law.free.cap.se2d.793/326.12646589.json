POWELL\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Raheem Chabezz Johnson (\"Johnson\") appeals the trial court's refusal to appoint a neuropsychologist at the Commonwealth's expense to assist in the preparation of his presentence report\n   pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A). Johnson further takes issue with the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the trial court's decision to impose a life sentence. According to Johnson, the life sentence imposed by the trial court was in violation of the Eighth Amendment because the trial court failed to afford him the opportunity to present evidence about youth and its attendant characteristics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 11, 2011, Johnson shot and killed Timothy Irving. At the time, Johnson was two months short of his eighteenth birthday. On June 1, 2011, Johnson was indicted on eight felonies, including capital murder. After his indictment but before trial, the United States Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). As a result, the Commonwealth amended the indictment to reduce the capital murder charge to first degree murder. A jury subsequently convicted Johnson of all eight felonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court ordered a presentence report and continued the matter for sentencing. On August 3, 2012, Johnson moved to have Joseph Conley, Ph.D. (\"Dr. Conley\"), a neuropsychologist, appointed at the Commonwealth's expense, to serve as an expert to assist in the preparation for his sentencing hearing. In his motion, Johnson noted that Dr. Conley had \"devoted his practice to the study of the maturation of the brain and its functioning.\" Johnson argued that Dr. Conley would \"provide relevant facts specific to Raheem C. Johnson so as 'to fully advise the court' of all matters specific to Raheem C. Johnson and allow the fashioning of a sentence in compliance with the 8th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At a hearing on the matter, Johnson argued that Dr. Conley's assistance was necessary because the probation officer charged with compiling the presentence report \"does not have the ability to collect the necessary details about what is happening within [Johnson's] mind, how [Johnson's] mind has developed.\" Johnson asserted that Dr. Conley's \"facts or unique abilities\" would allow him to develop \"other relevant facts needed to individualize the punishment that [the trial court] is going to have to mete out.\" In response, the Commonwealth stated that Johnson had not demonstrated the requisite particularized need to have Dr. Conley appointed at the Commonwealth's expense because it was \"common\n   sense\" that a juvenile is less mature than an adult. The Commonwealth also noted that Johnson was not facing life without parole because Johnson would be eligible for geriatric parole at age 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After considering the matter, the trial court denied Johnson's motion. The trial court noted that nothing in Johnson's record supported his position that such an evaluation was needed. It further stated that Johnson had not shown a particularized need because, in the trial court's opinion,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   did not require such an evaluation in every case where the accused was a juvenile at the time of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to sentencing, Johnson submitted four articles that discuss brain development and legal culpability. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court acknowledged that it had read the articles Johnson submitted and considered them along with the presentence report and Johnson's school records. After hearing argument from the parties, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Johnson, in this case we had a helpless victim, the shooting was unprovoked, and it was cruel and callous. It was just mean. It was, it's as cruel and callous as anything I've seen since I've been sitting here on the bench, and that's been awhile. Just totally unnecessary to put a bullet in this young man's head.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court then proceeded to sentence Johnson to life in prison for the first degree murder charge plus an additional 42 years for the other seven charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Johnson filed a motion to reconsider, arguing that the trial court failed to properly\n   consider the articles he submitted and the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   before imposing Johnson's sentence. Johnson further asserted that, by imposing a life sentence, the trial court ignored the fact that, statistically, geriatric parole was not a realistic opportunity to obtain early release. The trial court denied the motion without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In a letter opinion, the trial court explained that it imposed a life sentence \"after careful consideration of [Johnson's] individual characteristics as reflected in the record, including without limitation the presentence report and school records.\" The trial court also reiterated that it had reviewed the articles Johnson submitted. The trial court noted the \"horrendous nature of the crime\" and\n   determined that Johnson's \"history of disrespect for authority and aggressive behavior which, coupled with the brutality of the offense, make [Johnson] ... a danger to himself and others should he be returned to society.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Johnson appealed the trial court's refusal to appoint a neuropsychologist and its decision to impose a life sentence to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals denied Johnson's petition for appeal with regard to the denial of his motion for a neuropsychologist, but granted his petition with regard to the sentence imposed. In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals subsequently determined that, because a sentence of life did not exceed the statutory maximum penalty for first-degree murder, the trial court had not erred.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230449\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/63/175/#p182\">\n    63 Va.App. 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182-85,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230449\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/63/175/#p182\">\n    755 S.E.2d 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 471-73 (2014).

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, Johnson argues that the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to consider his appeal related to the trial court's denial of the motion for the appointment of a neuropsychologist on his behalf at the Commonwealth's expense. Additionally, he asserts that, under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court's decision to impose a life sentence because he was not afforded the opportunity to present evidence regarding youth and its attendant consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A. Motion for a Neuropsychologist\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Johnson contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for the appointment of a neuropsychologist on his behalf at the Commonwealth's expense because he demonstrated a particularized need for the services of a neuropsychologist. Johnson asserts that he demonstrated the requisite \"particularized need\" established by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Husske v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"485068\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/252/203/\">\n    252 Va. 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20S.E.2d%20920\">\n    476 S.E.2d 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). He also relies on the fact that Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A) requires that a presentence report include \"other relevant facts.\" Johnson claims that evidence relating to his\n   physiology or psychology were such \"other relevant facts.\" Thus, according to Johnson, even in the absence of showing a particularized need, the services of a neuropsychologist were necessary to provide a complete presentence report. He further asserts that such evidence was necessary to allow the trial court to \"tailor\" the punishment to him. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This Court has recognized that, upon request, the Commonwealth is required to \"provide indigent defendants with 'the basic tools of an adequate defense.' \"\n   <em>\n    Husske\n   </em>\n   , 252 Va.at 211,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20S.E.2d%20920\">\n    476 S.E.2d at 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ake v.

In the present case, Johnson admitted that he sought the services of a neuropsychologist because there was no other evidence regarding his physiology or psychology. In other words, Johnson sought the\n   assistance of an expert at the Commonwealth's expense with no idea what evidence might be developed or whether it would assist him in any way. At best, Johnson's request for a neuropsychologist amounted to a mere hope that favorable evidence would be obtained. Thus, it cannot be said that Johnson demonstrated a particularized need for the assistance of a neuropsychologist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Johnson next argues that, under Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A), he was entitled to the appointment of a neuropsychologist independent of any showing of a particularized need. Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A) states that, upon a finding of guilt, a trial court may (or, under certain circumstances, shall) direct a probation officer to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   thoroughly investigate and report upon the history of the accused, including a report of the accused's criminal record as an adult and available juvenile court records, any information regarding the accused's participation or membership in a criminal street gang as defined in \u00a7 18.2-46.1,\n   <em>\n    and all other relevant facts\n   </em>\n   , to fully advise the court so the court may determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20S.E.2d%20920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Nothing in the plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A) specifically requires a probation officer to investigate a defendant's current physiology or psychology.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the statute expressly limits the subject of the probation officer's investigation and report to \"the\n   <em>\n    history\n   </em>\n   of the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20S.E.2d%20920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). When read in context, it is clear that the phrase \"all other relevant facts\" is used to describe additional historical information that may be relevant to the probation officer's investigation and report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Thus, it is clear that Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A) does not envision the appointment of a neuropsychologist to augment the presentence report. That said, however, if information regarding a\n   defendant's physiology or psychology exists in a defendant's history, that information might well be included as \"other relevant facts\" in the presentence report. Moreover, such information could be used as part of the showing necessary to demonstrate a \"particularized need\" under\n   <em>\n    Husske\n   </em>\n   or presented as \"additional facts bearing upon the matter\" in response to the presentence report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Johnson's motion for the appointment of a neuropsychologist at the Commonwealth's expense and the Court of Appeals did not err in upholding this determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   B. Life Sentence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Johnson next argues that the trial court erred in sentencing him to life in prison. Relying on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   , Johnson claims that, because he was still a juvenile on the date that he committed the crimes, the trial court was required to consider the psychological differences between adults and juveniles before imposing a life sentence. Johnson further contends that, in the absence of such consideration, the sentence imposed by the trial court was not individualized and, therefore, violated the Eighth Amendment. However, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to the present case. Therefore, the trial court did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that a sentence of \"mandatory life without parole for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on 'cruel and unusual punishments.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. at 2460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, by its plain language,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   only applies where a juvenile offender is sentenced to a term of life\n   <em>\n    without parole\n   </em>\n   . Notably, the Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is founded, in part, on the notion that sentencing a juvenile to life in prison is a disproportionate sentence because a juvenile sentenced to life without parole is analogous to capital punishment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    at 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, \"[a]llowing those offenders to be considered for parole ensures that juveniles whose crimes reflected only transient immaturity-and who have since matured-will not be forced to serve a disproportionate sentence in\n   violation of the Eighth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/#p736\">\n    136 S.Ct. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/#p736\">\n    193 L.Ed.2d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Indeed, it is particularly telling that the remedy for a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violation is to \"permit juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/#p736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus it is clear that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   does not apply when a juvenile offender has the opportunity to be considered for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Angel v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=281%20Va.%20248\">\n    281 Va. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=704%20S.E.2d%20386\">\n    704 S.E.2d 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402 (2011), we held that the possibility of geriatric release under Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides a meaningful opportunity for release that is akin to parole. As Johnson was convicted of a Class 2 felony, he will be eligible for geriatric release under Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01 when he turns 60 in 2053, in which case the possibility exists that Johnson's sentence of life imprisonment will convert into a sentence of approximately forty years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, it is readily apparent that, under this Court's jurisprudence, Johnson was only sentenced to life in prison; he was not sentenced to life without parole. Accordingly, Johnson's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Having failed to demonstrate the requisite particularized need for the appointment of a neuropsychologist at the Commonwealth's expense, Johnson has failed to show any abuse of discretion in the decision of the trial court that mandated review by the Court of Appeals. Additionally, as Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01 provides Johnson with\n   a meaningful opportunity for parole when he turns 60,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   has no application to the present case.

It does prohibit States from making the judgment at the outset that those offenders never will be fit to reenter society.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
