We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim. We decline to address the defendant\u2019s second claim because our resolution of his first claim is dispositive of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The following facts and procedural history are necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. In June, 1993, the Bristol police conducted an undercover operation to investigate drug dealing near a housing project. At trial, two Bristol police officers, who participated in the undercover operation, identified the defendant as the person who sold a piece of crack cocaine to Officer Michael Healey, a plainclothes team member. Healey testified that he recognized the defendant from the alleged sale and knew him from two other undercover drug sales that the defendant had made to him. Another officer, Detective Kevin Hayes, testified that, using binoculars, he had observed the transaction between the defendant and Healey.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">In his testimony at trial and in his pretrial statements, the defendant made inconsistent statements concerning his use of drugs. First, as to heroin and cocaine use, the defendant told department of correction personnel that he had been using between seven to twelve \u201cbags\u201d of heroin and five \u201cbags\u201d of cocaine daily. At trial, on cross-examination, he testified that he had exaggerated those amounts for the purpose of receiving medication during his incarceration. Second, during an interview with a drug addiction specialist employed by the department of correction, he denied any heroin use prior to being arrested. He later admitted that he had misled the specialist about the frequency of his drug use, alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>ing that he was motivated by his fears that any admission of drug intake would have been used against him at trial. Third, although at trial, on direct examination as to quantity, the defendant claimed that he had been using five to six \u201cbags\u201d of heroin daily, during cross-examination he conceded that he could not tell with precision the daily amount of his drug use. He added that it \u201cdepended on the money he had\u201d at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In the defendant\u2019s direct testimony, he described withdrawal symptoms upon incarceration because he was \u201caddicted.\u201d Those symptoms included nausea, body aches and vomiting. That testimony was consistent with department of correction records, which indicated that medical staff had prescribed for him for three days the drug Vistaril, which commonly is prescribed for both heroin withdrawal and sleeplessness. The conditions of the defendant\u2019s parole from a 1992 conviction required him to submit to random urine tests to screen for the presence of drugs. Of the four urine tests given, the defendant failed two, which tested positive for the presence of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">In the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief, Robert Neuman, a drug addiction specialist with the state department of public health and addiction services, testified that the defendant was \u201cdrug-dependent\u201d at the time of the defendant\u2019s alleged sale and possession, within the meaning of \u00a7 21a-240 (18) and (19), and, additionally, that he was \u201cdrug-dependent\u201d as that term is defined in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Neuman interviewed the defendant on two separate occasions for the purpose of evaluating the extent of the defendant\u2019s drug dependency. During the first interview, lasting roughly one hour, the defendant admitted to some cocaine use but denied all heroin use. After discovering that the defendant\u2019s denials of his drug use conflicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>with the medical records<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the department of correction, Neuman recalled the defendant for a second interview. During the second interview, the defendant admitted to some heroin use but did not commit to having used any precise amount. Neuman did not perform any physical examination of the defendant for track marks or other signs of drug dependency. He nonetheless determined that the defendant was drug-dependent on the basis of the department of correction medical records as well as the two interviews that he had conducted with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The court instructed the jury on the main elements of each crime charged. In its charge, the court specifically noted that the jury could convict the defendant under \u00a7 2 la-278 and \u00a7 21a-278a only if it found that he was not drug-dependent. The charge did not define \u201cdrug dependency\u201d or \u201cdrug-dependent\u201d as those terms are defined by \u00a7 2 la-240. The court simply stated that the offenses charged must be committed by one \u201cwho is not, at the time of such action, a drug-dependent person.\u201d The court then went on to instruct the jury about the relevant burdens of proof of both the state and the defendant, noting that the defendant bore the burden of establishing drug dependency by a preponderance of the evidence. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">To address the defendant\u2019s claims adequately, we first examine the statutory scheme as it existed at the time that the alleged offenses occurred. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 and 21a-278a, by their terms, apply exclusively to one who is not \u201cat the time of such action, a drug-dependent person.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe design and effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>\u00a7 21a-278 (b) [and \u00a7 21a-278a (b)] is to punish persons who are not drug-dependent and sell narcotics [or controlled substances] more severely than drug-dependent persons who sell [those substances]. The legislature accomplishes this goal by providing for a five year mandatory minimum sentence for those [who are not drug-dependent and who are] convicted under \u00a7 2 la-278 (b) [and a three year minimum sentence for those convicted under \u00a7 21a-278a (b)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>41 Conn. App. 604, 607, 679 A.2d 3 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Although a defendant is presumed to be a person who is not drug-dependent unless and until he or she makes drug dependency an issue, a person charged with violating either \u00a7 2 la-278 (b) or \u00a7 21a-278a (b) may avoid the imposition of the minimum sentences mandated by those statutes by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she was drug-dependent at the time of the offense. Id., 608-609; see also General Statutes \u00a7 21a-269. \u201cA drug-dependent person, could, however, be convicted under [General Statutes] \u00a7 21a-277 (a), which does not consider drug dependency, but which also does not carry a mandatory minimum sentence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">With that statutory framework in mind, we now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the court failed to instruct the jury adequately as to the meaning of the term \u201cdrug-dependent person\u201d as that term is used in the statutorily recognized defense against the imposition of enhanced penalties for the drug charges at issue. The defendant claims that because of the court\u2019s failure to define drug dependency, the court\u2019s charge was an incomplete statement of the law that failed to guide the jury adequately in its duty to apply the law to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The defendant concedes that he did not properly preserve his claim at trial by making a request to define <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the term \u201cdrug-dependent\u201d or by taking exception to the lack of definition in the jury charge. He maintains, nonetheless, that his claim is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and, alternatively, the plain error rule of Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">At the outset, we note our standard of review for unpreserved claims of error. Generally, to obtain appellate review for a claim of trial court error, a defendant must raise the issue by objecting at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>36 Conn. App. 345, 359, 650 A.2d 632 (1994), cert. denied, 232 Conn. 908, 653 A.2d 195 (1995). In the context of flawed jury instructions, the defendant is expected to object \u201cimmediately after the conclusion of the charge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Snook, </em>210 Conn. 244, 270, 555 A.2d 390, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 924, 109 S. Ct. 3258, 106 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1989). Only under the \u201cmost exceptional circumstances\u201d will an appellate court permit the review of a claim of error that is not so preserved. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">That standard, although preclusive, serves critical policy objectives. Id. \u201cOtherwise [a defendant] would be permitted to lie by and speculate upon the chances of a verdict\u201d and only raise an issue of error observed during trial in the event that the result is not favorable. Id., 66. The \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d doctrine creates an incentive to assert claims of error at trial while the court still has the opportunity to correct any error. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">We first turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that review is warranted under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, because the court\u2019s failure to define drug dependency deprived him of his right to establish the statutorily authorized \u201cdrug-dependent\u201d person defense and thereby deprived him of his right to a fair trial. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>Golding, </em>a defendant can obtain review of an unpreserved claim \u201conly if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">\u201cThe first two steps in the <em>Golding </em>analysis address the reviewability of the claim, whereas the last two steps address the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohens, </em>62 Conn. App. 345, 350, 773 A.2d 363, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 918, 774 A.2d 139 (2001). We conclude that the record is adequate for review, satisfying the first step. With regard to the second step, an unpreserved claim of error consisting of the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the definition of what constitutes the affirmative defense of drug dependence does not implicate a fundamental constitutional right. \u201cDrug dependency is an affirmative defense to a charged violation [of \u00a7 21a-278 (b)].\u201d <em>Goodrum v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>63 Conn. App. 297, 313, 776 A.2d 461, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 902, 782 A.2d 136 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">It is true that a criminal defendant enjoys a fundamental right to establish a defense. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967). A state may, however, place the burden of establishing an affirmative defense, by a preponderance of the evidence, on a defendant, as long as the state is not incidentally relieved of its burden of proof for the elements of the crime. See <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 210, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1977). \u201cThe absence of drug dependency is not an element of the offense of sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>narcotics by aperson who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b). Rather, [like an affirmative defense] it is an exemption from liability under \u00a7 21a-269. . . . Therefore, it [is] not necessary for the state to negate drug dependency, but, rather, the defendant [has] the burden of proving that [he or] she was drug-dependent.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>35 Conn. App. 609, 619, 646 A.2d 909 (1994), aff'd, 235 Conn. 477, 668 A.2d 682 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">An analysis of our case law clearly demonstrates that the failure to charge adequately on an affirmative defense, which does not go to an element of the offense charged,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is not considered to be an error of constitutional magnitude. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 198-99, 502 A.2d 858 (1985), our Supreme Court addressed an unpreserved claim alleging that the trial court had improperly instructed a jury as to the affirmative defense of cohabitation in a sexual assault case. The defendant raised the broad issue of whether the trial court has an affirmative duty to charge the jury, sua sponte, on every defense theory for which there is a foundation in the evidence adduced at trial. Id., 196. The court stated: \u201cWhile the constitutional law of due process is implicated by a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the essential elements of the offense on which the conviction rests ... we have in the past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>found no constitutional infirmity in failure to charge on such defenses as entrapment . . . emotional disturbance ... or alibi.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 197. The court determined that \u201c[njothing in the circumstances [of the] case suggests that a different rule should apply for the defense of cohabitation.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Our Supreme Court has since applied the \u201crule\u201d from <em>Preyer </em>to encompass misinstmction on an affirmative defense. In <em>State </em>v. Foreshaw, 214 Conn. 540, 546, 572 A.2d 1006 (1990), the court again addressed challenges to improper instructions on affirmative defenses. The court in <em>Foreshaw, </em>determined that \u201c[i]mplicit in [our] decision [in Preyer] was the conclusion that claims of error pertaining to the inadequacy of instructions on an affirmative defense do not raise a constitutional question.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">It is true that in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 622, this court stated, in dicta, that an improper charge on the defense of drug dependency, the defense at issue on this appeal, like an improper charge on an element of an offense is an error of \u201cconstitutional dimension.\u201d The <em>holdings </em>of this court and our Supreme Court are, however, to the contrary. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreshaw, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 546; <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 197; <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>supra, 35 Conn. App. 619. An improper instruction on the defense of drug-dependency, \u201cis not of constitutional magnitude.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>supra, 619. In <em>Denby, </em>we stated that \u201c[b]ecause the claimed error does not involve an element of the offense ... [it is not a violation of a fundamental constitutional right].\u201d Id. We therefore conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim fails to meet the second prong of the <em>Golding </em>standard because it does not allege a claim that is of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that review is warranted under the plain error doctrine. As a preliminary matter, we set out our standard of review for plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>error. Under Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, an appellate court \u201cshall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. . . . [but an appellate court] may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court. . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. \u201cThe defendant cannot prevail under . . . [Practice Book \u00a7 60-5,] however, unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 849, 661 A.2d 539 (1995). Plain error is reserved for extraordinary situations and \u201cis not even implicated unless the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\u201cWe have consistently held that plain error review is necessary where the trial court, in its instruction, overlooks a clearly applicable statute . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Dionne </em>v. <em>Markie, </em>38 Conn. App. 852, 856-57, 663 A.2d 420 (1995). Because the court did not instruct the jury on the definition of \u201cdrug-dependent person\u201d in \u00a7 21a-240 (19), and the statutory definition contains alternative ways of meeting that exemption from enhanced penalties, which cannot be ascertained from the term\u2019s ordinary meaning, the jury was left to guess at the meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">To prevail on a claim of nonconstitutional plain error, \u201cthe defendant must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s improper action likely affected the result of his trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 850. When a court overlooks a statute defining a material term about which the jury is instructed, the likelihood of misleading the jury will depend on whether the statutory term carries its \u201c \u2018ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>255 Conn. 746, 756, 770 A.2d 898 (2001). If the term carries a specific, technical meaning that is beyond common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>understanding, the failure to charge as to the substance of the term\u2019s statutory definition is harmful error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>6 Conn. App. 24, 31-32, 502 A.2d 945 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Our evaluation of instructional error is a test of \u201csubstance rather than form.\u201d Id., 28. A court is not obligated to read the exact statutory language of a material definition. <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 755. In fact, if the statutory language would confuse the jury, reading it verbatim as part of the instructions is ill advised. <em>State </em>v. <em>Criscuolo, </em>159 Conn. 175, 177, 268 A.2d 374 (1970). The court must, however, charge on the substance of the controlling law in a way that the jury can understand. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>62 Conn. App. 743, 756, 774 A.2d 1015, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 919, 774 A.2d 142 (2001). The paramount concept in determining the propriety of jury instructions is whether, as a whole, the charge is \u201caccurate in law, adapted to the issues and adequate to guide the jury in reaching a correct verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>237 Conn. 454, 476, 678 A.2d 910 (1996); see also <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>145 Conn. 313, 315, 142 A.2d 135 (1958) (charging on material law in civil action, which, like drug dependency, requires proof by preponderance of evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The term at issue in this case is \u201cdrug-dependent\u201d as it is used in the statutory exclusion from liability for the mandatory minimum sentence under the statutes defining the offenses of which the defendant was convicted. Pursuant to \u00a7 21a-240 (18), \u201cdrug dependence\u201d is \u201ca state of physical or psychic dependence, or both, upon ... a repeated periodic or continuous basis . . . .\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 21a-240 (19), a \u201cdrug-dependent person,\u201d is \u201cany person who has developed a state of psychic or physical dependence, or both, upon ... a repeated periodic or continuous basis. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The standard technique to assess the common understanding of a statutory term is to turn to a dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>of common usage. <em>State </em>v. <em>Spillane, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 755. In the case of the term \u201cdrug-dependent,\u201d that approach is not entirely availing. In Webster\u2019s, the terms \u201cdrug-dependent\u201d or \u201cdrug dependence\u201d are not separately defined. Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1999). The absence of a separate definition indicates that the term is outside the rubric of common parlance. Within the definition of \u201cdependent,\u201d however, Webster\u2019s states \u201caffected with a drug dependence\u201d as one of several possible meanings. Id. \u201cDependence\u201d is, in turn, defined as \u201cthe quality or state of being dependent.\u201d Id. The meanings are, thus, circular and partially undefined. The most common meaning listed for \u201cdependent\u201d is \u201cdetermined or conditioned by another contingent.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">By contrast, the statutory definition of \u201cdrug-dependent person\u201d is a technical term of art with other than intuitive characteristics. As defined in \u00a7 21a-240 (19), a \u201cdrug-dependent person\u201d is \u201cany person who has developed a state of psychic or physical dependence, or both, upon ... a repeated periodic or continuous basis. . . .\u201d Absent a charge clearly defining the statutory meaning of \u201cdrug-dependent,\u201d whether a \u201cperiodic\u201d user qualifies as a \u201cdrug-dependent person\u201d would be a fruitless tautological debate. \u201cA jury should not be called upon to resolve such an esoteric philosophical question at the expense of the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 280, 506 A.2d 556 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The defendant adduced substantial evidence in support of his statutory drug dependence defense that would not necessarily jibe with the jury\u2019s common understanding of the term. For example, the defendant testified on both direct and cross-examination that he had used drugs periodically when his finances allowed. While it remained uninformed of the concepts of \u201cperiodic\u201d use or \u201cpsychic\u201d need as indicators of drug dependency, the jury was presented with evidence in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>of those concepts. It is not our role, on appeal, to pass judgment on the credibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sitkiewicz, </em>64 Conn. App. 108, 114\u201415, 779 A.2d 782, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 909, 782 A.2d 1250 (2001). At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the jury in the present case may have found the defendant\u2019s testimony to be credible, but, being unaware that \u201crepeated periodic\u201d use as well as \u201ccontinuous\u201d use qualified as drug dependency, discounted any evidence of periodic use as being inadequate to establish drug dependency. We therefore conclude that without the proper law before them to apply to that evidence, there is a reasonable possibility that the jurors were misled in reaching their verdict. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeBarros, </em>58 Conn. App. 673, 682-83, 755 A.2d 303, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 931, 761 A.2d 756 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The state urges us to consider aspects of the charge that allude to the testimony of a psychological expert, Neuman, who testified that the defendant was \u201cdrug-dependent\u201d at the relevant time within the meaning of \u00a7 21a-240 (19). In the state\u2019s estimation, Neuman\u2019s testimony regarding the meaning of drug dependency should be considered in determining whether the jury received a legally sufficient charge on the defense of drug dependency. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">It is the function of the court to state the rules of law and to explain the law to be applied to the facts of the case; <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>256 Conn. 517, 527, 779 A.2d 702 (2001); not the expert witnesses who testify at trial. Furthermore, nowhere in its instruction did the court ever charge that the defense expert had defined the material law for the jury to apply. On the contrary, the court underscored Neuman\u2019s lack of competency in the function of defining law. In the very first sentence of its charge, the court stated: \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, you\u2019ve heard the evidence presented in this case, and it\u2019s my duty now to instruct you as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>law which you are to apply to the facts. . . . Now, it\u2019s <em>exclusively the function of the court to state the rules of law that govern the case </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Further, regarding Neuman\u2019s testimony, the court stated: <em>\u201cNo such testimony is binding upon you, however, and you may disregard such testimony either in whole or in part. . . . </em>The testimony is entitled to such weight as you find expert\u2019s qualifications in this field entitle it to receive . . . and it must be considered by you, but is not controlling upon your judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We therefore do not agree that Neuman\u2019s testimony as to the meaning of drug dependency sufficed because there was no statutory definitional matrix against which such testimony could be measured. We conclude that the jury was likely to have been misled by the lack of a definition of \u201cdrug-dependent person\u201d in arriving at its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The judgment is reversed only as to the conviction of sale of a narcotic substance by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) and sale of a controlled substance by a person who is not drug-dependent within 1500 feet of a public housing project in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 21a-278a (b) and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
