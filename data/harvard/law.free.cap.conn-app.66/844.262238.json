He claims that the habeas court improperly failed (1) to grant certification for appeal, (2) to find that the trial court did not properly follow the plea agreement and (3) to find that trial counsel was ineffective. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">\u201cIn a habeas appeal, although this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous, our review of whether the facts as found by the habeas court constituted a violation of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is plenary.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>58 Conn. App. 169, 170, 752 A.2d 1159 (2000), citing <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>36 Conn. App. 695, 700, 652 A.2d 1050, cert. denied, 233 Conn. 912, 659 A.2d 183 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">\u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal, a petitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. ... If the petitioner succeeds in surmounting that hurdle, the petitioner must then demonstrate that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994). \u201cTo prove an abuse of discretion, the petitioner must demonstrate that the [resolution of the underlying claim involves issues that] are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ent manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. . . . For the petitioner to prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must establish both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel\u2019s mistakes, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>62 Conn. App. 583, 585, 772 A.2d 630 (2001); see also <em>Petaway v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>49 Conn. App. 75, 77, 712 A.2d 992 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Here, the habeas court based its dismissal of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus on a review of the petitioner\u2019s claims and the evidence presented. The petitioner\u2019s trial counsel testified that although he and the petitioner had hoped that the court would allow the petitioner to complete drug treatment and, as a result, not incarcerate the petitioner, the petitioner knew and understood that according to the plea he could have received incarceration up to ten years. In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court credited counsel\u2019s testimony and concluded that the petitioner failed to carry the burden of proof required to establish that the court did not properly follow the plea agreement or that his counsel had provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">\u201cThis court does not retry the case or evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Rather, we must defer to the [trier of fact\u2019s] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. ... In a case that is tried to the court . . . the judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses, and the weight to be given to their specific testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wieler </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>47 Conn. App. 59, 61, 702 A.2d 1195, cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>denied, 243 Conn. 957, 704 A.2d 806 (1997). The petitioner, therefore, cannot successfully challenge the habeas court\u2019s decision to credit counsel\u2019s testimony and to reject his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">After considering the record and briefs, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to make a substantial showing that he was denied a state or federal constitutional right. Furthermore, the petitioner has failed to sustain his burden of establishing that the denial of certification to appeal was a clear abuse of discretion or that an injustice has been done. See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 612; <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 189, 640 A.2d 601 (1994). We conclude, therefore, that the habeas court had before it sufficient evidence to find as it did and that it did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
