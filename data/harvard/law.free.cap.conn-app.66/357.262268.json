We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Hartford police officers Gregory DePietro and Germaine Coachman were dispatched to an apartment building at 84 Forest Street at 10:53 a.m. on June 16, 1997. Upon arrival at the scene, the building superintendent and a resident informed them that an intruder had broken into a first floor apartment through a window. The superintendent advised them of the apartment number, and Coachman entered the building to secure the apartment from the inside while DePietro moved to secure the exterior of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">As Coachman approached the apartment, a black male about five feet, six inches or seven inches tall and estimated to weigh 140 pounds, opened the door, saw Coachman and slammed it shut. At the same time, DePietro, who by then was at the rear of the building, observed an open broken window on the south side of the building. He heard a window opening on the north side of the building, and saw the defendant squatting in the window with one foot on the windowsill and apparently getting ready to jump to the ground. DePietro pointed his gun at him and ordered him to show his hands and get down.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant hesitated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>then, rather than comply with DePietro\u2019s order, retreated into the apartment, jumped out of a window on the south side and ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">DePietro radioed that the individual had fled and that he was chasing him on foot in a southbound direction. He accompanied the radio broadcast with a detailed description of the defendant. Shortly thereafter, DePietro broke off his pursuit and returned to the apartment building because he had left Coachman there without backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Upon entering the apartment, the officers observed a stereo, a videocassette recorder and various household goods stacked against a wall near one of the windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Officer Brian Foley was on bicycle patrol in the area when he heard DePietro\u2019s communication about the pursuit of a burglary suspect. He saw the defendant, who matched the description, and detained him until a patrol car arrived. The defendant was transported back to 84 Forest Street, where DePietro identified him as the person he had seen coming out of the apartment window and as the same person whom he had chased along the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The defendant claims that there is insufficient evidence that he (1) entered or remained unlawfully in the apartment and (2) intended to commit a crime therein. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">We employ a well established standard of review when a defendant challenges a jury\u2019s finding of guilt on the ground of insufficient evidence. \u201cIn reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>[a] sufficiency [of the evidence] claim, we apply a [two part] test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the [finding of guilt]. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 126, 646 A.2d 169 (1994), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 76, 634 A.2d 879 (1993). Moreover, \u201c[i]n viewing evidence which could yield contrary inferences, the jury is not barred from drawing those inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with innocence. The rule is that the jury\u2019s function is to draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 132-33. \u201cIn this process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>213 Conn. 243, 254, 567 A.2d 1173 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u201cA person \u2018enters or remains unlawfully\u2019 in or upon premises when the premises, at the time of such entry or remaining, are not open to the public and when the actor is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so. \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 (b). Applying the statutory definition to the present case, we conclude, on the basis of our review of the evidence, that the jury reasonably could have found that the apartment was occupied by another person and the defendant did not live there. As soon as he came to the attention of the police, he jumped from a window and ran, leaving the stereo, videocassette recorder and other household goods piled near a window, permitting an inference that it was an attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>gather everything together to be taken from the premises. The defendant\u2019s presence in an apartment that was not his own, his attempts to evade police and his flight were sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that he had entered the apartment unlawfully. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gradzik, </em>193 Conn. 35, 38, 475 A.2d 269 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. Godfrey, 39 Conn. App. 1, 663 A.2d 1117 (1995), appeal dismissed, 236 Conn. 904, 670 A.2d 1305 (1996), and <em>In re Adalberto S., </em>27 Conn. App. 49, 604 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 903, 606 A.2d 1328 (1992), is unavailing. In <em>Godfrey, </em>a police officer observed the defendant leaning against and peering into a parked car. The defendant attempted to open the front door and then the rear door of the car. The officer further observed the defendant look around and pick up a metal object, which the officer surmised that the defendant intended to use to break the window. The officer approached the defendant, whereupon he fled and was apprehended shortly thereafter. The owner of the car was not identified and did not testify. The defendant was convicted of attempt to commit burglary in the third degree and attempt to commit tampering with a motor vehicle. This court reversed the judgment of conviction because there was insufficient evidence to establish that the defendant lacked the consent of the owner to enter the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In this case, the officers testified that they were informed by the superintendent and a resident of the apartment building that an intruder had broken into a particular first floor apartment through a window. In addition, there were Coachman\u2019s observations of a person slamming the apartment door shut and running through the apartment. Furthermore, the officer in <em>Godfrey </em>speculated that the defendant was going to break into the car, whereas the officers in this case directly witnessed the defendant flee from inside of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>In <em>In re Adalberto S., </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 49, the respondent was observed by a police officer in a parked car with three other people. All the occupants fled when the officer approached the car. The respondent exited from the backseat and was apprehended a short time later. The vehicle\u2019s steering column was damaged, and the engine was running without a key in the ignition. Following a trial to the court, the respondent was adjudicated delinquent by virtue of having used a motor vehicle without the owner\u2019s permission. This court reversed the judgment of the trial court because the state failed to prove that none of the occupants had the owner\u2019s permission to use the car and that the respondent knew that this was the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In <em>In re Adalberto S., </em>a critical aspect of the case was the fact that the respondent was a passenger in the backseat. Taking into account his position in the car, the state could not prove that <em>he </em>was using the car without the owner\u2019s permission. Rather, the state had to prove that he knew that none of the other people had the requisite permission. In this case, however, there was no evidence that there was another person other than the defendant in the apartment. Considering the circumstances in this case, the evidence was sufficient to justify a conclusion that the defendant had entered the apartment unlawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The defendant next claims that the evidence was insufficient to show that he intended to commit a crime in the apartment. \u201cGenerally, intent can only be proved by circumstantial evidence, and, being a mental state, it is proved by the conduct of that person whose conduct is being scrutinized.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>31 Conn. App. 312, 328, 624 A.2d 1165, cert. denied, 226 Conn. 916, 628 A.2d 989 (1993). The fact that the defendant was found within an apartment that was not his own, that he slammed the door in Coachman\u2019s face and made a precipitous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>exit through a window \u201cpermitted a reasonable inference, based on human experience, that the unlawful entry by the defendant was hardly without purpose, but rather was with the intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cIt is a basic principle of law that common sense is not to be left at the courtroom door. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>195 Conn. 611, 620, 490 A.2d 68 (1985). \u2018Similarly, in [burglary cases], from the evidence of an attempt to make a forcible entry it is reasonable for the jury to infer an intent to commit theft.\u2019 Id., citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>444 F.2d 919, 924 (D.C. Cir. 1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>100 Wash. 2d 607, 625, 674 P.2d 145 (1983). In this case, there was an actual forced entry, not simply an attempted entry. . . . \u2018Common experience tells us that an unlawful entry into a dwelling ... is not without purpose. Nor are people accustomed to enter homes of strangers through a [window] for innocent purposes. To any person of ordinary intelligence, the expected by-product of a surreptitious unlawful entry into the home of another is theft.\u2019 . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Zayas, </em>supra, 617; <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>6 Conn. App. 24, 33, 502 A.2d 945 (1986). One would have to suspend reason to find that the defendant had broken into the house in this case intending to do anything other than commit a crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>10 Conn. App. 279, 291, 523 A.2d 508, cert. denied, 203 Conn. 810, 525 A.2d 524 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The defendant further argues that the state was estopped from claiming that he stacked the items near the window because the jury had fully and finally decided that question by acquitting him of a charge of attempt to commit larceny in the sixth degree. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\"><em>In State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>29 Conn. App. 825, 831, 618 A.2d 547 (1993), the defendant was acquitted of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>misconduct with a motor vehicle. The defendant argued that because the jury returned a not guilty verdict on the manslaughter charge, it had determined that he was not intoxicated or that his intoxication did not cause the deaths of the victims. Id., 836-37 n.6. This court stated: \u201cSimply put, collateral estoppel principles do not apply in a single trial to preclude a verdict of guilty on an offense which includes elements in common with an offense for which the jury has returned a verdict of not guilty. . . . Consequently, we may rely on evidence of alcohol consumption and its effects in our consideration of whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendant\u2019s conviction of misconduct with a motor vehicle.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. In accordance with <em>Ortiz, </em>we conclude that the state was not estopped from asserting that the defendant had stacked the items near the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In light of the additional evidence of the personal property that was stacked near the window, we conclude that the state established evidence from which the jury could infer that the defendant had an intent to steal when he entered the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The defendant next claims that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> codifies a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>a speedy trial and confers on the judges of the Superior Court the authority to make such rules as they deem necessary to establish a procedure for implementing that right. Pursuant to that authority, the judges adopted Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 43-39 through 43-41.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The defendant had been continuously incarcerated for more than eight months and, therefore, was facially entitled to the benefit of \u00a7 54-82m. On three occasions, the defendant filed speedy trial motions, two of which were denied by the court and the third of which was withdrawn. The defendant claims that the withdrawal was not voluntary, but was the result of improper information he received from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In his brief and in oral argument, the defendant presented scholarly arguments to support his contention that he is entitled to a dismissal of his case because he did not receive a speedy trial. Those arguments, however, do not take into consideration the final sentence of Practice Book \u00a7 43-41, which clearly and unequivocally provides that \u201c[f]ailure of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>to file a motion to dismiss prior to the commencement of trial shall constitute a waiver of the right to dismissal under these rules.\u201d The defendant failed to file a motion to dismiss prior to the commencement of trial and consequently is deemed to have waived his right to a dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly allowed the state to introduce out-of-court statements by unavailable witnesses, which were irrelevant for the purposes allegedly offered, but which were clearly prejudicial to the defendant with regard to the burglary charge. On direct examination, DePietro was allowed to testify concerning the radio transmission, which caused him to go to the apartment building. He was also allowed to testify concerning the information he received from the building superintendent when he arrived at the scene. On direct examination, Coachman was allowed to testify that she was responding to the Forest Street address on the basis of a communication that there was a breaking and entering or a burglary in progress at that address. Coachman was also allowed to testify as to the information she received from the superintendent upon her arrival at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">On each occasion of the allowance of that kind of testimony, the court cautioned the jury that it was being admitted solely for the purpose of showing why a witness took certain action. During its closing instructions to the jury, the court charged that \u201c[i]f some evidence was admitted for a limited purpose, you should only consider it for that purpose. We did have some evidence where I allowed police officers to talk about what other police officers were saying to show why they did things, but not to prove the underlying truth. That\u2019s what we were talking about with limited purpose.\u201d It is well established that out-of-court statements that are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>admitted for the truth of the matters asserted therein, but to establish the facts that led to the witness taking certain action, are not hearsay and are, therefore, admissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>212 Conn. 351, 357, 562 A.2d 1071 (1989). Because the out-of-court statements were admissible for a permissible nonhearsay purpose and accompanied by appropriate limiting instructions, the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting those statements. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The defendant next claims that he was deprived of a fair trial by prosecutorial misconduct. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The defendant failed to preserve his claim at trial and now seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the defendant fails to demonstrate that a constitutional violation clearly exists that deprived him of a fair trial, his claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Our standard of review of prosecutorial misconduct is well established. \u201cIn analyzing this claim, we do not focus solely on the prosecutor\u2019s conduct. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeudis, </em>62 Conn. App. 787, 793, 772 A.2d 715, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>cert. denied, 256 Conn. 923, 774 A.2d 140 (2001). \u201cIn determining whether the defendant was denied a fair trial we must view the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the context of the entire trial. ... In examining the prosecutor\u2019s argument we must distinguish between those comments whose effects may be removed by appropriate instructions . . . and those which are flagrant and therefore deny the accused a fair trial. . . . The defendant bears the burden of proving that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper in that they were prejudicial and deprived him of a fair trial. ... In determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, [our Supreme Court], in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>256 Conn. 291, 297-98, 772 A.2d 1107 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In his opening statement, the prosecutor stated: \u201cWho is Neroy Hampton? It\u2019s our position the defendant, Neroy Michael Hampton, is the one who committed the crimes that the clerk outlined ... I\u2019ll have three witnesses that will testify that Mr. Hampton was in the apartment, had placed items in such a manner illegally in that apartment.\u201d The defendant claims that those statements were improper because none of the three officers could testify that he was illegally in the apartment, and the prosecutor expressed his own opinion as to the guilt of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>We acknowledge that it is improper for a prosecutor to express his opinion, directly or indirectly, as to a defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>59 Conn. App. 638, 647, 757 A.2d 1175 (2000), cert. granted on other grounds, 255 Conn. 935, 767 A.2d 1214 (2001). In this case, however, the prosecutor was expressing the state\u2019s position, not his own. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were an appropriate method of describing the evidence and what the state ultimately intended to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor, in his opening statement, made improper comments on the basis of inadmissible hearsay. The statements are as follows: \u201c[0]ne [officer] went to the rear- to check the windows, where it was reported that someone had entered the building through a broken window .... All of them will testify, all of those three officers, that a burglary took place on that day at that location, and that [the defendant] was the one [who] committed that burglary . . . .\u201d The defendant claims that because there was no evidence presented that he had entered through the broken window and that none of the officers could testify that a burglary had taken place or that he had committed the burglary, the prosecutor improperly relied on inadmissible hearsay. The prosecutor was referring to evidence that he intended to introduce in the state\u2019s case and, later, when it was introduced, the court gave the jury a limiting instruction on how to consider it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that, under those circumstances, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor improperly elicited testimony involving out-of-court identifications of the defendant. On direct examination, DePietro testified that he had witnesses identify the defendant before arresting him. The defendant objected, and the court instructed the jury to disregard the statement about identification. On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned DePietro extensively as to his identification of the defendant. During redirect examination of DePietro, the prosecutor asked if his identification of the defendant was independent of any witnesses, to which he answered, \u201c[Y]es.\u201d The defendant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were a deliberate attempt to elicit inadmissible hearsay. We conclude that the defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s questions because of the court\u2019s instruction to the jury. Furthermore, the prosecutor\u2019s questions on redirect were in response to defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination and were an attempt to clarify that DePietro\u2019s identification was based on his own observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor improperly expressed his opinion in his final argument. The prosecutor stated: \u201cIt is the state\u2019s position, and you are the finders of facts so you are the ultimate ones. I am giving you my opinion based on the evidence that I put forward, but based on what the judge tells you about the law, what the law is, and you hearing all the facts, you decide ultimately whether the defendant is guilty or innocent. I will tell you my position, our position as the state. Our position is, yes, he is guilty. . . . Someone in a building, an apartment that he doesn\u2019t live in. Why is he there? That\u2019s up to you to determine. Was he there legally or illegally? It\u2019s the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>state\u2019s position that he was there illegally, attempting to commit larceny. . . . [Y]ou make the conclusions, but it\u2019s the state\u2019s position that the sole person in there was the defendant, and he took flight. . . . That this individual, Mr. Neroy Michael Hampton, is the defendant and is guilty.\u201d In rebuttal argument, the prosecutor stated: \u201cYou listened to all the evidence, and all of the evidence clearly points to this defendant as guilty. . . . Was Mr. Hampton in there illegally? We say yes. . . . You weigh the credibility. You\u2019ve heard all the evidence. You make the decision. Who is Michael \u2014 Neroy Michael Hampton? He is the defendant, and he is guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u201c[B]ecause closing arguments often have a rough and tumble quality about them, some leeway must be afforded to the advocates in offering arguments to the jury in final argument. [I]n addressing the jury, [cjounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Inherent in this latitude is the freedom to argue reasonable inferences based on the evidence presented at trial. . . . The mere use of phrases such as T submit,\u2019 \u2018I find,\u2019 or \u2018I believe\u2019 does not constitute improper argument.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>52 Conn. App. 385, 399-400, 726 A.2d 657, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 920, 733 A.2d 233 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Although the prosecutor did refer to himself in the first person, when viewed in the context of his entire argument, it is evident that this was unintentional and was part of his attempt to express the state\u2019s position. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were an appropriate method of highlighting the evidence presented and what reasonable conclusions could be made by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The defendant also argues that the prosecutor misstated evidence when he stated that \u201c[n]o one else was in that apartment\u201d because \u201cCoachman had secured the door and was there.\u201d The defendant claims that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that there was no one else in the apartment. It is apparent that the prosecutor was merely stating an inference that the jury reasonably could have drawn from the facts. Furthermore, it is not improper for a prosecutor to highlight the evidence that supports the state\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Finally, the defendant claims that the prosecutor misstated the evidence when he stated that DePietro said: \u201cStop. I\u2019m a police officer.\u201d In fact, DePietro testified that he did not recall if he said \u201cpolice.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s statement was in the context of describing what occurred when DePietro encountered the defendant in the window. Although DePietro did not remember if he said \u201cpolice,\u201d the jury was free to draw that inference from the evidence presented. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">We conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that a constitutional violation clearly exists that deprived him of a fair trial and, therefore, that he has failed to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In addition, the defendant also claims that in its casein-chief, the state improperly questioned DePietro on direct examination regarding the value of the equipment stacked in the apartment. The court sustained some of the defendant\u2019s objections to that line of questioning and ultimately permitted DePietro to testify only that he had paid $200 for a videocassette recorder. Although the defendant claims that this amounted to prosecutorial misconduct, we conclude that it is an evidentiary claim. Because the claim was preserved properly, we review it and determine that the defendant was not prejudiced by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The defendant next claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of interfering with an officer. He argues that the state (1) failed to prove the kind of acts of physical resistance required to constitute the offense and (2) failed to prove intent to interfere with the performance of an officer\u2019s duty. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The defendant first argues that to prove him guilty of interfering with an officer, the state was required to prove that he <em>physically </em>resisted the officer. A person is guilty of interfering with an officer when he obstructs, resists, hinders or endangers a police officer in the performance of his duties. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a. This court has stated that \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a . . . defines interfering to <em>include </em>obstruction, resistance, hindrance or endangerment. ... By using those words it is apparent that the legislature intended to prohibit <em>any </em>act which would amount to meddling in or hampering the activities of the police in the performance of their duties.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted). <em>State </em>v. <em>Laws, </em>37 Conn. App. 276, 297, 655 A.2d 1131, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 907, 659 A.2d 1210 (1995). \u201cIn enacting \u00a7 53a-167a, the legislature sought to prohibit behavior that hampers the activities of the police in the performance of their duties. . . . The statute\u2019s purpose is to ensure orderly compliance with the police during the performance of their duties; any act intended to thwart this purpose violates the statute.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>In re Adalberto S., </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In this case, the officer saw the defendant in the window and ordered him at gunpoint to get down and show his hands, whereupon the defendant reentered the building and fled through another window. The broad intent of \u00a7 53a-167a is to prohibit conduct that hampers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the activities of the police in the performance of their duties, including physical resistance as well as the defendant\u2019s conduct in this case. The evidence in the record is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s actions directly interfered with the officer\u2019s performance of his duties in investigating the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Second, the defendant argues that the evidence is insufficient to prove that he had the requisite mental state of specifically intending to interfere with the performance of an officer\u2019s duty. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u201cIntent is generally proven by circumstantial evidence because direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available. . . . Therefore, intent is often inferred from conduct . . . and from the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence and the rational inference drawn therefrom.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 257, 681 A.2d 922 (1996). The defendant disobeyed the officer\u2019s commands to get down from the window, avoided capture by escaping through another window and fled from the officers. Accordingly, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant intended to interfere with an officer by resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly instructed the jury on his constitutional right not to testify.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> More specifically, the defendant complains that the court referred to his <em>\u2018failure to </em>testify\u201d rather than using more neutral language. Whether a reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>to a defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to testify constitutes a constitutional violation as well as a statutory violation under General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is no longer in the realm of speculation. While this appeal was pending in this court, our Supreme Court decided <em>State </em>v. <em>Casanova, </em>255 Conn. 581, 597, 767 A.2d 1189 (2001), in which it held that reference to a defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to testily\u201d in an instruction pursuant to \u00a7 54-84 (b) is proper and that the court is not obligated to substitute more neutral language at the defendant\u2019s request.
