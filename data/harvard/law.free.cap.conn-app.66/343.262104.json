Shapero, in the amount of $22,500. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) awarded the plaintiff damages on his claim for nonpayment of legal fees when the attorney trial referee (referee) had found that no evidence as to the value of the plaintiffs services had been introduced at the hearing, (2) awarded the plaintiff damages on his claim for nonpayment of legal fees when the referee based her decision on evidence outside the record, and (3) awarded the plaintiff damages on his claim for nonpayment of legal fees where the referee\u2019s conclusions are internally inconsistent and unsupported by findings of fact. We agree and therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The plaintiff has filed a cross appeal, claiming that (1) the defendant\u2019s claims are not properly reviewable, as he did not provide the trial court with a transcript of the hearing conducted by the referee, (2) the plaintiff introduced sufficient evidence for the court to determine fairly the value of his services, (3) the defendant\u2019s brief is inadequate for review, and (4) the court improperly allowed the defendant to obtain a credit of $5000 when the defendant did not plead a proper special defense or setoff. We do not agree with the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are pertinent to our resolution of these appeals. In May, 1995, the defendant hired the plaintiff, an attorney, to represent him in a tax appeal to reduce the assessment on two commercial properties owned by the defendant. On May 17, 1995, the defendant paid the plaintiff a $5000 retainer and entered into an agreement to pay the plaintiff on a contingency fee basis. In May, 1997, the defendant discharged the plaintiff and hired substitute counsel on an hourly basis. Within four months, substitute counsel had successfully concluded the defendant\u2019s appeal. The appeal resulted in a tax burden reduction of $330,000 for the defendant\u2019s properties. The defendant paid substitute counsel $15,000 for services rendered in resolving the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On February 8, 1998, the plaintiff filed an action against the defendant to recover legal fees under causes of action sounding in quantum meruit, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., and fraud. The defendant thereafter alleged two special defenses: (1) that the plaintiff was paid for his work, and (2) that the plaintiff breached the standard for professional conduct within the legal community. On December 28, 1999, the matter was heard by the referee. During the hearing, the plaintiff presented no evidence relating to the hourly rate that he charged the defendant. The plaintiff testified that he had reasonably spent 100 hours on the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">On May 31, 2000, the referee filed a report recommending judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $27,500 with $5000 credited against the retainer. The referee arrived at those figures by calculating the plaintiffs hourly rate at $275 multiplied by 100 hours. On June 19, 2000, the defendant filed an objection to the referee\u2019s report, asserting that the plaintiff had failed to meet his burden of proof with regard to the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>of his services and that the referee had failed to make appropriate findings of fact to support her conclusions. On July 11, 2000, the court, <em>Karazin, J., </em>accepted the referee\u2019s report over the defendant\u2019s objections. On September 6, 2000, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for reargument. On October 2, 2000, the plaintiff filed a motion for articulation. In response, the court on November 6, 2000, filed a memorandum of decision upholding the referee\u2019s findings and her crediting of the $5000 retainer against the amount of the judgment. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">All of the defendant\u2019s claims are predicated on the payment of legal fees, regardless of the terms in which those claims have been couched. Because of that, each claim requires that a finding be made as to the value of the legal services rendered by the plaintiff. Absent any evidence as to the value of those services, the court may not award damages. We conclude that our disposition of the defendant\u2019s first claim is dispositive and, therefore, decline to address all of his other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The defendant claims that the court improperly awarded the plaintiff damages on his claim for nonpayment of legal fees when the referee found that no evidence as to the value of the plaintiffs services had been introduced at the hearing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u201cThis court\u2019s review of the trial court\u2019s factual findings is limited.

App. 561, 564-65, 771 A.2d 266, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 917, 773 A.2d 944 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Our Supreme Court repeatedly has held that courts have a general knowledge of what would be reasonable compensation for services that are fairly stated and described. See, e.g., <em>Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>186 Conn. 673, 680, 443 A.2d 486 (1982); <em>Piantedosi </em>v. <em>Floridia, </em>186 Conn. 275, 279, 440 A.2d 977 (1982); <em>Storm Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Baumgold, </em>186 Conn. 237, 245-46, 440 A.2d 306 (1982); <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Valley Oil Co., </em>126 Conn. 154, 161, 9 A.2d 822 (1939); <em>Carangelo </em>v. <em>Nutmeg Farm, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>115 Conn. 457, 463, 162 A. 4 (1932); <em>Gruskay </em>v. <em>Simenauskas, </em>107 Conn. 380, 387, 140 A. 724 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">No award of attorney\u2019s fees, however, may be made when the evidence on which to base the award is insufficient. <em>Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 680; <em>Lebowitz </em>v. <em>McPike, </em>151 Conn. 566, 568, 201 A.2d 469 (1964); <em>Gruskay </em>v. <em>Simenauskas, </em>supra, 107 Conn. 387; <em>City Savings Bank of Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Miko, </em>1 Conn. App. 30, 38, 467 A.2d 929 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">After a review of the record, we conclude that the plaintiff produced no evidence showing either his rate of compensation or that of prevailing rates in the legal community. There was insufficient evidence on which to base a finding of attorney\u2019s fees. In the absence of relevant evidence, the referee acted outside her discretion in assigning the hourly rate of $275, and the court improperly adopted that finding. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">We now turn our attention to the plaintiffs claims on cross appeal. The plaintiff first asserts that the defendant\u2019s claims are not reviewable because he did not provide the court with a transcript of the hearing before the referee. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">The following additional procedural histoiy is relevant to our disposition of the plaintiffs claim. On May 31, 2000, the referee filed her report, finding that the plaintiff was entitled to $27,500, which represented 100 hours of work valued at $275 per hour, less $5000 credited against the retainer paid by the defendant. On June 19, 2000, the defendant filed written objections to the acceptance of the referee\u2019s report. The defendant stated: \u201cIn her report, the Referee specifically found, in paragraph No. 8, that the Defendant <em>\u2018did not keep </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>time records\u2019 . . </em>. Despite this fact, which was clearly supported by the record, the Referee nonetheless found in paragraph No. 7 that the Plaintiff \u2018reasonably spent 100 hours in connection with his representation of the defendant.\u2019 The Referee repeats this finding in paragraph Nos. 14-15.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The defendant further stated that \u201c[i]n paragraph 17 the referee finds that the reasonable hourly rate for the plaintiff to have charged during the time period in question\u2014 1995 \u2014 was $275.00 per hour. However, in paragraph 14 the referee rightly found that <em>\u2018there was not any testimony regarding] the plaintiff\u2019s estimate of the value of his services on an hourly basis\u2019 . . </em>. Therefore, there was simply no basis on which the referee could have found that $275.00 was a reasonable hourly fee to have charged, or that in fact the Plaintiff did utilize that rate in the underlying matter.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The defendant in his written objections to the referee\u2019s report finally states that \u201c[t]he [referee] recommends an award in paragraph No. 18 that is not properly found because of the lack of foundation. As set forth above, the Referee specifically determined that the Plaintiff failed to present evidence with respect to the time spent or the rate charged in the underlying matter. Therefore, the award of $27,500.00, less a credit for monies paid, is without foundation in the evidence.\u201d On June 19, 2000, the plaintiff filed written objections to the acceptance of the referee\u2019s report. The plaintiff objected \u201cto the limited extent that [the report] recommended that the Defendant benefit from a credit or setoff of $5,000.00. The Plaintiff does not challenge any of the factual findings of the [referee], but claims as a matter of law that the Defendant can not obtain a credit or setoff, therefore judgment should enter in the full amount of $27,500.00.\u201d Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant filed with the trial court a transcript of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>hearing before the referee. On July 11, 2000, both the defendant\u2019s objections and the plaintiffs objections were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u201cThere is no rule requiring the factfinder or the trial court reviewing the factfinder\u2019s report to order a transcript . . . pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 546J<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> .... [A] trial court may ask that transcripts be provided, but there is nothing that requires that the trial court have the transcripts before rendering judgment.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Beizer </em>v. <em>Goepfert, </em>28 Conn. App. 693, 706-707, 613 A.2d 1336, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 901, 615 A.2d 1044 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 973, 113 S. Ct. 1416, 122 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The plaintiff relies on <em>John M. Glover Agency </em>v. <em>RDB Building, LLC, </em>60 Conn. App. 640, 760 A.2d 980 (2000), for the proposition that \u201c[i]t is impossible for a reviewing court, without a transcript, to determine whether the subordinate facts found by the fact finder are supported by the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 646. That, in itself, is true. The plaintiff, however, goes on to maintain that <em>John M. Glover Agency </em>is \u201cexactly on point here.\u201d The plaintiff is mistaken. In <em>John M. Glover Agency, </em>the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>claimed that the trial court failed to apply a statute to the circumstances of the case. A review of that issue was dependent on the facts found by the attorney fact finder. The defendant had supplied the Appellate Court with a transcript of the hearing before the fact finder, but had not supplied one to the trial court. This court concluded that \u201cto review the transcript and judge the trial court\u2019s decision is appeal by ambuscade, a practice to which we do not adhere . . . .\u201d Id., 646-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The case currently before us is distinguishable from <em>John M. Glover Agency. </em>Here, the defendant\u2019s objections were directed to contradictions within the referee\u2019s report. The defendant claims, and we agree, that the referee contradicted herself in her report by finding that (1) the plaintiff kept no time records and presented no evidence concerning the value of his services, and (2) the plaintiff was entitled to compensation at a rate of $275 an hour for 100 hours of work. The defendant\u2019s objections were not directed at the truth or falsity of the referee\u2019s findings, but to the fact that the referee had made two findings in direct opposition to each other. The findings in the referee\u2019s report were sufficient for the court to rely on. In her report, the referee found that (1) the plaintiff had failed to keep any time records with regard to his representation of the defendant, and (2) there was no testimony during the hearing regarding the plaintiffs estimate of the value of his services on an hourly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">As previously stated, having found that the plaintiff kept no time records and presented no evidence concerning the value of his services, there was no basis on which the referee could properly find that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation at a rate of $275 an hour. That finding was inconsistent. A transcript of the underlying proceedings was not required for the court to address that claim because the claim itself is not dependent on the underlying facts. All that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>needed to decide the claim was the referee\u2019s report itself. We further find it telling that the plaintiff himself failed to file with the court a copy of the transcript of the hearing before the referee when he objected to the referee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">We conclude that the failure of the defendant to provide the trial court with a copy of the transcript does not preclude this court from hearing the defendant\u2019s appeal. It is clear from the defendant\u2019s objections that the court did not require a transcript to resolve the issues before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The plaintiff next claims that he introduced sufficient evidence for the referee to be able to fairly determine the value of his services. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">In her report, the referee found that (1) the plaintiff failed to keep any time records with regard to his representation of the defendant, and (2) there was no testimony during the hearing regarding the plaintiffs estimate of the value of his services on an hourly basis. As previously stated, we conclude that the plaintiff failed to offer any evidence pertaining to the value of his hourly services and that the referee therefore acted outside her discretion in assigning a rate of $275 an hour to his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The plaintiff claims that the defendant\u2019s brief is inadequate for review. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The plaintiffs claim is clearly without merit. Practice Book \u00a7 67-4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sets forth the requirements an appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>must meet in his brief for this court to review his claims. The defendant has met those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The plaintiff finally claims that the court improperly allowed the defendant to obtain a credit of $5000 when the defendant did not plead a proper special defense or setoff. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Because we have concluded that the referee acted outside her discretion in assigning a value to the plaintiffs services, we need not reach the plaintiffs claim on cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">On the defendant\u2019s appeal, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>In this opinion SCHALLER, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 23-58, formerly \u00a7 546J, provides: \u201c(a) After review of the finding of facts and hearing on any objections thereto, the judicial authority may take the following action: (1) render judgment in accordance with the finding of facts; (2) reject the finding of facts and remand the case to the fact finder who originally heard the matter for a rehearing on all or part of the finding of facts; (3) reject the finding of facts and remand the matter to another fact finder for rehearing; (4) reject the finding of facts and revoke the reference; (5) remand the case to the fact finder who originally heard the matter for a finding on an issue raised in an objection which was not addressed in the original finding of facts; or (6) take any other action the judicial authority may deem appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u201c(b) The judicial authority may correct a finding of facts at any time before accepting it, upon the written stipulation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">\u201c(c) The fact finder shall not be called as a witness, nor shall the decision of the fact finder be admitted into evidence at another proceeding ordered by a judicial authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-11\"> Practice Book \u00a7 67-4 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe appellant\u2019s brief shall contain the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">\u201c(a) A concise statement setting forth, in separately numbered paragraphs, without detail or discussion, the principal issues or issues involved in the appeal, with appropriate references to the page or pages of the brief where the issue is discussed, pursuant to subsection (d) hereof.

I cannot agree with the majority because without a transcript of the proceedings before the attorney trial referee (referee), it was impossible for the trial court to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to support the referee\u2019s findings and recommendation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is well settled that \u201c[i]t is impossible for a reviewing court, without a tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>script, to determine whether the subordinate facts found by [a referee] are supported by the evidence. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>John M. Glover Agency </em>v. <em>RDB Building, LLC, </em>60 Conn. App. 640, 646, 760 A.2d 980 (2000), citing <em>Meadows </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>249 Conn. 155, 170 n.10, 733 A.2d 172 (1999). Furthermore, \u201c]i]t is inherently unfair to ask this court to rule on the propriety of the trial court\u2019s judgment and to provide this court with information that was not before the trial court. For this court to review the transcript and judge the trial court\u2019s decision is appeal by ambuscade, a practice to which we do not adhere . . . unless a manifest injustice would otherwise occur.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>John M. Glover Agency </em>v. <em>RDB Building, LLC, </em>supra, 646-47. The fact that the plaintiff furnished a transcript to this court is irrelevant. We must decide this appeal on what was before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The plaintiffs action was not based on an express contract in which he and the defendant had contracted for compensation at an agreed rate per hour for services rendered. The theory of the plaintiffs action was quantum meruit for the value of his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The referee found that the plaintiff reasonably spent 100 hours in connection with his representation of the defendant. The majority concludes that this finding is inconsistent with the referee\u2019s finding that the plaintiff did not keep time records. I do not believe that the findings are inconsistent. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to keep time records to estimate the time he spent. The referee\u2019s finding is supported by the plaintiffs testimony that he \u201cspent more than 100 hours\u201d on the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The referee also made extensive findings concerning the plaintiffs legal experience and the novelty of the case. See Rules of Professional Conduct 1.5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u201c[I]t is well established that the evaluation of a witness\u2019 testimony and credibility is wholly within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Opotzner </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>63 Conn. App. 555, 564-65, 777 A.2d 718, cert. denied, 257 Conn. 910, 782 A.2d 134 (2001). Furthermore, without a transcript, the trial court could not know what other evidence might have supported that finding. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">I acknowledge that the referee found that there was no testimony regarding the plaintiffs estimate of the value of his services on an hourly basis. I question the significance of that finding because, as I have stated, the plaintiff was not suing for compensation on an hourly basis, but in quantum meruit for the reasonable value of his services. He did not allege an hourly rate and now is being penalized for failing to prove something that he did not allege. Furthermore, without a transcript, the trial court could not know what evidence, if any, the referee relied on in arriving at her recommendation that he be awarded $27,500 computed at $275 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>per hour. If the defendant wanted to persuade the trial court that there was no evidence to support the $275 per hour rate, it was the defendant\u2019s burden to furnish a transcript demonstrating that there was no evidence whatsoever to support that recommendation. Lack of testimony from the plaintiff does not rule out evidence having been produced from some other source.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Accordingly, it is my opinion that the defendant sustained his burden and the trial court properly rendered judgment on the referee\u2019s report. Even if the majority could convince me that there was an inconsistency between the finding and the recommendation, I would not be convinced that a reversal and rendition of judgment for the defendant is warranted. Instead, I would remand the appeal to the trial court to take appropriate action under Practice Book \u00a7 19-17.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\"> The referee made, in part, the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u201c(5) The plaintiff, according to his testimony, spent more than 100 hours pursuing the novel arguments made in the appeal. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\u201c(6) [The plaintiff] researched the law and in addition to presenting his arguments to the Corporation Counsel\u2019s office, also presented his arguments on the record in an effort to move negotiations forward with the City of Stamford.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">\u201c(7) [The plaintiff] reasonably spent 100 hours in connection with his representation of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">\u201c(8) [The plaintiff] did not keep time records on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">* **</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">\u201c(13) The fact finder recognizes that the Value added\u2019 choice of the plaintiff to handle the defendant\u2019s tax matters involved the recognition of the plaintiffs notable service as probate judge and as Corporation Counsel with the City of Stamford and other public boards and agencies and his lifelong service to the community and to the legal profession. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">\u201c(15) The fact finder accepts the argument of plaintiffs counsel that it is reasonable to accept the testimony that 100 hours was spent in pursuit of the defendant\u2019s matters and that there was a value added to the defendant as a result of the plaintiffs standing in the legal community.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">\u201c(16) The fact finder does not believe that an hourly rate of compensation of $500.00 per hour is a reasonable rate of compensation, regardless of the standing of plaintiff in the legal community. Given the criteria set forth in Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 1.5, this fact finder specifically finds that</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">\u201cThere is an element of novelty to plaintiffs presentation to the tax assessor regarding the assessment method and the list year in question;</p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">\u201cThe defendant is very active in a wide variety of commercial matters and the plaintiff would have been precluded from representation of others who may have been in an adversary position to the defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b376-17\">\u201cThe tax appeal process requires attention to detail and is expedited on the docket</p>\n<p id=\"b376-18\">\u201cThe plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity to have recovered on a contingent fee basis and there was no evidence that the plaintiff breached his obligation to the defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b376-19\">\u201c(17) The fact finder recommends that an hourly rate of $275.00 per hour is reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> Rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\u201c(a) A lawyer\u2019s fee shall be reasonable.

The requirement of filing a transcript was resurrected and added to \u00a7 19-14, effective January 1,2001. (The defendant\u2019s objection to the acceptance of the referee\u2019s report was filed in June, <em>2000.) </em>I can offer no explanation as to why that requirement was omitted for one year, but it is clear that the appeal was filed during the one year window when the Practice Book transcript requirement seemed to be in abeyance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b379-12\"> Practice Book \u00a7 19-17 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The court shall render such judgment as the law requires upon the facts in the report.
