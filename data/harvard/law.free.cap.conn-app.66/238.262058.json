On appeal, the defendant claims that he was denied a fair trial because of a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct. Although we agree with the defendant that some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>claimed conduct was improper, we conclude that such misconduct did not clearly deprive the defendant of a fair trial. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The defendant did not object at trial to any of the alleged prosecutorial misconduct on which his claims are based and therefore requests review of his claims pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We review the defendant\u2019s claims because the record is adequate for our review and because a claim that the defendant\u2019s rights to due process and to a fair trial were denied is of constitutional dimension. <em>State </em>v. <em>Radzvilowicz, </em>47 Conn. App. 1, 44, 703 A.2d 767, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 955, 704 A.2d 806 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The defendant identifies seven instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct in support of his claim. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly (1) introduced evidence of the codefendants\u2019 pleas of guilty during the state\u2019s case-in-chief, (2) suggested that the defendant threatened a witness, (3) engaged in a general character assassination of the defendant and the codefendants, (4) suggested that defense counsel acted improperly in representing the defendant, (5) appealed to the passions of the jurors, (6) asked argumentative questions, interjected his personal opinion, misstated evidence and became an unsworn witness for the state in relation to the testimony of a particular witness and (7) commented on the appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ateness of the codefendants\u2019 pleas of guilty during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The defendant acknowledges that he cannot prevail on his claims where the challenged conduct was not blatantly egregious and merely consisted of isolated and brief episodes that do not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dumas, </em>54 Conn. App. 780, 788, 739 A.2d 1251, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 903, 743 A.2d 616 (1999). The defendant claims, however, that the prosecutor engaged in a pattern of egregious and repeated misconduct not only throughout his case-in-chief but also during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In determining whether prosecutorial conduct amounts to a denial of due process, we consider whether the conduct was improper, and, if so, we next determine whether the conduct caused substantial prejudice to the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cansler, </em>54 Conn. App. 819, 828-29 n.9, 738 A.2d 1095 (1999). \u201cWe do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>61 Conn. App. 763, 769, 765 A.2d 1240, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 901, 772 A.2d 599 (2001). \u201cTo make this determination, we must focus on several factors: (1) the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) the frequency of the conduct; (4) the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues of the case; (5) the strength of the curative instructions adopted; and (6) the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The defendant first argues that during the state\u2019s casein-chief, the prosecutor improperly introduced into evidence the codefendants\u2019 pleas of guilty. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>At trial, the state called as witnesses Lonnie Cross, Harson Griffith and Demetrius White, who, along with the defendant, were charged in connection with the robbery of the victim, Julio Burgos. At the time of trial, each of those witnesses had pleaded guilty to the robbery of Burgos and was incarcerated. Cross, the first to take the witness stand, stated that he was serving a ten year sentence for several robberies, including the robbeiy of Burgos. Next, Griffith testified that he pleaded guilty to several robberies, including the robbery of Burgos, and that he was serving a ten and one-half year sentence. He denied, however, any knowledge of the robbery of Burgos. White testified last that he also was in jail after pleading guilty to the robbery charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u201c[GJuilty pleas and convictions may be introduced into evidence if the co-conspirator or co-defendant testifies at trial, so that the factfinder will have appropriate facts on hand to assess the witness\u2019s credibility. . . . Convictions and guilty pleas generally are not admissible for credibility purposes if the co-conspirator or co-defendant does not testify, and convictions and guilty pleas of co-conspirators and co-defendants other than the witness are not admissible to attack or bolster the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Butler, 55 Conn. App. 502, 511, 739 A.2d 732 (1999), aff'd, 255 Conn. 828, 769 A.2d 697 (2001); see <em>also State v. Just, </em>185 Conn. 339, 347-48, 441 A.2d 98 (1981) (whether person jointly charged with crime pleaded guilty not admissible on trial of another person so charged to establish that crime was committed); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 198, 187 A.2d 442 (1962) (same). Within these bounds, we recognized in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>7 Conn. App. 377, 388, 509 A.2d 36 (1986), that asking a witness on direct examination about his conviction is a permissible tactic to anticipate or soften impeachment evidence. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Conn. App. 598, 604, 513 A.2d 1268, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 810, 516 A.2d 887 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In <em>Just, </em>our Supreme Court rejected a claim similar to the defendant\u2019s claim in the present case. In that case, the state called three of the defendant\u2019s accomplices who had participated in the crimes alleged, and each testified at length on direct and on cross-examination and implicated himself and the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 343. Two of the witnesses testified, without objection by the defense, about their convictions of the crimes for which the defendant was on trial. Id., 343-44. The third witness also testified as to his convictions in federal and state court for the certain crimes connected with the incident, to which the defense raised a general objection. Id., 345-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly allowed \u201cthe state to prove his guilt by proving the convictions of alleged co-conspirators.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 343. In doing so, the court reasoned that \u201c[a]ny prejudice resulting from the testimony of the pleas was rendered harmless when the guilt of the accomplices was established by their own testimony which also implicated the defendant.\u201d Id., 349. The court further reasoned that \u201c[t]he purpose of the witness\u2019 testimony was to give the facts and circumstances of the crime[s]. The testimony as to their pleas of guilty gave the circumstances under which they were testifying, and their status with regard to the charge, and went to their credibility as witnesses for the state.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The court also noted several other factors that mitigated against finding harm, among which was the absence of any evidence that the state emphasized the witness\u2019 guilty pleas during final argument. Id., 350. Additionally, the court noted that defense counsel neither objected to the challenged testimony nor requested a curative instruction, possibly as a matter of trial strategy. Id., 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>In the present case, evidence of the codefendants\u2019 pleas of guilty came from the witnesses\u2019 own testimony and was inextricably linked with their testimony and other evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the robbery of Burgos. Cross testified that at approximately 1 a.m. on May 20,1998, he, Griffith, White and the defendant went to Burgos\u2019 apartment so that Cross could buy drugs and rob Burgos. When the state inquired as to the location of the robbery, Cross replied that it occurred on East Clay Street in Waterbury. The state then called to Cross\u2019 attention a statement in evidence that he had given to the police after being arrested.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although Cross professed to having no recollection of providing much of the information in the statement, he did testify that the defendant was present at the scene and drove the vehicle.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Griffith testified that he did not know why he was incarcerated but that he was serving a ten and one-half year sentence after pleading guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to several robberies that he did not commit, including the robbery of Burgos in the early morning hours of May 20, 1998. Griffith denied being with the defendant at any time during the day on which Burgos was robbed. Next, White testified that it was Cross\u2019 idea to rob Burgos and that he, Cross and the defendant went to Burgos\u2019 apartment for that purpose. According to White, the defendant knocked on Burgos\u2019 door and entered, with White and Cross following behind. White further testified that as Burgos attempted to escape through a window, the defendant dragged him from the window and that the defendant and Cross \u201cpistol whipped\u201d Burgos with their guns. Considering the witnesses\u2019 testimony in its entirety, we conclude that the testimony regarding the witnesses\u2019 pleas gave the circumstances under which they were testifying and their status with regard to the charges, and went to their credibility as witnesses for the state. See id., 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We further note that, as in <em>Just, </em>defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the introduction of the codefendants\u2019 guilty pleas or to request a curative instruction, coupled with counsel\u2019s cross-examination of two of the three witnesses, mitigates against finding substantial prejudice. Although the defendant waived his right to cross-examine Griffith, his counsel cross-examined both Cross and White, during which each codefendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>questioned on his criminal record, including his plea of guilty to the robbery of Burgos. Last, we note that, although the court did not give a curative instruction; see id., 348-49 (\u201clack of a curative instruction, especially in the absence of objection and a request for one, does not necessarily constitute harmful error\u201d); the court did provide an instruction on accomplice testimony in its charge to the jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> All of those factors mitigate against a conclusion that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct that substantially prejudiced the defendant when, during the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecutor solicited testimony regarding the codefendants\u2019 pleas of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The defendant next claims that during the state\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor improperly suggested that the defendant had intimidated a witness. We agree that this was improper conduct, but in the context of the entire trial, we conclude that it did not substantially prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>At trial, the defendant called his former girlfriend, Amanda Curtis, as an alibi witness. She testified that the defendant arrived at her home at approximately 11:30 p.m. on May 19, 1998, and remained there until the following morning. She further testified that, although they are no longer romantically involved, she continues to have contact with the defendant because he owns a barber shop where she takes her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In commenting on Curtis\u2019 testimony during his closing argument, the prosecutor stated that Curtis still takes her son \u201cwhere [the defendant] is found. [The defendant], who\u2019s friends with Lonnie Cross, who\u2019s friends with Demetrius White, and who\u2019s friends with Harson Griffith. Her son goes there. <em>And if someone asked you to testify for them and you\u2019re the mother of a young child, who knows?\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u201cWhile the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or even to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury have no right to consider. . . . We have cautioned repeatedly that a prosecutor should avoid arguments which are calculated to influence the passions or prejudices of the jury, or which would have the effect of diverting the jury\u2019s attention from their duty to decide the case on the evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pouncey, </em>241 Conn. 802, 811, 699 A.2d 901 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u201cWhen presenting closing arguments, as in all facets of a criminal trial, the prosecutor, as a representative of the state, has a duty of fairness that exceeds that of other advocates. [A] prosecutor is not an ordinary advocate. His [or her] duty is to see that justice is done and to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce prejudice and wrongful decisions by the jury.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Here, the prosecutor\u2019s comment, \u201cwho knows,\u201d in reference to why Curtis, the mother of a young boy, would testify as an alibi witness for the defendant was improper and unprofessional.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There was absolutely no evidence in the record from which to suggest that Curtis was testifying under threat, duress or out of fear for her or her son\u2019s safety. The prosecutor made such comments despite Curtis\u2019 testimony that she wanted to help a friend who was in trouble. We can conclude only that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was designed to encourage the jury to speculate, beyond the evidence, as to why Curtis testified on behalf of the defendant. Such conduct is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u201cScrutiny of a challenged remark made during closing arguments to the jury [however] does not occur in a vacuum; an appellate court examines such remarks in light of the entire trial.\u201d Id., 771. In the present case, we cannot say, as the defendant argues, that the utterance of that comment alone amounted to conduct so egregious that the defendant\u2019s conviction must be overturned. We first note that the prosecutor\u2019s comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>was not part of a recurring line of argument. While defense counsel liberally objected to argument, evidence and testimony throughout the trial, including during closing argument, counsel neither objected to nor requested a curative instruction regarding the challenged comment. \u201cThe failure to object to certain arguments at trial often is an indication that counsel did not view the remarks as so prejudicial that his client\u2019s right to a fair trial was seriously jeopardized. . . . Counsel might make a tactical decision not to object to a marginally objectionable argument because he or she does not want to draw the jury\u2019s attention to it or because he or she wants to later refute that argument.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The fact that defense counsel squarely addressed Curtis\u2019 veracity during his own closing argument also mitigates against concluding that the comment caused substantial prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, defense counsel expressed his own personal opinion as to the truthfulness of that witness. See footnote 12. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The strength of the state\u2019s case further leads us to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remark did not improperly influence the jury. Cross, Griffith and White each implicated the defendant in the crimes alleged. White testified at length to the defendant\u2019s involvement. Cross\u2019 statement to the police, which was admitted into evidence, detailed the defendant\u2019s involvement. Burgos also identified the defendant as one of the three men who had robbed him at his apartment. Therefore, although we condemn the prosecutor\u2019s comment, we must conclude that, in light of the entire trial, the prosecutor\u2019s comment did not cause substantial prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The defendant next argues that the prosecutor attempted to assail the defendant\u2019s character \u201cby implying that \u2018guilty birds of a feather are flocked together.\u2019 \u201d First, the defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly engaged in a general character assassination of the defendant and the codefendants by asking Cross on redirect examination whether it is \u201cfair to say that you were running around the city committing crimes for quite some time before this incident happened,\u201d and then by immediately asking whether Cross was friends with the defendant for the last four years before his arrest on the night of May 20, 1998. The defendant further contends that the prosecutor continued the general attack daring his closing argument.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim is without merit. First, the defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit burglary and robbery with Cross, Griffith and White. Therefore, evidence of the defendant\u2019s association with them was relevant. Second, the prosecutor\u2019s question regarding Cross\u2019 criminal activities was within the permissible boundaries of redirect, especially in light of defense counsel\u2019s searching cross-examination of Cross\u2019 extensive criminal record. We also note that Cross\u2019 statement to the police, in which he already had admitted his association with the defendant, was admitted into evidence. Regarding the challenged comments that were made during the state\u2019s closing argument, we note that defense counsel engaged in his own \u201cgeneral character assassination\u201d of the codefendants during his closing arguments.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments do not amount to prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The defendant next argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by suggesting that defense coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>sel acted improperly in his representation of the defendant. This claim also is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim rests on the prosecutor\u2019s following statements made during his closing argument: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m going to give you a little bit of a lecture right now. There are procedures where I can object during a closing argument, when things are inappropriate. And let me ask you this. How inappropriate is it for the defense attorney to stand up and to say that his client is innocent? He\u2019s not a witness in this case. Would he be willing to go on the stand under oath and subject himself to cross-examination? <em>It is as wrong for him to say he knows the defendant is innocent as it would be for me to come up to you and say, you know, I know a lot about this case and he\u2019s guilty. </em>That\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Assuming that those comments may be construed as an attack on defense counsel\u2019s representation of the defendant, we must evaluate the prosecutor\u2019s comments in light of defense counsel\u2019s argument that preceded them. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were made immediately following defense counsel's statement that sometimes when he meets somebody in a bar, he informs them that he is a lawyer and that he practices criminal defense. Defense counsel continued: \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to chill a relationship. So you represent all . . . those guilty people. How can you do that? ... I tell them . . . [i]t\u2019s easy to represent guilty people. It\u2019s when you represent the people that you know are not guilty, that\u2019s when it\u2019s tough. That\u2019s when the pressure is on. That\u2019s, really, the hardest part of this business. And I would submit to you that based on the record you have here, that [the defendant] is not guilty. Because to find him guilty you\u2019d have to be just as bad as the system, and I don\u2019t think you are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">We conclude that, although the prosecutor\u2019s comments may have been improper, defense counsel invited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>such comments. \u201cDefense counsel, like the prosecutor, must refrain from interjecting personal beliefs into the presentation of his case.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 8-9, 105 S. Ct, 1038, 84 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1985); see also Rules of Professional Conduct 3.4 (lawyer shall not in trial state personal opinion as to justness of cause, credibility of witness or guilt or innocence of accused). Whatever way in which counsel adroitly phrased his comments, counsel did what rule 3.4 prohibits. As we discussed previously, in determining whether the defendant\u2019s lights to due process and to a fair trial were violated, our focus is not on the culpability of the prosecutor, but rather on the impact such misconduct had on the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 769. We cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s comments greatly affected the defendant\u2019s rights, particularly in light of the court\u2019s instruction to the jury<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the fact that the comments were not repeated.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The defendant next argues that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the passions of the jurors. Specifically, the defendant claims that during closing argument, the prosecutor diverted \u201cthe jury\u2019s attention toward improper notions of its duty to protect society.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant further argues that the prosecutor improperly complained \u201cabout the failings of the \u2018system\u2019 in general\u201d during his rebuttal closing argument.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>We initially note that the defendant neither objected to the challenged comments nor requested a curative instruction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>58 Conn. App. 603, 620, 755 A.2d 279 (where counsel does not object or request curative charge, we presume counsel did not consider remarks as so prejudicial that client\u2019s right to fair trial was seriously jeopardized), cert. denied, 254 Conn. 923, 761 A.2d 755 (2000). After reviewing the transcript of the trial court proceedings, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument were not improper and, even if they were improper, they were not so egregious as to cause substantial prejudice to the defendant. \u201cIn determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s conduct was so egregious as to deny a defendant a fair trial, we note that some leeway must be afforded to the advocates in offering arguments to the jury in final argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 619. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were part of a wider argument discussing why the jury should care about the case, notwithstanding that the victim was an admitted drug dealer. Furthermore, unlike in <em>State </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>57 Conn. App. 202, 748 A.2d 318, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 914, 915, 754 A.2d 163 (2000), on which the defendant relies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the prosecutor did not express the \u201copinion that society would be in trouble if the defendant were not found guilty of murder.\u201d Id., 207. Rather, the prosecutor was explaining why the jurors should care about the case and not decide the case on the basis of their like or dislike of Burgos, an admitted drug dealer, who defense counsel earlier had urged was a beneficiary of a lax and lenient justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Regarding the prosecutor\u2019s comments during his rebuttal closing argument, we note that they immediately followed and were invited by defense counsel\u2019s argument about \u201cthe system.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We cannot say that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>rebuttal comments were improper in light of the parties\u2019 respective closing arguments. In so deciding, we are mindful that \u201c[i]n addressing the jury, [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of the argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>supra, 58 Conn. App. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor asked argumentative questions, interjected his personal opinions into the case, misstated the evidence and became an unsworn witness for the state. The defendant first contends that \u201c[i]n an attempt to impeach Cross, the prosecutor resorted to improper argumentative questions and interjected his personal opinions into the case.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We agree that the expression of the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>personal opinion as to Cross\u2019 veracity was improper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>56 Conn. App. 384, 391, 743 A.2d 640 (2000) (prosecutor may not express his own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to credibility of witnesses). We cannot say, however, that this isolated personal opinion rises to a level of substantial prejudice. This is especially so in light of the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the opinion or to seek a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We decline to review the defendant\u2019s additional claim that the prosecutor misstated Cross\u2019 testimony because, as the defendant acknowledges, the trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the complained of questioning.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The defendant also contends that the prosecutor misstated Curtis\u2019 testimony during closing argument. The record reveals that, notwithstanding Curtis\u2019 testimony that she contacted defense counsel one week after the defendant was arrested, the prosecutor stated that Curtis waited until she testified at trial \u201cto bring those facts to the light of anybody who could help her boyfriend out.\u201d Assuming that the prosecutor intentionally mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>stated Curtis\u2019 testimony, we cannot say that the misstatement substantially prejudiced the defendant.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The defendant further claims that the prosecutor became an unsworn witness for the state when, during his rebuttal argument, he chronicled his efforts to contact Curtis.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant challenges the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word \u201cI\u201d in reciting his office\u2019s efforts to communicate with Curtis. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Although we agree with the defendant that \u201c[ujndoubtedly, using the pronoun T in an argument increases the chances that appropriately structured arguments will deteriorate into expressions of personal opinion\u201d; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, 52 </em>Conn. App. 385, 401, 726 A.2d 657, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 920, 733 A.2d 233 (1999); there was little, if any, chance of that occurring in the present case. Here, the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of his office\u2019s efforts to speak with Curtis directly related to Curtis\u2019 earlier responses to the state\u2019s efforts to speak with her, all of which were before the jury.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In light of Curtis\u2019 earlier testimony, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>jury reasonably could have inferred that the prosecuting attorney directed the efforts of the inspectors in the present case. Moreover, the \u201c[u]se of the personal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>noun I is a normal and ordinary use of the English language. If courts were to ban the use of it, prosecutors would indulge in even more legaiese than the average lawyer, sounding even more stilted and unnatural.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 400. After reviewing the record, we conclude that these comments were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the prosecutor improperly commented on the appropriateness of Cross\u2019 and White\u2019s guilty pleas, thereby burdening the defendant\u2019s right to elect a jury trial.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>solely relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>734 So. 2d 670 (La. App. 1999), in support of his claim. In that case, the court overturned the defendant\u2019s conviction of theft on the ground that the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal comments that \u201c[t]he problem is that this self-confessed liar [a codefendant who testified for the state at trial] took responsibility for what he did and pled guilty. [The defendant] does not want to take responsibility for his actions\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 671-72; violated the presumption of the defendant\u2019s innocence under the Louisiana and federal constitutions. The Louisiana court reasoned that the prosecutor\u2019s comments led the jury \u201cto infer that because . . . the defendant . . . did not want to take responsibility for his actions, as did . . . the co-defendant . . . [the defendant] did not plead guilty.\u201d Id., 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Although \u201cimproper use of a co-conspirator\u2019s conviction infringes on the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 513; such use in the present case was not improper. Here, the prosecutor did not compare Cross\u2019 and White\u2019s guilty pleas with the defendant\u2019s plea, but rather used their guilty pleas as evidence of their credibility as witnesses. Moreover, the jury already was aware of Cross\u2019 and White\u2019s pleas in connection with the robbery of Burgos as each testified thereto, and defense counsel cross-examined each witness about his extensive criminal records, including their respective guilty pleas. See id., 511 (coconspirator\u2019s guilty plea and conviction may be introduced into evidence if coconspirator testifies at trial, so that fact finder will have appropriate facts to assess witness\u2019 credibility). When viewed in the context of the entire trial, we cannot say that these comments substantially prejudiced the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>63 Conn. App. 263, 277, 775 A.2d 338 (individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ual comments not scrutinized in vacuum, but are reviewed in context of entire trial), cert. denied, 256 Conn. 930, 776 A.2d 1148 (2001). Another factor mitigating against a conclusion of substantial prejudice is that defense counsel neither objected to nor requested a curative instruction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>supra, 58 Conn. App. 620. We conclude, therefore, that these comments were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">We conclude, in light of the foregoing determinations, that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the prosecutor engaged in a pattern of misconduct so egregious that the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was violated. For those same reasons, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claims do not satisfy the third condition under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-13\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1) and (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-14\"> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-15\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1) and (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b261-16\"> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b261-17\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\"> Pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b266-6\"> The statement provided in relevant part that the defendant wanted to rob Burgos, that the robbery occurred on West Clay Street in Waterbury and that the defendant, Griffith and White \u201cpistol whipped\u201d Burgos to get him to tell them where he kept his drugs and money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\"> In response to the state\u2019s questions, Cross testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u201cQ.

In weighing the testimony of an accomplice who was a self confessed criminal, you should consider that fact. It may be that you would not believe a person who has committed a crime as readily as you would believe a person of good character. In weighing the testimony of an accomplice who has not yet been sentenced or whose case has not been disposed of or who has not been charged with offenses in which the state has evidence, you should keep in mind that he may in his own mind be looking for some favorable treatment in the sentence or disposition of his own case, or hoping not to be arrested. Therefore, he may have such an interest in the outcome of this case that his testimony may have been colored by that fact. Therefore, you must look with particular care at the testimony of an accomplice and scrutinize it very carefully before you accept it. There are many offenses that are of such a character that the only persons capable of giving useful testimony are those who are themselves implicated in the crime. It\u2019s for you to decide what credibility you will give to a witness who has admitted his involvement in criminal wrongdoing, whether you will believe or disbelieve the testimony of a person who, by his own admission, has committed or contributed to the crime charged by the state here. Like all questions of credibility, this is a question that you must decide based on the evidence presented to you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\"> The defendant attached to his brief a computer printout detailing the number of times that the Waterbury Republican-American, a local newspaper, published stories about a Bridgeport criminal action in which a child witness and his mother were murdered. The defendant argues that because such coverage preceded the defendant\u2019s trial, the jury likely was exposed to it, and, thus, the prosecutor\u2019s comments, which implied that \u201cthe defendant would threaten physical violence toward a child in an attempt to influence trial testimony, is especially egregious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">We note that, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s present argument, he neither objected to the prosecutor\u2019s comments at trial nor filed a motion to set aside the verdict, a motion for a mistrial or a motion for a new trial based on that argument. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 777 (failure to object to allegedly prejudicial comments at trial often indicates that counsel did not view remarks as so prejudicial that client\u2019s right to fair trial was seriously jeopardized).

They brought all their resources in here against [the defendant] to protect a career criminal or drug dealer, someone who is really poisoning our city little by little everyday.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">\u201cNow, I want you to ask yourself that if tMs was one of your loved ones, would you be satisfied with tMs prosecution? If [the defendant] was your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>brother or your son, would you be satisfied with the way things turned out here? I mean, could you live with it? Would it sit right with you? I don\u2019t think that it would. I would submit to you that based on the evidence that you\u2019ve heard in this courtroom and the lack of evidence, that if you go into that room and you come out and you find [the defendant] not guilty on all of these charges, I think that you could be satisfied that you\u2019ve done the right thing and you can be proud of what you\u2019ve done because you\u2019d be basing it on the law. And I think when you went home and you explained to people why you found [the defendant] not guilty, then I think whoever you explain that to will be proud and would understand that all you did was follow the law. . . . And I would submit to you that based on the record you have here, that [the defendant] is not guilty. Because to find him guilty you\u2019d have to be just as bad as the system, and I don\u2019t think you are. And you\u2019d have to buy into the system\u2019s argument that these, you know, gang, bang and stickup kids are the people that you want to believe, that you want to trust . . . and I don\u2019t think you can do that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\"> The defendant\u2019s claim rests, in part, on the following colloquy between the prosecutor and Cross:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">\u201cA. What was the question?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">\u201cQ. Is this amusing to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">\u201cA. No, you know what I\u2019m saying? You keep asking the same damn questions, you know what I\u2019m saying?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">\u201cQ. I\u2019m trying to get you to tell the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">\u201cA.

And then what did [the defendant] do when you kicked in the door?</p>\n<p id=\"AYz\">\u201cA. I\u2019m not quite sure because I went directly in there behind him, do you know what I\u2019m saying, to do that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u201cQ. You went in behind him?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\u201cA. Yeah, I went in behind the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\u201cQ. And then where was [the defendant]?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">\u201cA. I\u2019m not quite sure. He was in the hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">\u201cQ. Who drove the car when you left?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">\u201cA. [The defendant].</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">\u201cQ. So, [the defendant] drove what you would call the getaway car?</p>\n<p id=\"Ay71\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Objection, Judge. That\u2019s what he\u2019s calling it.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao7\">\u201c[The Court]: I\u2019ll sustain the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-17\">\u201cQ. Is that the car you used to get away in?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-18\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-19\">\u201cQ. And [the defendant] drove that car?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-20\">\u201cA.

As soon as I heard her name, I sent inspectors out to her address. I sent inspector John Maia. There was testimony about that. He left a business card on her door. She did not call. I sent inspector Vincent Paolino. He left the car'd on her door. She did not call. I had the inspector talk to her neighbors and ask her to call us, and she didn\u2019t call. She was in court.

Did you think it would be a good idea to go and tell somebody at the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u201cA. No, I just wanted to \u2014 oh, no, I just spoke to attorney Crone.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">\u201cQ.

You didn\u2019t think maybe you could help him get out of jail by going and telling the truth?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">\u201cA. Well, I wanted the jury to hear, you know, I talked to attorney Crone.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">\u201cQ. So you decided to wait until this trial came along\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">\u201cA.

Just attorney Crone, that\u2019s it.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-21\">\u201cQ. So you never came and told us?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-22\">\u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-23\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b282-24\">\u201cQ.

Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-26\">\u201cQ. Requesting that you call our office?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-27\">\u201cA. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-28\">\u201cQ. And didn\u2019t inspector Solomita, who\u2019s sitting right here, ask you earlier today to come and talk to us and tell us what you knew?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-29\">\u201cA.

And how many times \u2014 how many notes did you find from inspectors from the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office on your door?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-37\">\u201cA. Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u201cQ. Two separate occasions?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">\u201cQ.

And did you make any efforts to call our office?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">\u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">\u201cQ. Were there phone numbers on those business cards?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">\u201cA. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">\u201cQ. Did you know where the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office was if you needed to talk to us?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">\u201cA. Well, it was on the card. It was.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">\u201cQ. And I think actually you got a card from inspector Paolino also. Not only inspector Maia and inspector Solomita, but also inspector Paolino left a card for you too, didn\u2019t he?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-19\">\u201cA.

What else could be more of an admission about the fact that he knows about the crime? Not only did he give the statement to the police, but then instead of going to trial he pled guilty. He admitted his responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-21\">\u201cAnd then we come to Demetrius White. I think you could tell that he was kind of the youngest of the group. He pled guilty to the crime, has known [the defendant] for his entire life. And I asked him do you have anything against [the defendant], do you have any reason to be trying to get him in trouble, and he said no. He said if you do the crime, you got to do the time. It\u2019s a pretty sophisticated attitude for somebody who, I think, said he was coming up on nineteen year s old. ... He pled guilty, he put the case behind him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
