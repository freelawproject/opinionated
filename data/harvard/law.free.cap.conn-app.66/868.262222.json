See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>War</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number><em>den, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 189, 640 A.2d 601 (1994); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>38 Conn. App. 99, 100, 659 A.2d 195, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 920, 661 A.2d 100 (1995); see also <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991). We therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner claimed that the commissioner of correction denied the petitioner\u2019s liberty interest in the extended family visitation program. The habeas court properly concluded that the petitioner does not have a liberty interest in access to visitors. <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>39 Conn. App. 674, 680, 667 A.2d 304 (1995); see also <em>Kentucky Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>490 U.S. 454, 460-61, 109 S. Ct. 1904, 104 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1989). Furthermore, department of correction Administrative Directive \u00a7 10.6 provides in relevant part that \u201cvisitation shall be considered a privilege and no inmate shall have entitlement to a visit.\u201d The court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-11\"> While the petitioner\u2019s appellate brief states the issue of whether the habeas court improperly denied his petition for a writ of mandamus, his brief does not-address that question. \u201cAn issue merely mentioned will be deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wragg, </em>61 Conn. App. 394, 395 n.l, 764 A.2d 216 (2001). We therefore do not address that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
