On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly (1) denied his petition for certification to appeal and (2) determined that he was not denied ineffective assistance of counsel. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">On September 19, 1997, the petitioner pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine to one count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1). The petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging ineffective assistance of coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>sel. Specifically, he alleged that his trial counsel failed to inform him that he would not receive credit for time served from his arrest date of April 30, 1996, through and including his sentencing date of September 19,1997. At the habeas hearing, the court heard conflicting testimony from the petitioner and his trial counsel regarding whether the petitioner was correctly informed of the sentencing consequences of his guilty plea. The court, finding trial counsel\u2019s testimony to be more credible, accordingly dismissed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">\u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal, a petitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. ... If the petitioner succeeds in surmounting that hurdle, the petitioner must then demonstrate that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed on the merits.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">\u201cThis court does not retry the case or evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Rather, we must defer to the [trier of fact\u2019s] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Colon </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>55 Conn. App. 763, 765, 741 A.2d 2 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 921, 744 A.2d 437 (2000). \u201cThe habeas judge, as the trier of facts, is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony. \u201d <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, 57 </em>Conn.

Daly, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 125a, p. 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">After thoroughly reviewing the record and briefs, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to make a substantial showing that he has been denied a state or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>federal constitutional right and, further, has failed to sustain his burden of persuasion that the habeas court\u2019s denial of his petition for certification to appeal was a clear abuse of discretion or that an injustice has been committed.
