The trial court sustained defendants\u2019 demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint without leave to amend and dismissed the action. The court found plaintiff\u2019s claim for invasion of her constitutional right of privacy was barred as a matter of law by the litigation privilege. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>find the litigation privilege inapplicable to the noncommunicative acts alleged in the complaint. We nevertheless find plaintiff cannot state a claim for liability against defendants because they obtained her medical and psychiatric records through the court\u2019s normal processes, including a court order. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The following facts are taken from the complaint and the transcript of the hearing on the prosecution\u2019s motion for a protective order in the underlying criminal case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Respondent Jeffrey Manning Carlton was charged in two criminal proceedings alleging narcotics violations as well as assault and battery charges against appellant Katherine Mansell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Carlton retained respondents Douglas W. Otto, Edward P. George, Jr., and Armand Arabian, to represent him in the criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">In preparing a defense to the criminal assault and battery charge respondents sought appellant\u2019s records from the hospital where she sought treatment. The complaint alleges respondents \u201ccaused a subpoena duces tecum to be served on the Veterans Administration Hospital in connection with the defense of defendant Carlton. Said Subpoena sought the medical and psychiatric records of Katherine Mansell aka Katherine Midtbo for the period from 1976 to the present.\u201d The subpoena requested \u201c[a]ny and all medical and psychiatric records of doctors or nurses or other medical professionals; records of all hospitalizations, results of any laboratory tests, x-rays, CAT scans, MRI screenings, or other diagnostic procedures; records of any medications prescribed and/or administered; records of diagnosis and treatment of any type performed and/or recommended; and records of all visits made to the emergency room and treatment received there for KATHERINE MIDTBO [aka Mansell] for the period of 1976 to the present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The complaint states the subpoena directed the custodian of records for the Veterans Administration Hospital to \u201cdeliver [the requested records] to Department 6 of the Long Beach Municipal Court . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">The hospital informed respondents records responsive to the subpoena could only be produced by court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Thereafter respondents applied ex parte for a court order directing release of the records sought in the subpoena. The ex parte application, and counsel\u2019s declaration in requesting the court order, mentioned only medical records. However, counsel\u2019s ex parte motion and declaration were apparently submitted with the original application for the subpoena duces tecum requesting both medical and psychiatric records. Judge Richard Lyman signed the order directing release of appellant\u2019s records. The order states in part: \u201cGOOD CAUSE APPEARING THEREFOR, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Custodian of Records for the Veterans Administration Hospital in Long Beach, California, produce the medical records of Katherine Mansell (DOB 2/12/58) aka Katherine Midtbo as described in the attached subpoena duces tecum served herewith . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">On receipt of the court order and subpoena the hospital sent appellant\u2019s records under seal to the court as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">From the allegations in appellant\u2019s complaint, it appears the court released the records to the prosecution, and that the prosecution in turn made copies of the records and gave them to the defense. Appellant\u2019s complaint alleges: \u201cPlaintiff is informed and believes that on November 4, 1999, Defendant OTTO requested of the Prosecution to make copies of the documents contained in the sealed envelope sent to the court. Said documents included medical and psychiatric records of plaintiff from 1976 and on. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Respondents read appellant\u2019s medical and psychiatric records and disseminated them to other members of the defense team.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">A few weeks later the prosecution sought a protective order directing all appellant\u2019s records be returned to the court. Judge William T. Gamer presided at the hearing. After extensive argument, the court treated the motion as a belated motion to quash, granted the motion, and ordered all records and derivative materials be returned. Specifically, the court ordered \u201cthe records be returned to the victim. And I\u2019m going to treat this motion as a motion to quash the subpoena duces tecum, and I\u2019m going to grant the motion to quash, [f] Now, I realize that it puts defense counsel at [Vc] a lot more work. They have to go through this process again. But next time maybe they will want to narrow the request down somewhat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Over the prosecutor\u2019s objection the court also expressly found respondents returned all documents in a timely fashion and further stated it was granting the motion to quash, but not because it believed respondents had \u201cduped\u201d Judge Lyman into issuing the court order for the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Appellant filed suit against respondents. Her complaint alleges a claim for invasion of the constitutional right of privacy under the California Constitution, article I, section 1, based on respondents and other members of the defense team reading her confidential mental health records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Respondents demurred to the complaint, arguing they were immune from liability under the litigation privilege of Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The trial court found the litigation privilege applied and sustained respondents\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend. Thereafter, the court entered judgment dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, we independently review the complaint to determine whether the facts alleged state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In doing so, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, \u201ctreating] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">II. <em>The Facts Respondents Received Appellant\u2019s Confidential Mental Health Records as a Result of a Court Order, and Only After Release by the Court, Combine to Preclude Potential Liability for Reading and Disseminating Those Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">\u201c[A] plaintiff alleging an invasion of privacy in violation of the state constitutional right to privacy must establish each of the following: (1) a legally protected privacy interest; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy in the circumstances; and (3) conduct by defendant constituting a serious invasion of privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">In this case, respondents do not contest appellant\u2019s complaint states a claim for violation of her constitutional right of privacy. Evidence Code section 1014 provides a statutory privilege of privacy which provides a patient the \u201cprivilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent another from disclosing a confidential communication\u201d between herself and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>psychotherapist.  This psychotherapist/patient privilege is also an aspect of the constitutional right to privacy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n                   Respondents claim the litigation privilege nevertheless immunizes them from liability for the alleged violation of her constitutional right of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The so-called litigation privilege found in Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b)(2) makes privileged a \u201cpublication or broadcast\u201d made in any \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d  As the Supreme Court explained, the litigation privilege of Civil Code section 47 \u201cis now held applicable to any communication, whether or not it amounts to a publication . . . , and all torts except malicious prosecution.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The privilege applies to any publication \u201c(1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Respondents\u2019 act of reading appellant\u2019s confidential psychiatric records satisfies these elements in only the most general sense: The act of reading her confidential records was related to a judicial proceeding, taken by the defense team of a litigant to achieve the object of preparing a defense to the charge in the pending criminal prosecution. However, we note nowhere in the complaint does appellant allege any of the information contained in those reports was testified to, or otherwise used in any judicial proceeding. Instead, the allegations of the complaint and judicially noticed facts reveal appellant instead complains several members of the defense team read her confidential psychiatric records. Because these acts describe noncommunicative conduct, it would appear the litigation privilege is not technically applicable. Indeed, in <em>Susan S. </em>v. <em>Israels </em>we expressly held the litigation privilege inapplicable to the unauthorized reading of confidential mental health records.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Our state\u2019s highest court has drawn a distinction between injury arising from communicative acts, which are privileged, and injury arising from noncommunicative conduct, which is not. In <em>Ribas v. </em>Clark<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the attorney for the plaintiffs wife eavesdropped on a telephone conversation between the wife and the plaintiff. The attorney then testified to the conversation in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>arbitration proceeding. The plaintiff sued the attorney alleging, among other things, violation of California\u2019s Invasion of Privacy Act<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and common law invasion of privacy. The trial court found the litigation privilege applied and sustained the attorney\u2019s demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed as to the privacy cause of action but affirmed as to the common law tort of invasion of privacy, noting the injury under the common law tort \u201cstems solely from defendant\u2019s testimony at the arbitration proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In upholding the cause of action based on the act of eavesdropping, and rejecting the cause of action based on testimony which resulted from the eavesdropping, the court made a distinction between the injury arising from noncommunicative conduct\u2014the attorney\u2019s eavesdropping\u2014and a communicative act\u2014the attorney\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The court reinforced the distinction between communicative and noncommunicative acts in <em>Kimmel v. Goland.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Kimmel, </em>the court held the litigation privilege did not shield mobilehome park management representatives from liability for their acts of unlawfully tape recording confidential conversations between the parties. The court emphasized, \u201cthe litigation privilege is plainly <em>not </em>applicable\u201d to the acts of tape recording.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court distinguished this unprivileged activity from any publication or broadcast of the information contained in those conversations. The <em>Kimmel </em>court noted, \u201ca review of the myriad cases that have applied section 47(2) to shield defendants from liability demonstrates that, without exception, the privilege has applied only to torts arising from statements or publications.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In the present case appellant argues the litigation privilege was equally inapplicable because her complaint alleged only noncommunicative conduct, i.e., reading her confidential mental health records. Moreover, she points out, this court in <em>Susan S. </em>plainly held unauthorized reading of confidential mental health records are noncommunicative acts for which the litigation privilege presents no bar to suit for personal injuries arising from this conduct.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">However, the mere act of reading confidential and privileged materials, or reading and disseminating such materials, cannot alone be sufficient to be an actionable invasion of a plaintiff\u2019s right of privacy. In other words, these acts cannot alone be the test for potential liability. There are likely several thousands, if not tens of thousands, of privileged and confidential records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>being read and disseminated at this very moment as litigants all over the state prepare for trial. Likely only a tiny fraction of these cases will ever result in claims of tortious invasions of privacy. There must be a reason for this. As the cases make clear, valid statutory or constitutional claims for invasion of privacy based on noncommunicative acts require something more to establish liability than simply the acts of reading and/or dissemination standing alone. We note the salient fact in each of the cases finding potential liability, the offending party did not even make an attempt at either prior judicial review or approval prior to reading and disseminating the confidential records. It was these facts of a total lack of judicial oversight and the voluntary disclosure of confidential materials which in combination gave rise to actionable claims for invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">For example, in <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Brownbridge</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a patient sued his psychotherapist for invasion of privacy. The patient\u2019s complaint alleged the psychotherapist \u201c \u2018voluntarily, and not as a result of [subpoena] or other legal compulsion\u2019 executed a written declaration describing his diagnosis of Cutter, as well as damaging personal details learned as a result of his being Cutter\u2019s therapist.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The patient\u2019s wife submitted the psychotherapist\u2019s declaration with her request to suspend the patient\u2019s visitation with their children. The doctor demurred on the ground the litigation privilege applied to immunize him from civil liability. Ultimately the trial court sustained the doctor\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The appellate court reversed, finding the litigation privilege did not provide blanket immunity for invasions of the constitutional right of privacy.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cWe conclude that, when disclosure of constitutionally protected material is contemplated, compliance with the Evidence Code requirements for claiming the privilege when that disclosure is sought and resort to the protective procedures provided are necessary prerequisites to protection of section 47, subdivision 2, immunity. Thus, a psychotherapist who volunteers information concerning a patient obtained in connection with their relationship, does so at his or her peril.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In <em>Urbaniak v. </em>Newton<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the plaintiff underwent medical procedures in connection with a workers\u2019 compensation claim. The plaintiff disclosed his HIV status to a nurse following a neurological test so hospital technicians would know to properly sterilize the equipment. The physician unnecessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>included information in his report regarding the plaintiffs HIV status. The physician then sent a copy of the report to the plaintiffs counsel, his employer\u2019s insurance carrier and to the carrier\u2019s counsel, who in turn sent a copy to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The plaintiff brought suit, claiming the gratuitous disclosure of his HIV status was an unconstitutional invasion of his right of privacy. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, finding dissemination of the report was privileged under Civil Code section 47 as a publication in a judicial proceeding.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The appellate court agreed the litigation privilege provided a valid defense for the insurance company, its counsel and the employer\u2019s counsel but only because they had no actual notice of facts suggesting an invasion of privacy, and because they received the doctor\u2019s report in discovery proceedings which did not indicate it was a confidential communication.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> However, the court reversed the judgment in favor of the doctor. \u201cThe allegations of the complaint support the inference that Dr. Newton knew of and ratified the use of the information confided to his nurse. The offending information had limited relevance to the medical examination. It would have been possible to mention the patient\u2019s concern over his health as a source of stress without specifically mentioning his HIV positive status. Under these circumstances, as in <em>Cutter v. Brownbridge, supra, </em>[183 Cal.App.3d] at page 848, \u2018[w]e have determined that the constitutional right to privacy outweighs the policies underlying the judicial proceedings immunity when private material is voluntarily published, without resort to a prior judicial determination.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In <em>Susan S. v. Israels,</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>defense counsel in a criminal prosecution for sexual battery served a subpoena duces tecum for the crime victim\u2019s records on the mental health facility where she sought treatment. The facility sent her mental health records directly to defense counsel. Defense counsel read the records, transmitted them to the defense psychiatrist, and used the information in cross-examining the crime victim at trial. The crime victim brought suit against defense counsel and his client for invasion of her constitutional right of privacy and other claims. The trial court sustained the defendants\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">This court affirmed the judgment of dismissal with regard to the other causes of action. However, we found the complaint stated a cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>for violation of her constitutional right of privacy. We noted the subpoena duces tecum process itself implicitly recognizes an expectation of privacy on the part of the person whose records are subpoenaed. It requires the witness to appear before the judge. In the alternative, the witness must place the records in a sealed envelope, and place the sealed envelope inside another envelope, and mail it to the clerk of the court. We stated confidential records should not be produced to the subpoenaing party \u201c \u2018until a judicial determination has been made that the person is legally entitled to receive them.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In <em>Susan S. </em>we concluded, \u201c[a] stranger\u2019s unauthorized reading and dissemination of a person\u2019s mental health records is a serious invasion of the person\u2019s privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We also found the litigation privilege inapplicable to defense counsel\u2019s noncommunicative act of reading these confidential records. \u201cSusan S.\u2019s cause of action for invasion of her constitutional right of privacy does not depend on the \u2018publication\u2019 or \u2018broadcast\u2019 of her mental health records but rests on Israels\u2019 conduct in reading those records. In this respect, Israel\u2019s conduct is similar to the defendants\u2019 conduct of eavesdropping on and secretly recording telephone conversations in <em>Ribas </em>v. <em>Clark </em>. . . and <em>Kimmel </em>v. <em>Goland . . . </em>,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In <em>Wise v. Thrifty Payless, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a customer sued a pharmacy for invasion of privacy for its unauthorized disclosure of prescription drug information to her husband. The customer gave the drugstore express directions not to release her prescription information to anyone because the couple was involved in acrimonious dissolution proceedings. Nevertheless, a pharmacy clerk provided her husband with a list of his wife\u2019s prescriptions when he claimed he needed them to prepare tax returns.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The husband used the information about his wife\u2019s prescription drug use in their child custody battle to accuse her of being a drug addict and a danger to the couple\u2019s children. Among other things, the husband also wrote to the Department of Motor Vehicles charging his wife with violating the Vehicle Code which prohibits a person addicted to drugs from driving a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The appellate court concluded if the wife included her husband as a defendant, \u201cthe litigation privilege would bar plaintiff from recovery of damages from him proximately caused by his use of the drug printout in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>family court and DMV proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In contrast, the court found Payless\u2019s act of voluntarily disclosing the wife\u2019s private medical information to her husband was \u201cclearly not\u201d covered by the litigation privilege. \u201cRegardless of whether the privilege protected Mr. Wise from liability for his subsequent communications in the litigation forum, Payless cannot avoid the insurmountable fact that <em>its communication </em>outside that forum enjoyed no such protection. We find no persuasive reason to confer section 47(b) immunity to one who wrongfully reveals confidential information simply because the disclosure <em>subsequently </em>becomes a hot potato in the course of court litigation or administrative hearings.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">In <em>Jeffrey H. v. Imai, Tadlock &amp; </em>Keeney<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> the plaintiff brought an action against a law firm and a secretary in the firm for invasion of the constitutional right of privacy and other claims. His complaint alleged the law firm had improperly released his hospital records in the underlying lawsuit, and in arbitration proceedings disclosed the results of his HIV tests to the arbitrator.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The trial court sustained the defendants\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The appellate court reversed the judgment as to the invasion of privacy cause of action and otherwise affirmed. The court stated, \u201cthe litigation privilege applies when the disclosure is made pursuant to a judicial determination, but, in the absence of a judicial ruling, the constitutional right to privacy may sometimes outweigh the policies underlying the privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The complaint alleged an intentional disclosure of the plaintiff\u2019s HIV test results which the defendants knew were improperly released by the hospital. Based on this allegation, the court concluded the constitutional right of privacy outweighed the policies underlying the litigation privilege.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In the present case, by contrast, respondents sought and received a court order for release of appellant\u2019s records. The court order expressly references the affidavit describing the records sought. We indulge the presumption the court performed its official duties before issuing the order,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> i.e., that the trial court read counsel\u2019s declaration and the affidavit and thereafter found good cause for release of the records before signing the order. Moreover, as noted, Judge Gamer in ordering appellant\u2019s hospital records returned, stated he was granting the motion to quash but not because he believed Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Lyman had been \u201cduped\u201d into issuing the court order for the blanket release of records not obviously necessary for the criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Also, unlike the cases noted above, in the present case appellant\u2019s confidential records were not delivered to counsel, but were delivered to the court under seal. It was the court who then released appellant\u2019s records to the prosecutor who, in turn, provided copies to respondents.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v. Hammon </em><footnotemark>45</footnotemark> the trial court in the underlying matter was under no legal compulsion at the pretrial stage of the proceedings to review appellant\u2019s records in camera to determine which, if any, of the records could be released to counsel under the now overruled authority of <em>People </em>v. <em>Reber </em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\"> Despite appellant\u2019s suggestion in her appellate briefs, she does not claim her injury arose from respondents\u2019 overly broad request for her medical and psychiatric records.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark>\n                   Instead, her claimed injury is the result of the court order requiring the hospital to release those records, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>and from the trial court\u2019s release of those records to the parties, apparently without further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>These facts establishing a judicial imprimatur distinguish the present case from those finding liability for the unauthorized dissemination of a patient\u2019s privileged records.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> These facts similarly preclude a finding of liability based on respondents\u2019 reading of those confidential records which they received through the prescribed judicial process <footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The judgment is affirmed.

However, this is not strictly accurate from respondents\u2019 perspective. As is perhaps normal during discovery, respondents\u2019 request was extremely broad. They sought as much information regarding appellant\u2019s medical and mental history as they thought might exist. From their perspective, the records they received were exactly what they asked for. There was nothing to indicate respondents thought release of any of the records was inadvertent.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">For this reason, the decision in <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>WPS, Inc. </em>(1999) 70 Cal App.4th 644 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 799] is inapplicable. In <em>State Compensation </em>the court held an attorney could comply with ethical standards, and not be disqualified, if upon receipt of confidential and privileged documents apparently sent inadvertently, the lawyer receiving such materials refrains from examining them beyond ascertaining their privileged nature, and immediately notifies the sender he or she possesses materials that appear to be privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Because respondents received the very documents they requested, it was not reasonably apparent to them appellant\u2019s records were provided through inadvertence. In any event, they did not refrain from examining the records, and certainly did not immediately notify the sender they were in receipt of apparently privileged records received inadvertently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\"><em> People </em>v. <em>Hammon </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1117 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 938 P.2d 986].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\"><em> People </em>v. <em>Reber </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 523 [223 Cal.Rptr. 139], expressly disapproved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hammon, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 1117, 1123.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b293-12\"> The dissenting justice is of the view appellant could validly state a claim for invasion of privacy if given the chance to amend her complaint to allege respondents deliberately misled the trial court regarding the nature and extent of the records sought which induced the court to sign the court order for their release.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">This would be an allegation of intentional misrepresentation, describing communicative conduct, and in a judicial setting. Such an allegation would present the classic scenario for application of the litigation privilege, presenting a bar to any such amended complaint. That this is so is made plain by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Silberg </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>which concluded the litigation privilege presents an absolute bar to even deliberately or recklessly false communications. In <em>Silberg, </em>the court emphasized the litigation privilege \u201cpromotes the effectiveness of judicial proceedings by encouraging attorneys to zealously protect their clients\u2019 interests. \u2018[I]t is desirable to create an absolute privilege . . . not because we desire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>to protect the shady practitioner, but because we do not want the honest one to have to be concerned with [subsequent derivative] actions. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Silberg </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d 205, 214.) Based on this rationale, the high court rejected several Court of Appeal decisions which had imposed a requirement the communication promote the interest of justice as a prerequisite to a valid claim of litigation privilege. In so doing the court observed such a rule is \u201cwholly inconsistent with the numerous cases in which fraudulent communications or perjured testimony have nevertheless been held privileged.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Numerous decisions before and after the court\u2019s <em>Silberg </em>decision recognize the litigation privilege presents a bar to actions, even when based on fraudulent representations, forgery, negligent or intentional omissions, and other types of tortious communications. (See, e.g., <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Bidwell </em>(1884) 65 Cal. 489 [4 P. 491] [complaint alleged charges of arson were falsely fabricated as was testimony at trial]; <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Thrift Payless, Inc., supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th 1296 [husband affirmatively misled pharmacy clerk to get copies of wife\u2019s prescription drugs for his own improper ulterior motives]; <em>Sacramento Brewing Co. v.

George McDonald Law Corp. </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 988 [160 Cal.Rptr. 505] [counsel\u2019s negligent representation insurer was financially sound when it was in fact insolvent was a publication protected by the litigation privilege]; <em>Pettitt v. Levy </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 484, 489 [104 Cal.Rptr. 650] [litigation privilege protected defendants who prepared and presented false and forged documents to city council and planning commission. \u201cPreparing and presenting false documents is equivalent to the preparation and presentation of false testimony. Since there is no exception to the privilege when the testimony is perjured, by a parity of reasoning no exception should apply to the preparation and presentation of false documentary evidence.\u201d]; <em>Kachig v. Boothe </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 626 [99 Cal.Rptr. 393] [litigation privilege protected peijury, as well as manufactured evidence].)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Moreover, the presence or absence of malice or good or bad faith is irrelevant to the inquiry whether the litigation privilege is applicable. <em>(Silberg v. Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d 205, 216 [\u201cit must be concluded that the \u2018without malice\u2019 requirement applies only to those allegations against correspondents published in the pleadings and affidavits filed in dissolution proceedings, and that otherwise the Legislature intended section 47(2) to apply to <em>all </em>publications, irrespective of their maliciousness.\u201d (Italics in original.)]; <em>Albertson v. Raboff </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 375 [295 P.2d 405] [allegations defendant maliciously asserted false claims to real property, knowing he had no right to a lien were no bar to application of the litigation privilege]; <em>Pettitt </em>v. <em>Levy, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.3d 484, 488 [\u201cThe privilege is an absolute one because it protects publications made with actual malice or with the intent to do harm.\u201d].) Thus, in this case the result would be the same whether respondents deliberately, intentionally or negligently misrepresented facts to the judge to induce him to sign the court order for appellant\u2019s mental health records. Given this state of the law, it would be futile to allow an amendment to assert a claim for invasion of privacy based on allegations of respondents\u2019 affirmative misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The decisions the dissenting justice relies on for an opposite conclusion do not support a contrary finding. Both <em>Malley v. Briggs </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 335 [106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271] and <em>Lombardi v. City of El Cajon </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 117 F.3d 1117 concern actions for violations of federal civil rights, and for alleged violations by police officers of their constitutional obligations. They do not purport to construe California\u2019s constitutional right to privacy, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>California\u2019s statutory litigation privilege. Moreover, the police officer defendants in these decisions were acting under state color of authority, and thus are at maximum entitled to only a qualified immunity <em>(Malley </em>v. <em>Briggs, supra, </em>475 U.S. 335, 340-341 [106 S.Ct. 1092, 1098]), in contrast to the absolute immunity the litigation privilege affords. Accordingly, these decisions are distinguishable. In addition, the fact, as the dissent notes, respondents\u2019 statements may have evidentiary value in some other or future proceeding does not alter the conclusion the litigation privilege would provide respondents immunity from liability in the present action alleging a single cause of action for invasion of privacy. <em>(Oren Royal Oaks Venture </em>v. <em>Greenberg, Bernhard, Weiss &amp; Karma, Inc. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1157, 1168 [232 Cal.Rptr. 567, 728 P.2d 1202] [discussing potential evidentiary value of otherwise privileged statements in a related abuse of process or malicious prosecution action]; <em>Shade Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Innovative Products Sales &amp; Marketing, Inc. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847, 914-915 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 364] [in the context of a bad faith action against insurers].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b295-11\"> Compare <em>Coverdell </em>v. <em>Department of Social and Health Services </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 834 F.2d 758, 764-765 (social worker was entitled to absolute quasi judicial immunity from liability for actions taken in faithfully executing a valid court order).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\"> In light of our conclusion, we need not, and do not, reach respondents\u2019 alternative arguments for affirming the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b295-8\">PERLUSS, P.

In light of the holding and rationale of <em>Susan S., </em>however, I would grant Ms. Mansell an opportunity to amend her complaint to allege respondents deliberately misled the criminal trial court to obtain the initial discovery order and to attempt to prove her claim for invasion of her constitutional right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>1. <em>Case Law Other Than Susan S. Recognizes That Ancillary Noncommunicative Conduct Does Not Defeat the Litigation Privilege</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">As originally filed Ms. Mansell\u2019s complaint focused on the respondents\u2019 alleged lack of good cause for discovery of her psychiatric records dating back to 1976, the omission from the ex parte application of any specific reference to psychiatric records and the failure of the subpoena to propose an in camera court review of the documents prior to their disclosure, the procedure recognized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Reber </em>(1986) <em>177 </em>Cal.App.3d 523, 531-532 [223 Cal.Rptr. 139] <em>(Reber) </em>as the appropriate method for a criminal defendant to obtain privileged records by demonstrating his or her need for the information outweighed the crime victim/patient\u2019s interest in confidentiality.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if some aspect of this allegedly tortious course of conduct involved a noncommunicative act (reading the records before disclosing them to others, including potential expert witnesses for use in cross-examining Ms. Mansell at Carlton\u2019s criminal trial), but for <em>Susan S. </em>I would conclude respondents\u2019 discovery efforts were communicative in their essential nature and therefore within the privilege of section 47, subdivision (b). (See <em>Rubin v. Green </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1187, 1195-1196 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 847 P.2d 1044] [fact that defendants\u2019 communications \u201cnecessarily involved related acts\u201d does not destroy privilege]; <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>v. <em>Kompa </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 130, 134 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 602] [\u201c[T]he scope of \u2018publication or broadcast\u2019 includes noncommunicative conduct like the filing of a motion for a writ of sale [citation], the filing of assessment liens [citation], or the filing of a mechanic\u2019s lien [citation]. The privilege also applies to conduct or publications occurring outside the courtroom . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In <em>Brown v. Kennard </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 40 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 891], for example, the plaintiff complained the defendant\u2019s allegedly wrongful levy pursuant to a writ of execution constituted an abuse of process. Seeking to avoid the bar of the litigation privilege, the plaintiff asserted the defendant\u2019s noncommunicative act in wrongfully levying on his bank account (as opposed to the communicative acts of obtaining a judgment and applying for the writ of execution) deprived him of his property interest in that account, causing injury outside of the judicial proceeding. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 49.) The Court of Appeal rejected this purported distinction: \u201cThe act of applying for a writ is privileged. The privilege extends to torts arising from the privileged statement or publication. As such, not only does the privilege protect the application for the writ of execution, it also extends to the act of carrying out the directive of the writ. To hold otherwise would effectively strip the litigation privilege of its purpose.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 50, fhs. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Similarly in the case at bar, respondents\u2019 act of applying for the order requiring production of Ms. Mansell\u2019s psychiatric records is privileged under section 47, subdivision (b). <em>(O\u2019Keefe v. Kompa, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 135 [even an act committed fraudulently is covered by litigation privilege].) The privilege, therefore, should also extend to respondents\u2019 acts in carrying out the directive of the discovery order they obtained. (See <em>Wise v. Thrifty Payless, Inc. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1296, 1301-1302 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 437] [husband\u2019s conduct in obtaining confidential information concerning wife\u2019s prescription drug purchases without a court order or formal discovery proceedings is protected by litigation privilege].)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In <em>Susan S., supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th 1290, however, this court held a defense attorney\u2019s unauthorized reading of a crime victim\u2019s confidential mental health records violated the victim\u2019s constitutional right of privacy and that such conduct was not immune from liability under the litigation privilege even though the records were obtained in a judicial proceeding through service of a subpoena duces tecum. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1294, 1299; see <em>People v.

Susan S., we held, had a reasonable expectation of privacy in her mental health records \u201csubject to a court determination whether any of those records should be disclosed to [respondents] prior to their disclosure.\u201d <em>(Susan S., </em>at p. 1298.)

Unlike <em>Susan S., </em>however, where there was no judicial review of any sort prior to defense counsel\u2019s discovery of the victim\u2019s confidential records, here the crime victim\u2019s psychiatric records were obtained with a modicum of judicial participation: Although the court in fact ordered production of only the victim\u2019s medical records, the subpoena duces tecum enforced by that order identified both medical and psychiatric records.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Notwithstanding this distinction between <em>Susan S. </em>and the present case\u2014 crucial to the majority\u2019s analysis\u2014I would grant Ms. Mansell leave to amend her complaint to include additional allegations that defense counsel intentionally misled the criminal court to obtain the order arguably allowing discovery of her psychiatric records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With those amended allegations I believe Ms. Mansell can plead each of the three elements required to state a cause of action for invasion of her constitutional right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">2. <em>Ms. Mansell Has Demonstrated a Reasonable Possibility She Can Amend Her Complaint to Allege Respondents Deliberately Misled the Criminal Trial Court to Obtain the Initial Discovery Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In her briefs on appeal and during oral argument, Ms. Mansell has alleged defense counsel in the criminal proceeding affirmatively misled the trial court in order to obtain the discovery order now invoked as immunizing counsel\u2019s conduct. In support of her proposed allegations, Ms. Mansell can point to the following matters: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>sought \u201cthe <em>medical </em>records of the alleged victim in this case\u201d (italics added), and suggested those records were needed because the nature and extent of \u201cher [Ms. Mansell\u2019s] alleged injuries\u201d were material to the defense of the ongoing criminal case against his client, which included a charge of battery with serious bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 243, subd. (d)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\u2014 The ex parte application for an order directing the custodian of records at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Long Beach to produce records in response to defense counsels\u2019 subpoena duces tecum referred only to Ms. Mansell\u2019s <em>\u201cmedical </em>records.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">\u2014 The declaration of Douglas W. Otto in support of the ex parte application explained that a prior, unsuccessful subpoena had similarly</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u2014 The application for subpoena duces tecum (which may or may not have been attached to the material submitted to the court) asserts the records requested \u201care material to the issues involved in this case as they will provide information about the alleged victim\u2019s <em>medical </em>history and treatment for alleged injuries.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u2014 Most significantly, the court order itself, prepared by defense counsel and upon which they rely to create an absolute privilege against liability for invading Ms. Mansell\u2019s privacy, directs the custodian of records to \u201cproduce <em>the medical records </em>of Katherine Mansell (DOB 2/12/58) aka Katherine Midtbo as described in the attached subpoena duces tecum served herewith.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">To be sure, the application for subpoena duces tecum (but not the subpoena itself) includes in its description of documents to be produced \u201c[a]ny and all medical and psychiatric records.\u201d But it remains disputed whether that application was actually attached to the material submitted to Judge Richard Lyman when he signed the order directing production of medical records. Indeed, the minute order for the December 9, 1999 hearing at which Judge William Gamer granted the motion to quash the subpoena expressly states the court was making no finding whether the subpoena was attached to Judge Lyman\u2019s signed order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Even if the subpoena and application had been part of the package presented to Judge Lyman, however, it is by no means clear to me, at least under the rationale of <em>Susan S., </em>that Ms. Mansell is precluded as a matter of law from proving defense counsel attempted to mislead the court by requesting an order requiring production of medical records, not medical and psychiatric records, and presenting the court with a form of order doing just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>that.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Certainly Evidence Code section 664, which directs us to \u201cpresume[ ] that official duty has been regularly performed\u201d\u2014a rebuttable presumption affecting only the burden of proof (Evid. Code, \u00a7 660)\u2014does not justify a conclusive determination that respondents properly obtained court authorization to read and disseminate Ms. Mansell\u2019s psychiatric records.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">3. <em>Under Susan S. a Crime Victim Has a Cause of Action for Invasion of Her Constitutional Right to Privacy against a Defense Attorney Who Deliberately Misleads the Court to Obtain Confidential Psychiatric Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\u201c[A] plaintiff alleging an invasion of privacy in violation of the state constitutional right to privacy must establish each of the following: (1) a legally protected privacy interest; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy in the circumstances; and (3) conduct by defendant constituting a serious invasion of privacy.\u201d <em>(Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 39-40 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633].)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Our decision in <em>Susan S. </em>recognized an individual\u2019s legally protected privacy interest in his or her mental health records <em>(Susan S., supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 1295; accord, <em>Jeffrey H. v. Imai, Tadlock &amp; Keeney </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 345, 353 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 916] [zones of privacy created by Cal. Const, art. I, \u00a7 1, extend to the details of an individual\u2019s medical history]), as well as a crime victim\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy in those confidential records. <em>(Susan S., </em>at p. 1295 [\u201cSusan S. did not lose her right to privacy in her mental health records because she charged Keables with sexual battery\u201d].) We emphasized there is nothing \u201c \u2018inevitable\u2019 \u201d about the disclosure of such records in a criminal case since \u201cdiscovery requires a careful balancing of the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to cross-examination and the complaining witness\u2019s right of privacy. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1297.)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The viability of Susan S.\u2019s claim for invasion of her right to privacy in the circumstances of that case rested in large part on the defendants\u2019 failure to comply with the four-step procedure for pretrial disclosure of confidential psychiatric records established in <em>Reber, supra, 171 </em>Cal.App.3d at pages 531-532. <em>(Susan S., supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 1296.) Shortly after our decision in <em>Susan S., </em>the Supreme Court in <em>People v. Hammon, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 1117, 1123 <em>(Hammon) </em>expressly disapproved <em>Reber </em>and held a criminal defendant has no right to pretrial disclosure of a crime victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>privileged psychiatric records: \u201cWhen a defendant proposes to impeach a critical prosecution witness with questions that call for privileged information, the trial court may be called upon ... to balance the defendant\u2019s need for cross-examination and the state policies the privilege is intended to serve. [Citation.] Before trial, the court typically will not have sufficient information to conduct this inquiry; hence, if pretrial disclosure is permitted, a serious risk arises that privileged material will be disclosed unnecessarily.\u201d <em>(Hammon, </em>at p. 1127.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Under <em>Hammon </em>(as Judge Gamer recognized when he quashed the subpoena on December 9, 1999) criminal defendant Jeffrey Carlton and his defense counsel simply had no right to pretrial disclosure of Ms. Mansell\u2019s psychiatric records, even upon a heightened showing of good cause; and Ms. Mansell necessarily had a reasonable expectation that the confidentiality of her records would be respected, at least prior to the commencement of Carlton\u2019s trial. If respondents were unaware of this controlling authority and reasonably believed they were entitled to discover the records, Ms. Mansell\u2019s cause of action for invasion of privacy will undoubtedly fail. However, to the extent Ms. Mansell can allege and ultimately prove defense counsel deliberately avoided the restrictions on pretrial criminal discovery announced in <em>Hammon </em>by affirmatively misleading Judge Lyman as to the nature of the records sought by their subpoena duces tecum, she will have established, at least in my view, conduct by the defendants constituting a serious invasion of privacy. A properly obtained court order enforcing a subpoena duces tecum for psychiatric records would (notwithstanding <em>Hammon) </em>negate an essential element of the invasion of privacy cause of action \u2014\u201can egregious breach of the social norms underlying the privacy right.\u201d <em>(Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 37.) An order obtained by successful efforts to mislead the court should not. <em>(Ibid. </em>[\u201cActionable invasions of privacy must be sufficiently serious in their nature, scope, and actual or potential impact to constitute an egregious breach of the social norms underlying the privacy right. Thus, the extent and gravity of the invasion is an indispensable consideration in assessing an alleged invasion of privacy.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The majority\u2019s answer to this analysis is, in effect, to assert Ms. Mansell\u2019s allegations regarding misrepresentations by defense counsel to the court as to the nature of the records sought by their subpoena duces tecum are irrelevant because those statements would be absolutely protected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>litigation privilege. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 278-279, in. 47.) I agree the litigation privilege immunizes defense counsel from tort liability for any misrepresentations to the court, whether or not intentional or in bad faith. <em>(Brown v. Kennard, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 45 [\u201cBecause the privilege applies without regard to malice or evil motives, it has been characterized as \u2018absolute.\u2019\u201d]; see <em>Silberg v. Anderson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 214 [266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But that immunity does not preclude Ms. Mansell from introducing evidence of respondents\u2019 allegedly misleading statements to prove that they, like defense counsel in <em>Susan S., </em>intended to obtain her confidential psychiatric records by improperly evading meaningful judicial oversight of their discovery efforts. <em>(Oren Royal Oaks Venture v. Greenberg, Bernhard, Weiss &amp; Karma, Inc. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1157, 1168 [232 Cal.Rptr. 567, 728 P.2d 1202] [\u201c \u2018The privileges of Civil Code section 47, unlike evidentiary privileges which function by the exclusion of evidence [citation], operate as limitations upon liability.\u2019 Indeed, on brief reflection, it is quite clear that section 47 [, subdivision] (2) has never been thought to bar the <em>evidentiary </em>use of every \u2018statement or publication\u2019 made in the course of a judicial proceeding .... Thus, while section 47 [, subdivision] (2) bars certain tort causes of action which are predicated on a judicial statement or publication itself, the section does not create an evidentiary privilege for such statements. Accordingly, when allegations of misconduct properly put an individual\u2019s intent at issue in a civil action, statements made during the course of a judicial proceeding may be used for evidentiary purposes in determining whether the individual acted with the requisite intent. [Citations.]\u201d (Italics omitted.)]; accord, <em>Shade Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Innovative Products Sales &amp; Marketing, Inc. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847, 914-915 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 364] [statements made during a judicial proceeding may be used to prove bad faith in an action against an insurer].)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized a criminal suspect\u2019s right to pursue a damage claim against an overzealous police officer who has submitted a false or objectively unreasonable application for a search warrant, notwithstanding the fact that a judicial officer issued the warrant after finding probable cause. <em>(Malley v. Briggs </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 335, 345 [106 S.Ct. 1092, 1098, 89 L.Ed.2d 271].) \u201c[I]n an ideal system an unreasonable request for a warrant would be harmless, because no judge would approve it. But ours is not an ideal system, and it is possible that a magistrate, working under docket pressures, will fail to perform as a magistrate should. We find it reasonable to require the officer applying for the warrant to minimize this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>danger by exercising reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 345-346 [106 S.Ct. at p. 1098]; see <em>Lombardi </em>v. <em>City of El Cajon </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 117 F.3d <em>1117, 1118 </em>[\u201cspecific intent <em>to </em>deceive the issuing court is not an element (in addition to a substantial showing of deliberate or reckless falsehood or omission that is material to the probable cause determination) that the plaintiff must show in order to survive summary judgment on a claim of qualified immunity in a civil rights action seeking damages\u201d].) A crime victim who has suffered an invasion of her constitutional right to privacy at the hands of overzealous defense counsel deserves no less protection.
