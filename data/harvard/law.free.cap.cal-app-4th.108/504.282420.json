(Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1); further statutory references are to the Penal Code.) He admitted allegations that he personally used a knife (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)), that he personally inflicted great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7), and that he suffered a November 2000 strike conviction (\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i)) in Kitsap County, Washington. His counsel stipulated that there is a factual basis for the charge and the allegations. In exchange, a count of attempted premeditated murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 664) was dismissed along with allegations of knife use and great bodily injury. Defendant was sentenced to a stipulated state prison term of 12 years. He obtained a certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">On appeal, defendant contends the matter must be remanded for resentencing because his November 2000 conviction is not a strike. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">On September 25, 2000, defendant and Derek Jasmer went drinking at several bars. Shortly after leaving Gil\u2019s bar that evening, defendant told Jasmer that he had to speak with him. As they sat on a curb in the back of a parking lot, defendant pulled back Jasmer\u2019s head and put a knife to his neck. Defendant said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d and told Jasmer not to mention defendant\u2019s name or the name of the motorcycle gang, \u201cThe Resurrection.\u201d When Jasmer pleaded, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d defendant cut Jasmer\u2019s throat. Jasmer threw defendant off of him and ran toward the street, where he flagged down a motorist and was transported to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Defendant effectively contends his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by allowing him to admit the strike allegation and by stipulating to its factual basis. Noting that the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law applies to persons who \u201ccommit a felony and <em>have been previously convicted </em>of serious and/or violent felony offenses\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> italics added), he argues that the law does not apply to him because he committed the present offense in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>September 2000, and was <em>subsequently, </em>not previously, convicted of the Washington offense in November 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The People claim the Three Strikes law applies even though defendant committed the present offense before he suffered his \u201cprior\u201d strike conviction. They argue, \u201cIf the Legislature had intended for section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) to apply only if the current offense was committed after a prior conviction, it could have easily said so. Instead of stating that the three strikes law provides increased punishment \u2018for those who commit a felony and <em>have been previously </em>convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses,\u2019 subdivision (b) could have been written to state that the three strikes law provides increased punishment \u2018for those who commit a felony <em>after having been </em>convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u2019 \u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The People\u2019s argument is puzzling because its two alternative formulations mean the same thing. The word \u201cpreviously\u201d means the <em>conviction </em>for a serious or violent felony <em>must precede </em>the present felony; the present felony must be committed <em>after </em>the serious or violent felony conviction. Here, the opposite occurred; the present crime occurred in September 2000, the serious or violent felony evidently was committed in October 2000, and the serious or violent felony <em>conviction </em>occurred in November 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The People rely on <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1632 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 448], but their reliance is misplaced. In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant had been convicted of a burglary before committing the present burglary offense, but the judgment on the prior burglary conviction was not pronounced until after the commission of the present offense. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1637.) The defendant argued that a \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d requires both a verdict and pronouncement of judgment, and because the judgment on the prior burglary was not pronounced until after the current felony the offense was not a strike. The court rejected this argument, explaining: \u201cThe focus of the three strikes law is <em>conduct: </em>did the defendant commit a felony after having previously committed one or more serious or violent felonies? When a defendant pleads guilty to or is convicted of a felony, the law is satisfied factually that he or she committed it.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1638, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">In this case, defendant did not \u201ccommit [the present] felony after having previously committed\u201d a serious or violent felony; rather, he committed the serious or violent felony <em>after </em>he committed the present felony. <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>Williams, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at p. 1638; see fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>The Three Strikes law did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Defense counsel did not waive this error by stipulating that there was a factual basis for the strike allegation. Defendant\u2019s admission and his counsel\u2019s stipulation took the place of a fact finder\u2019s determination that the prior conviction existed. It was the trial court\u2019s function to determine whether that prior conviction constituted a \u201cstrike.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Epps </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 19, 23 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 572, 18 P.3d 2]; <em>People v. Kelii </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 452, 454, 457 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 674, 981 P.2d 518].)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">However, defendant is not entitled to a reduction of his stipulated prison sentence. In exchange for the plea and admissions, defendant avoided a possible punishment for attempted premeditated murder of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. (\u00a7 664, subd. (a).) The People claim that defendant, after having gained the benefit of his plea bargain, cannot now prevail on his claims that the Three Strikes law does not apply and that his 12-year term must be reduced by four years. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u201c \u2018Where defendants have pleaded guilty in return for a specified sentence, appellate courts are not inclined to find error even though the trial court acts in excess of jurisdiction in reaching that figure, as long as the court does not lack fundamental jurisdiction. [Citations.] The rationale behind this policy is that defendants who have received the benefit of their bargain should not be allowed to \u201ctrifle with the courts\u201d by attempting to better the bargain through the appellate process.
