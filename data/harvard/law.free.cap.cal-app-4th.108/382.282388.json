Without actual or prospective damage proved, there can be no inverse condemnation award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">On appeal, we consider two questions: (1) did the trial court utilize the correct legal standard in deciding that CUNA\u2019s mitigation expenses were not recoverable; and (2) is compensable physical injury necessary before a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>property owner may recover mitigation expenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude: (1) a property owner is entitled to recover reasonable costs incurred to mitigate damage to the property that the property owner reasonably and in good faith believed would be caused by a work of public improvement even if post-mitigation events indicate there would have been no damage; (2) the trial court prejudicially erred by requiring CUNA to show that, \u201cbut for\u201d the mitigation repairs, the Building in fact would have been damaged; and (3) actual physical damage to the subject property is not a prerequisite to an award of mitigation damages. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Built in 1926, the Building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the Los Angeles Conservancy holds a conservation easement that requires the Building owner to preserve it in good repair. Constructed of reinforced concrete, the Building is comprised of a six-story office building located on the northern most portion of the lot, facing onto the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard. An attached theater is situated behind the office building. A full basement below the footprint of the office building extends beyond the north property line to below the Walk of Fame. A subbasement is located below the footprint of the office building. Except for the basement walls beneath the Walk of Fame, the foundation for the Building consists of a series of piles, the tips of which are driven into old alluvium soil.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The tunnels for the Hollywood/Highland Metro Rail Station (the station) run beneath Hollywood Boulevard and pass directly north of the Building. The station itself is located just beyond the Building\u2019s northeast comer. In preparation for construction of the subway system, MTA commissioned a series of investigations resulting in reports regarding the geotechnical characteristics of the land affected by the project. According to a May 1990 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>report: \u201cThe need for underpinning the adjacent existing buildings depends on whether their foundations are adequate or whether the buildings can satisfactorily undergo the anticipated settlements due to excavation and construction. Each adjacent building should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">According to a January 1992 report, the Building was located \u201coutside the zone of influence of the tunneling. However[,] the basement vault beneath the Hollywood Boulevard sidewalk, which is not pile supported, will be affected by the tunneling.\u201d This report anticipated minor cracking to the Building facade, but recommended any damage be repaired after tunneling was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">A November 1993 report predicted station excavation could cause \u201csome ground settlement or angular distortion at ground surface within 60 to 70 feet of station outline.\u201d At its closest point, the excavation for the station was expected to be approximately 14 feet from the face of the Building. The November 1993 report opined settlement and angular distortion would \u201cgenerally be small, if proper construction techniques are followed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In January 1994, the Building was extensively damaged in the Northridge earthquake. The most serious damage occurred at the Building\u2019s west wall, primarily at the south end, less so at the north end. Seismic upgrades to the west wall began that summer and were completed by September 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Meanwhile in 1994, MTA had begun tunneling along Hollywood Boulevard in the first stage of construction of the Metro Rail Red Line. In August 1994, tunneling stopped because of excessive settlement. Tunneling eventually recommenced, and by March 1995, both the north and south tunnels had passed in front of the Building. The tunneling caused building settlement of almost one-fourth (0.23) inch.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">In June 1995, the Building owner hired The J. Byer Group, Inc., a geotechnical consulting firm (J. Byer), to assist in the design and completion of seismic upgrading by evaluating the engineering properties of the earth materials beneath the Building. In this context, J. Byer employed various subsurface exploration techniques, including manometer surveys on the basement and subbasement levels of the Building, in addition to using data <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>obtained from MTA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> J. Byer advised that the manometer surveys were also useable to quantify building settlement associated with construction of the station. In August 1995, Ryland Associates prepared a seismic hazard evaluation of the Building using, among other things, data obtained from previous reports, including those obtained from MTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In October 1995, J. Byer informed the Building owner that surveys conducted on behalf of MTA between August 1993 and May 1995 established the Building had settled one-fourth of an inch. Similar surveys conducted on behalf of the Building owner concluded the Building had settled between one-fourth and one-third of an inch. J. Byer opined that construction of the station \u201cwill induce more than <em>Va </em>inch of settlement on a portion of the building. [MTA reports indicated that] one episode of very rapid settlement accounted for most of the settlement during construction of the tunnels. It might be structurally unacceptable to incur <em>V2 </em>inch or more of rapid settlement before defensive measures are taken. It is recommended that the structural engineer establish what the acceptable tolerances for differential settlement are. [ft] At least <em>Va </em>inch of settlement within 50 feet of the station excavation should be expected. Therefore, defensive measures should be implemented now and not after additional settlement.\u201d J. Byer warned: \u201c[d]eflection of the shoring system, settlement, and ground losses have occurred at other Metro Red Line station construction sites and should be anticipated for this site.\u201d Structural engineers Ismail Associates, Inc., advised the Building owner to ensure that MTA was taking steps to prevent problems relating to the proximity of the construction to the Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In a letter dated November 20, 1995, counsel for the Building owner requested MTA to underpin the front portion of the Building. At a meeting on March 13, 1996, after several months of negotiations, MTA agreed to pay $23,500 for the design of an underpinning system and a portion of the construction costs of a support system for the north wall of the Building. The offer was confirmed in writing on March 28.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the time, work on the station was slated to begin on May 17. Less than two weeks later, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Building owner\u2019s structural engineering firm, Robert Englekirk Consulting Structural Engineers, Inc., (REI) gave MTA its proposal for \u201cthe design of permanent underpinning for vertical loads of those elements of the Building affected by the construction of the MTA Hollywood/Highland Station\u201d for an estimated fee of $50,000, on a time and material basis due to the \u201cgreat uncertainty in work involving underpinning existing buildings.\u201d The design-build firm of Hayward Baker, Inc., proposed to do the construction work in accordance with the scope of work outlined by REI for $526,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">At a meeting on April 29, REI provided MTA with a written description of the proposed underpinning scheme. MTA proposed an alternate scheme. The disadvantages of the MTA scheme, according to REI, were that it placed a new basement wall foundation system in unstable soil, did not provide specific protection of the pile foundations of the office tower columns, and required regular monitoring with a hydraulic jack, which could disrupt operation of the Building and make the basement unusable for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In response to MTA\u2019s request for more information \u201con the issue of whether settlement is expected,\u201d REI explained its opinions were based on the 1995 J. Byer reports. REI concluded: \u201cIt is the opinion of REI that although the shoring system documents developed for the Station are well-designed, the system is not adequate to avoid settlement at the El Capitan Building. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">CUNA offered to accept $500,000, a portion of the estimated $800,000 total cost of underpinning in accordance with the REI scheme, in exchange for which MTA would receive a $500,000 credit against any claim of physical damage to the Building as a result of the station construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Unable to agree with MTA on a plan to underpin the Building, CUNA commenced on its own the underpinning project in accordance with its engineers\u2019 recommendations. The project was completed by May 28 for a total cost of $755,787.22. Excavation for the station began on June 15 and was completed on December 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\"> when MTA refused to reimburse CUNA for the cost of underpinning, the Building owner filed suit for inverse condemnation.* **<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The concurrent court and jury trial commenced on November 8, 2000. On November 15, MTA moved for judgment under Code of Civil Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>section 631.8 on the grounds that CUNA had not established a taking within the meaning of California Constitution, article I, section 19, and, even if there had been a taking, CUNA\u2019s conduct was not reasonable.* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Relying primarily on the same cases cited in its respondent\u2019s brief, MTA argued that there can be no constitutional taking where there is no physical injury to the Building; thus, there was nothing to mitigate and no inverse condemnation occurred. The trial court took the motion under submission and allowed both parties to introduce additional evidence. The motion was thereafter renewed and eventually denied. On November 17, 2000, outside the presence of the jury, the court heard final argument on whether there was a compensable taking and whether mitigation damages were recoverable. On November 20, the court ruled in favor of MTA. It dismissed the jury and granted judgment in favor of MTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In its written statement of decision, the trial court found the Building had settled one-fourth inch following the construction of the tunnels, and the Building owner was \u201crightly concerned about [the] possibility\u201d that excavation for and construction of the station would cause building settlement in addition to the one-fourth inch caused by the tunnel excavation. It found, however, that the Building owner could not reasonably rely on the recommendations of its licensed engineers that station construction would cause damage to the Building because, the court found, the engineers\u2019 warnings were not \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of professional certainty.\u201d The trial court noted that CUNA did not offer expert testimony \u201cthat the station box construction would have . . . damaged the building,\u201d whereas MTA offered expert evidence that the construction would not have done so. The trial court concluded there was \u201cinsufficient evidence that the later station construction . . . caused damage to the El Capitan. Without actual or prospective damage proved, there can be no inverse condemnation award.\u201d Judgment and a final statement of decision were filed on January 29, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">CUNA timely appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The question of whether there has been inverse condemnation is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>(Ali v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 246, 250 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 458].) In deciding a mixed question, the trial court must: (1) establish the historical facts; (2) select the applicable law; and (3) apply the law to the facts. We review the trial court\u2019s determination of the historical facts for substantial evidence but afford questions of law plenary review. If application of the law to the facts is essentially factual, the trial court\u2019s determination is reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard. \u201c \u2018If, on the other hand, the question requires us to consider legal concepts in the mix of fact and law and to exercise judgment about the values that animate legal principles, then the concerns of judicial administration will favor the appellate court, and the question should be classified as one of law and reviewed de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Louis </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 969, 987 [232 Cal.Rptr. 110, 728 P.2d 180], quoting <em>United States v. McConney </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 728 F.2d 1195, 1202; also quoted by <em>Ghirardo v. Antonioli </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 791, 801 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 883 P.2d 960], and <em>McGhan Medical Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 804, 810 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 264].)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The issues for us to decide here are essentially legal: (1) the meaning of the terms \u201creasonable and in good faith\u201d as used in applicable Supreme Court authority, and (2) whether actual damage to the property is a prerequisite to recovery of mitigation damages in an inverse condemnation action. Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s determination de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\n<em>In Order to Establish Its Mitigation Efforts Were Reasonable and in Good Faith, a Property Owner Need Not Prove That \u2018\u2018But For\u201d Its Efforts the Property Would Have Been Damaged</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Although the parties approach the issue by taking somewhat different tacks, they generally agree that this case is largely controlled by our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Albers, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d 250. <em>Albers </em>is a seminal case in the field of eminent domain as it established the rule that a public entity is liable for damage it causes to private property \u201cwhether foreseeable or not.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 264; see also <em>Holtz v. Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 296, 304 [90 Cal.Rptr. 345, 475 P.2d 441].) For our purposes, however, it is the court\u2019s discussion of mitigation of damages in inverse condemnation cases that is of interest. We start our analysis there.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\"><em>Albers </em>arose out of landslides in the Palos Verdes Hills triggered by the placement of 175,000 cubic yards of dirt in, and on either side of, a road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>easement obtained by the County of Los Angeles for the purpose of extending Crenshaw Boulevard. Certain affected property owners sued the county. The trial court expressly found that the county had not acted negligently and had not committed a nuisance or a trespass. Nevertheless, it awarded judgment in favor of plaintiffs on an inverse condemnation theory. The county argued on appeal that, since the trial court had found in its favor on the common law causes of action and, therefore, if the defendant had been a private party, judgment would have been in its favor, the same rule should apply to a public entity. <em>(Albers, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at pp. 255-256.) The Supreme Court rejected this argument, concluding that under former article I, section 14 of the state Constitution\u2014the takings clause\u2014a private landowner is to be compensated for taking or injury to property irrespective of the public entity\u2019s negligence. <em>(Albers, </em>at pp. 263-264.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The issue that concerns us here was one presented by the <em>Albers </em>plaintiffs, who appealed from the part of the judgment that denied \u201crecovery for expenditures they made in attempting to determine the cause of the landslide and to prevent or minimize further damage.\u201d <em>(Albers, supra, 62 </em>Cal.2d at p. 268.) The trial court found that the expenses were reasonable and expended in good faith but refused to award them as damages.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In reversing the trial court on this latter issue, the Supreme Court acknowledged the lack of California authority supporting recovery for mitigation of damages in condemnation proceedings. So it turned to other states with similar constitutional provisions. It quoted approvingly from <em>Kane v. City of Chicago </em>(1945) 392 Ill. 172 [64 N.E.2d 506, 509]: \u201cExpenses reasonably and prudently incurred in good faith in making a proper effort to <em>prevent </em>or diminish injury to the building are considered a diminution in the fair cash market value of the real estate, and as such are proper items to be recovered.\u201d (Italics added.) And from a New York inverse condemnation case: \u201c \u2018The rule is of general and widespread application that one who has been injured either in his person or his property by the wrongful act or default of another is under an obligatory duty to make a reasonable effort to minimize the damages liable to result from such injury, and that if he does not make such reasonable effort he will be debarred from recovering for those additional damages which result from such failure\u2019 [Citation] . . . and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>that \u2018. . . the injured party who makes a successful effort to avoid or reduce damages will be allowed to recover the expenses necessarily incurred in so doing, but also that <em>he will be allowed to recover the expenses of a proper effort even though it proves unsuccessful.\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>(Zidel </em>v. <em>State </em>(1949) 198 Misc. 91, 98 [96 N.Y.S.2d 330, 337], italics added, quoting <em>Norske Ameriekalinje v. Sun Printing &amp; Publishing Association </em>(1919) 226 N.Y. 1, 7 [122 N.E. 463, 465].)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Our Supreme Court, additionally citing cases in a substantial number of other jurisdictions, concluded that no \u201creason appears why the rule in California should be harsher than that of our sister states.\u201d <em>(Albers, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The principles that derive from <em>Albers </em>are as follows: (1) the costs of mitigation efforts are recoverable in inverse condemnation actions if they are reasonable and undertaken in good faith; and (2) it is \u201cirrelevant\u201d that the mitigation efforts may have failed. <em>(Albers, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The parties generally agree that the foregoing is the applicable law. Where they part company is on whether the trial court correctly followed <em>Albers </em>in this case. Thus, MTA acknowledges in its brief that <em>Albers </em>does not require mitigation efforts to be successful for them to be recoverable. It does not appear to quarrel with the trial court\u2019s implied finding that CUNA acted in good faith. It does contend that the trial court correctly found that CUNA \u201cacted unreasonably in choosing to construct extensive underpinning, based on the limited analysis of its \u2018experts.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">CUNA, on the other hand, argues that the trial court, while giving judicial lip service to <em>Albers, </em>actually imposed on CUNA the additional burden of proving that \u201cbut for\u201d the mitigation efforts, the Building in fact would have been damaged. This test, it contends, was expressly rejected by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">In order to determine whether the trial court correctly applied <em>Albers </em>or added an element not authorized by the Supreme Court, we turn to a more thorough analysis of the trial court\u2019s statement of decision. Additionally, we are aided by the court\u2019s thorough explanation of its analysis during oral argument and by its ruling denying MTA\u2019s motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 631.8. First, we observe that the statement of decision does not contain an express finding of good faith. The trial court noted that CUNA contends it acted in good faith, but the court does not state whether it agrees or disagrees with CUNA\u2019s position. However, a reading of the entire statement of decision, coupled with the trial court\u2019s oral statement during closing argument that \u201cI think the client [CUNA] was acting in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>faith,\u201d leads us to conclude that the trial court did so find. MTA does not press the point on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The more weighty issue is how the trial court addressed the \u201creasonableness\u201d component of <em>Albers. </em>There is no question that the court was mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, as the parties argued from it extensively and the trial judge referred to it by name in his statement of decision and during his oral pronouncements from the bench. It is also apparent that he understood that the <em>Albers </em>test required a showing of reasonableness. This can be seen from his ruling denying MTA\u2019s earlier motion: \u201cThe court\u2019s reading of <em>Albers </em>is that mitigation steps may be taken if damage is reasonably threatened by the public improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In his oral remarks, the trial court stated that the premitigation investigation by CUNA\u2019s experts was not reasonable. \u201cI think that more investigation was necessary.\u201d If by that the trial court meant the experts\u2019 work was shoddy, below the standard of care, or otherwise not worthy of sufficient weight, then it might have been unreasonable for CUNA to have relied on them, and CUNA would have failed to meet the <em>Albers </em>mandate. It is not clear to us, however, that was what the trial court meant. More importantly, the statement of decision does not use the word \u201creasonableness\u201d in that context.  We, of course, are bound by the familiar rule that it is the trial court\u2019s ruling, not its oral explanation, that governs. (See <em>Wurzl v. Holloway </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1740, 1756 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 512]; 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Trial, \u00a7 403, p. 463.) So, we proceed to the statement of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The trial court in its statement mentions the concept of reasonableness on four occasions. Each time, the court links reasonableness with proof that the Building in fact would have been damaged but for CUNA\u2019s mitigation efforts. For example, the court writes: \u201cThe engineers, however, did not advise CUNA that the contemplated construction <em>would cause building damage </em>within a reasonable degree of professional certainty.\u201d And: \u201c[CUNA], in the court\u2019s view, may not reasonably rely on experts\u2019 opinions in undertaking an expensive mitigation project, the cost of which it hopes to charge to a public agency, unless its experts advise that they have made a thorough independent analysis of the construction plans and have determined that the construction project <em>will more likely than not cause injury to the </em>building.\u201d In response to CUNA\u2019s argument that Albers's requirement of good faith and reasonableness protects the public entity: \u201cThis court does not construe that statement to mean that a property owner should be reimbursed for voluntarily-incurred mitigation expenses even if the property owner cannot establish by a preponderance of the evidence that its property <em>would </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>have been damaged absent the mitigation measures. A property owner\u2019s claim, under those circumstances, although earnestly pressed, would not be </em>reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">The clearest example of the trial court equating reasonableness with a \u201cbut for\u201d standard is found in the statement of decision, although the court does not use the word \u201creasonableness\u201d at that juncture: \u201cA plaintiff in [an] inverse condemnation action must establish, by the preponderance of evidence standard, that the government action would have damaged its property absent mitigation efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">These statements lead us to conclude that the court required CUNA not to prove merely that it acted reasonably in deciding to undertake mitigation measures but that, preconstruction, its experts were required to advise CUNA that the public project \u201cwould cause building damage,\u201d and postconstruction, CUNA would have to prove \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that its property would have been damaged absent mitigation measures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The \u201cbut for\u201d test articulated by the trial court finds no support in <em>Albers </em>and is not compelled by public policy. First, there is a strong policy embedded in various facets of our law that mitigation is favored. (See <em>Albers, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.2d at p. 272, &amp; fn. 5.) Second, in the context of condemnation actions there are particularly forceful reasons to encourage mitigation. \u201c[I]t would seem that the pubic interest would be served by allowing the possibility of such a recovery: the owner, who is ordinarily in the best position to learn of and guard against danger to his property, would thereby be encouraged to attempt to minimize the loss inflicted on him by the condemnation, rather than simply to sit idly by and watch otherwise avoidable damages accumulate.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 272.) Although MTA decries CUNA\u2019s position as carte blanche to improve one\u2019s property by passing on construction costs to a public entity, <em>Albers </em>expressly holds that \u201cthe requirements of good faith and reasonableness\u201d provide adequate protection to the public agency. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">On the other hand, adding the dual burden of requiring a consulting expert in advance to opine that in fact damage will be suffered, and an expert witness to testify during litigation that damage in fact would have been suffered, provides an unnecessary impediment to reasonable mitigation efforts. It also creates a concomitant risk that the public will have to pay for damage to property that could have been avoided. If the property owner is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>unable to secure the services of an expert who will state with reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"ALS\">certainty that, but for the mitigation efforts, damage will occur, or if the owner is fearful that similar testimony in hindsight will not be believed by the trier of fact, it may be reluctant to take reasonable steps to avoid loss. In that situation, if damage does in fact occur, we are confident a public agency would argue for a reduction in the amount of compensation because of an unreasonable failure to undertake feasible mitigation measures. <em>(Albers, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 271; <em>Sheffet v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 720, 731, fn. 8, 732 [84 Cal.Rptr. 11].)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Finally, we observe that the \u201cbut for\u201d test adopted by the trial court is at odds with another principle endorsed by <em>Albers: </em>that mitigation expenses are recoverable even though they are not successful. <em>(Albers, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 271.) \u201cThat the efforts to prevent further damage failed is irrelevant . . . .\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 272.) Under <em>Albers, </em>the test remains one of reasonableness: either that mitigation efforts were reasonable but unsuccessful and further damage accrued, or that in fact the mitigation efforts, although reasonable, turned out to be unnecessary, is not dispositive.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Our conclusion that the trial court employed the incorrect legal standard in assessing the evidence does not end our inquiry. We asked for additional briefing from the parties on whether such a conclusion requires a remand to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the trial court or whether the state of the record permits this court to affirm or reverse outright. Not surprisingly, the parties\u2019 arguments are diametrically in opposition. CUNA urges us to decide the issue in its favor and reverse because the underlying facts are not contested and support only a finding that it acted reasonably. MTA says the trial court\u2019s error was harmless and contends that \u201cthis Court should review the evidence to determine whether it supports the decision under the proper reasonableness standard.\u201d MTA argues that such a review compels affirmance. We conclude that remand is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">MTA correctly points out the venerable rule that a judgment may be affirmed on any basis supported by the record even if not expressly relied upon by the trial court. (See <em>Lawless v. Calaway </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 81, 93-94 [147 P.2d 604]; <em>Day v. Alta Bates Medical Center </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 243, 252, fn. 1 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 606].) This requires CUNA to demonstrate that the complained of error was prejudicial. In the instant case, if the trial court had used the correct standard, review of its decision would have been measured by the substantial evidence rule.  \u201cIt has been held that the question whether an injured party acted reasonably to mitigate damages is a matter to be determined by the trier of fact and that the scope of review on appeal is circumscribed by the \u2018any substantial evidence\u2019 rule.\u201d <em>(Green v. Smith, supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d at p. 397.)  Accordingly, for us to affirm or reverse outright, we would have to find that, applying the substantial evidence test, a reasonable trier of fact could have reached only one result. We must remand if substantial evidence would have supported judgment in favor of each party. That is the state of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">We need not belabor the point. Aside from the fact that there were 97 exhibits received in evidence (and over 400 marked for identification), three versions of the statement of decision, and the trial judge denied MTA\u2019s motion under Code of Civil Procedure 631.8 by concluding the evidence at that stage of the litigation \u201csatisfies the reasonableness requirement\u201d yet ultimately found against CUNA, our review of the evidence causes us to conclude that there was substantial evidence on both sides that would have supported a finding one way or the other on the reasonableness of CUNA\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We summarize just a portion of the evidence on each side.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On CUNA\u2019s behalf, when it prepared its September 1995 report, CUNA\u2019s geotechnical expert J. Byer performed its own subsurface exploration, including manometer surveys on the basement and subbasement levels of the Building. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Building owner also retained Jennings Engineering Company (Jennings) to perform survey and monitoring independent of that being done by MTA. J. Byer used data from its own and the Jennings surveys, in addition to data obtained from MTA, to conclude the Building had settled between one-fourth and one-third inch as a result of the tunnel construction and that station construction would induce settlement of more than one-fourth inch on a portion of the Building. In an October 18, 1995 memo to the Building owner, J. Byer described the techniques MTA intended to implement in the station construction, which information was gleaned from the contract documents between MTA and its contractors. J. Byer warned the Building owner: \u201cIt might be structurally unacceptable to incur <em>Vi </em>inch or more of rapid settlement before defensive measures are taken. It is recommended that the structural engineer establish what the acceptable tolerances for differential settlement are. [|] At least <em>Va </em>inch of settlement within 50 feet of the station excavation should be expected. Therefore, defensive measures should be implemented now and not after additional settlement.\u201d J. Byer recommended underpinning the Building \u201c[i]f the structural engineer determines that differential settlement of the northeastern portion of the foundation line A0.5 is detrimental to the structural integrity of the building . . . .\u201d The Building owner\u2019s structural engineer, REI, proposed an underpinning scheme and warned that the shoring system suggested by MTA was \u201cnot adequate to avoid settlement at the El Capitan Building.\u201d Thus, there was substantial evidence that the Building owner\u2019s experts did, in fact, make a thorough independent analysis of the construction plans and determined that mitigation measures were appropriate to avoid the risk of damage to the Building. Finally, the evidence was undisputed that, two years before station construction commenced, MTA had been required to stop tunnel construction due to excessive settlement. A trier of fact could find CUNA\u2019s reliance on its experts reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">On the other hand, substantial evidence also supported MTA\u2019s position that CUNA\u2019s conduct was unreasonable. Girish Roy, an MTA engineer, testified to the steps taken in advance of station excavation to ensure that a proper support system was in place. Although an earlier earth technology report expressed concerns about settlement, the specifications for the station were intentionally designed to eliminate those potential problems. Expert witnesses William Cole, an engineering geologist, and Patrick Shires, a geotechnical engineer and geophysicist, testified that the piles on which the Building was founded and the soldier piles installed during construction reduced the likelihood of settlement. Mr. Shires also testified about the relationship between angular distortion and likely tilting, concluding that no damage would have occurred. MTA\u2019s witnesses were critical of the opinions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>expressed by CUNA\u2019s witnesses. Finally, there was evidence that none of the neighborhood buildings that were not underpinned suffered any damage, and that the earlier settlement of the Building caused no actual physical damage. This, and other evidence, was sufficient to support a finding under the correct legal standard that CUNA did not act reasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Because we cannot determine the reasonableness issue as a matter of law, we must remand for a new trial on that issue.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\n<em>MTA\u2019s Additional Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">MTA also contends that CUNA may not recover mitigation damages because there was no physical damage to the property and also because mitigation efforts here were designed to avoid future harm rather than to remedy an existing problem. We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">In <em>Albers </em>the Supreme Court did not establish as a prerequisite to the recovery of mitigation costs that the property owner show actual physical damage to the property or hold that mitigation designed to obviate only future harm was noncompensable. Although the issue was not strictly before the court because the landslides had occurred before mitigation efforts were undertaken, the court\u2019s analysis of mitigation costs as damages reflects disagreement with the position MTA now takes. As to future harm, on two occasions the high court quoted approvingly from the out-of-state cases to which we referred earlier. First: \u201cExpenses reasonably and prudently incurred in good faith in making a proper effort to prevent or diminish injury to the building are considered a diminution of the fair cash market value of the real estate, and as such are proper items to be recovered. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Albers, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 270, italics omitted, boldface added.) Later: \u201c \u2018[I]t is held as a natural corollary to this rule of duty, not only that the injured party who makes a successful effort to avoid or reduce damages will be allowed to recover.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 271, boldface added.) These references to \u201cpreventing\u201d and \u201cavoiding\u201d damage in contrast to \u201cdiminishing\u201d or \u201creducing\u201d harm reflect an unmistakable approval of the notion that reasonable, good faith mitigation that avoids future harm is just as important to the public good as are actions taken to lessen the impact of previous damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Similarly, in describing the type of damage compensable in inverse condemnation proceedings, the court stated, \u201c \u2018Any definite physical injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>to land or an invasion of it cognizable to the senses, depreciating its market value, is a damage in the constitutional sense . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Albers, supra, 62 </em>Cal.2d at p. 260.) This notion that inverse condemnation damage includes not only physical injury but other sensory invasions was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in <em>Varjabedian </em>v. <em>City of Madera </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 285 [142 Cal.Rptr. 429, 572 P.2d 43] <em>(Varjabedian). </em>\u201c[P]hysical damage to property is not invariably a prerequisite to compensation [for inverse condemnation liability]. [Citations.] Rather, the determination of the scope of the just compensation clause rests on its construction \u2018 \u201cas a matter of interpretation and policy.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 296.) The <em>Varjabedian </em>court reversed a judgment on the pleadings for the defendant city, concluding that the city could be liable in inverse condemnation for operation of a sewage plant that emitted septic odors that were blown onto the plaintiffs neighboring property. The fact that the injury was unlike \u201cthose core cases of direct physical invasion which indisputably require compensation,\u201d did not vitiate the inverse condemnation claim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 297.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Here, there was an \u201cinvasion\u201d of plaintiffs property, as the court found that MTA\u2019s earlier construction of the subway tunnels \u201ccaused the El Capitan Building to settle slightly less than one quarter inch.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Likewise, it is undisputable that CUNA\u2019s mitigation efforts were designed to \u201cprevent\u201d or \u201cavoid\u201d injury. <em>(Albers, supra, 62 </em>Cal.2d at pp. 270-271.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">MTA relies principally on three cases in support of its contention that mitigation expenses are not recoverable when they are incurred to avoid only future harm and where there is no physical injury. None is persuasive. In <em>Placer County Water Agency v. Hofman </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 890 [211 Cal.Rptr. 894] <em>(Placer), </em>the water district constructed a pipeline pursuant to an acquired easement over private land, some of which was owned by the Hofmans. The Hofmans complained that the project did not comply with its own specifications and that an environmental impact report was required. The trial court awarded damages falling in several categories, one of which was mitigation expenses. The Court of Appeal reversed that award. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 903.) MTA correctly points out that in the course of its opinion that appellate court stated, \u201cIf there is no taking, it is not possible for there to be any damages <em>caused by </em>a taking.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 897, original italics.) From there, MTA argues there was no taking here and therefore mitigation damages cannot be awarded. We read the case more narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>In <em>Placer, </em>the mitigation damages were not expended to construct tangible physical solutions to harms anticipated by public projects. Rather, they \u201cwere for engineering and legal services largely incurred in a separate legal action which sought to compel the agency to comply with the project plans and EIR.\u201d <em>(Placer, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at p. 895.) The <em>Placer </em>court held that those costs were not recoverable under the relevant statute relied upon by the Hofmans. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1263.40 [damage caused to remainder where property is severed].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Essentially, the Hofmans were trying to recover expenses incurred in litigation filed \u201cto compel the agency to comply with the project EIR.\u201d <em>{Placer, supra, </em>at p. 897.) Accordingly, the costs had nothing to do with the decrease in market value necessary to support an award of mitigation expenses under <em>Albers. (Id. </em>at pp. 896-898; see <em>Albers, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at pp. 272-273; see also discussion, <em>ante.) </em>For these reasons, the court concluded the engineering and litigation expenses incurred in the prior lawsuit were not recoverable. We find <em>Placer </em>of little help in deciding whether monies spent to shore up a building in the face of major construction are compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">MTA also relies on <em>Jordan v. Santa Barbara </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1245 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 340] <em>{Jordan). </em>There, agricultural landowners filed an action for inverse condemnation and other common law torts when activities of public agencies increased the salinity of groundwater and allowed sewage to seep into a river. The landowners were particularly concerned that the buildup of vegetation in the river created a potential for future flooding of their property. Hence, they claimed, the public entities\u2019 conduct constituted inverse condemnation. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1255-1256.) The Court of Appeal affirmed judgment for the public agencies. MTA finds support in the following quotation from the appellate court: \u201cThe [trial] court properly concluded that risk of future flooding does not give rise to a claim for inverse condemnation. Any damages claimed by appellants are speculative.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1261.) First of all, we note that this is not a mitigation of damages case at all. In <em>Jordan, </em>the plaintiffs incurred no expense in trying to prevent the vegetation from growing or clearing the riverbed to prevent flooding. Accordingly, the issue was not whether costs incurred in mitigating damages were recoverable in the context of inverse condemnation. Second, the quoted language reflects the appellate court\u2019s conclusion that the damages claimed were speculative because there had been no flood, there might never be a flood, and it was not possible to calculate any loss that the property owners might suffer from some unknown flood. In the present case, there is no suggestion that the damages would be speculative as the actual amounts expended by CUNA are known. Nor was the tunneling and station excavation speculative: they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>scheduled to take place at the time the mitigation efforts were undertaken and had been completed by the time of trial. CUNA did not file suit for inverse condemnation immediately following the passage of a preliminary municipal resolution in support of a project that might never see the light of day. Finally, we note that the court of appeal affirmed the rule expressed in <em>Albers and Varjabedian </em>that \u201c[pjhysical damage is not invariably a prerequisite to compensation for inverse condemnation liability.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1257.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Finally, MTA relies on <em>Orange County Flood Control Dist. v. Sunny Crest Dairy, Inc. </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 742, 765 [143 Cal.Rptr. 803], for the rule that expenses incurred to mitigate noncompensable business losses are themselves noncompensable. (See also <em>City of San Diego v. Sobke </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 379, 400 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 9] [mitigation costs to avoid loss of goodwill are not recoverable in the absence of a showing of goodwill].) The property owner there tried to recover fair rental value of the property during a time of temporary severance. The appellate court concluded that was an incorrect measure of damage and that out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith (title fees, attorneys\u2019 fees, escrow costs and brokers\u2019 commissions) were not proper mitigation expenses. <em>(Orange County Flood Control Dist. v. Sunny Crest Dairy, Inc., supra, </em>77 Cal.App.3d 742, 764-767.) As the present case does not deal with noncompensable business losses such as fair rental value or loss of goodwill, we see little application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The judgment is reversed and the matter remanded.

We hold only that the \u201cbut for\u201d test is not the legal standard by which reasonableness is judged. We also conclude that the rule is that the reasonableness of a property owner\u2019s mitigation efforts \u201cmust be judged in the light of the situation confronting him at the time the loss was threatened and not by the judgment of hindsight.\u201d <em>(Green v. Smith </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 392, 396 [67 Cal.Rptr. 796].) This principle, although articulated in litigation involving private parties, applies equally to inverse condemnation matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Although <em>Albers </em>did not purport to describe the type of evidence relevant to a determination of reasonableness, certain areas of inquiry come to mind. One is a comparison of the likelihood of actual damage and its cost to repair with the cost to mitigate. These factors may work on a sliding scale. (See <em>Albers, supra, 62 </em>Cal.2d at p. 271 [mitigation must be \u201c \u2018proportioned to the injury and consequences to be averted\u2019 \u201d].) It may be reasonable to pay $10,000 in mitigation to avoid spending $500,000 in subsequent repairs even though the likelihood of damage is only 35 percent. Another factor may be the uniqueness of the property. Here the El Capitan is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the Los Angeles Conservancy holds a \u201cgood repair\u201d easement on the Building. The loss of the Building\u2019s facade would have far greater consequences than could be quantified solely by the cost of repair. Thus, on the sliding scale referred to above, mitigation might appear to be more reasonable even with a smaller likelihood of injury and greater mitigation costs. Finally, other legal obligations of the property owner and interests of third parties might support a finding of reasonableness or the opposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> Additional facts are set forth in the \u201cFactual and Procedural Background\u201d part of our opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\"> We express no opinion on whether the trial judge must reopen the case in whole or in part to admit additional evidence, or whether it may rely on the state of the record and apply the proper legal standard to the evidence already received.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\"> Although the court also found that the settlement did not cause actual physical damage to the building warranting separate compensation, a finding that CUNA does not dispute (see fn. 7, <em>ante), </em>we would be hard pressed to say that causing a building on adjacent property to settle one-fourth inch was not an \u201cinvasion\u201d of another\u2019s property interests under <em>Albers.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b417-5\"> This code section is not relevant to the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> Both <em>Jordan, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at page 1258, and another case cited by MTA, <em>Olson </em>v. <em>County of Shasta </em>(1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 336, 341 [85 Cal.Rptr. 77], state that the \u201cvery definition of a \u2018taking\u2019 requires an \u2018act\u2019 . . . , and the risk of fixture flooding is not an act.\u201d As we have already discussed, compensation is required when the public entity takes or causes damage to property.
