Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">In this appeal, we determine the sufficiency of an environmental impact report (EIR) prepared by defendant and respondent Sonoma County Water Agency (Agency) for a project increasing the Agency\u2019s withdrawal of water from the Russian River. Appellants, Friends of the Eel River et al.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contend the EIR does not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15000 et seq. (CEQA))<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and violates certain planning laws. Appellants challenge the EIR on three primary grounds: (1) the EIR fails to adequately consider the project\u2019s impacts and alternatives; (2) the EIR does not describe the project\u2019s environmental setting accurately; and (3) the Agency did not comply with certain planning laws in its approval of the project. We conclude the EIR does not contain adequate cumulative impacts and alternatives analyses and its description of the project\u2019s environmental setting is deficient. We reject appellants\u2019 remaining arguments. Because the EIR is inadequate, the trial court erred in denying appellants\u2019 petition for a writ of mandate vacating the Agency\u2019s certification of the EIR and approval of the project. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Two rivers are at the heart of this controversy. The Russian River, the immediate source of water for the Agency\u2019s 500,000 customers, runs south from its headwaters near Ukiah, and then west to Jenner, where it empties into the Pacific Ocean. The Eel River lies to the northeast of the Russian River. It flows west and then north through Mendocino and Humboldt Counties and empties into the Pacific Ocean near Eureka.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The Agency draws water from the Russian River and then releases it to its customers in Sonoma and Marin Counties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Agency has the right to divert up to 75,000 acre-feet of water a year (AFY) from the Russian River under permits issued to it by the State Water Resources Control Board. At the time the Agency proposed this project, it was using 55,000 AFY of its permitted water rights. The Agency has determined it must divert considerably more water than its current permit allows in order to meet the needs of the growing populations of Sonoma and Marin Counties. The project that is the subject of the challenged EIR is a proposal to increase the Agency\u2019s diversions of Russian River water from 75,000 AFY to 101,000 AFY and to expand its transmission system of pumps, tanks and pipelines in order to meet the projected demands of its customers (the Project).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Despite its distance from the Agency\u2019s customers, the Eel River is a crucial part of the Agency\u2019s Russian River water supply system. For decades, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) has redirected a significant amount of water from the Eel River under a license issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This water\u2014between 159,000 and 181,000 AFY\u2014powers a PG&amp;E hydroelectric project in Potter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Valley .called the Potter Valley Project (PVP). After the water is used to generate power, it is sent into the Russian River, pursuant to a 1965 agreement between PG&amp;E and the Agency* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and PG&amp;E\u2019s FERC license. As the Agency acknowledges in its EIR, \u201cthe PVP is important to the successful operation of the . . . Agency\u2019s water transmission system.\u201d In fact, <em>most </em>of the summer water flow in the Russian River consists of water diverted from the Eel River.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">This diversion of water from the Eel River to the Russian River has resulted in a decline in the population of salmonid species in the Eel River and impacted fishery operations along the river. Several endangered species are among the fish populations that have been harmed by the diversion of water from the Eel River.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The environmental consequences of diverting water from the Eel River have not gone unnoticed. In 1983, as a condition of relicensing PG&amp;E\u2019s Potter Valley Project, FERC ordered PG&amp;E, in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Game and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, to carry out fish monitoring studies at the Potter Valley Project for a decade, between 1985 and 1995. <em>(Covelo Indian Community </em>v. <em>F.E.R.C. </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 895 F.2d 581.) In 1998, PG&amp;E, joined by these two wildlife agencies and the National Marine Fisheries Service, filed a proposal to decrease by 22 percent the amount of water diverted from the Eel River to the Russian River (the Consensus Recommendation).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The Agency participated in the FERC proceeding and vigorously opposed the Consensus Recommendation. It put forward an alternate proposal for curtailing diversions from the Eel River by 10 percent by the year 2022. In so doing, the Agency pointed out that cutting off Eel River water to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>extent proposed in the Consensus Recommendation would have severe environmental consequences to the Russian River, including the risk of dewatering portions of that river during critically dry years because of the impossibility of maintaining \u201cprudent water storage reserves.\u201d Despite these concerns, the Agency did not include in this EIR, which contemplated an increase in water withdrawn from the Russian River, any discussion of the potential curtailments in Eel River diversions. Instead, the Agency made only a summary reference to the pending FERC proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Appellants argued, both in administrative hearings and before the trial court, that the Agency was required to consider the environmental consequences of the proposals before FERC to curtail water diverted from the Eel River into the Russian River. Appellants also contended the Agency was required to disclose and discuss the long-standing diversion of water from the Eel River and the fact that these diversions have ongoing environmental consequences to the Eel River, most notably seen in the loss of endangered salmonid species. In a similar vein, appellants argued that the Project\u2019s commitment of water from the Russian River to customer uses would make FERC reluctant to curtail the diversion of Eel River water. Appellants contended the Agency was required to disclose this possibility in the EIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The Agency rejected appellants\u2019 arguments and approved the EIR without making the analyses and disclosures urged by appellants. Appellants challenged this approval in the Sonoma County Superior Court on the grounds that the EIR was insufficient under CEQA and the Agency\u2019s approval of the EIR violated California planning law. The Agency defended its failure to discuss the possible curtailment of Eel River diversions by characterizing the proposed curtailments as speculative. The trial court rejected appellants\u2019 challenge to the EIR. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">In <em>Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 356-357 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 579] <em>(Napa Citizens), </em>we articulated the standard of review applicable to a CEQA challenge. \u201c \u2018[I]n reviewing agency actions under CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21168.5 provides that a court\u2019s inquiry \u201cshall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Napa Citizens, </em>at pp. 356-357.) \u201cOn appeal, \u2018[i]n applying the substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>evidence standard, \u201cthe reviewing court must resolve reasonable doubts in favor of the administrative finding and decision.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 393.) The role of the appellate court... is precisely the same as the trial court\u2019s, and the lower court\u2019s findings are not conclusive on appeal. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Napa Citizens, </em>at p. 357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">\u201cThus, the reviewing court \u2018 \u201cdoes not pass upon the correctness of the EIR\u2019s environmental conclusions, but only upon its sufficiency as an informative document.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] We may not set aside an agency\u2019s approval of an EIR on the ground that an opposite conclusion would have been equally or more reasonable. \u2018Our limited function is consistent with the principle that \u201c[t]he purpose of CEQA is not to generate paper, but to compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental consequences in mind. CEQA does not, indeed cannot, guarantee that these decisions will always be those which favor environmental considerations.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] We may not, in sum, substitute our judgment for that of the people and their local representatives. We can and must, however, scrupulously enforce all legislatively mandated CEQA requirements.\u201d <em>(Citizens of Goleta Valley </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564 [276 Cal.Rptr. 410, 801 P.2d 1161].) With these principles in mind, we consider appellants\u2019 CEQA arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">B. <em>Cumulative Impacts Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Appellants argue the EIR\u2019s cumulative impacts analysis is flawed because it does not take into account the proposals pending before FERC to curtail water diverted from the Eel River into the Russian River. The Agency, on the other hand, argues the outcome of the FERC proceeding is speculative and need not be included in the cumulative impacts discussion of the EIR. We conclude it was reasonable and practical to include a discussion of the FERC proceeding in the EIR, and the Agency failed to proceed in a manner required by law when it concluded otherwise. The Agency, therefore, abused its discretion in certifying the EIR. <em>(Laurel Heights, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 376; <em>San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 61, 71 [198 Cal.Rptr. 634] <em>(San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The Guidelines require the Agency to consider \u201cpast, present, and probable future projects producing related or cumulative impacts . . . .\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15130, subd. (b)(1)(A).) The Agency must interpret this requirement in such a way as to \u201cafford the fullest possible protection of the environment.\u201d (Citizens <em>Assn. for Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number><em>Inyo </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 168 [217 Cal.Rptr. 893]; see also <em>Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 247, 259 [104 Cal.Rptr. 761, 502 P.2d 1049]; <em>San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d 61, 74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">In <em>Kings County Farm Bureau </em>v. <em>City of Hanford </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 723 [270 Cal.Rptr. 650] <em>(Kings County Farm Bureau), </em>the court held that, in considering whether an EIR must include related projects, \u201c[t]he primary determination is whether it was reasonable and practical to include the projects and whether, without their inclusion, the severity and significance of the cumulative impacts were reflected adequately.\u201d Here, the answer to this inquiry leads to the conclusion that the FERC proceeding was a related project and should have been included in the EIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">We disagree with the Agency\u2019s contention that the FERC proceeding is inconclusive and need not be analyzed in the EIR\u2019s cumulative impacts section. Certainly, the present EIR might lead to this conclusion. In that document, according to the Agency, \u201cPG&amp;E, in consultation with the resource agencies, was required to file with FERC recommendations for <em>modifications </em>to the required flow schedule, operations, or structures for the purpose of protecting and maintaining fisheries resources in the Eel and East Fork Russian rivers. A consensus recommendation, in which the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) also joined, was filed with FERC by PG&amp;E at the end of March 1998.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">The record tells a far different story from the one the Agency relates in its EIR. Although the Agency euphemistically describes the flow proposals before FERC as \u201cmodifications,\u201d <em>every </em>proposal before FERC\u2014including the Agency\u2019s own\u2014posits a <em>decrease </em>in the amount of water available to the Agency to supply its customers\u2019 needs at a time when the Agency is seeking to <em>increase </em>the amount of water it takes out of the Russian River.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Moreover, the Agency was well aware at the time the EIR was drafted that the proposals pending before FERC, if approved, would limit its ability to supply water to its customers in an environmentally sound way under current conditions. In a letter sent to FERC about a month before the EIR was certified, the Agency told FERC that the Consensus Recommendation proposed by PG&amp;E and a number of federal and state wildlife agencies would lead to a \u201cdramatic increase in the risk that Lake Mendocino, and the Russian River between Coyote Valley Dam and Healdsburg, would be dewatered in a critically dry year by failure to maintain prudent water storage reserves. The economic and environmental consequences of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>dewatering would be enormous. The National Marine Fisheries Service has listed steelhead trout and coho salmon in the Russian River as threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (\u2018ESA\u2019). In addition to the obvious impacts on endangered fish of dewatering the upper Russian River, lower Lake Mendocino water levels would often result in higher water temperatures that could adversely affect the salmonid rearing habitat maintained for several miles downstream of Coyote Valley Dam by cold water releases from Lake Mendocino. Salmonid rearing habitat on Dry Creek also could be adversely affected by warmer releases from Lake Sonoma resulting from reduced diversions to the Russian River.\u201d Although the Agency was aware of the nature of the proposals pending before FERC and the environmental consequences of these proposals, its EIR completely fails to alert the public and the decision makers to the cumulative impact of Eel River curtailments pending before FERC and increased Russian River diversions proposed in the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">CEQA requires more than this. Despite the Agency\u2019s argument to the contrary, it was both reasonable and practical to include the Eel River curtailment proposals pending before FERC in the Agency\u2019s cumulative impacts analysis. At the time the EIR was prepared, the proposals before FERC had progressed to the point that an environmental impact statement, the federal equivalent of an EIR (Guidelines, \u00a7 15363), had been initiated. Based on this fact alone, we can conclude the possible curtailment of Eel River diversions was a reasonably foreseeable future project, which should have been included in the EIR\u2019s discussion of cumulative impacts. For example, in <em>San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d 61, 75, the court held that high-rise building projects that had progressed far enough to be under environmental review must be considered in a cumulative impacts analysis because \u201cexperience and common sense indicate that projects which are under review are \u2018reasonably] foreseeable probable future projects.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The Agency responds that FERC has been considering some curtailment of Eel River diversions for a long time and has yet to take action. We do not agree that a lengthy review process means a project is speculative. We doubt the Agency would describe its own project as speculative, despite the fact that a great deal of time has elapsed since the project was originally proposed. Similarly, the proposals pending before FERC to decrease Eel River diversions may not be considered speculative simply because the FERC process appears to be a lengthy one.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Another basis for our conclusion that the FERC proceeding should have been included as a related project in the cumulative impacts section of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>Agency\u2019s EIR is the fact that the Agency has been participating actively in this proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Kings County Farm Bureau, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d 692, 723, evidence that environmental information omitted by the agency was, in fact, available for inclusion in the EIR, led the court to conclude that \u201cthe EIR could reasonably and practically have included such projects in its analysis.\u201d The Agency\u2019s detailed submittal to FERC on November 6, 1998 (a month before the EIR was certified) leaves little doubt that the Agency, an active and sophisticated participant in the FERC licensing procedure, had more than sufficient information with which to analyze the FERC proceeding in its EIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Finally, the Agency\u2019s failure to consider the impact of the potential curtailment of water from the Eel River has resulted in an EIR that fails to alert decision makers and the public to the possibility that the Agency will not be able to supply water to its customers in an environmentally sound way. <em>(Kings County Farm Bureau, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 724.) Throughout the EIR, the Agency relies on a tool referred to as the \u201cRussian River Model.\u201d The model is used by the Agency to simulate demand on its Russian River water supply system in order to determine whether there is adequate water to meet customer demands. In the cumulative impacts section, the Agency forecasts demands on its water supply system and then, using the model, draws conclusions about whether its existing water supplies will meet these future demands. One assumption the Agency relies on in determining whether there is enough water to meet future demands is that the Russian River will continue to receive diversions from the Eel River.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The EIR concludes that existing supplies can meet future demands for water, and that minimum stream flow requirements imposed by the State Water Resources Control Board can also be maintained even when future water demands are taken into account. This is not an insignificant conclusion environmentally, because these minimum stream flow requirements are designed in part to ensure the health of species in the river. And yet, had the Agency taken into account the potential curtailment of Eel River diversions, it might well have reached a different conclusion about whether existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>water supplies could satisfy customer demands <em>and </em>minimum stream flow requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The Agency has made clear it believes that the Consensus Recommendation pending before FERC will have \u201cenormous\u201d environmental consequences. The failure to consider these consequences has resulted in an underestimation of the Agency\u2019s ability to meet customer demands without negative environmental consequences. <em>(Kings County Farm Bureau, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 724.)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">In conclusion, this EIR should have, but did not, consider whether the proposed curtailments in Eel River diversions would lead to significant cumulative impacts in combination with the Project. The absence of this analysis makes the EIR an inadequate informational document,  \u201c\u2018[T]he ultimate decision of whether to approve a project, be that decision right or wrong, is a nullity if based upon an EIR that does not provide the decision-makers, and the public, with the information about the project that is required by CEQA.\u2019 [Citation.] The error is prejudicial \u2018if the failure to include relevant information precludes informed decision making and informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 721-722 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 704] <em>(San Joaquin Raptor).) </em> The public and the decision makers should have been made aware that the proposed curtailment of Eel River diversions might impact the Agency\u2019s ability to provide water to its customers in an environmentally sound way. The Agency\u2019s failure to do so renders this EIR deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">C. <em>Alternatives Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Appellants contend the EIR\u2019s alternatives analysis is flawed. Appellants assert the EIR should have, but did not, consider alternatives that would reduce its dependence on water diverted from the Eel River, particularly in light of the proposals before FERC to curtail this water.  We agree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">An EIR is required to \u201censure that all reasonable alternatives to proposed projects are thoroughly assessed by the responsible official.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number><em>(Wildlife Alive v. Chickering </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 197 [132 Cal.Rptr. 377, 553 P.2d 537].) Therefore, \u201c[a]n EIR must \u2018[d]escribe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project or to the location of the project, which could feasibly attain the basic objectives of the project and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives.\u2019 (Guidelines, \u00a7 15126, subd. (d).) The discussion must \u2018focus on alternatives capable of eliminating any significant adverse environmental effects or reducing them to a level of insignificance, even if these alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or would be more costly.\u2019 (Guidelines, \u00a7 15126, subd. (d)(3).)\u201d <em>(Kings County Farm Bureau, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 733.) This discussion of alternatives must be \u201cmeaningful\u201d and must \u201ccontain analysis sufficient to allow informed decision making.\u201d <em>(Laurel Heights, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 376, 403-404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The Agency was required to consider project alternatives that might eliminate or reduce the Project\u2019s significant adverse environmental effects. The EIR presently considers alternatives fashioned by the Agency in light of the EIR\u2019s flawed cumulative impacts analysis. In <em>San Joaquin Raptor, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th 713, 738, the court held that, where the EIR\u2019s description of the project\u2019s environmental setting was not \u201caccurately and fully assessed,\u201d the alternatives analysis was also flawed. In finding the alternatives analysis flawed, the court pointed out that the EIR\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of alternatives does .not foster \u2018informed decision making\u2019 [citation]\u201d because it is \u201cdevoid of substantive factual information from which one could reach an intelligent ^decision as to the environmental consequences and relative merits of the available alternatives to the proposed project. . . . [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, as there, \u201c[b]ecause the discussion of alternatives omitted relevant, crucial information, it subverted the purposes of CEQA and is legally inadequate.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 738-739.)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The Agency must discuss project alternatives that would mitigate any significant cumulative impact of the proposed curtailment of Eel River diversions and the Agency\u2019s Project. Alternatives that would reduce the Agency\u2019s reliance on water diverted from the Eel River would be among the alternatives that must be considered by the Agency in the event it determines that the cumulative impact of the Project and the FERC proceeding is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">D. <em>The Project\u2019s Environmental Setting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">Appellants contend the EIR\u2019s description of the Project\u2019s environmental setting is deficient. Appellants argue that under CEQA, the Agency was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>required to reveal that Eel River diversions, on which the Agency depends for a significant amount of water, have harmed salmonid species in the Eel River. The Agency on the other hand, contends its abbreviated description of historical levels of diversions from the Eel River sufficiently describes the Project\u2019s environmental setting. We conclude the EIR\u2019s description of the Project\u2019s environmental setting is deficient because it does not disclose either the impact on Eel River salmonid species of diverting water from the Eel River or the fact that FERC is considering proposals to curtail these diversions in order to prevent harm to these species.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">An EIR must contain an accurate description of the project\u2019s environmental setting. An EIR \u201cmust include a description of the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project. . . from both a local and regional perspective. This environmental setting will normally constitute the baseline physical conditions by which a lead agency determines whether an impact is significant.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15125, subd. (a).) There is good reason for this requirement: \u201cKnowledge of the regional setting is critical to the assessment of environmental impacts. . . . The EIR must demonstrate that the significant environmental impacts of the proposed project were adequately investigated and discussed and it must permit the significant effects of the project to be considered in the full environmental context.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15125, subd. (c).) We interpret this Guideline broadly in order to \u201cafford the fullest possible protection to the environment.\u201d <em>(Kings County Farm Bureau, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d 692, 720.) In so doing, we ensure that the EIR\u2019s analysis of significant effects, which is generated from this description of the environmental context, is as accurate as possible. (See also Remy et al., Guide to the Cal. Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (10th ed. 1999) pp. 374-376.)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">In the chapter devoted to the Project\u2019s environmental setting, the EIR largely focuses on Lake Sonoma, the southernmost reservoir in the Agency\u2019s water supply system, and the reservoir from which the Agency will make the proposed increased withdrawals of water. In so doing, the EIR omits a meaningful discussion of the conditions in the northern part of the water supply system: Most notably, the diversion of Eel River water to the Russian River, the impact these diversions have had on salmonid species in the Eel River, and the proposals pending before FERC to curtail Eel River diversions in order to protect these species. Beyond stating that most of the stream flow in the Russian River during the summer months comes from water \u201cimported\u201d from the Eel River, the Agency fails to alert the public and the decision makers to the real possibility that these diversions, on which the Agency depends, will be curtailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">As we have explained, FERC, which authorizes these diversions, has received proposals to <em>decrease </em>the amount of water diverted from the Eel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>River. The EIR\u2019s incomplete description of the Project\u2019s environmental setting fails to set the stage for a discussion of the cumulative impact of the FERC proceeding and the Project. We conclude the EIR must disclose to the public and decision makers that, because of the harm caused by Eel River diversions to salmonid species in that river, proposals are pending before FERC to curtail these diversions, on which the Agency depends. Without this information, the EIR does not comply with Guidelines section 15125. <em>(San Joaquin Raptor, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th 713, 722-729; see also <em>Galante Vineyards </em>v. <em>Monterey Peninsula Water Management Dist. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1122 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">E. <em>The Project\u2019s Impacts on the Eel River</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Although we conclude the EIR must discuss the fact that the diversion of Eel River water has harmed salmonid species in that river, we do not agree that this harm is a significant impact caused by <em>this </em>Project, as appellants argue. Nor do we agree with appellants\u2019 argument that another significant impact of the Project is the possibility that, by committing additional Russian River water to Agency customers, the Agency will cause FERC to reject the pending proposals to curtail Eel River diversions.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">In general, an EIR is required to identify and focus on direct and indirect environmental impacts caused by a project. Significant impacts typically involve changes in the existing environment caused by a project. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15126.2, subd. (a).) The Agency\u2019s Project, neither approves nor makes any change to Eel River diversions. Accordingly, it does not cause the conditions in the Eel River. These conditions, which predate the Project, would exist even if the Project was not approved. The record makes clear that the diversion of Eel River water is authorized by FERC through a license that gives PG&amp;E the right to divert water from the Eel River. PG&amp;E\u2019s diversion of this water into the Russian River takes place under a contract between the Agency and PG&amp;E entered into in 1965. Under its terms, PG&amp;E directs water from the Eel River into the Russian River and, in exchange, the Agency maintains dams and other structures associated with the PVP.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Both the FERC licensing procedure and the contract between the Agency and PG&amp;E may well be \u201cprojects\u201d under CEQA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See Guidelines, \u00a7 15378, subd. (a) [a project is the \u201cwhole of an action which has a potential for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment\u201d].) Quite clearly, neither the FERC proceeding nor the 1965 contract is the subject of the EIR challenged by appellants. Both the FERC proceeding and the 1965 contract may have significant environmental impacts, but nothing in the record indicates these impacts are caused by the Agency\u2019s Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">In reality, appellants seem to be arguing that, although the Project does not authorize or change the diversion of Eel River water, the Agency must nevertheless account for the consequences of this diversion in its EIR for the Project simply because the Agency relies on these diversions. Appellants have not cited any authority for the proposition that, when a project relies on an arrangement that predates the project and is authorized in a different proceeding, the project\u2019s EIR must consider the significant impacts of this prior arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">One case cited by appellants in support of this argument is <em>County of Inyo v. Yorty </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795 [108 Cal.Rptr. 377]. <em>County of Inyo </em>involves the withdrawal of water from the Owens Valley to supply residents of the Los Angeles Basin. The project in <em>County of Inyo </em>was a proposal by the City of Los Angeles to expand and accelerate its extraction of subsurface water from Owens Valley. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 799.) The city argued it was not required to prepare an EIR for this proposal because it was not a new project. The court disagreed and held that the \u201cCity\u2019s expanded tapping and extraction of the underground water is an\u2018ongoing project,\u2019requiring an EIR . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019(Id. </em>at p. 808.) <em>County of Inyo </em>holds that, when a project proposes an increase in the scope of an existing project, an EIR must be prepared. Here, however, the Agency\u2019s Project does not involve any increase in or change to Eel River diversions. <em>County of Inyo </em>is, therefore, not helpful to appellants. <em>Santiago County Water Dist. v. County of Orange </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818 [173 Cal.Rptr. 602] is similarly inapposite. The <em>Santiago County </em>court found that an EIR for a sand and gravel mine was deficient because it failed to analyze the increased demands for water that would result from the construction of the mine. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 831.) Because there is no evidence the Agency\u2019s Project will result in any increase in diversions from the Eel River, <em>Santiago County </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">We turn next to the issue of whether the EIR must consider the impact of the Agency\u2019s approval of the Project on the FERC proceedings. An EIR must discuss a project\u2019s direct and indirect significant impacts, but these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>impacts need be discussed only if they are likely to result from the project. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15126.2.) There is no requirement that an EIR analyze speculative impacts. Guidelines section 15145 provides, \u201cIf, after thorough investigation, a lead agency finds that a particular impact is too speculative for evaluation, the agency should note its conclusion and terminate discussion of the impact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Appellants suggest that, if the Project is approved, the Agency will somehow lock in Eel River diversions and thus will make it impossible for FERC to curtail these diversions. The Agency points out that appellants\u2019 argument is based on an assumption that FERC will respond to the Project\u2019s approval by refusing to curtail Eel River diversions. Appellants have cited no evidence that the Agency\u2019s approval of the Project is a legally cognizable factor in FERC\u2019s decision to curtail Eel River diversions. The Agency, therefore, properly concluded it need not consider the impact of approving the Project on the FERC proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">F. <em>Growth-inducing Impacts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The Project is designed to accommodate the projected population growth of the eight cities and counties served by the Agency, as that growth is forecast under the general plans for these cities and counties. Between 1987 and 1995, EIR\u2019s were prepared for each of these general plans. In considering the growth inducing impacts of the Project, the Agency incorporates the discussion contained in these general plan EIR\u2019s. Appellants now contend the Agency\u2019s EIR is deficient because the Agency was required to prepare its own analysis of the consequences of growth in these eight cities and counties. The Agency argues that its reliance on these general plans is permitted under Guidelines section 15130, subdivision (b)(1)(B), which provides that a cumulative impacts analysis can rely on a \u201csummary of projections contained in an adopted general plan or related planning document, or in a prior environmental document which has been adopted or certified, which described or evaluated regional or areawide conditions contributing to the cumulative impact.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Appellants suggest for the first time in their reply brief that the EIR\u2019s relied on by the Agency are deficient because these documents do not address the cumulative impacts of regional growth. Appellants support this contention with a blanket reference to seven volumes of the administrative record, the functional equivalent of offering no support whatsoever for this proposition. A \u201c \u2018. . . reviewing court is not required to make an independent, unassisted study of the record in search of error . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Guthrie </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1115 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 27]) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>and may treat an issue as waived \u201cwhen an appellant makes a general assertion, unsupported by specific argument . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Stanley </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 793 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 897 P.2d 481].) Because we are not required to comb through the nearly 7,000 pages of the record cited by appellants in order to locate these claimed deficiencies, we treat this argument as having been waived by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">G. <em>Responses to Comments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Appellants also contend the Agency failed to or did not adequately respond to a number of comments regarding various aspects of the EIR. Two of these comments raise issues we have identified as inadequately addressed by the Agency in the EIR and, therefore, these comments must be addressed in a revised EIR. Specifically, comment 1-9 requests additional evaluation of potential decreases in PVP diversions from the Eel River. Because we have held the Agency must take into account the pending proposals to curtail Eel River diversions, a revised EIR must address this request. Comment 45-3 requests that the EIR include a figure depicting the Eel River, a request the Agency must fulfill when it revises the description of the Project\u2019s environmental setting.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">We have reviewed the Agency\u2019s responses to the remaining comments and conclude they are adequate. \u201cGuideline, section 15088, subdivision (b), explains that what is required of the responses is \u2018good faith, reasoned analysis. . . . Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice.\u2019\u201d <em>(Towards Responsibility in Planning </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 671, 683 [246 Cal.Rptr. 317].) \u201c \u2018The courts have looked not for perfection but for adequacy, completeness, and a good faith effort at full disclosure.\u2019 . . . Thus, a lead agency need not respond to each comment made during the review process, however, it must specifically respond to the most significant environmental questions presented. [Citation.] Further, the determination of the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s responses to comments on the draft EIR turns upon the detail required in the responses. [Citation.] Where a general comment is made, a general response is sufficient. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Browning-Ferris Industries v. City Council </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 852, 862 [226 Cal.Rptr. 575], italics omitted.) With these principles in mind, we will address briefly the remaining comments and responses challenged by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Comment 226-1 expresses a general concern that the Project will degrade natural habitats, reduce water for agricultural uses, and impact the health and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>safety of drinking water. The Agency responded that the project would not have impacts on the Eel River and that its objective is to \u201cprovide a safe, economical, and reliable water supply . . . .\u201d The response also referred to a more extensive discussion of agricultural water use contained elsewhere in the EIR. Given the lack of specificity contained in this comment, the Agency\u2019s response is adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Comments 226-2 and 226-4 request that the Agency prepare a watershed management plan. We agree with the Agency that this comment asks the Agency to consider a different project and thus fails to raise any significant issues regarding the Project itself. The Agency\u2019s response, that a watershed management plan is not part of the Project, along with a reference to the section of the EIR discussing the Agency\u2019s watershed management activities, is adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Comment 44-6 raises the issue of why the Agency had not developed programs to identify the habitat needs of steelhead trout, coho salmon, and chinook salmon. The Agency\u2019s response refers to its discussion of the listing of these species under the Endangered Species Act. We agree with the Agency that this comment does not point out any deficiencies in the Agency\u2019s analysis of the Project\u2019s impacts on these species in the EIR and, therefore, the Agency\u2019s response is adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">H. <em>'California Planning Law Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Appellants argue the Agency has failed to comply with certain planning law requirements. Appellants contend the Agency is in violation of Government Code sections 53091, 65401 and 65402 because it did not consider whether its Project is in compliance with the general plans of Marin, Mendocino, and Humboldt Counties. This argument is based on a misreading of the requirements of these Government Code sections and we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Government Code section 53091 provides that \u201c[ejach local agency shall comply with all applicable building ordinances and zoning ordinances of the county or city in which the territory of the local agency is situated.\u201d Appellants read this as a requirement that the Project comply with the general plans of Marin, Mendocino, and Humboldt Counties because the Agency\u2019s water transmission system operates in all of these counties. We disagree. This statute does not mandate compliance with applicable general plans at all. Rather, it contemplates compliance with building and zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">Neither of the cases cited by appellants convinces us otherwise. In <em>City of Lafayette v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1005, 1009 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>[20 Cal.Rptr.2d 658], the East Bay Municipal Utility District proposed to expand and improve facilities at a filter plant that treated raw water for delivery to the district\u2019s customers. The district applied for a use permit for the project from the City of Lafayette, where the project was located. After the city denied the application, the district attempted to declare itself exempt from compliance with Lafayette\u2019s zoning and building ordinances. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1012.) The issue in <em>City of Lafayette </em>is whether the district\u2019s project was exempt from these ordinances. Although appellants assert this case stands for the proposition that the district was required to comply with the City of Lafayette\u2019s general plan, this issue is simply never discussed. In <em>Lawler v. City of Redding </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 778 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 392], the court held that the City of Redding was categorically exempt from compliance with the county\u2019s general plan under Government Code sections 53090 and 53091. It did not, therefore, address the specific question of whether section 53091 requires that an Agency\u2019s project comply with a county general plan. Our reading of this statute\u2019s plain language leads to the conclusion that it does not concern general plan compliance, a subject covered in Government Code sections 65401 and 65402.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Appellants further contend that, under Government Code section 65401, the Agency was required to submit its Project to the county planning agencies of all counties in which its water transmission system is located for review and report as to their conformity with these counties\u2019 general plans. The Agency counters that it was only required to do so in Sonoma County. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Government Code section 65401 provides, \u201cIf a general plan or part thereof has been adopted, within such time as may be fixed by the legislative body, each county or city officer, department, board, or commission, and each governmental body, commission, or board, including the governing body of any special district or school district, whose jurisdiction lies wholly or partially within the county or city, whose functions include recommending, preparing plans for, or constructing, major public works, shall submit to the official agency, as designated by the respective county board of supervisors or city council, a list of the proposed public works recommended for planning, initiation or construction during the ensuing fiscal year. The official agency receiving the list of proposed public works shall list and classify all such recommendations and shall prepare a coordinated program of proposed public works for the ensuing fiscal year. Such coordinated program shall be submitted to the county or city planning agency for review and report to said official agency as to conformity with the adopted general plan or part thereof.\u201d Section 65402, subdivision (c) provides that local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>agencies shall not construct or authorize a public structure in any county until the project has been submitted to and reported upon by the planning agency having jurisdiction over the project as to conformity with the local general plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">We read these statutes as requiring the Agency to submit the Project, which involves the construction of additional facilities only in Sonoma County, to the Sonoma County Planning Commission. Although appellants suggest that the Project \u201cevolves [sz'c] the construction and maintenance of check dams and other structures associated with the PVP in Mendocino County,\u201d in fact these facilities have already been constructed and are not subject to review under Government Code section 65402, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Appellants acknowledge the Agency did submit the Project to the Sonoma County Planning Commission, as it was required to do. Nevertheless, appellants contend the EIR is deficient because the Project is in direct conflict with the Sonoma County general plan and this conflict is not disclosed in the EIR. An EIR is required to \u201cdiscuss any inconsistencies between the proposed project and applicable general plans . . . .\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15125, subd. (d).) Thus, to the extent the Project is inconsistent with general plan goals such as the protection of rare and endangered species and stream environments, the EIR must discuss this inconsistency. When the Agency drafts a subsequent EIR to correct the deficiencies identified in this opinion, it may identify inconsistencies between the Project and the Sonoma County general plan, including those provisions that identify a policy to protect and restore fish and wildlife resources. At this point, however, we are unable to conclude the Project conflicts with the Sonoma County general plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">I. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">We have concluded, based on the foregoing analysis of CEQA, that the EIR prepared by the Agency is an inadequate informational document. The EIR fails to adequately discuss the cumulative impact of the Project and the proposal pending before FERC to curtail Eel River diversions. To the extent the adequate analysis of Project alternatives depends on the EIR\u2019s thorough consideration of the Project\u2019s cumulative impacts, the EIR\u2019s alternatives analysis is also deficient. Further, the EIR fails to provide an accurate description of the Project\u2019s environmental setting. The EIR must disclose that diversions from the Eel River have impacted salmonid species in that river and given rise to proposals pending before FERC to curtail Eel River diversions. Finally, we conclude the Agency\u2019s responses to comments violate CEQA insofar as these comments raise issues we have identified as inadequately addressed in the EIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>\u201cWhen the informational requirements of CEQA are not complied with, an agency has failed to proceed in \u2018a manner required by law\u2019 and has therefore abused its discretion. [Citations.] [U] . . . While we may not substitute our judgment for that of the decision makers, we must ensure strict compliance with the procedures and mandates of the statute.

The Agency\u2019s deficient EIR has made meaningful assessment of the potentially significant impacts of its Project impossible. Therefore, the Agency\u2019s failure to proceed as required by law was prejudicial and the trial court erred in denying appellants\u2019 petition for a writ of mandate vacating certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Sierra Club v.

Code Regs., tit. 14], \u00a7\u00a7 15125, 15126.2, subd. (a).)\u201d <em>(County of Amador </em>v. <em>El Dorado County Water Agency </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 952 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 66].) The majority recognizes that an adequate description of the Project\u2019s environmental setting is necessary to insure that the EIR\u2019s (environmental impact report) analysis of significant impacts \u201cis as accurate as possible\u201d and notes two major deficiencies. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 874.) The existing description veils the Project\u2019s dependence on maintaining existing Eel River diversions and the effects of those diversions on fish populations in that river. It also gives only a myopic view of the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) proceedings in which flow curtailments from the Eel River have been proposed. Thus, a sufficient \u201cbaseline\u201d does not exist from which it can be accurately determined if the Project will, or will not have, a significant impact on the Eel River.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Until this veil is lifted by an adequate description of the environmental setting, as required by the majority opinion, it is premature to find that the Project has no significant impact on the Eel River. I therefore dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that the Project will not cause a significant impact on the Eel River. In all other respects, I concur in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 13, 2003, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
