(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 976(d).)\u201d <em>(White v. Davis </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 579 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 74, 133 P.2d 648].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"b221-13\">CURRY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">The two actions underlying the consolidated appeals before us arise from the state budget impasses in 1997 and 1998. In the first action, Steven White sought declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the conduct of several state officials during the budget impasse in 1997, and demurrers to the individual\u2019s first amended complaint were sustained without leave to amend. In the second action, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association (Jarvis), joined by White, sought injunctive relief barring Kathleen Connell, Controller for the State of California (the Controller), from issuing warrants prior to the passage of a budget in 1998, and the trial court issued a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">In view of the Legislature\u2019s enactment of Budget Acts for the 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 fiscal years and concessions by Jarvis and White during oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>argument before us, we dismiss the appeal in the first action as moot. Although the appeal in the second action is also technically moot, we retain the case for decision due to the importance of the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Regarding the preliminary injunction issued in the second action, we affirm in part and reverse in part. As we explain below (see Discussion, pt. II., <em>post), </em>the Controller may disburse funds during a budget impasse when state and federal law properly authorizes or requires their payment, despite the absence of a budget act or emergency appropriation. In some cases, state laws and provisions of the California Constitution function as appropriations outside the budget act. Furthermore, due to the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, some federal laws require the payment of funds, notwithstanding the requirement for an appropriation in the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">To the extent that the parties have identified particular state and federal laws, we conclude that absent a budget act or emergency appropriation, the Controller may properly disburse funds pursuant to (1) continuing appropriations found in statutes and other provisions of law, (2) article III, section 4, and article XVI, section 8.5 of the California Constitution, (3) the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.), and (4) federal funding mandates applicable to the food stamp program (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 et seq.), foster care and adoption programs (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 670 et seq.), child support program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-669b), and child welfare services program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 620-628).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Relevant Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Steven White initiated the first underlying action on July 25, 1997. On September 22, 1997, White filed his first amended complaint against the following individuals then holding elected office: Pete Wilson, Governor of the State of California, Gray Davis, Lieutenant Governor of the State of California, Kathleen Connell, Controller for the State of California, and Matt Fong, Treasurer of the State of California, as well as Bill Lockyer, President Pro Tempore of the Senate of the State of California, Cruz M. Bustamante, Speaker of the Assembly of the State of California, Rob Hurtt, Senate Republican Leader, and Curt Pringle, Assembly Republican Leader.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>White\u2019s first amended complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief. It alleged that the Legislature had failed to pass a budget for the 1997-1998 fiscal year by the constitutionally mandated date of June 15, 1997 (Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 12), and that from June 15, 1997, to August 18, 1997, when a budget was finally enacted and approved, the Controller was improperly permitted to pay funds from the state treasury to welfare recipients, state employees, members of the Legislature and other individuals without the enactment of a constitutionally mandated emergency appropriation bill (Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 12; art. XVI, \u00a7 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Following a hearing on March 13, 1998, the trial court sustained the defendants\u2019 demurrers to White\u2019s first amended complaint without leave to amend, concluding that White\u2019s claims were moot for the 1997-1998 fiscal year, and premature for the following fiscal year. White appealed from the subsequent order of dismissal (case No. B122178).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">On June 24, 1998, Jarvis and White initiated the second underlying action with a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, and for a writ of mandate, against the Controller in her capacity as state controller. The complaint alleged that the Legislature had not passed a budget for the 1998-1999 fiscal year by June 15, 1998, that under the state Constitution, the state government \u201cmust close\u201d in the absence of a budget or emergency bills, and that the Controller was likely to disburse funds despite this constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">On July 9, 1998, the trial court issued a temporary restraining order barring the Controller from paying out funds absent a budget or an emergency appropriation, unless the payments were authorized by a continuing appropriation or by federal law. Subsequently, the trial court granted intervener status to several state employees, unions, and professional associations (the state employee interveners),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as to Jerome Feitelberg and Alameda Drug Company.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">On July 21, 1998, the trial court issued a preliminary injunction barring the Controller from disbursing any funds absent a budget, with the exception of funds properly appropriated prior to July 1, 1998, for expenditure in the 1998-1999 fiscal year, funds properly appropriated pursuant to emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>bills, and payments of minimum wages and overtime compensation required under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.) for work performed prior to July 21, 1998. Jarvis and White were required to post a $100,000 bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The Controller and the state employee interveners appealed from the order granting the preliminary injunction (case No. B123992). In connection with this appeal, several of the state employee interveners sought to stay enforcement of the preliminary injunction by petition for writ of supersedeas in the Court of Appeal. In addition, the Controller and the state employee interveners filed petitions for writ of mandate in the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On July 28, 1998, Division Two of this district issued a writ of supersedeas, and the petitions for writ of mandate before the Supreme Court were subsequently transferred to Division Two (case Nos. B124395, B124397, B124398). The appeal in the second action and related petitions were ultimately transferred to this court and consolidated with the appeal in the first action pending before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The issue of mootness arises at the threshold of our discussion because the Legislature enacted (albeit belatedly) budgets for the 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 fiscal years. Furthermore, during oral argument, counsel for Jarvis and White represented that no further relief would be sought in the superior court in the underlying actions. In addition, counsel for Jarvis and White represented that White would not pursue his claims in the first action against Lockyer, Bustamante, Hurtt, Pringle, or any other legislators, that the first action had otherwise merged into the second action, and that Jarvis and White seek a decision from us only on the substantive legal issues regarding the Controller\u2019s disbursement of funds raised in the second action.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Under these circumstances, the cases before us are technically moot.  However, appellate courts have the \u201cdiscretion to decide otherwise moot cases presenting important issues that are capable of repetition yet tend to evade review.\u201d <em>(Conservatorship of Wendland </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 519, 524, fn. 1 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 28 P.3d 151]; see <em>County of Fresno v. Shelton </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 996, 1006 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 272].) Here, the issues presented are of profound public significance and arise with some frequency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>but escape review with the enactment of a budget. Long before the events underlying the cases before us, our Supreme Court remarked in <em>Jarvis v. Cory </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 562, 574, footnote 6 [170 Cal.Rptr. 11, 620 P.2d 598], that budget impasses have \u201cpractically become an annual event. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In view of the concessions by Jarvis and White, we dismiss the first action as moot, but retain the second action for decision. For this reason, we limit our inquiry to the questions presented by the preliminary injunction issued in the second action.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In the appeal in the second action, the Controller and the state employee interveners contend that during a budget impasse, the Controller may disburse funds pursuant to (1) continuing appropriations, (2) provisions of the California Constitution, and (3) the FLSA and other federal law. In addition, they contend that (4) the trial court did not require Jarvis and White to post an adequate bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the trial court considers two related factors: (1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits of its case at trial, and (2) the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction. <em>(King </em>v. <em>Meese </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1217, 1226 [240 Cal.Rptr. 829, 743 P.2d 889].) \u201cThe latter factor involves consideration of such things as the inadequacy of other remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity of preserving the status quo.\u201d <em>(Abrams </em>v. <em>St. John\u2019s Hospital &amp; Health Center </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 603].)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">The determination whether to grant a preliminary injunction generally rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>(Abrams v. St. John\u2019s Hospital &amp; Health Center, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at p. 636.) \u201cDiscretion is abused when a court exceeds the bounds of reason or contravenes uncontradicted evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lessen v. Keystone Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 454, 458 [191 Cal.Rptr. 104].)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">\u201cThe granting of a preliminary injunction does not constitute a final adjudication of the controversy. [Citation.] Its purpose is to preserve the status quo until a final determination following a trial. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Scaringe </em>v. <em>J. C. C. Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536, 1542 [253 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>344], disapproved on another ground in <em>Citizens for Covenant Compliance v. Andersen </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 345, 359, 367 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 898, 906 P.2d 1314].)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">To the extent that the trial court\u2019s ruling rests on factual findings regarding the pertinent factors, we review the record for substantial evidence to support the findings. <em>(American Academy of Pediatrics v. Van de Kamp </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 831, 838-839 [263 Cal.Rptr. 46].) However, to the extent that the ruling presents an issue of pure law not presenting factual issues, we review the determination de novo. (See <em>Efstratis v. First Northern Bank </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 667, 671-672 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 445].)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">B. <em>Continuing Appropriations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In issuing the preliminary injunction, the trial court concluded that funds may not be disbursed pursuant to continuing appropriations in the absence of a budget act or emergency appropriation. In our view, the trial court erred on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Before the trial court, Jarvis and White argued in general terms that continuing appropriations lack a constitutional basis. The Controller disputed this contention, and pointed to statutes and other provisions of laws that purportedly establish continuing appropriations, including general obligation bond acts approved by the voters pursuant to article XVI, section 1 of the state Constitution. The trial court concluded that Jarvis and White\u2019s general contention was correct, and it did not make individualized determinations as to whether any of the statutes or laws cited by the Controller establish a continuing appropriation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Setting aside Jarvis and White\u2019s general contention that such continuing appropriations are constitutionally infirm, they do not argue on appeal that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>any of the cited statutes and laws are <em>not </em>intended to create continuing appropriations. Because the trial court did not address the existence of individual continuing appropriations and a full showing has not been made regarding them, we limit our inquiry to Jarvis and White\u2019s contention regarding the constitutional soundness of continuing appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Generally, \u201c[i]n construing constitutional and statutory provisions, whether enacted by the Legislature or by initiative, the intent of the enacting body is the paramount consideration.\u201d <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 889 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].) To determine this intent, we look first to the plain language of the law, read in context, and will not add to the law or rewrite it to conform to an assumed intent not apparent from the language. <em>(People ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 294, 301 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 855, 926 P.2d 1042].) Whenever possible, we seek an interpretation that harmonizes Constitution and statute. <em>(California Housing Finance Agency </em>v. <em>Elliott </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 575, 594 [131 Cal.Rptr. 361, 551 P.2d 1193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Article IV, section 12, subdivision (c) of the California Constitution provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe Legislature shall pass the budget bill by midnight on June 15 of each year. Until the budget bill has been enacted, the Legislature shall not send to the Governor for consideration any bill appropriating funds for expenditure during the fiscal year for which the budget bill is to be enacted, except emergency bills recommended by the Governor or appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the Legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Article XVI, section 7 of the California Constitution further provides that \u201c[m]oney may be drawn from the Treasury only through an appropriation made by law and upon a Controller\u2019s duly drawn warrant.\u201d  As the court explained in <em>California Assn. for Safety Education v. Brown </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1282 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 404], \u201c[a]n appropriation is a legislative act setting aside \u2018a certain sum of money for a specified object in such manner that the executive officers are authorized to use that money and no more for such specified purpose.\u2019 [Citation.] A continuous appropriation runs from year to year <em>without the need for further authorization in the budget act. </em>[Citations.]\u201d (Fn. omitted, italics added.) Government Code sections 16304 and 13340, which fall within the statutory scheme governing appropriations, recognize and regulate continuing appropriations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (30 Cal.App.4th at p. 1282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Generally, the Legislature \u201cmay exercise any and all legislative powers which are not expressly or by necessary implication denied to it by the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento v. Saylor </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 685, 691 [97 Cal.Rptr. 1, 488 P.2d 161].) Here, nothing in California Constitution, article IV, section 12, expressly bars continuing appropriations. On its face, section 12 prohibits the Legislature from sending specified appropriation bills to the Governor prior to the enactment of a budget, and it provides for exceptions to this prohibition; it does not otherwise limit the Legislature\u2019s authority to enact appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Jarvis and White nonetheless contend that continuing appropriations are constitutionally unsound, arguing that (1) the structure of the budget process, as delineated in the state Constitution, bars such appropriations, and that (2) the revision of the state Constitution in 1966 that resulted in article IV, section 12, abrogated the constitutional basis for such appropriations. We disagree. As we explain below, prior to the 1966 revision, former article IV, section 34 of the Constitution\u2014the predecessor of article IV, section 12\u2014permitted the disbursement of funds pursuant to continuing appropriations, and nothing in the 1966 revision eliminated the constitutional basis for these appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">1. <em>Former Article IV, Section 34</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Former section 34 of 'California Constitution, article IV, which was adopted in 1922, provided in pertinent part: \u201cThe Governor shall, . . . [at] each regular session of the legislature . . . , submit to the legislature, with an explanatory message, a budget containing a complete plan and itemized statement of all proposed expenditures of the state <em>provided by existing law </em>or recommended by him .... The budget shall be accompanied by an appropriation bill covering the proposed expenditures, to be known as the budget bill. . . . Until the budget bill has been finally enacted, neither house shall place upon final passage any other appropriation bill, except emergency bills recommended by the Governor, or appropriations for the salaries, mileage and expenses of the senate and assembly.\u201d (Stats. 1923, p. xvii, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>In <em>Railroad Commission </em>v. <em>Riley </em>(1923) 192 Cal. 54, 56-58 [218 P. 415], our Supreme Court addressed whether California Constitution, former article IV, section 34, impliedly repealed a statute that had created a special fund for the use of the Railroad Commission, and financed from the collection of fees. The Railroad Commission sought a writ of mandate when the state Controller declined to deposit fees in the fund following the adoption of former article IV, section 34. (192 Cal. at pp. 54-55, 58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In granting the writ, the court in <em>Railroad Commission </em>concluded nothing in California Constitution, former article IV, section 34, barred the fund\u2019s existence, citing the principle that \u201c[r]epeals by implication are not favored and are recognized only when there is an irreconcilable conflict between two or more existing legislative enactments.\u201d <em>(Railroad Commission v. Riley, supra, </em>192 Cal. at p. 57.) On this matter, the <em>Railroad Commission </em>court placed special emphasis on the requirement in former article IV, section 34, that the Governor should submit a budget identifying proposed expenditures \u201c <em>\u2018provided by existing </em>law.\u2019 \u201d (192 Cal. at pp. 57-58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Subsequently, in <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1924) 193 Cal. 773, 776 [227 P. 772], the state Controller sought a writ of mandate to transfer to the state treasury a special fund created by statute to pay the salaries and operating costs of the commission that regulated harbor pilots. The fund was financed from fees collected from harbor pilots. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 778.) The state Controller argued that money in the fund should be absorbed into the treasury because the state budget contained a small appropriation for the commission, even though the budget allocated no funds to pay the commissioners\u2019 salaries. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 776, 780. )</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Our Supreme Court denied the writ, concluding that neither the state budget nor former article IV, section 34, abolished the fund. <em>(Riley v. Thompson, supra, </em>193 Cal. at pp. 778-781.) Furthermore, the court in <em>Riley </em>held that the commissioners\u2019 salaries were properly paid from the fund, <em>despite </em>the absence of an allocation in the budget for this purpose. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 781. )</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">In numerous other cases prior to 1966, the Supreme Court affirmed the existence and propriety of continuing appropriations. <em>(Gillum v. Johnson </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 744, 758 [62 P.2d 1037, 108 A.L.R. 595]; <em>Daugherty </em>v. <em>Riley </em>(1934) 1 Cal.2d 298, 308-309 [34 P.2d 1005]; <em>Board etc. Commrs. v.

L.Rev. 48, 48 (hereafter Sumner).) \u201cUnder procedures authorized by the constitution, the Legislature, in 1961, adopted a constitutional amendment that authorized the Legislature to act, in effect, as a constitutional convention by allowing it to submit proposals for revision of the constitution to the voters. The amendment was placed on the November 1962 ballot and was approved by the voters by a margin of more than 2 to 1.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The Legislature subsequently created the Constitutional Revision Commission to implement this amendment.

In 1966, the commission\u2019s first set of proposals, which rewrote approximately one-third of the Constitution, was adopted by the Legislature and approved by the voters. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 49.) \u201cAlong with the changes contained in the revision, 16,000 words were deleted from the constitution.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Under the 1966 revision, California Constitution, former section 34 of article IV was renumbered section 12 of that article, and its language was simplified. The change most pertinent here concerns the requirement in former section 34 concerning the Governor\u2019s duty to submit a budget. Following the 1966 revisions, this requirement now states in pertinent part that \u201cthe Governor shall submit to the Legislature, with an explanatory message, a budget for the ensuing fiscal year containing itemized statements for recommended state expenditures and estimated state revenues.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 12, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">As part of the revision process, the Legislature also enacted former Government Code section 12016, which provided in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he budget required by the State Constitution to be submitted by the Governor . . . shall contain a complete plan and itemized statement of all proposed expenditures of the state <em>provided by existing law </em>or recommended by him . . . .\u201d (Italics added, added by Stats. 1966, ch. 161, \u00a7 9.3, p. 713 and repealed by Stats. 1984, ch. 1286, \u00a7 2, p. 4377.) This statute became effective only upon the voters\u2019 approval of the constitutional revisions at issue here. (Stats. 1966, ch. 161, \u00a7 33, p. 720; Stats. 1966, ch. 139, \u00a7 12, p. 969.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">3. <em>Constitutional Soundness of Continuing Appropriations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Following the 1966 revision, the Courts of Appeal have recognized the existence of continuing appropriations (e.g., <em>California Assn, for Safety </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>Education v. Brown, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at p. 1283; <em>Walsh v. Board of Administration </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 682, 689-699 &amp; fn. 5 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 118]), but no court has addressed whether the 1966 revision abrogated such appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The language of California Constitution, article IV, section 12, closely resembles that of former article IV, section 34, which, as we have explained (see pt. I. B.2., <em>ante), </em>authorized the disbursement of funds from continuing appropriations independent of a budget act. This similarity of language supports the conclusion that the two provisions carry the same meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">As the court explained in <em>County of Sacramento v. Hickman </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 841, 850 [59 Cal.Rptr. 609, 428 P.2d 593], \u201c \u2018[i]n the absence of contrary indication in a constitutional amendment, terms used therein must be construed in the light of their statutory meaning or interpretation in effect at the time of its adoption.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Michels v. Watson </em>(1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 404, 408 [40 Cal.Rptr. 464].) This is because \u201c \u2018we cannot suppose that the framers of the new constitution were ignorant of the point decided, or that they intended the provision we adopted from the old constitution to have an operation theretofore uniformly denied to it\u2019 [citation]; and the new constitutional provision should be given the construction placed upon its predecessor even though we might not have so decided the point as a matter of first impression [citation].\u201d <em>(County of Sacramento v. Hickman, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at p. 850; see <em>Professional Engineers </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 543, 564 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 936 P.2d 473].)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Jarvis and White disagree, contending that the removal of the phrase \u201cby existing law\u201d from the statement of the Governor\u2019s duty to propose a budget in California Constitution, article IV, section 12, and its concurrent placement in former Government Code section 12016 by the Legislature signaled the abrogation of continuing appropriations. They observe that the court in <em>Railroad Commission v. Riley, supra, </em>192 Cal. at pages 56-58, cited the presence of this phrase in former article IV, section 34, as evidence for its conclusion that former section 34 did not repeal continuing appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">We are not persuaded. The issue presented is similar to that resolved in <em>Railroad Commission </em>v. <em>Riley, supra, </em>192 Cal. 54.  Thus, following <em>Railroad Commission, </em>we decline to find a repeal by implication unless \u201cthere is an irreconcilable conflict between two or more existing legislative enactments.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 57; see <em>Caminetti v. Pac. Mutual L. Ins. Co. </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 344, 367 [139 P.2d 908].) No such conflict is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Rather, the language and history of California Constitution, article IV, section 12, and former Government Code section 12016 indicate that the 1966 revision was intended to preserve continuing appropriations. The duty regarding the budget imposed on the Governor under former Government Code section 12016, on its face, is consistent with the duty stated in subdivision (a) of article IV, section 12: the phrase \u201crecommended state expenditures\u201d in article IV, section 12, reasonably encompasses expenditures \u201cprovided by existing law or recommended by\u201d the Governor, as stated in former Government Code section 12016.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Moreover, as our Supreme Court remarked regarding another provision of California Constitution, article IV, the 1966 revision to article IV \u201cwas intended solely to shorten and simplify the Constitution, deleting unnecessary provisions; it did not enact any substantive change in the power of the Legislature and the people.\u201d <em>(Associated Home Builders etc., Inc. v. City of Livermore </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 595, fn. 12 [135 Cal.Rptr. 41, 557 P.2d 473, 92 A.L.R.3d 1038].) Nothing in the legislative history of article IV, section 12, or former Government Code section 12016 that the parties have submitted to us betrays an intent to abrogate continuing appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">By contrast, Jarvis and White contend that California Constitution, article IV, section 12, abrogated the continuing appropriations denoted by the phrase \u201cprovided by existing law\u201d in former Government Code section 12016, despite the intertwined history of these provisions.  However, in assessing this history, the settled principles of construction direct us to accord a \u201cstrong presumption in favor of the Legislature\u2019s interpretation of a provision of the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Saylor, supra, 5 </em>Cal.3d at p. 692.) Here, the interpretation advanced by Jarvis and White renders the Legislature\u2019s placement of the phrase at issue in former Government Code section 12016 \u201credundant and a nullity, thereby violating one of the most elementary principles of statutory construction. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Cal Pacific Collections, Inc. v. Powers </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 135, 139 [74 Cal.Rptr. 289, 449 P.2d 225].)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The trial court therefore erred in determining that continuing appropriations are constitutionally infirm.  Because \u201c[a]n injunction cannot be granted \u2018[t]o prevent officers of the law from executing a public statute for the public benefit[]\u2019 \u201d (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Provisional Remedies, \u00a7 332, p. 265), the preliminary injunction must be reversed insofar as it rests on this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">C. <em>Constitutionally Mandated Payments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">In concluding that continuing appropriations lack a constitutional basis, the trial court impliedly rejected the Controller\u2019s contentions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>certain provisions of the state Constitution mandate payments from the treasury independent of the Budget Act. The Controller argues that section 4 of California Constitution, article III, which addresses judicial salaries, and sections 8 and 8.5 of article XVI, which address school funding, constitute payment obligations that do not require an appropriation in the budget act or emergency appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Our inquiry into these contentions is guided by the principle that \u201cin interpreting modem constitutions, their provisions will be presumed to be self-executing and to be given effect without legislation, unless a contrary intention is clearly expressed.\u201d <em>(Flood </em>v. <em>Riggs </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 138, 154 [145 Cal.Rptr. 573].) As our Supreme Court explained long ago in <em>Denninger v. Recorder\u2019s Court </em>(1904) 145 Cal. 629, 635 [79 P. 360], \u201ca necessary corollary to this proposition is[] that a constitutional provision not strictly self-executing becomes operative just as soon as it is supplemented by so much legislation as is <em>absolutely necessary </em>to supply its deficiencies . . . .\u201d (Italics added; accord, <em>In re Development Plan for Bunker Hill </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 21, 75 [37 Cal.Rptr. 74, 389 P.2d 538].)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Instructive applications of this principle and its corollary are found in <em>San Francisco v. Dunn </em>(1886) 69 Cal. 73 [10 P. 191], and <em>Clausing v. San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1224 [271 Cal.Rptr. 72]. In <em>San Francisco, </em>our Supreme Court addressed former article IV, section 22 of the state Constitution. This section stated that \u201c[n]o money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriation made by law, and upon warrants duly drawn thereon by the Controller,\u201d but permitted the Legislature, \u201cnotwithstanding anything contained\u201d in the Constitution, to grant aid to counties, cities, towns, and private entities that supported orphans, with the proviso that enumerated counties, cities and towns that supported orphans were entitled to \u201cthe same pro rata appropriations as may be granted to such institutions under church, or other control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">In <em>San Francisco, </em>the City and County of San Francisco sought a writ of mandate directing the state Controller to disburse the pro rata allocation of aid accorded to them under California Constitution, former section 22 of article IV. <em>(San Francisco v. Dunn, supra, 69 </em>Cal. at p. 74.) Observing that the Legislature had granted aid to private institutions within San Francisco, the court in <em>San Francisco </em>held that the writ was properly granted, reasoning that \u201c[s]uch appropriation having been made, the . . . proviso [in former article IV, section 22] became self-executing as to counties, cities and counties, cities, and towns; and no further legislative action was required.\u201d (69 Cal. at p. 74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">By contrast, in <em>Clausing, </em>a student, together with his parent and guardian, asserted a claim for damages under subdivision (c) of article I, section 28 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the state Constitution, which provides that all students attending public schools \u201c \u2018have the inalienable right to attend campuses which are safe, secure and peaceful.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Clausing v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1235-1236.) Noting that a provision of the Constitution may be mandatory without being self-executing, the court in <em>Clausing </em>concluded that a demurrer to this claim was properly sustained, reasoning that subdivision (c) of section 28 did not provide a remedy for its violation, and no statute filled this gap. (Clausing, atpp. 1235-1238, 1241, &amp; fn. 5.) In so concluding, the <em>Clausing </em>court stated: \u201cThe right proclaimed in section 28, subdivision (c), although inalienable and mandatory, simply establishes the parameters of the principle enunciated; the specific means by which it is to be achieved for the people of California are left to the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Clausing, </em>at p. 1237, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">1. <em>Article III, Section 4</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">With qualifications not relevant here, subdivision (a) of the California Constitution, article III, section 4, provides: \u201c[S]alaries of elected state officers may not be reduced during their term of office. Laws that set these salaries are appropriations.\u201d (Italics added.)  Observing that the salaries of state judges are set by Government Code section 68200 et seq., the Controller argues that she may disburse funds to pay these salaries independent of a budget act or emergency appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In our view, the Controller is correct. Subdivision (a) of the California Constitution, article III, section 4, by its plain language, became self-executing with the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the statutes setting judicial salaries in the Government Code. Under <em>San Francisco, </em>\u201cno further legislative action [is] required\u201d to authorize payment of these salaries. <em>(San Francisco v. Dunn, supra, </em>69 Cal. at p. 74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Our conclusion finds compelling support in <em>Brown v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 242 [188 Cal.Rptr. 425, 655 P.2d 1260], In <em>Brown, </em>the Legislature enacted a statute that authorized several new appellate judges, but provided limited funding for the judges\u2019 staff and library. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 244-246.) After some taxpayers challenged the statute, the superior court concluded that the limited funding rendered the statute unconstitutionally infirm, and it enjoined the implementation of the statute. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Shortly thereafter, the Legislature enacted a budget that cured any inadequacies in the funding. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 246.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Recognizing that the Legislature\u2019s action had eliminated the original basis for the injunction, the court in <em>Brown </em>addressed other alleged infirmities in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the statute. <em>(Brown v. Superior Court, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 247.) The taxpayers contended, inter alia, that the statute was constitutionally unsound because it had not been enacted by a two-thirds majority of the Legislature, as is generally required for appropriations from the state\u2019s general fund (Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 12, subd. (d)). <em>(Brown, </em>at p. 249, fn. 6.) Citing subdivision (a) of article III, section 4, the taxpayers argued that <em>every </em>law setting a judge\u2019s salary, including the statute in question, is an appropriation, and thus subject to the two-thirds vote requirement. <em>(Brown, </em>at p. 249, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The <em>Brown </em>court observed that no judges had ever been appointed or drawn a salary under the statute, but nonetheless addressed the merits of this contention. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 249, fa. 6.) It stated: \u201cThe aim of the declaration in article III, section 4, subdivision (a), . . . was not to require a two-thirds vote but rather to ordain that even with a mere majority vote certain salary laws are \u2018appropriations.\u2019 The critical words were in Proposition 6 adopted by the voters at the November 1972 election. In the voters\u2019 pamphlet the Legislative Counsel explained that the words \u2018would eliminate the existing requirement that there be a specific appropriation in the Budget Act, or otherwise, to pay salaries.\u2019 ... In other words, though a bill setting salaries of elected state officers is not an appropriation bill it nonetheless takes effect as an appropriation once it has been enacted.\u201d <em>(Brown, </em>at pp. 249-250, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Although this discussion by our Supreme Court appears to be dicta, it is persuasive on the issue before us. <em>(Grange Debris Box &amp; Wrecking Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1349, 1358 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 515]; <em>People v. Jackson </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 397, 402 [157 Cal.Rptr. 154].) We therefore conclude that the Controller may properly disburse funds to pay the salaries set forth in Government Code section 68200 et seq., independently of the Budget Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">2. <em>Article XVI, Section 8</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The Controller also contends that she may disburse funds independent of a Budget Act or emergency appropriation pursuant to article XVI, section 8 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Subdivision (a) of California Constitution, article XVI, section 8, provides: \u201cFrom all state revenues there shall first be set apart the moneys to be applied by the state for support of the public school system and public institutions of higher education.\u201d Subdivision (b) of the same section states: \u201cCommencing with the 1990-91 fiscal year, the moneys to be applied by the state for the support of school districts and community college districts shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>be not less than the greater of the following amounts[] . . . .\u201d Subdivision (b) then sets out three formulas.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The first of these determines an amount on the basis of the percentage of general fund revenues appropriated for public schools and community colleges in the 1986-1987 fiscal year (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 8, subd. (b)(1)). The remaining two formulas determine amounts based on the total allocations to public schools and community colleges from defined sources in the prior fiscal year (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 8, subd. (b)(2), (3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">These provisions of California Constitution, article XVI, section 8, are the result of voter initiatives. As the court explained in <em>County of Sonoma v. Commission on State Mandates </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1289 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 784], \u201cProposition 98, adopted by the voters in 1988, amended article XVI, section 8 of the California Constitution to provide a minimum level of funding for schools. [Citation.] The measure ... set up two tests, later expanded by the passage of Proposition 111 in 1990 to three tests, for determining the mandated minimum funding level for the coming year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The court in <em>County of Sonoma </em>further observed: \u201cProposition 98 does not appropriate funds .... The power to appropriate funds was left in the hands of the Legislature. Proposition 98 merely provides the formulas for determining the minimum to be appropriated every budget year. The state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>obligation is to ensure specific amounts of moneys are applied by the state for education.\u201d <em>(County of Sonoma v. Commission on State Mandates, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 1290.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In our view, the <em>County of Sonoma </em>court is correct on this matter. Section 8 of California Constitution, article XVI, on its face, sets a minimum funding level for public schools and community colleges. Furthermore, the second and third formulas that play a role in determining this level for any given fiscal year presuppose that the Legislature has appropriated a specific amount of money for public schools and community colleges in the prior fiscal year. Accordingly, section 8 of article XVI necessarily requires the Legislature to make a determinate appropriation of funds <em>every year </em>that meets or exceeds the specified minimum; otherwise, the second and third formulas cannot fix a minimum level for the <em>following year.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Thus here, as in <em>Clausing, </em>the provisions of California Constitution, article XVI, section 8, although mandatory, \u201csimply establish[] the parameters of the principle enunciated\u201d and leave \u201cthe specific means by which it is to be achieved for the people of California ... to the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Clausing v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1237, fn. omitted.) We therefore conclude that they do not constitute a self-executing authorization to disburse funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Appellants nonetheless contend that the injunction improperly blocks funding for public education and other important governmental functions, arguing that the balance of harms does not favor Jarvis and White. We are not persuaded. We agree that barring the disbursement of such funds may cause severe distress during a budget impasse absent an emergency appropriation by the Legislature. However, in the present case, the Legislature enacted an emergency appropriation to fund vital services and pay the salaries of state employees the day after the trial court issued its injunction; (Stats. 1998, ch. 213, \u00a7 1.)  In any event, as our Supreme Court stated in <em>Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1989) 49 Cal. 3d 432, 447 [261 Cal.Rptr. 574, <em>777 </em>P.2d 610], \u201cif the party seeking the injunction can make a sufficiently strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the trial court has discretion to issue the injunction <em>notwithstanding that party\u2019s inability to show that the balance of harms tips in his favor. </em>[Citation.]\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">3. <em>Article XVI, Section 8.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Finally, the Controller contends that she may disburse funds independent of a budget act or emergency appropriation pursuant to article XVI, section 8.5 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Section 8.5 of California Constitution, article XVI establishes additional education funding subject to article XIII B, which limits-government spending.

Section 8.5 does not extend the Legislature\u2019s spending power to excess revenues; rather it imposes a self-executing, ministerial duty upon the Controller to transfer such excess revenues to a restricted portion of the school fund and thence to allocate such revenues to school districts and community college districts on a per-enrollment basis.

As such, article XVI, section 8.5, bears the earmarks of a continuing appropriation entrenched by the voters in the state Constitution.

D.l.c., <em>post), </em>state employees do not have an entitlement to their full salaries (over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>and above the compensation required under the FLSA) pursuant to the contract clauses of the United States and California Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The FLSA requires employers to pay minimum wages (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(a)) and overtime compensation (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1)), and provides for the recovery of unpaid minimum wages, unpaid overtime compensation, and liquidated damages (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b)).  Generally, \u201cthe FLSA is violated unless the minimum wage is paid on the employee\u2019s regular payday . . . .\u201d <em>(Biggs v. Wilson </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 1 F.3d 1537, 1541.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\"> These provisions encompass public employers, including the states. <em>(Biggs v. Wilson, supra, </em>1 F.3d at p. 1543; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(d), (e)(2)(C).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>at pages 1538-1543, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that California violated the FLSA in 1990 when it failed to pay the wages owed to a group of public transportation employees under the FLSA during a budget impasse until a budget was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The trial court in this case determined that under <em>Biggs, </em>the Controller was authorized to pay minimum wages and overtime compensation required under the FLSA for work performed <em>prior </em>to the date of the preliminary injunction, but state employees who continued to work after this date were \u201cvolunteers.\u201d The trial court thus apparently concluded that a budget impasse nullifies the relationship between the state and its employees, and that employees who continued to work despite notice of this nullification fall outside the protection of the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">We therefore examine three issues: (1) whether there is a continuing employment relationship between the state and its employees during a budget impasse; (2) whether this relationship, if it exists, falls within the scope of the FLSA; and (3) whether state employees are entitled to payment of their salaries during a budget impasse absent an appropriation, over and above the compensation requirements found in the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">a. <em>Continuing Employment Relationship</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Regarding the first issue, we observe that \u201c[pjublic employment, by and large, is not held by contract, but by statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hinchliffe </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>City of San Diego </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 722, 725 [211 Cal.Rptr. 560].) Nonetheless, public employment may give rise to obligations regarding compensation treated as contractual under the contract clauses of the federal and state Constitutions. <em>(Olson v. Cory </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 532, 536-538 [178 Cal.Rptr. 568, 636 P.2d 532].)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">As the court explained in <em>Markman v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 132, 134-135 [110 Cal.Rptr. 610]: \u201cThe terms and conditions relating to employment by a public agency are strictly controlled by statute or ordinance, rather than by ordinary contractual standards; and one who accepts such employment, thereby benefiting in ways denied an employee of a private employer, must in turn relinquish certain rights which are enjoyed by private employees [citation], one such disability being that the public employee is entitled only to such compensation as is expressly provided by statute or ordinance regardless of the extent of services actually rendered. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The Legislature has enacted two statutes concerning the status of public employees and the payment of their salaries during an impasse. Government Code section 1231 provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo state officer or employee shall be deemed to have a break in service or to have terminated his or her employment, for any purpose, nor to have incurred any change in his or her authority, status, or jurisdiction or in his or her salary or other conditions of employment, solely because of the failure to enact a budget act for a fiscal year prior to the beginning of that fiscal year.\u201d Furthermore, Government Code section 1231.1 provides: \u201cFunds from each appropriation made in the budget act for any fiscal year may be expended to pay to officers and employees whatever salary that would have otherwise been received had the budget act been adopted on or prior to July 1, of that fiscal year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In interpreting these statutes, we seek a construction that is constitution^ ally sound. <em>(Kortum v. Alkire </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 325, 333-334 [138 Cal.Rptr. 26].)  \u201cUnder our Constitution the creation of an enforceable contract with the state requires compliance with the constitutional debt limitation provisions of article XVI, section 1, or a valid appropriation in support of the contract under article XVI, section 7. [Citations.] In this respect our law is consistent with federal law and the law of nearly every state in the Union. [Citations.] Persons who deal with the government are held to have notice of this limitation upon the authority to enter into contracts. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Walsh </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 699.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Generally, \u201c[u]nder our Constitution the state can incur valid contractual obligations in four ways: (1) by legislative authorization where the liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>created will not cause aggregate state liabilities to exceed $300,000; (2) by legislative authorization in case of war to repel invasion or suppress insurrection; (3) by compliance with constitutional debt limitation requirements, which include a two-thirds vote of each house of the Legislature and approval by the majority of the voters at a general election or direct primary; or (4) by legislative authorization supported by an appropriation. ([Cal. Const., a]rt. XVI, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7.)\u201d <em>(Walsh v. Board of Administration, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 698-699.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Here, nothing supports a determination that Government Code sections 1231 and 1231.1 establish an obligation to pay employee salaries in conformity with the first three of these ways, which are rooted in the debt limitation provisions of California Constitution, article XVI, section 1. (See <em>Walsh v. Board of Administration, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 698-700.) Nor do the parties dispute that the salaries at issue here are generally paid pursuant to an appropriation on the general treasury fund, rather than pursuant to a continuing appropriation or constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Under these circumstances, Government Code sections 1231 and 1231.1 cannot establish an employment relationship that entitles state employees to their salaries during a budget impasse absent an appropriation, given the constitutional limitations that we have described. In our view, these statutes, if constitutionally sound, authorize a continuing employer-employee relationship during a budget impasse under which entitlement to compensation for work done during the budget impasse arises <em>only </em>upon the satisfaction of a <em>condition precedent, </em>namely, the enactment of a budget or other proper appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Under principles of contract law, an obligation to pay money may be conditioned upon the eventual accrual of funds in a specified source, or when the ability to pay arises. (1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, \u00a7 736, pp. 666-667.) These principles apply to the right to compensation in contracts of employment. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see, e.g., <em>R. J. Kuhl Corp. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1589, 1599-1600 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 425]; <em>Farnon v. Cole </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 855, 858-859 [66 Cal.Rptr. 673]; <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Bechdolt </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 659, 661-663 [42 Cal.Rptr. 53].)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Although the employer-employee relationship at issue here is ultimately governed by statute, we discern no reason rooted in the state Constitution barring the Legislature from subjecting the entitlement to wages earned during a budget impasse to an analogue of a condition precedent. Thus, the entitlement of state employees to compensation for work performed during a budget impasse does not accrue until the enactment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>budget or other proper appropriation. Furthermore, given the friction of democratic politics\u2014which Government Code sections 1231 and 1231.1 impliedly recognize\u2014state employees assume the risk that satisfaction of this condition may be delayed due to the Legislature\u2019s inaction during a budget impasse. (Cf. <em>Kline v. Johnson </em>(1953) 121 Cal.App.2d Supp. 851, 852-854 [under broker\u2019s compensation agreement, broker assumed risk that employer will not ensure performance of act upon which broker\u2019s compensation is conditioned]; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 765, p. 692; Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 239, subd. (2), com. b, p. 228.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">b. <em>Scope of the FLSA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The second issue is whether this employment relationship falls within the scope of the FLSA. Our research has located little case authority addressing the extent to which the FLSA applies to employer-employee relationships subject to such a condition precedent. Nonetheless, we discern guidance in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Klinghoffer Bros. Realty Corp. </em>(2d Cir. 1960) 285 F.2d 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In <em>Klinghoffer Bros., </em>several security officers who worked for a corporation were asked to guard the property of a second, closely related corporation, which had filed a petition for bankruptcy. <em>(United States v. Klinghoffer Bros. Realty Corp., supra, </em>285 F.2d at p. 489.) The security officers were told that due to the second corporation\u2019s financial embarrassment, they would not be paid for their additional overtime services until the bankruptcy proceedings ended. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 489-490.) The security officers provided the additional guard services for a period, but were never compensated during this period, and they ultimately refused to extend any further services at some point before the bankruptcy proceedings terminated. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 490.) The court in <em>Klinghoffer Bros, </em>concluded that the security officers were entitled to prompt and regular payment of overtime compensation under the FLSA, even though they had worked under \u201ca vague understanding that at some indefinite future date, related to the termination of the [bankruptcy] proceedings, they would be taken care of.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 490-493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Here, much as in <em>Klinghoffer Bros., </em>state employees have a continuing relationship with their employer during a budget impasse (Gov. Code, \u00a7 1231), subject to the understanding that payment of wages is dependent upon an appropriation (Gov. Code, \u00a7 1231.1). Accordingly, their relationship falls within the protection of the FLSA during such an impasse.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">As the court explained in <em>Rogers v. City of Troy, New York </em>(2d Cir. 1998) 148 F.3d 52, 57, the FLSA requires wages to be paid in a timely fashion, where \u201cwhat constitutes timely payment must be determined by objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>standards\u2014and not solely by reference to the parties\u2019 contractual arrangements.\u201d Timeliness is fixed by due reference to an employee\u2019s \u201cwork period\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>which federal regulations characterize as the employee\u2019s \u201cestablished and regularly recurring period of work\u201d (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 553.224(a) (2001); see 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.105 (2001)). <em>(Rogers, </em>at pp. 57-58.) Under these principles, the FLSA requires the prompt payment of minimum wages and overtime compensation for work performed during a budget impasse, with due reference to the state employee\u2019s established work period.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">c. <em>Compensation Over and Above the FLSA Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Finally, we address the extent to which state employees are entitled to receive compensation during a budget impasse beyond that required under the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The state employee interveners contend that they are entitled to <em>full </em>and <em>regular </em>payment of their salaries during a budget impasse, over and above the payments required by the FLSA, absent a budget act or other proper appropriation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Citing union contracts and memoranda of understanding with the state, they argue that the injunction at issue violates the contract clauses of the United States and California Constitutions, and denies them due process of law. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Article I, section 10, clause 1 of the United States Constitution prohibits the states from passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts. Article I, section 9 of the California Constitution contains a similar clause providing that a \u201claw impairing the obligation of contracts may not be passed.\u201d  Generally, a public employee\u2019s right to compensation, once vested, \u201ccannot be eliminated without unconstitutionally impairing the contract obligation,\u201d and \u201c[wjhen agreements of employment between the state and public employees have been adopted by governing bodies, such agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>are binding and constitutionally protected.\u201d <em>(Olson </em>v. <em>Cory, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 538.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In interpreting the state contract clause, California courts have often followed federal courts that have analyzed the federal contract clause. <em>(Hermosa Beach Stop Oil Coalition v. City of Hermosa Beach </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 534, 559, fn. 15 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 447].) Nonetheless, the two clauses differ in their application in at least one respect. Whereas the federal contract clause \u201cis directed only against impairment by legislation and not by judgments of courts\u201d <em>(Tidal Oil Co. v. Flanagan </em>(1924) 263 U.S. 444, 451 [44 S.Ct. 197, 199, 68 L.Ed. 382]; see Thompson, <em>The History of the Judicial Impairment </em>\u201cDoctrine\u201d <em>and Its Lessons for the Contract Clause </em>(1992) 44 Stan. L.Rev. 1373, 1375 &amp; in. 9), the state contract clause also applies to judicial action <em>(Bradley v. Superior Court </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 509, 519 [310 P.2d 634]). Because the contention in question targets an injunction, we limit our attention to the state contract clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Under the state contract clause, \u201c[n]either the court nor the Legislature may impair the obligation of a <em>valid </em>contract . . . .\u201d <em>(Bradley </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d at p. 519, italics added.) However, the contract clause does not protect contracts that are prohibited by law or are against public policy. <em>(Griffith v. Connecticut </em>(1910) 218 U.S. 563, 571 [31 S.Ct. 132, 134, 54 L.Ed. 1151]; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th at p. 696; <em>People ex rel. Mosk v. Lynam </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 959, 967 [61 Cal.Rptr. 800].)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Generally, \u201cno contractual obligation may be enforced against a public agency unless it appears the agency was authorized by the Constitution or statute to incur the obligation; a contract entered into by a governmental entity without the requisite constitutional or statutory authority is void and unenforceable.\u201d <em>(Air Quality Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 340, 349 [157 Cal.Rptr. 791].)  In our view, the state Constitution precludes the state from incurring an obligation to pay employee salaries during a budget impasse in the absence of a proper appropriation, and thus the failure to pay full salaries under such circumstances does not constitute an impairment of contract under the state contract clause. (Cf. <em>California Assn. for Safety Education v. Brown, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1284-1285 [statute does not create obligation protected by contract clause when it gives notice that funds must be separately appropriated by Legislature].)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">It is well established that the state cannot abridge its fundamental police powers by contract. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Pennsylvania Hospital v. Philadelphia </em>(1917) 245 U.S. 20, 23 [38 S.Ct. 35, 36, 62 L.Ed. 124], \u201cthe States cannot by virtue of the contract clause be held to have divested themselves by contract of the right to exert their governmental authority in matters which from their very nature so concern that authority that to restrain its exercise by contract would be a renunciation of the power to legislate for the preservation of society or to secure the performance of essential governmental duties.\u201d Similarly, our Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe government may not contract away its right to exercise [its] police power in the future.\u201d <em>(Avco Community Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>South Coast Regional Com. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 785, 800 [132 Cal.Rptr. 386, 553 P.2d 546].)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">We recognize that the obligation at issue concerns the state\u2019s taxing and spending powers, rather than its police powers, and that modem contract clause jurispmdence follows the \u201creserved-powers doctrine,\u201d which holds that the former powers, unlike the latter powers, may be abridged by contract. (See <em>Hermosa Beach Stop Oil Coalition v. City of Hermosa Beach, supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th at pp. 559-561.) Under this doctrine, the state may \u201c \u2018bind itself in the future exercise of the taxing and spending powers. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 560, quoting <em>United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 1, 24 [97 S.Ct. 1505, 1518, 52 L.Ed.2d 92].)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">However, the obligation here would directly undermine the appropriation requirement in article XVI, section 7 of the state Constitution. As our Supreme Court explained in <em>Humbert </em>v. <em>Dunn </em>(1890) 84 Cal. 57, 59 [24 P. 111], this requirement, which is taken from the United States Constitution, \u201chad its origin in Parliament in the seventeenth century, when the people of Great Britain, to provide against the abuse by the king and his officers of the discretionary money power with which they were vested, demanded that the public funds should not be drawn from the treasury except in accordance with express appropriations therefor made by Parliament [citation]; and the system worked so well in correcting the abuses complained of, our forefathers adopted it, and the restraint imposed by it has become a part of the fundamental law of nearly every state in the Union.\u201d In view of the fundamental nature of this requirement, we conclude that the state cannot undertake obligations protected by the contract clause that directly contravene it. To hold otherwise would gut the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Furthermore, the injunction does not deny state employees due process, insofar as it denies them their salaries over and above the payments required under the FLSA.  Under principles of contract interpretation, \u201c \u2018 \u201call applicable laws in existence when an agreement is made, which laws the parties are presumed to know and to have had in mind, necessarily enter into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the contract and form a part of it, without any stipulation to that effect, as if they were expressly referred to and incorporated.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Torrance v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 371, 378 [185 Cal.Rptr. 645, 650 P.2d 1162]; see 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Contracts, \u00a7 692, p. 625.)  For this reason, state employees must be deemed to have notice of the limitation on the payment of their salaries during a budget impasse. <em>(Walsh v. Board of Administration, supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th at p. 699.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Appellants also contend that the balance of harms arising from the failure to pay full salaries does not favor Jarvis and White, pointing to the distress to state employees caused by the denial of their full salaries (over and above the payments required under the FLSA). We recognize the severity of this distress.  However, as we have explained (see pt. C.2., <em>ante), </em>the Legislature enacted an emergency appropriation to pay these salaries the day after the trial court issued its injunction, and an injunction may be properly granted upon \u201ca sufficiently strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits . . . .\u201d <em>(Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 447.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">d. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In sum, the preliminary injunction must be reversed to the extent that it denies state employees the compensation required under the FLSA during a budget impasse, absent a proper appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">2. <em>Other Federal Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Before the trial court, the Controller also contended that other federal laws required her to disburse funds during a budget impasse. In issuing the preliminary injunction, the trial court impliedly rejected this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>We find guidance on this issue in <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(E.D.Cal. 1991) 770 F.Supp. 539 and <em>Dowling v. Davis </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 19 F.3d 445. In <em>Pratt, </em>the state Controller halted payments partially funded under the now-abolished federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> during the 1990 budget impasse. <em>{Pratt, </em>at pp. 540-541.) Citing the supremacy clause, the court in <em>Pratt </em>concluded that the state was required to make AFDC payments during the budget impasse despite the appropriation requirements in the state Constitution. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 543-544.) The <em>Pratt </em>court reasoned that although a state\u2019s participation in the AFDC program was voluntary, once the state had elected to participate, it was required to comply with AFDC statutes and regulations mandating timely payments. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 541.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><em>Dowling </em>also arose out of the 1990 budget impasse. In <em>Dowling, </em>the state Controller delayed payments under the Medi-Cal program (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14000 et seq.), which is partially funded through the federal Medicaid law (42 U.S.C \u00a7 1396), and the In-Home Support Service (IHSS) program (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 12300), which was partially funded by a federal block grant. <em>(Dowling v. Davis, supra, </em>19 F.3d at pp. 446-448.) The state subsequently secured summary judgment in a class action arising from these delayed payments. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 447.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The court in <em>Dowling </em>affirmed, concluding that there was no evidence that the delayed payments violated federal law. <em>(Dowling </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>19 F.3d at pp. 447-448.) In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Dowling </em>court reasoned that \u201c[djelayed payment is an inherent feature of the Medicaid statutory and regulatory framework,\u201d that the federal block grant supporting the IHSS program did not require timely payments, and the state statute governing the IHSS program predicated its continuing existence on an appropriation in the state budget act. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In view of <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Dowling, </em>the key issue is whether the federal laws cited by the Controller require timely payments during a budget impasse. The Controller contends that she is required to disburse funds due to the state\u2019s participation in the federal (1) food stamp program (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 et seq.), (2) foster care and adoption programs (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 670-679b), (3) child support program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-669b), and (4) child welfare services program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 620-628).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Before the trial court, the Controller asserted in conclusory terms that these four federal programs carry requirements for timely payment of funds. On appeal, the Controller cites federal regulations concerning the food stamp program that require participating states to \u201cact promptly on all applications\u201d for food stamps benefits (7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(a)(2) (2002)), to offer expedited services when necessary <em>(ibid.), </em>and to extend benefits no later than 30 days following a new application (7 C.F.R. \u00a7 274.2(b) (2002)). We therefore conclude that the food stamp program falls within the scope of <em>Pratt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In our view, <em>Pratt </em>also governs the foster care and adoption programs and the child support program. The federal statutes governing the foster care and adoption programs state that to receive federal funds, the state must have a plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services that, inter alia, \u201cprovides that [it] <em>shall </em>be in effect in all political subdivisions of the [state], and, if administered by them, be <em>mandatory </em>upon them[.]\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(3), italics added.) In addition, the federal statutes require payments to enumerated persons and for enumerated purposes. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 672(a), 673(a)(1)(B).) Finally, California\u2019s approved plan meets these requirements, and identifies classes of children and other persons who shall receive payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Furthermore, the federal regulations governing the child support program require an approved state plan regarding this program, and also require that the pertinent state agency must \u201cassure that the plan is <em>continuously </em>in operation . . . .\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.10(c) (2001), italics added.) Moreover, these regulations set timeframes for the collection and disbursement of funds by the state agency (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.32(b) (2001)). California\u2019s approved plan states that it \u201cis continuously in operation\u201d in accordance with federal regulations. Accordingly, the Controller may properly disburse funds to make timely payments mandated under the foster care and adoption programs and the child support program.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Finally, the Controller cites two federal statutes for the proposition that she must disburse funds in connection with the child welfare services program. However, nothing in these statutes mandates timely disbursement of funds. The statutes define the term \u201cchild welfare services\u201d to apply to services intended, inter alia, to \u201cassur[e] adequate care of children away from their homes, in cases where the child cannot be returned home or cannot be placed for adoption\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 625(a)(1)(F)). Moreover, they require only that the state plan for services to children under this program must provide for coordination with other services in a manner that \u201cwill best promote the welfare of such children and their families\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 622(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The Controller also argues in cursory fashion that despite recent changes in federal law, the child welfare Services program is subject to the former AFDC requirements concerning timely payments at issue in <em>Pratt.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Of the statutes and regulations cited in <em>Pratt </em>(770 F.Supp. at pp. 541-542), only certain regulations concerning notice of changes in benefits currently apply to the Child Welfare Services program (see 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1355.30(p) (2001)). These regulations provide that when \u201cchanges in either State or Federal law require automatic grant adjustments for classes of recipients,\u201d recipients are entitled to notice of a reduction or suspension of benefits and a hearing on the matter. (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.10(a)(4)(iii) (2001).) Furthermore, these regulations provide that \u201cassistance <em>shall not </em>be suspended\u201d to those recipients who request a hearing until \u201c[a] determination is made at the hearing that the sole issue is one of State or Federal law or policy, or change in State or Federal law . . . .\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.10(a)(6)(i)(A) (2001), italics added; \u00a7 205.10(a)(6)(i)(C) (2001).)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In view of the mandatory language of these regulations, we conclude the child welfare services program falls under <em>Pratt, </em>rather than under <em>Dowling, </em>to the extent determined by the regulations in question.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (See <em>Pratt v. Wilson, supra, </em>770 F.Supp. at p. 544, in. 14.) Accordingly, the Controller may properly disburse only those funds necessary to comply with the notice-and-hearing requirements imposed by federal regulations on the child welfare services program.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In sum, the preliminary injunction must be reversed to the extent that it bars timely payments under the federal mandates that we have identified regarding the food stamp program, the foster care and adoption programs, the child support program, and the child welfare services program.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>E. <em>Bond</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Finally, appellants contend that the trial court failed to require an adequate bond. \u201cOn granting an injunction, the court or judge must require an undertaking on the part of the applicant to the effect that the applicant will pay to the party enjoined any damages, not exceeding an amount to be specified, the party may sustain by reason of the injunction, if the court finally decides that the applicant was not entitled to the injunction.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 529, subd. (a).)  As the court observed in <em>ABBA Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Seaquist </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1, 14 [286 Cal.Rptr. 518], \u201cthe trial court\u2019s function is to estimate the harmful effect which the injunction is likely to have on the restrained party and to set the undertaking at that sum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In view of our conclusion that the preliminary injunction must be reversed in part (see pt. II.B., C.I., 3., D.I., 2., <em>ante), </em>and Jarvis and White\u2019s representation that they do not seek further relief before the trial court, we do not address appellants\u2019 contentions on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The appeal in the action initiated by White (case No. B122178) is dismissed as moot. White and respondents in this action shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">The preliminary injunction in the action initiated by Jarvis and White (case No. B123992) is reversed to the extent that it bars the Controller from disbursing funds pursuant to (1) continuing appropriations, (2) article III, section 4, and article XVI, section 8.5, of the state Constitution, (3) the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq.), and (4) the federal funding mandates that we have identified applicable to the food stamp program (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 et seq.), foster care and adoption programs (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 670 et seq.), child support program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-669b), and child welfare services program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 620-628). The preliminary injunction is otherwise affirmed. In view of Jarvis and White\u2019s abandonment of further action in the trial court, we do not remand the matter for modification of the preliminary injunction. Appellants in the action initiated by Jarvis and White are awarded their costs on appeal.

As a \u201csmall sampling,\u201d the Controller cites statutes enacted by the Legislature, including purported appropriations for disability insurance payments (Unemp. Ins. Code, \u00a7 3012), income tax refunds (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 19611), the Local Revenue Fund (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 17600), the Local Public Safety Account (Gov.

Code, \u00a7 16429.1), and bond-related payments (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 15814.16, 15848). The Controller also points to general obligation bond acts (e.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7 8879.10, Pub. Util.

These questions have not been presented to us, and we do not address them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\"> We recognize that individuals cannot initiate actions under the FLSA against states that have not waived their immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution <em>(Alden v. Maine </em>(1999) 527 U.S. 706, 754 [119 S.Ct. 2240, 2266, 144 L.Ed.2d 636]), and that California has not waived this immunity <em>(Baird v. Kessler </em>(E.D.Cal. 2001) 172 F.Supp.2d 1305, 1312). Nonetheless, the FLSA authorizes the Secretary of Labor to seek the payment of minimum wages and overtime compensation \u201cowing to any employee or employees\u201d under the FLSA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(c)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\"> Citing <em>American Federation of Government Employees v. Rivlin </em>(D.D.C. Nov. 17, 1995, No. 95-2115) 1995 WL 697236, Jarvis and White disagree, pointing out that despite the FLSA, many federal employees were laid off during the 1985 federal budget impasse pursuant to article I, section 9, clause 7 of the United States Constitution, which provides that \u201c[n]o money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law,\u201d and other federal employees were compelled to work without pay. However, <em>American Federation of Government Employees </em>provides little guidance here. The United States Constitution, unlike the California Constitution, is not governed by federal statutory law such as the FLSA. <em>(Marbury v. Madison </em>(1803) 5 U.S. 137, 176-177 [2 L.Ed. 60, 73].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\"> Citing <em>Donovan v. Crisostomo </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 689 F.2d 869, 876, the state employee interveners argue under the FLSA, employees who work overtime must receive the requisite overtime wages plus their full straight time pay. However, they do not cite any authority that the FLSA requires the full payment of straight time wages in all circumstances, and we are unaware of any such authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b247-10\"> On a related matter, the Controller argued before the trial court that wage payments for state employees adjusted to the federally mandated levels could not be issued by the pending pay date, and that an injunction ordering such an adjustment therefore threatened injury to state employees and the imposition of penalties on California for violations of the FLSA. Because the trial court concluded that the FLSA did not apply to state employees who continued to work after the date of the injunction, it did not resolve the factual issues raised by this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">We decline to resolve these factual issues for the first time on appeal. Under the FLSA, penalties may be excused when the employer engages in good faith conduct that violates the FLSA <em>(Craig </em>v. <em>Far West Engineering Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1959) 265 F.2d 251, 261; <em>Nash v.

In view of this fact, as well as the Controller\u2019s scanty evidentiary showing, the record permits conflicting inferences regarding the likelihood of penalties and the extent of financial injury to state employees. Under these circumstances, it is inappropriate for us to resolve the pertinent factual issues. <em>(Crocker Nat. Bank v.
