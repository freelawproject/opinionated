The Matrons contend the trial court erred by concluding Government Code section 818, which exempts public entities from liability for punitive or exemplary damages, precludes their cause of action against RUC for enhanced remedies under Welfare and Institutions Code section 15657.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">On August 23, 2000, Lidia Marr\u00f3n, then 44 years old, entered UCSD Medical Center (the Hospital) for a liver biopsy. The Hospital is owned and operated by RUC, which is a division of the State of California. Complications arose during the procedure when the biopsy needle perforated Lidia\u2019s middle colic vein, causing damage to her abdominal viscera and requiring emergency surgery. Following surgery, Lidia was admitted to the Hospital\u2019s intensive care unit. During her subsequent two-month stay at the Hospital, she suffered complications, including fungus infections in her blood and lungs, peritonitis,\" intra-abdominal and pelvic abscesses, sepsis syndrome, hypotension, fevers, abdominal pain and hemorrhaging.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">On October 28 she was discharged from the Hospital. On October 31 she returned to the Hospital because of a spiking fever. On November 8 she was discharged from the Hospital, but returned within 12 hours because of fevers, chills and severe pain. A CT scan showed an intra-abdominal abscess. She became progressively septic and was diagnosed with enterocutaneous fistula.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>On December 13 Lidia died.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">The Marrons, as Lidia\u2019s parents and successors in interest, filed a complaint against defendants RUC and Tarek I. Hassanein, M.D., alleging causes of action for wrongful death and section 15657 dependent adult abuse. The dependent adult abuse cause of action alleges the defendants \u201cfailed to exercise the requisite degree of care but rather acted with recklessness in the failure to appropriately and adequately care for, monitor, and treat Lidia Marr\u00f3n\u2019s declining health condition from\u201d August 23 through December 13, 2000. It further alleges the defendants \u201cfailed to recognize and treat obvious signs of uncontrolled hemorrhage, failed to protect [Lidia] from health and safety hazards, failed to assist in personal hygiene, failed to provide an adequate environment for the level of care that was needed, ignoring obvious signs of stress and disease, causing [her] to suffer protracted pain, discomfort, mental suffering, indignity and humiliation up to the time of her death.\u201d The complaint seeks damages for Lidia\u2019s pain and suffering and an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to section 15657.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">RUC filed a motion for summary adjudication of the dependent adult abuse cause of action, asserting, inter alia, that Government Code section 818 provided it with immunity against section 15657 damages and attorney fees and costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Marrons opposed the motion, arguing that because section 15657 does not provide for punitive damages, Government Code section 818 does not bar an award of section 15657 enhanced remedies against RUC.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">The trial court granted RUC\u2019s motion for summary adjudication, stating: \u201c[T]he [dependent adult abuse] cause of action impermissibly seeks punitive damages against a public entity in violation of Government Code section 818. . . . [T]he pain and suffering [Lidia] suffered was personal to her and ceased to be an element of compensation upon her death. As a result, . . . the Legislature\u2019s decision [in section 15657] to abrogate [Code of Civil Procedure] section 377.34 as a result of a caregiver\u2019s reckless neglect is punitive in nature, as it is intended to award damages in excess of just compensation. The same logic applies vis-\u00e1-vis the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, as this is an award in excess of just compensation for [Lidia\u2019s] injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During oral argument on the motion, the trial court further stated: \u201cTo me [section 15657\u2019s enhanced remedies constitute] a penalty. [They are] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>an amount of money in addition to compensation and [they penalize] someone for reckless conduct . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The Marrons filed this petition for writ of mandate, challenging the trial court\u2019s order granting the motion for summary adjudication. RUC filed a response, arguing the trial court correctly concluded it was immune under Government Code section 818 from liability for section 15657 enhanced remedies. We issued an order to show cause, stayed trial of this matter and heard oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">\n<em>Consideration of the Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">The Marrons contend we should consider their petition for writ of mandate because they have an inadequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable injury if their petition is not granted. They argue the trial court\u2019s order has the effect of barring a substantial portion of their case on the merits and a second trial would be a waste of judicial and litigant resources. Furthermore, they assert the instant issue is one of law that is of first impression and of public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">An order granting a motion for summary adjudication may be reviewed by way of a petition for writ of mandate. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (m)(l); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 337, 345 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 713].) The issuance of our order to show cause constituted an effective determination that the Marrons\u2019 remedy at law was not adequate. <em>(Community Care &amp; Rehabilitation Center v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 787, 790, fn. 3 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 343]; <em>Robbins v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 199, 205 [211 Cal.Rptr. 398, 695 P.2d 695].) We further conclude the Marrons would suffer irreparable injury if a second trial were required because of an erroneous summary adjudication by the trial court. <em>(Barrett v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1183 [272 Cal.Rptr. 304].) Furthermore, the petition presents a significant issue of first impression. <em>(Casterson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 177, 182 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 637]; <em>Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 695, 702 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 541].) Therefore, we exercise our discretion to consider the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b990-13\">\n<em>Summary Adjudication Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b990-14\">\u201c[A motion for] [s]ummary adjudication is properly granted when the evidence in support of the moving party establishes that there is no issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>[material] fact to be tried as to a particular cause of action, affirmative defense, claim for damages or issue of duty. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (f); <em>Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1107 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46] [, superseded by statute on other grounds as noted in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 853, fn. 19 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493]].)  The aim of the procedure is to discover whether the parties possess evidence requiring the weighing procedures of a trial. <em>(Corwin </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 842, 851 [94 Cal.Rptr. 785, 484 P.2d 953].)\u201d <em>(Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.4th at pp. 344-345.) For a defendant to prevail on a summary adjudication motion, the defendant generally must establish an affirmative defense or show one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (&lt;?).) In moving for summary adjudication, a defendant meets its \u201cburden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  If the trial court concludes there is no triable issue of material fact and \u201cthe sole remaining issue is one of law, it is the duty of the trial court to determine the issue of law. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., supra, </em>at p. 345.)  In reviewing an order granting a motion for summary adjudication, \u201cwe review the record de novo, considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained.

Section 15610.07 defines \u201cabuse of an elder or dependent adult\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-8\">\u201c(a) Physical abuse, neglect, financial abuse, abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other treatment with resulting physical harm or pain or mental suffering^ or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-9\">\u201c(b) The deprivation by a care custodian of goods or services that are necessary to avoid physical harm or mental suffering.\u201d The Act\u2019s definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>of \u201cneglect\u201d includes: \u201cThe negligent failure of any person having the care or custody of an elder or a dependent adult to exercise that degree of care that a reasonable person in a like position would exercise.\u201d (\u00a7 15610.57, subd.

The Act\u2019s definition of \u201ccare custodian\u201d includes members of the support staff of 24-hour health facilities as defined in Health and Safety Code sections 1250, 1250.2, and 1250.3.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (\u00a7 15610.17, subd.

(\u00a7 15657; <em>ARA Living Centers\u2014Pacific, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 1564; <em>Delaney, supra, </em>at p. 33.) Section 15657 provides: \u201cWhere it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant is liable for physical abuse as defined in Section 15610.63, neglect as defined in Section 15610.57, or financial abuse as defined in Section 15610.30, and that the defendant has been guilty of <em>recklessness, </em>oppression, fraud, or malice in the commission of this abuse, <em>in addition to all other remedies </em>otherwise provided by law: [][] (a) <em>The court shall award to the plaintiff reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. </em>The term \u2018costs\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, reasonable fees for the services of a conservator, if any, devoted to the litigation of a claim brought under this article, [f] (b) <em>The limitations imposed by Section 3[7]7.34 of the Code of Civil Procedure on the damages recoverable shall not apply.

As the parties note, this issue is a question of law that appears to be one of first impression in the California courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Government Code section 818 provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a public entity is not liable for damages awarded under Section 3294 of the Civil Code or other <em>damages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the </em>defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Italics added.)  \u201cGovernment Code section 818 in context means that ... a plaintiff who alleges injury caused by a public entity may be entitled to actual damages for that injury, but not punitive damages. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Kizer v. County of San Mateo </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 139, 145 [279 Cal.Rptr. 318, 806 P.2d 1353].)  Punitive damages and compensatory damages serve different purposes. <em>(State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell </em>(2003) 538 U.S. 408, _ [123 S.Ct. 1513, 1515, 155 L.Ed.2d 585]; <em>Cooper Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. </em>(2001) 532 U.S. 424, 432 [121 S.Ct. 1678, 1683, 149 L.Ed.2d 674].) Compensatory damages \u201care intended to redress the concrete <em>loss that the plaintiff has suffered </em>by reason of the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct. [Citations].\u201d <em>(Cooper Industries, supra, </em>at p. 432 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1683], italics added.) In contrast, punitive damages \u201coperate as \u2018private fines\u2019 intended to punish the defendant and to deter future wrongdoing.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In determining compensatory damages, \u201c[a] jury\u2019s <em>assessment of the extent of a plaintiff\u2019s injury </em>is essentially a factual determination, whereas its imposition of punitive damages is an expression of its moral condemnation. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Punitive damages are <em>not </em>compensation <em>for loss or injury. (Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323, 350 [94 S.Ct. 2997, 3012, 41 L.Ed.2d 789]; <em>Piscitelli v.

Superior Court </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 825, 834 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 97] [\u201cPunitive damages do not compensate for loss.\u201d].) Punitive damages must bear a reasonable relationship and be proportionate to the actual harm suffered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>the plaintiff (i.e., compensatory damages). <em>(State Farm, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. _ [123 S.Ct. at p. 1515]; <em>BMW of North America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gore </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 559, 580 [116 S.Ct. 1589, 1601, 134 L.Ed.2d 809].) Therefore, \u201csection 818 of the Government Code, in referring to \u2018damages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant\u2019 contemplates . . . punitive damages [that] are designed to punish the defendant rather than to compensate the plaintiff. <em>Punitive damages are </em>by definition in addition to actual damages and <em>beyond the equivalent of harm done. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(State Dept. of Corrections v. Workmen\u2019s Comp.

Those damages \u201ccompensate the victim <em>for injury suffered. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Applied Equipment Corp. </em>v. <em>Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 516 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 869 P.2d 454], italics added.) Compensatory damages generally include damages for pain and suffering caused by a defendant\u2019s breach of a noncontractual obligation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3333; <em>Capelouto </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 889, 892-893 [103 Cal.Rptr. 856, 500 P.2d 880] [pain and suffering is a genuine detriment that requires compensation].)  \u201c[T]he unitary concept of \u2018pain and suffering\u2019 has served as a convenient label under which a plaintiff may recover not only for physical pain but [also] for fright, nervousness, grief, anxiety, worry, mortification, shock, humiliation, indignity, embarrassment, apprehension, terror or ordeal. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Capelouto, supra, </em>at pp. 892-893.) The term <em>pain and suffering </em>\u201creflects a consequence of [a victim\u2019s] personal and physical injury and a subjective loss for which money could compensate the victim.\u201d <em>(Nakamura </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. 835.) Punitive damages are <em>dissimilar </em>to pain and suffering and other compensatory damages. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 835-836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Although a victim ordinarily may be entitled to compensation for pain and suffering sustained from a defendant\u2019s breach of a noncontractual obligation, that compensation <em>generally </em>cannot be recovered after the victim\u2019s death because of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34, which provides: \u201cIn an action or proceeding by a decedent\u2019s personal representative or successor in interest on the decedent\u2019s cause of action, the <em>damages recoverable </em>are limited to the loss or damage that the decedent sustained or incurred before death, <em>including any </em>penalties or <em>punitive or exemplary damages that the decedent would have been entitled to recover had the decedent lived, and do </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number><em>not include damages for pain, suffering, or </em>disfigurement.\u201d (Italics added.) That statute distinguishes between a decedent\u2019s pain and suffering damages and a decedent\u2019s punitive or exemplary damages. Because a decedent\u2019s representative or successor in interest may pursue a cause of action for recovery of punitive damages to which the decedent would have been entitled had the decedent lived, but may not recover damages for pain and suffering the decedent sustained before his or her death, it appears the decedent\u2019s pain and suffering damages are distinct and different from punitive or exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">We conclude the enhanced remedies available under section 15657 are <em>not </em>punitive or exemplary damages under Government Code section 818, and the trial court erred by granting RUC\u2019s motion for summary adjudication on the Marrons\u2019 section 15657 cause of action. Had Lidia lived despite the alleged dependent adult abuse, she would have been entitled to recover any and all pain and suffering damages in a section 15657 action against RUC.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(ARA Living Centers\u2014Pacific, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at p. 1564.) However, Lidia died before she could file an action and obtain an award for the pain and suffering she allegedly sustained. Although Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34 ordinarily would bar Lidia\u2019s successors in interest from recovering her pain and suffering damages, section 15657 expressly allows recovery of those pain and suffering damages (subject to Civ. Code, \u00a7 3333.2, subd. (b)\u2019s $250,000 limitation). <em>(ARA Living Centers, supra, </em>at p. 1564.) If the Marrons prove by clear and convincing evidence that RUC committed reckless neglect in caring for Lidia, section 15657 allows them to recover all remedies provided by law, including reasonable attorney fees and costs and Lidia\u2019s pain and suffering damages (subject to Civ. Code, \u00a7 3333.2, subd. (b)\u2019s $250,000 limitation). Section 15657 expressly provides that \u201c[t]he limitations imposed by Section 3[7]7.34 of the Code of Civil Procedure on the damages recoverable shall not apply.\u201d (\u00a7 15657, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">RUC argues, and the trial court concluded, that section 15657\u2019s express exception to Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34\u2019s general preclusion of awards of a decedent\u2019s pain and suffering damages equates to an award of punitive or exemplary damages under Government Code section 818. However, considering the language of those statutes and the general statutory and common law regarding compensatory and punitive damages, we conclude section 15657\u2019s enhanced remedies are <em>not </em>punitive or exemplary in nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>or \u201cdamages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant\u201d under Government Code section 818.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An award of Lidia\u2019s pain and suffering damages that Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34 otherwise would preclude is based on, and measured by, Lidia\u2019s <em>actual loss or injury. </em>Lidia\u2019s alleged pain and suffering damages are part of the compensation \u201cfor all the detriment proximately caused\u201d by RUC\u2019s alleged reckless neglect. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3333.) An award of Lidia\u2019s alleged pain and suffering damages would provide the Matrons with compensation <em>for the injury </em>Lidia sustained. <em>(Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 516.) Compensatory damages include damages for pain and suffering caused by a defendant\u2019s breach of a noncontractual obligation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3333; <em>Capelouto v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 892-893 [pain and suffering is a genuine detriment that requires compensation].)

Furthermore, under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34, a decedent\u2019s representative or successor in interest may pursue a cause of action for recovery of punitive damages to which the decedent would have been entitled had the decedent lived, but may not recover damages for pain and suffering the decedent suffered before his or her death. The decedent\u2019s pain and suffering damages are therefore distinct from punitive or exemplary damages. Under Government Code section 818, \u201ca plaintiff who alleges injury caused by a public entity may be entitled to <em>actual damages for that injury, </em>but not punitive damages. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Kizer v. County of San Mateo, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 145, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">RUC argues that section 15657, subdivision (c)\u2019s incorporation of the standard for holding employers liable for punitive damages under Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b) shows section 15657\u2019s enhanced remedies were intended to be, and are, punitive damages. Section 15657, subdivision (c) provides: \u201cThe standards set forth in subdivision (b) of Section 3294 of the Civil Code regarding the imposition of punitive damages on an employer based upon the acts of an employee shall be satisfied before any damages or attorney\u2019s fees permitted under this section may be imposed against an employer.\u201d Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cAn employer shall not be liable for damages pursuant to subdivision (a) [i.e., where, by clear and convincing evidence, plaintiff shows defendant\u2019s breach of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>noncontractual obligation is done with oppression, fraud, or malice], based, upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or the safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.\u201d We are not persuaded by RUC\u2019s argument. Section 15657, subdivision (c)\u2019s incoiporation of Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b)\u2019s standard for holding an employer liable for punitive damages based on an employee\u2019s outrageous conduct does <em>not </em>show section 15657\u2019s enhanced remedies are intended to be punitive damages. Rather, incorporation of that standard is merely a simple statutory means for setting forth what actions of an employer suffice for holding that employer liable for an employee\u2019s reckless neglect or other egregious conduct under section 15657. Section 15657, subdivision (c) incorporates a standard of conduct rather than the remedy or damages to be awarded if that conduct is found to have occurred. Because section 15657 and Civil Code section 3294 provide for different remedies, their use of a common standard for initially determining an employer\u2019s liability is irrelevant in determining whether section 15657\u2019s enhanced remedies are to be considered punitive damages. Furthermore, RUC\u2019s argument does not apply to section 15657 cases that do not involve employers. The characterization of section 15657 enhanced remedies presumably should not change based on whether the defendant is an individual or an employer of that individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">We also conclude that an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs under section 15657 cannot be considered punitive or exemplary damages under Government Code section 818. Section 15657\u2019s authorization of awards of attorney fees and costs was intended to act as an incentive for attorneys to accept elder or dependent adult abuse cases that involve recklessness or more egregious conduct. In enacting the 1991 amendments to the Act that included section 15657, \u201c[t]he Legislature pointed out that few civil actions were being brought in connection with elder [or dependent adult] abuse due in part to lack of incentives. It then provided some incentives [i.e., reasonable attorney fees and costs and limited pain and suffering damages].\u201d <em>(ARA Living Centers\u2014Pacific, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1564-1565.) Section 15600, subdivision (h) states: \u201cThe Legislature further finds and declares that infirm elderly persons and dependent adults are a disadvantaged class, that cases of abuse of these persons are seldom prosecuted as criminal matters, and few civil cases are brought in connection with this abuse due to problems of proof, court delays, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>and the lack of incentives to prosecute these suits.\u201d Section 15600, subdivision (j) states: \u201cIt is the further intent of the Legislature in adding [section 15657 et seq.] to this chapter to enable interested persons to engage attorneys to take up the cause of abused elderly persons and dependent adults.\u201d <em>Delaney </em>noted: \u201cAs was stated in the Senate Rules Committee\u2019s analysis of Senate Bill No. 679, \u2018in practice, the death of the victim and the difficulty in finding an attorney to handle an abuse case where attorneys fees may not be awarded[] impedes many victims from suing successfully. [TJ] This bill would address the problem by: . . . authorizing the court to award attorney\u2019s fees in specified cases; [and by] allowing pain and suffering damages to be awarded when a verdict of intentional and reckless abuse was handed down after the abused elder dies.\u2019 (Sen. Rules Com., Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 679 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 8, 1991, p. 3.)\u201d <em>(Delaney v. Baker, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Fee-shifting statutes generally are intended to enable parties to retain attorneys to represent them in certain types of cases. The goal of those statutes is \u201cto enable private parties to obtain legal help in seeking redress for injuries resulting from the actual or threatened violation of specific . . . laws. Hence, if plaintiffs . . . find it possible to engage a lawyer based on the statutory assurance that he [or she] will be paid a \u2018reasonable fee,\u2019 the purpose behind the fee-shifting statute has been satisfied.\u201d <em>(Pennsylvania v. Del. Valley Citizens\u2019 Council </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 546, 565 [106 S.Ct. 3088, 3098, 92 L.Ed.2d 439].) We conclude section 15657\u2019s attorney fees and costs provision was intended to encourage attorneys to take on cases of elder and dependent adult abuse. There is nothing in the Act or its legislative history to support RUC\u2019s position that awards of reasonable attorney fees and costs under section 15657 are intended to punish defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Furthermore, awards of statutory attorney fees are usually considered an element of costs. (7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Judgment, \u00a7 146, p. 661; <em>Santisas </em>v. <em>Goodin </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 607, fn. 4 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399].) We recently noted: \u201cUnder Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10), <em>attorney fees are allowable as costs </em>under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, <em>\u2018when authorized by </em>any of the following: [f] (A) Contract. [If] (B) <em>Statute. </em>[If] (C) Law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Carver </em>v. <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 132, 143 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 569], fn. omitted, italics added; see also <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Benco Building Services </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1386 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 53].) Recovery of litigation <em>costs, </em>including statutory attorney fees, is <em>not </em>considered part of an award of <em>damages. </em>\u201cWhen authorized by statute, awards of attorney\u2019s fees are expressly defined as costs, not damages. ([Code Civ. Proc.,] \u00a7 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B).)\u201d <em>(Elton v. Anheuser-Busch Beverage Group, Inc. </em>(1996) 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>Cal.App.4th 1301, 1308 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 303].) The California Supreme Court also recently stated: \u201cStatutory attorney fees are not of course intended to compensate the \u2018prevailing party\u2019 for damages suffered.\" <em>(Flannery v. Prentice </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 572, 586 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 809, 28 P.3d 860].) In concluding a prevailing party\u2019s <em>attorney </em>is entitled to an award of statutory attorney fees absent a contrary agreement, <em>Flannery </em>noted that in certain circumstances: \u201cPaying the proceeds of a [statutory attorney fee] award to the party rather than to counsel in such circumstances [i.e., when there is no agreement requiring attorney compensation and no fees have been paid] would, from the perspective of those paying them, transform the award, without legislative authorization, into a kind of punitive damages.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Therefore, an award to a party\u2019s attorney of statutory attorney fees (when attorney fees have been paid pursuant to a fee agreement) cannot be considered punitive damages. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Because awards of statutory attorney fees generally are considered awards of costs and not damages, we conclude an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs under section 15657 cannot be considered an award of punitive damages (unless possibly there is no fee agreement and no fees have been paid). (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B); <em>Flannery </em>v. <em>Prentice, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 586; <em>Carver v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 143; <em>Cummings v. Benco Building Services, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1386; <em>Elton v. Anheuser-Busch Beverage Group, Inc., supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 1308.) Therefore, the trial court erred by concluding an award of section 15657 reasonable attorney fees and costs necessarily constitutes an award of exemplary or punitive damages under Government Code section 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">\n<em>RUC\u2019s Asserted Independent Grounds for Summary Adjudication</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">RUC contends there are grounds independent of Government Code section 818 on which the trial court\u2019s grant of its motion for summary adjudication can be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">RUC argues that Lidia could not be considered a \u201cdependent adult\u201d under the Act because there is no evidence she suffered from a disability that precluded her from carrying out normal activities or being able to protect her rights. However, the Act\u2019s definition of a \u201cdependent adult\u201d includes \u201cany person between the ages of 18 and 64 years who is admitted as an inpatient to a 24-hour health facility, as defined in Sections 1250, 1250.2, and 1250.3 of the Health and Safety Code.\u201d (\u00a7 15610.23, subd. (b).) RUC argue that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>Act\u2019s other definition of a \u201cdependent adult\u201d in section 15610.23, subdivision (a) is a prerequisite to Lidia\u2019s qualification as a dependent adult under the Act. Section 15610.23, subdivision (a) provides: \u201c \u2018Dependent adult\u2019 means any person between the ages of 18 and 64 years who resides in this state and who has physical or mental limitations that restrict his or her ability to carry out normal activities or to protect his or her rights, including, but not limited to, persons who have physical or developmental disabilities, or whose physical or mental abilities have diminished because of age.\u201d Section 15610.23, subdivision (a) provides an <em>alternative </em>definition of a \u201cdependent adult\u201d and is <em>not </em>a prerequisite to qualification as a \u201cdependent adult\u201d under the definition in section 15610.23, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Citing section 15657, subdivision (c), RUC argues the Matrons did not allege or submit evidence supporting an inference that it ratified the actions of its employees, which actions allegedly constituted reckless neglect in caring for Lidia. However, the Matrons\u2019 complaint alleges RUC \u201cfailed to exercise the requisite degree of care but rather acted with recklessness in the failure to appropriately and adequately care for, monitor, and treat Lidia Matron\u2019s declining health condition . . . .\u201d As a public entity, RUC can act only through its employees or agents. It is implied that the acts alleged in the complaint were done by RUC\u2019s employees or agents. Therefore, the complaint, by alleging RUC is liable under section 15657, implicitly alleges the requirements of section 15657, subdivision (c) are satisfied. To the extent the complaint should have expressly stated that allegation, any demurrer based on that deficiency should be sustained only with leave to amend the complaint. Furthermore, regarding RUC\u2019s assertion the Matrons did not submit any evidence that it ratified the reckless neglect of its employees, the Matrons submitted evidence showing that Mary Middleton, the Hospital\u2019s director of patient care services, had actual knowledge of understaffing complaints made by nurses caring for Lidia and apparently did not take any remedial action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Matrons also submitted excerpts from the deposition testimonies of percipient witnesses regarding the specific acts of reckless neglect allegedly committed in caring for Lidia.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Matrons\u2019 separate statement of disputed facts asserted that Mary Middleton, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>Hospital\u2019s director of patient care services, was responsible for the Hospital\u2019s nursing services and staffing and therefore was a managing agent of RUC. The Marrons submitted sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact whether a managing agent of RUC ratified the alleged reckless neglect of the Hospital\u2019s nurses in caring for Lidia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">RUC also argues the Marrons, in opposing its motion for summary adjudication, did not submit any admissible evidence to support an inference that RUC or its employees acted with reckless neglect in caring for Lidia. Rather than arguing that the Marrons\u2019 evidence does not show reckless neglect, RUC argues that the evidence submitted by the Marrons in opposing the summary adjudication motion lacked a proper foundation because that evidence was uncertain regarding the specific time or place of the act or the specific person who committed the act. However, our review of the Marrons\u2019 opposition papers does not support RUC\u2019s assertion. Many of the alleged instances of reckless neglect consisted of acts of omission, not commission, and therefore a specific time, place, or person may not necessarily be identified with the alleged omission. Furthermore, the excerpts from the deposition testimonies of percipient witnesses sufficiently described, for purposes of successfully opposing the summary adjudication motion, the specific acts and omissions constituting the alleged reckless neglect. To the extent the Marrons are required to show that RUC or its employees acted with \u201c a \u2018conscious choice of a course of action . . . with knowledge of the serious danger to others involved\u2019 \u201d <em>(Delaney v. Baker, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 31-32) as RUC asserts, the Marrons\u2019 opposing papers therefore included sufficient admissible evidence to support an inference that there was reckless neglect in caring for Lidia. Although at trial the trial court may exclude evidence that is irrelevant or does not have a proper foundation, RUC has not shown that all of the Marrons\u2019 evidence submitted in opposition to the summary adjudication motion is inadmissible or insufficient to show reckless neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Let a writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate its order of October 25, 2002, granting RUC\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of the dependent adult abuse cause of action and to enter a new order denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>the motion.

Arizona has a substantial population of elderly people, and the legislature was concerned about elder abuse. In civil actions for elder abuse, pain and suffering may be the only compensable damages the victim may recover. Because incapacitated or vulnerable adults are not employed, they cannot recover damages for lost earnings or diminished earning capacity. Because incapacitated or vulnerable adults generally have Medicare, Medicaid coverage, or other insurance, they may not recover for medical expenses. . . . As a result, the most likely form of damages recoverable in these cases are for pain and suffering. [Citation.] [H] Furthermore, most vulnerable or incapacitated adults are near the end of their lives. Under defendants\u2019 theory, the tortfeasor would have a great incentive to delay litigation until the victim dies. If we were to subscribe to defendants\u2019 theory, the policy of the elder abuse statute would not be furthered.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 156-157 [945 P.2d at pp. 1287-1288].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b997-7\"> RUC argues section 15657\u2019s pain and suffering damages must be considered punitive damages because a decedent cannot be made whole or be compensated for pain and suffering sustained before his or her death. However, the crucial issue is whether those damages are for a loss or injury suffered by the decedent, not whether a decedent can be compensated for that loss or injury after his or her death. Therefore, section 15657\u2019s limited <em>revival </em>of a decedent\u2019s pain and suffering damages, as an express exception to the survival statute (i.e., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 377.34), is not intended to punish a defendant and does not provide for punitive or exemplary damages under Government Code section 818.
