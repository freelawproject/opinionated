We conclude on the strength of Penal Code section 1202.46 that it may, and affirm the order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">On March 15, 2000, a jury found Robert Aguilar Moreno guilty of first degree murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 189). It also found true allegations Moreno had committed the offense for the benefit of a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)); that he had intentionally and personally discharged a firearm in the commission of the offense, causing great bodily injury or death (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)); and that he had personally used a firearm in the commission of the offense (\u00a7 12022.5, former subd. (a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">On May 26, 2000, the court sentenced Moreno accordingly to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life for the murder, to a consecutive 25-year-to-life term for the firearm great bodily injury enhancement, and to the middle term of two years consecutive for the gang enhancement, for a total of 52 years to life in state prison. The court imposed the middle term of four years for the personal use enhancement, but stayed its execution. (\u00a7 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b19-9\">In addition, the court ordered Moreno to pay a $10,000 restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)), and a parole revocation fine in the same amount (\u00a7 1202.45). In the absence of any request, the court did not direct Moreno to pay restitution to the murder victim\u2019s family. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b19-10\">In fact, however, the state Victims of Crime Program (VOC) had paid $4,346.35 to the victim\u2019s family a month earlier, on April 21, 2000, for burial expenses the family incurred in March of 1999. Through a combination of circumstances, this information was not relayed to the trial court in time for the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-11\">The probation report had been filed on April 6 in anticipation of the sentencing hearing originally scheduled for April 13. According to the report, the probation officer had made several unsuccessful attempts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>contact the victim\u2019s family.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sentencing hearing was continued three times before it finally was held on May 26. The VOC payment was made in the interim between the report and the hearing. Neither the VOC nor the family, it seems, notified the probation officer of the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-4\">Moreover, notwithstanding the fact a trial court is required to make provision for victim restitution, the subject did not come up at the sentencing hearing. The court did not retain jurisdiction to make a restitution order in the future, nor did it find \u201ccompelling and extraordinary reasons\u201d for not ordering foil restitution. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">Moreno filed an appeal challenging the gang enhancement in various respects. In an unpublished opinion filed January 14, 2002, we rejected his claims and affirmed the judgment in its entirety. <em>(People v. Moreno </em>(Jan. 14, 2002, F036130).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Again, no mention was made of victim restitution in connection with the appeal. The California Supreme Court denied Moreno\u2019s petition for review on March 20, 2002. The remittitur issued from this court on March 29, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">On November 20, 2001, while the appeal was pending, the probation officer asked the trial court for a restitution order directing Moreno to reimburse VOC for the payment it had made to the victim\u2019s family in April of 2000. The court granted the request, over Moreno\u2019s objection, following a hearing on May 15, 2002 (i.e., after the remittitur). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">Moreno challenges the trial court\u2019s restitution order on three grounds. He argues that neither the statute nor the case law upon which the court relied supports its decision; that by neglecting to request direct restitution at the sentencing hearing, or to object to the court\u2019s failure to impose it, the People waived their right to seek such an order thereafter; and that the restitution order exceeds the scope of the remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-9\">Section 1202.4 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>\u201c(a)(1) It is the intent of the Legislature that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that crime, [t] . . .

This section states in its entirety: \u201cNotwithstanding Section 1170,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] when the economic losses of a victim cannot be ascertained at the time of sentencing pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 1202.4, the court shall retain jurisdiction over a person subject to a restitution order for purposes of imposing or modifying restitution until such time as the losses may be determined. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting a victim, the district attorney, or a court on its own motion from requesting correction, at any time, of a sentence when the sentence is invalid due to the omission of a restitution order or f\u00edne without a finding of compelling and extraordinary reasons pursuant to Section 1202.4.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The sole issue at the restitution hearing was whether such an order would violate the state constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15.) The trial court, in reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Harvest </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 641 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 135] <em>(Harvest), </em>concluded it would not because victim restitution is not a form of punishment. Since Moreno does not discuss the double jeopardy issue in his opening brief, we asked the parties to address it in supplemental briefing, along with two other issues: Had the court lost jurisdiction to modify Moreno\u2019s sentence? Was the court\u2019s order authorized in any case by the <em>second </em>part of section 1202.46? We begin with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\n<em>Does Section 1202.46 Apply?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Moreno argues in his opening brief that section 1202.46 did not authorize the trial court to order direct restitution because, referring to the <em>first </em>part of the statute, the losses could have been ascertained at the time of the original sentencing (and were not due only to the prosecutor\u2019s neglect). And, he notes further, the court in this case had not reserved the issue of direct restitution when it sentenced him initially.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">It is this latter point, Moreno claims, that distinguishes this case from <em>Harvest, </em>where the appellate court, in addition to holding that victim restitution is not punishment for purposes of double jeopardy, held that the principles of waiver and estoppel did not foreclose a request for restitution made for the first time upon resentencing following an appeal. The trial court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction, however, was only one of several reasons the appellate court gave for its conclusion. (See <em>Harvest, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 652.)</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Moreno\u2019s principal argument against the application of section 1202.46 is based on <em>People v. Tillman </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 300 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 741, 992 P.2d 1109] <em>(Tillman). </em>There, on the defendant\u2019s appeal from his criminal conviction, the People complained for the first time that the trial court had failed to impose a restitution fine and a parole revocation fine. A restitution fine is mandatory unless the court finds \u201ccompelling and extraordinary reasons\u201d for not ordering it, and states those reasons on the record (which the trial court had not done). (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b).) Further, if the court imposes a restitution fine, it must also impose a parole revocation fine in the same amount. (\u00a7 1202.45.) Consequently, on the premise the two fines were mandatory, the Court of Appeal in <em>Tillman </em>amended the judgment to impose both fines in the amount of $200 each, the minimum permitted by the statutes. <em>(Tillman, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 301-302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">The question before the Supreme Court was whether the People, by failing to raise the point at sentencing, had waived their objection to the trial court\u2019s omission. The court reasoned that the trial court\u2019s option to forgo imposition of a restitution fine for \u201ccompelling and extraordinary reasons\u201d made the fine a discretionary sentencing choice subject to the waiver doctrine enunciated in <em>People v. Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040] <em>(Scott) </em>and <em>People v. Welch </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 228 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 520, 851 P.2d 802] <em>(Welch). (Tillman, supra, 22 </em>Cal.4th at p. 302; cf. <em>People v. Talibdeen </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1151 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 922, 46 P.3d 388] [imposition of state and county penalties is mandatory]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 849 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 14 P.3d 942] [imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>parole revocation f\u00edne is mandatory].) Both <em>Scott </em>and <em>Welch </em>applied the waiver rule to criminal defendants; in <em>Tillman </em>the court applied it as well to the People. <em>(Tillman, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 303.) That is, an appellate court may not correct errors arising from the trial court\u2019s failure to make or articulate its discretionary sentencing choices if the complaining party\u2014 whether the defendant or the People\u2014failed to object to the omission at trial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">Moreno argues the decision whether to order victim restitution likewise is a discretionary sentencing choice because the trial court has the option to award less than the full amount of the victim\u2019s losses for \u201ccompelling and extraordinary reasons\u201d stated on the record. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f).) \u201c[I]t is clear,\u201d he asserts, \u201cthat if the trial court fails to provide restitution to victims or to reserve the issue, it has exercised its discretion to waive restitution while failing to state its reasons for doing so on the record.\u201d Perhaps he means to say we must presume the trial court elected not to order restitution, but simply neglected, or was not required, to state its reasons. (But see <em>People v. Martinez </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1511, 1517-1518 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 492] [presumption applies to silent record when trial court is <em>not </em>required to state findings; failure to object to omission in this situation constitutes waiver].)</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Moreover, Moreno contends this extension of <em>Tillman </em>trumps the earlier decided cases cited by the People for the proposition that the trial court must <em>either </em>order victim restitution <em>or </em>state its reasons for not doing so on the record, but it has no discretion to do neither. This distinction between mandatory and discretionary sentencing issues, in addition to determining whether the issue can be waived by a failure to object at trial, also determines whether or not the resulting sentence is unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rowland </em>(1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1745 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 351] <em>(Rowland), </em>for example, the defendant pleaded no contest to two counts of grand theft as part of a plea bargain that made no provision for victim restitution. When the victims appeared at the sentencing hearing seeking restitution, the court, believing it had the discretion to do so, denied the request. The victims then moved for modification of the sentence to include restitution on the ground it was mandatory under section 1202.4. The court agreed. The question then was whether the defendant would be prejudiced by a restitution order such that he should be allowed to withdraw his plea. The court found no prejudice, viz., it was not reasonably probable the defendant would have rejected the plea bargain had he been advised of the restitution order, and so it directed him to pay restitution totaling nearly $200,000 with interest. <em>(Rowland, </em>at pp. 1748-1750.)</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>On appeal, the defendant argued the trial court .lacked the power to resentence him because the original sentence had been valid. He also challenged the court\u2019s no-prejudice finding. The Court of Appeal rejected both of these arguments and affirmed the judgment. <em>(Rowland, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1750-1754.) As for the validity of the original sentence, the court said: \u201c[Vjictim restitution is mandated by both the Constitution and section 1202.4. [Citations.] The only discretion retained by the trial court in this regard is in fixing the amount of the award. Although section 1202.4 mandates a sum which will fully reimburse the victim(s), the court can for \u2018clear and compelling reasons\u2019 award a lesser amount. However, in such a case the court must state the reasons for issuing a lesser award. [Citations.] Where the court fails to issue an award altogether, as here, the sentence is invalid. [Citation.]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Rowland, </em>at p. 1751; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bernal </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 155, 164-165 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 622] [sentence that fails to award victim restitution, or to award full restitution, is invalid, citing <em>Rowland]; People </em>v. <em>Valdez </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198-1204 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 4] [sentence making no provision for victim restitution is unauthorized, and subject to correction notwithstanding prosecution\u2019s failure to object at sentencing].)</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">In his supplemental brief, Moreno maintains <em>Rowland </em>was \u201csimply wrong\u201d to conclude a sentence that fails to award restitution altogether is invalid. His point, as best we can discern, is that section 1202.4 (see former subd. (g), ante) requires the trial court to find and state compelling reasons only if it awards less than full restitution, but not if it awards no restitution at all. \u201cAccordingly, a decision to waive restitution entirely is not invalid,\u201d he asserts. It seems to us nonsensical to suppose the Legislature intended to make it more burdensome on the trial court to award <em>some </em>restitution than to order none at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">We believe in any case that the answer to the question before us lies not in <em>Tillman </em>but in the second sentence of section 1202.46. \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting a victim, the district attorney, or a court on its own motion from requesting correction, at any time, of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>sentence when the sentence is invalid due to the omission of a restitution order or fine without a finding of compelling and extraordinary reasons pursuant to Section 1202.4.\u201d Section 1202.46 was enacted effective January 1, 2000, after the sentencing that was the subject of <em>Tillman. </em>(Stats. 1999, ch. 888, \u00a7 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">In his supplemental brief, Moreno simply reiterates his contention the introduction to the first part of section 1202.46 (\u201cwhen the economic losses of a victim cannot be ascertained at the time of sentencing . . .\u201d) qualifies the <em>entire </em>statute, notwithstanding the introduction to the second part of the section (\u201cNothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting . . .\u201d the correction of an invalid sentence at any time). He asserts: \u201cThe second sentence of section 1202.46 provides that the failure to retain jurisdiction, order restitution or state reasons only results in an invalid sentence in cases in which the amount of restitution is not ascertainable at the time of sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">We disagree. To begin with, the second part of section 1202.46 does not purport to define <em>when </em>a sentence is valid or invalid, it says only that a sentence that <em>is </em>invalid for lack of a restitution provision may be corrected at any time. And it seems obvious in any event that \u201cNothing in this section . . .\u201d includes \u201cnothing in the first part of this section.\u201d Thus, for purposes of the second part of section 1202.46, it makes no difference whether or not the victim\u2019s losses were ascertainable at the time of sentencing. Otherwise, every section 1202.46 hearing necessarily would require the court to make an \u201cascertainability\u201d determination, much like the one it must make in statute of limitations situations where the discovery rule applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">We conclude that, notwithstanding a trial court\u2019s failure to retain jurisdiction to impose or modify a restitution order, the second part of section 1202.46 permits the prosecutor, <em>at any time, </em>to request correction of a sentence that is <em>invalid </em>because, as in the present case, the court at the initial sentencing had neither ordered restitution nor found \u201ccompelling and extraordinary reasons\u201d for ordering less than full restitution. The victim too may make such a request, or the trial court may act on its own motion. It follows that the court is not barred from correcting the invalid sentence simply because the prosecutor failed to object when it was imposed. An invalid or unauthorized sentence is subject to correction whenever it comes to the court\u2019s attention. <em>(People v. Dotson </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 547, 554, fn. 6 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 423, 941 P.2d 56]; <em>Scott, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 354; <em>People v.

The defendant in <em>Harvest </em>was convicted (in 1994, it seems) of one count of first degree murder with special circumstances, and one count of second degree murder. At sentencing, the trial court reserved the issue of victim restitution. The appellate court, in an opinion filed in 1998, reversed the second count and the special circumstances finding on the first count. It gave the prosecution the option on remand of retrying the second count or accepting a reduction of the charge to voluntary manslaughter. The prosecutor chose the latter course and the matter was set for resentencing. It was only then that the prosecutor asked the court to impose restitution. (The reasons for the delay are not clear.) The defendant opposed the request on several grounds: the request was untimely and exceeded the scope of the remand; the prosecutor should be estopped to seek restitution for having failed to do so back in 1994; and a restitution order would constitute double jeopardy. The trial court rejected these arguments and ordered the defendant to pay restitution to both victims. <em>(Harvest, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 645.)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The appellate court, following the type of analysis utilized by the Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hanson </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 355, 360-363 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 58, 1 P.3d 650] (Hanson) (finding that a restitution fine is a form of punishment), concluded direct victim restitution is not punishment for double jeopardy purposes. <em>(Harvest, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 650.) The court also rejected the defendant\u2019s other two claims, but reduced the restitution award to one victim for lack of evidence.' <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 651-653.)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">Since the trial court in <em>Harvest </em>had \u201creserved the issue of victim restitution at the time it initially sentenced [the] defendant\u201d <em>(Harvest, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 651), we wonder whether the subsequent restitution order implicated double jeopardy principles at all, regardless of whether or not victim restitution is a form of punishment. In <em>Hanson, </em>by comparison, the trial court, after having originally imposed a $1,000 restitution fine, increased it to $10,000 on resentencing following an appeal. <em>(Hanson, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 357-358.) The problem in <em>Harvest, </em>it seems to us, was one of due process, given the five-year delay between the sentencing and the resentencing. (See <em>Harvest, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at pp. 657-658 (dis. opn. of Poch\u00e9, J.).)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
