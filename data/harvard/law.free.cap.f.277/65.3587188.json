There was a motion to dismiss appellee\u2019s amended complaint which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-16\">It is contended that the court erred in so ruling because appellee\u2019s complaint was bad for want of equity. There is nothing in the contention that appellee was as much a party to the fraud as appellant. Washer v. Smyer, 109 Tex. 398, 211 S. W. 985, 4 A. L. R. 1320, is not in point. Even if appellee had an adequate remedy at law, a motion to dismiss was not the remedy. Pierce v. National Bank of Commerce (C. C. A.) 268 Fed. 487; section 274b, Judicial Code, amendment of March 3, 1915. 38 Stat. 956 (Comp. St. \u00a7 1251b). There was no error in the refusal of the court to transfer the case to the law docket, as it was not one that ought to have been brought at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-17\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
