We are of opinion that the ground relied on is untenable, that evidence adduced, as disclosed by the record, was such as warranted the finding made by the court, and that the record does not show that the court erred in making the order complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
