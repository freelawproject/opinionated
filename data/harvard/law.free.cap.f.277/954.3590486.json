We have read the record with great care, and are o E the opinion that there is no substantial evidence connecting the defendant with the offense charged in the indictment. The most that can be said of the evidence is that it arouses a suspicion that the defendant in some <em>way </em>aided and abetted in the mailing of the pamphlet in question. The facts of the case are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">Post Office Inspector W. U. Kleinwachter for some reason became suspicious that a Mrs. Cora Brown was using the mails unlawfully, and arranged with the wife of an associate inspector to write a decoy letter from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Mrs. Brown, requesting that she would send the writer a copy of the book entitled birth control, and inclosing in payment a post office money order for $1. This letter was dated. February 10, 1919, and addressed to Mrs. Cora Brown, Box 288, Crest\u00f3n, Iowa. A few days later the pamphlet was received through the mail at Council Bluffs and immediately turned over to the inspector. The envelope inclosing the pamphlet was postmarked Thayer, Iowa, February 13, 1919. On February 17th Mrs. Cora Brown cashed the post office money order for $1 at the Crest\u00f3n post office. It is seen that the evidence thus far recited establishes the guilt of Mrs. Cora Brown with reasonable certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">To connect the defendant with the offense made out by the proof against Mrs. Brown, the government proved that in April, 1917, a young woman who is not otherwise identified rented box 288 of the Crest\u00f3n post: office for the use of a business concern known as the Brown Book Company. About a week later the defendant called for and was given a key to box 288. Pie retained the key until in May, 1919. Another key to box 288 was out during this period, hut to whom it was given does not apipear. The rent for box 288, collected quarterly, was on several occasions paid by the defendant during <em>the </em>time he had a key to the box in his possession. The Brown Book Company, in whose name the box was taken, for aught the record shows, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>may have had a well-known place of business in the town of Crest\u00f3n, or it may have been a name only, with post office box No. 288-as its sole identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The defendant, -a lawyer by profession, had been living with his father and brother at Thayer on a farm for about 2% years before the-trial in September, 1919. On February 22d Inspector Kleinwachter, accompanied .by the United States marshal and the post office clerk who had cashed the $1 money order for Mrs. Brown, went from Crest\u00f3n to Thayer, a distance of about 13 miles. Mrs. Brown was found' at the home of the defendant. The clerk identified her as the Mrs. Cora Brown who had cashed the $1 money order on the 17th. The marshall at that time arrested both the defendant and Mrs. Brown. After the arrest the defendant told the inspector that Mrs. Brown was-his wife. Until he received this information, it does not appear the inspector knew that the defendant and Mrs. Brown were married. The-inspector was called as a witness and testified to a conversation he had with the defendant a day or two- after the arrest. The Brown-Book Company was the chief subject of this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">From a casual reading of this testimony the impression is left that the defendant admitted his guilt to the witness. On a more careful reading of the testimony, however, it is-seen that this impression is based upon the inferences of the witness, as is fairly illustrated in-his answer to the question o-n cross-examination: \u201cMr. Gibson didn\u2019t tell you he sent any such book?\u201d when he answered: \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t tell me; just come out and say that he sent it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Aside from the inferences of the witness, the direct statements attributed by him to the defendant are of too doubtful import, under the circumstances of the case, to justify the conviction of the defendant. The defendant undoubtedly knew, at the time he had the conversation detailed by the witness, the nature of the evidence connecting his wife, or Mrs. Brown, with the mailing of the pamphlet, and understood its seriousness. When this so-called confession is read in the-light of this knowledge, it is evident that the defendant, in what he said, was attempting to\u2019shield his wife, and not, as inferred by the-witness, making or intending to make a confession of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">The case made by the government amounts to this, when both the evidence and the lack of evidence are considered:</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">In answer to a letter from Council Bluffs, addressed to Mrs. Cora Brown, Box 288, Crest\u00f3n, Iowa, the pamphlet entitled birth control\u2019 was received through the mail. Box 288 belonged to the Brown Book Company, a concern which- may have had a well-established business at.Crest\u00f3n. The defendant two years before had been given a key to-box 288 and on several occasions had paid the box rent. Another key was out to the box. He lived at Thayer, 10 or IS miles distant from Crest\u00f3n. He had never received mail through this box and had never taken mail from it. There is no evidence that he was ever in Crest\u00f3n, except the occasions when he paid the box rent, when he received the-key to the box, and when he returned it. The connection of the defendant with post office bo-x No. 288 is certainly insufficient to justify his conviction. The fact next to be added to those recounted above is-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>that the woman who committed the <em>offense, as </em>shown by <em>the </em>evidence, was the wife of the defendant, and living with him at Thayer, 12 or 15 miles distant from Crest\u00f3n. We do not know how long they had been married, or how long she had resided at Thayer, or how frequently she visited Crest\u00f3n. If the defendant is to be given the benefit of the presumption of innocence accorded to every person accused of crime, he cannot be found guilty of aiding and abetting in the commission of the offense charged in the indictment, and therefore a principal, simply because the woman was his wife. Their relationship cannot he said to do more than raise a suspicion that the defendant aided and abetted her in the commission of the offense. As already stated, we do not think the so-called confession sufficient to justify the conviction of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">Whether the facts above detailed are considered singly or together, we repeat that we are of the opinion that there is no substantial evidence connecting the defendant with the offense charged in the indictment. The mosi that can be said of the evidence is that it raises a suspicion that the defendant in some way aided and ahetted in the mailing of the pamphlet in question. It may he possible for the prosecution, upon a retrial of this cause, to make a case against the defendant which should he submitted to a jury for its determination; but we are clearly convinced that it failed to do so at the trial now under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">I,et the judgment be reversed, and the court below directed to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Judge HOOK sat in the case, concurred in the conclusion reached, but died before this opinion was prepared</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
