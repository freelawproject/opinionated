Hoyne and Eugene H. de Bronkhart, as the sole members of the firm of Eugene M. Lloyne &amp; Co., a partnership, together with the partnership, were on April 8, 1920, adjudged bankrupts. On May 7th a petition was filed by Charles S. Winston, praying that the order of adjudication be vacated. This petition, as amended, put in issue the personnel of the copartnership of Eugene M. Hoyne &amp; Co., petitioner alleging that, in addition to the aforementioned partners, there were William R. Moorhou.se, Royal C. Vilas, Peter G. Thompson, Frank G. Hoyne, Thomas M. Hoyne, Maclay Hoyne, J. C. McCord, William Franz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Anderson, Ward' A. Vilas, T. H. Willis, H\u00e9nry D. Sturtevant, Daniel J. <em>Schuyler; </em>R. T. Davis, and John D. Cory, Insolvency was denied, with these parties recognized as partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Issue was joined and the matter referred to a master to take proofs and report his conclusions and recommendations to the court. Testimony was thereafter taken before the special master, upon which he filed his report, finding that the firm of Eugene M. Hoyne &amp; Co. consisted of Eugene M. Hoyne and Eugene H. de Bronkhart, and recommending that the Winston petition be dismissed, with costs. The master approached the question stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">\u201cI therefore determine that the hearing should be had on the sole question as to whether there was a partnership relation as claimed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">He further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">\u201cIt would seem that the business was unsuccessful, because none of these obligations were met out of any of the profits; that no profits were made, excepting for a short time, and not very large; and that none of the creditors who signed this agreement were paid anything on their respective claims, either on their original indebtedness or for money they advanced. The bankrupt firm owes unsecured creditors approximately $750,000; secured creditors, $2,600,000. The liabilities of Perry, Price &amp; Co., which are involved in the contract, amount to about $720,000, and the loan by a few of the owners of those claims was about $12,000. The contract under which the firm of Hoyne &amp; Co. took over the old business of Perry, Price &amp; Co. is the basis of the claim that the partnership relation was created thereby and that the new creditors who were created by Hoyne &amp; Co. in running the business are now creditors of all the parties to that contract. Attention is called to the fact that the petitioners allege that they did not know the facts on which they base the partnership till after bankruptcy, so they did not extend their credit based on any thought that anybody except de Bronkhart and Hoyne were liable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">He further said, discussing the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">\u201cAre these bankrupts partners as between themselves? The contract in question expressly states that those who are now sought to be charged as partners were merely creditors who postponed their day of payment until profits were earned in carrying on the business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">And in conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">\u201cAs first stated, I think the. Illinois statute precludes the partnership idea; but aside from that I am of the opinion that the contract does not involve the partnership construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">This report was approved by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\"><bracketnum>[1-3]</bracketnum> Petitioner seeks to review <em>this </em>order dismissing his petition both by appeal and bj7 a petition to review and revise. That the order under consideration is not appealable seems well settled. Brady v. Bernard &amp; Kittinger, 170 Fed. 576, 95 C. C. A. 656; Hart-Parr Co. v. Barkley, 231 Fed. 913, 146 C. C. A. 109; In re Ives, 113 Fed. 911, 1 C. C. A. 541, B-R Electric &amp; T. Mfg. Co. v. \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co., 206 Fed. 885, 124 C. C. A. 545; In re Vanoscope Co., 233 Fed. 53, 147 C. C. A. 123; Plymouth Cordage Co. v. Smith, 194 U. S. 311, 24 Sup. Ct. 725, 48 L. Ed. 992; Brady v. Bernard &amp; Kittinger, 217 U. S. 595, 30 Sup. Ct. 695, 54 L. Ed. 896; Armstrong v. Norris, 247 Fed. 253, 159 C. C. A. 347. Petitioner does not urge it in this court. His only way to review the order is by petition to review and revise, and therefore naught but questions of law may be considered. In re Caponigri, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>183 Fed. 307, 105 C. C. A. 519; In re Antigo Screen Door Co., 123 Fed. 249, 59 C. C. A. 248; In re Richards, 96 Fed. 935, 37 C. C. A. 634; Courier-Journal, etc., Co. v. Sch\u00e6fer-Meyer Brewing Co., 101 Fed. 699, 702, 41 C. C. A. 614; In re Rosser, 101 Fed. 562, 41 C. C. A. 497; Stuart v. Reynolds, 204 Fed. 709, 123 C. C. A. 13. Our examination of the record convinces us that hut one question of law is involved, viz. Is the report of the master wholly unsupported by testimony? Such a question is one of law. In re Kuhn, 234 Fed. 277, 148 C. C. A. 179; Good v. Kane, 211 Fed. 956, 128 C. C. A. 454; In re Knosher &amp; Co., 197 Fed. 136, 116 C. C. A. 560; In re Cole, 144 Fed. 392, 75 C. C. A. 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"><bracketnum>[4-6]</bracketnum> Counsel for petitioner place much reliance upon the written agreement of the parties, but it is by no means all of the material evidence bearing upon this issue. Several witnesses, some of them parties to the written agreement, testified to facts which throw some-light upon the construction which the court must give to the contract. Certainly all the facts and inferences favorable to the respondents must be unqualifiedly accepted under the aforementioned rule of law. The contract, material parts of which are set forth below,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>of recognizing the partnership status, describes the relationship of tine parties as debtors and creditors. We might therefore from this fact alone, find support for the master\u2019s finding. True, the written agreement may not have embodied the true understanding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>parties; it may have been drawn for the purpose of defeating any liability arising out of the partnership relation, and may not nave been expressive of the real intent of the parties; or the agreement may not have expressed the entire understanding of the parties. This may be conceded, but it does not derogate from the effect of the document, the recitals of which recognize the relation of debtor and creditor, and which therefore furnish some basis \u00bfor the master\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Certainly the oral testimony tends to support this view. Respondents were creditors of the old, brokerage firm of Perry, Price &amp; Co. This firm became badly involved. The creditors were numerous; the assets small. Tike others, respondents desired to increase the amount recoverable on their claims. They agreed upon certain conditions not to press them. A change in the name and membership of the firm was one of the conditions imposed. The payment of the claims as fast as their earnings permitted was another condition. Neither the motive that prompted the parties to enter into the agreement nor the contract itself is indicative of a partnership between the debtors and the creditors. These facts may not and do not constitute all of the evidence, nor were they conclusive on the District Court; but they afford material support and rather persuasive reasons for the conclusion which the master reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">It is urged, however, that notwithstanding these foregoing reasons in support of the findings, the question of the status of the parties is one for the court to determine solely from the contract and that certain provisions make it impossible for us to conclude other than that a general partnership was created. Because the respondents were to receive the net profits, and because they appointed trustees to represent them to insure the payment of the profits on their claims, and such trustees were given, for the purpose, some voice in the affairs of the. partnership, it is urged that the partnership extended to the respondents. But is this conclusion unavoidable?</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\"><bracketnum>[7, 8]</bracketnum> The Uniform, Partnership Law of Illinois (Hurd\u2019s Rev. St. 1919, c. 106a, \u00a7\u00a7 1-44) governs this contract; Chicago being the place where its execution was completed and the same city being the place where the business of the new firm was to be conducted. The Uniform Partnership Act was in force at the date of its execution, and had been for over a year. Timited partnerships for the conduct of a brokerage business were not permitted. Section 3, Limited Partnership Act (Hurd\u2019s Rev. St. 1919, c. 106a, \u00a7 47). It is true that participation in profits as such is evidence tending to establish the status of partnership between the respondents, but it is not conclusive. Section 7, subd. 4. More significant would participation in profits he, if the evidence allowed that the payments were made to partners as such, rather than in the extinguishment of a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The Uniform Partnership Act defines certain tests by which the status of an individual may be determined. Section 6, subd. 1, defines a partnership as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\u201cAn association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Section 7, subd. 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\">\u201cExcept as provided by section 16, persons who are not partners as to each other are not partners as to third persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Section 16, referred to, deals with a situation where an estoppel has arisen by virtue of statements made by one holding himself out as a partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> Intent is a factor that may be considered in any finding of fact. True, intent must be gathered from the acts of the parties, and not from an Unlawful desire to avoid liability; that is to say, the parties may intend to avoid liability, and may'fail to do so because their acts and their contract establish a status from which liability as a partner follows. But if the parties intend to loan money, which is to be repaid as fast as the profits permit, we think the intent may overcome the effect of receipt by the creditors of the profits of the debtor concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">At least it is evident that a basis, and a substantial one, exists for the finding of the master, and we are therefore not permitted to disturb it. -We find no error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The appeal is dismissed. On the petition to review and revise the order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-6\"> This agreement, made at Chicago, Illinois, this 1- day of October, 1918, between Eugene H. de Bronkhart and Eugene M.
