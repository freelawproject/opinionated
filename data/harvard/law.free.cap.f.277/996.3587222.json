In this he was defeated (United States ex rel. Dunkley v. Ewing, 42 App. D. C. 176),. but the Association above named withdrew its application for said proceeding on May 25, 1914.

Dunkley. 46 App. D. C. 70), and thereafter Dunkley\u2019s process patent issued on August 21, 3.917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1019-4\">It is plain that Dunkley\u2019s real opponent in the Patent Office was the California Fruit Canners\u2019 Association, and eotemporaneously with the abandonment by that concern of its \u201cpublic use proceeding,\u201d and for a nominal consideration the plaintiff herein executed a license to its opponent for and under whatever patents might be ultimately granted upon the Dunkley application of November 29. 1904.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1019-5\">This license is dated May 22, 1914, and the words here important are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1019-6\">\u201cNow therefore, be it known, that for and in consideration of the sum of $10 in hand paid by the California Fruit Canners\u2019 Association unto the said Dunkley Company the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, the said Dunkley Company does hereby grant unto the said California Fruit Canners\u2019 Association for the benefit of itself and its successors, a license free of royalties of any kind whatsoever, for the use of the said invention in connection with its business relative to the canning or treatment of fruit, granting unto the said California Fruit Canners\u2019 Association the free right for the use of any machine or machine or invention owned or controlled by the said Dunkley Company\u201d\u2014and covered by the patents expected to grow out of tho application aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1019-7\">The license agreement continues that it is granted \u201cfor the benefit of the said California Fruit Canners\u2019 Association and its successors for the full term of years of any letters patent which may hereafter be granted for the inventions\u201d disclosed in the aforesaid application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1019-8\">In August, 1915, plaintiff sued upon its then recently granted machine patent in the Northern District of California, summoning as defendants numerous companies engaged in the canning of fruit, especially peaches, including the Griffin &amp; Skellcy Company and the Central California Canners\u2019 Company;. In this case Dunklev prevailed. Central, etc., Co. v. Dunkley Co., 247 Fed. 790, 159 C. C. A. 648.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1019-9\">Within a fortnight after the lower court\u2019s favorable decision in the case just cited, this plaintiff began action against another alleged infringer in the Southern District of California. The process patent had not yet issued and suit was begun on the machine patent alone. Subsequently and in April, 1918, the suit was enlarged by supplemental bill so as to count upon the process patent also. It was then brought to trial and the bill dismissed, the trial court holding that the Dunkley machine invention could not be \u201ccarried back beyond the summer of 1903\u201d and was under 1he evidence anticipated. That court was \u201cclearly of the opinion that there is no validity at all\u201d in the Dunkley process patent, wherefore the bill was dismissed. The appeal resulted ii^ affirmance, but upon the ground of noninfringement. Dunkley Co. v. Pasadena, etc., Co. (C. C. A.) 261 Fed. 386.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1019-10\">This present suit was brought before tho decision of the District Court for the Southern District of California adverso to the patents. A. N. Hand, J., followed the reasoning, and reached the conclusion of Trippet, J., in the last-mentioned California case. But the issues in this litigation differ from those in any of the preceding causes. Here, as there, anticipation and lack of invention are advanced by the defense; hut in addition there is a plea of license growing out of the following nncontradicted facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1019-11\">The California Fruit Canners\u2019 Association is a corporation of California. After it obtained the above-recited license, it continued to carry on its busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>ness until November, 1916. At that time it sold, transferred, and assigned to this defendant, the California Packing Corporation (which is formed under the laws of New York), all its \u201cbusiness, franchise and property as a whole,\u201d including its good will and all its real and personal property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1020-4\">It is not denied that this transaction was and is in accord with ihe law of California, which does not permit the express merger and consolidation of corporations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1020-5\">Defendant by its contract of purchase assumed all the debts, obligations, and liabilities of the California Fruit Canners\u2019 Association, and since the purchase aforesaid defendant has carried-on the business of its assignor or predecessor. It has also acquired additional canning plants, including especially those of Griffin &amp; Skelley and the Central, etc., Co., which were two of the unsuccessful defendants in the suit brought in the Northern District of California.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1020-6\">Since the sale in November, 1916, the California Fruit Canners\u2019 Association has done no business, but shortly, after said sale its capital stock was reduced to \u00e1 par of $3,000 and all its assets (except $3,000) were distributed among its stockholders. The defendant herein has acquired all of this $3,000 par of stock (except eight shares) and is now the holder and owner of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1020-7\">The decree below (appealed from by plaintiff) held: (1) That defendant during all the times complained of was a licensee of plaintiff; (2) that both the patents in suit are \u201cinvalid, null and void.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1020-9\">Frederick L.

The above statement shows that the license of 19\u00cd4 was a settlement of expensive conflict between Dunkley and the Fruit Canners\u2019 Association; the consideration is manifest, entirely apart from the formal recital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">Two phrases of this document are especially important: (1) The association is licensed \u201cfor the benefit of itself and its successors,\u201d and (2) the privilege is granted for the use of the Dunkley invention \u201cin, connection with (the associatidn\u2019s) business relative to the canning or treatment of fruit.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-15\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> One preliminary contention may be put aside; it is suggested that, since the license is merely to use, no one acting thereunder can make the licensed article. This is not true, for \u201cif the circumstances indicate such an intention, a license to use implies a license to make the thing to be used.\u201d Edison, etc., Co. v. Peninsular Light, Power &amp; Heat Co. (C. C.) 95 Fed. 669, 676, citing cases. In 1914 all that Dunkley had were applications for two patents, one for a machine, the other for a process; and every circumstance points to. the conclusion that his licensee was expected\u2019 to make or have made whatever machine it desired to use; while, as for the process, it is difficult to see how any one can be licensed to use a process, without by necessary im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>plication having the right to devise and build whatever apparatus exemplifying the process seems good to the licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">Considering the first phrase of the license agreement: While the word \u201csuccessor\u201d is a term of art, it is of the most general signification, meaning no more than \u201cone who follows or comes into the place of another.\u201d Historically it is the equivalent, when applied to a corporation, of the word \u201cheir\u201d in connection with a natural person. Bouv. Law Dict, and citations. In conveyancing it. is necessary to insure more than a life estate in a corporation sole (Boston v. Sears, 22 Pick. [Mass.] 122), hut, though usual, a grant to a corporation aggregate without the phrase is prima facie in perpetuity, inasmuch as the company is usually perpetual (Union Co. v. Young, 1 Whart. [Pa.] 410, 425, 30 Am. Dec. 212: Chancellor v. Bell. 45 N. J. Eq. 538, 541, 17 Atl. 684).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Doubtless a license, without more, is but a personal privilege expiring by operation of law with the death of the licensed individual, or with the cessation of business life in the case of a corporate recipient (Keystone, etc., Foundry v. Fastpress Co. [C. C. A.] 272 Fed. 242, Op. filed Feb. 2, 1921), yet if the grant be also to heirs or successors it is plain that the property is descendible. Usually descendibility carried with it the quality of assignability, and it has been held that the words \u201cheirs or successors\u201d import assignability. Wood Harvester Co. v. Minneapolis, etc., Co. (C. C.) 61 Fed. 256, 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">\u201cSuccessor\u201d is a plastic word, and \u201cin modern acceptation has a broader significance than succession in respect to the estate of a deceased. It may mean * * * succeeding to a place, or a right, or an interest or a power, official or otherwise. It may mean succession in corporate control.\u201d American, etc., Co. v. Campbell, 138 Fed. 531, 534, 71 C. C. A. 55, 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Both from reason and authority we conclude that a grant to a corporation and its successors is a phrase to be interpreted according to the surrounding circumstances. There can be no doubt that one corporation may be the successor of another, although there is neither a merger nor technical consolidation. Lightner v. Boston, etc., Co., 1 Low. 338, Fed. Cas. No. 8,343. Indeed, where what is ordinarily called consolidation occurs, the presumption (in the United States courts) is that all the constituent companies retain their corporate identity. Keokuk, etc., R. R. v. Missouri, 152 U. S. 301, 305, 14 Sup. Ct. 592, 38 L. Ed. 450. Two corporations may \u201cremain separate legal entities and yet be merged for all practical purposes,\u201d as was said in Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 330, 337, 38 Sup. Ct. 540, 62 L. Ed. 1142; but always it is necessary to consider the connection in which words of succession, merger or consolidation are used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">The second phrase above quoted from the license shows that the Dunkley devices were to be utilized in a business; \u25a0 context and evidence prove that that business was the preserving of fruit, for which the peeling thereof was and always would be necessary. There was thus excellent reason for stating that the invention was licensed for use \u201cin connection with\u201d the association\u2019s business; and it is reasonable to read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>the phrase of succession in conjunction with the phrase relating to a business use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">A license is but \u201cthe right not to be sued,\u201d yet it is also a piece of intangible, incorporeal personal property, and, in the nature of its estate, does not differ from many other privileges or (in a very broad sense) franchises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">It is this similarity which renders applicable to the matter in hand such cases as International, etc., Co. v. Smith County, 65 Tex. 21, and Grand Canyon, etc., Co. v. Treat, 12 Ariz. 69, 95 Pac. 187, affirmed 222 U. S. 448, 32 Sup. Ct. 125, 56 L. Ed. 265, where, speaking of the privilege of exemption from taxes as passing from the exempted corporation to one purchasing its property in foreclosure, the court held that\u2014;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018successors\u2019 is evidently used to designate such corporations or persons as may in any lawful manner acquire the proprietorship of the corporate rights and property through which they are to he exercised.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">In these cases the' privilege of exemption was held to be attached to the property, and the \u201csuccessor\u201d reasonably and legally to be that company which \u201ccame into the place of\u201d the original recipient of the privilege. In like manner, an easement (another piece of incorporeal but descendible property) has been held when granted to one \u201cand his successors\u201d to be attached to the business of a certain.store and to pass with the business. Ainslie v. Eason, 107 Ga. 747, 33 S. E. 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">Without any written license the doctrine here contended for by appellee was enforced in Wilson v. Wilson Corp. (D. C.) 241 Fed. 494, and in Lane, etc., Co. v. Locke, 150 U. S. 193, 14 Sup. Ct. 78, 37 L. Ed. 1049, it was held to be sufficient to work a succession to a license privilege enjoyed by a copartnership, that the succeeding \u201ccompany was organized upon the same basis as the firm; that the business of the company was to be the same as that carried on by .[the firm], and to be carried on in the same premises; that the - entire property and assets of the firm and its liabilities and obligations * * * devolved upon the company.\u201d This decision sufficiently discusses and distinguishes the earlier decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">Nor is it perceived that Niagara, etc., Co. v. Hibbard, 179 Fed. 844, 103 C. C. A. 330, favors appellant\u2019s contention, though much relied upon. In that case the patentee gave a corporation a ten-year license without any clause of succession. During the ten-year period, the licensee in question transferred all its property to a new company formed in another state, but the new concern did not assume the liabilities of the assignor. It was held that the second corporation was \u201cnot the successor or heir\u201d of the original one. Plainly in that case there was no intention to make a perpetual grant. Again, it is of the essence of a legal succession that in all material respects the succeeding corporation should stand-in the boots of the old one, and the deliberate omission to assume liability was itself enough to prevent that continuity of business and corporate life which is the essence of succession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Result is that when in due legal form this defendant succeeded not only to the business but (as proven) to the franchise, property, liabilities, and good will of the Fruit Canners\u2019 Association, it became within the purpose and meaning of the license agreement the successor of the licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> . It is urged that this result is an attack upon Dunkley\u2019s rights as assured in the case brought in the Northern district of California, because he there obtained injunctions .against two canning companies which have now been acquired by this defendant. But this is a mistaken view of legal rights; the injunction referred to necessarily ran against certain corporations; it affected the corporate personalty, and a license likewise affects persons and corporations, and does not directly reach machinery and buildings. The Griffin &amp; Skelley Company and Central California Company may well remain under injunction and be required to account; but that is no reason why an unlimited licensee of Dunkley\u2019s may not buy the property of these two enjoined corporations and under his license use on his own property and in his own business machines properly forbidden to the former proprietors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Holding as we do that this defendant is the plaintiff\u2019s licensee, we need not go further and consider the validity and scope of Dunkley\u2019s patents. On this point we express no opinion, but affirm the decree below on the sole ground of license. Appellee will recover costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
