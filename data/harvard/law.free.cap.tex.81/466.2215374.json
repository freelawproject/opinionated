Appellant by its answer pleaded not guilty and disclaimed title to all the land sued for except a certain defined portion set iip in the answer. The land so described in the answer it claimed as a right of way in use by it for railway purposes since 1882, under and by virtue of a certain contract executed and delivered to appellant by appellee and others, which contract is made an exhibit to the answer; that by the terms thereof the land was granted to appellant as a right of way for its railway track; and that appellee at that time was the owner of the lands over which the way was granted. The contract among other things donated to the defendant certain other lands in the event it would erect and locate its depot at a certain place, and stated other conditions on appellant which it alleges have been fully complied with. The answer further in the alternative asked that if the defendant is not entitled to hold the land by virtue of said contract, then that the lands be condemned as a right of way for the use of its road and that the damages be found, which it expressed a willingness to pay. Appellee interposed special demurrers to the answer in so much as wherein it asserted title to the lands in appellant by virtue of the contract set up in the answer. The ground of the demurrer being that the land sued for is alleged to be the property of appellee, and the contract under which appellant claims title was not executed by appellee in his individual capacity, but as the representative of the San Felipe Irrigation, Agricultural, and Manufacturing Company, and that it only affects the lands of the company. The court below sustained the demurrer, and no proof was offered under this phase of. the case. The only issue submitted to the jury was that of damages to the land under appellant\u2019s answer, asking ih the alternative for a condemnation of it. The jury found a verdict in favor of appellee for the value of twelve and one-tenth acres of land at $5 an acre and for $200 actual damages to the balance of the tract. Judgment was rendered .on this verdict against appellant, and in its favor condemning the land as its right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The contract declared on in the answer is substantially as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\"><em>\u201cState of </em>Texas, <em>Kinney </em>Bounty.\u2014Memoranda of an agreement made and concluded this the 23d day of May, 1882, between John Perry, Paulina and B.

Block,</p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">\u201cJustice of the Peace Precinct Bo. 4, Kinney County, and ex officio Botary Public Kinney County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-17\">Appellant\u2019s first and only assignment of error complains \u00f3f the action of the court in sustaining the demurrer to its answer setting up title to the lands in controversy under and by virtue of said contract, assigning as a reason because the contract conveyed not only the interest of the irrigation company in the lands therein described but the right of way of the lands owned by the several parties that executed and signed the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-18\">The only question for our consideration is the proper construction to be given to the contract. The primary purpose to be accomplished by this contract was the conveyance of certain lands therein mentioned to the appellant in consideration of its establishing and maintaining a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>depot at Del Rio. For the accomplishment of this purpose the contract may be susceptible of the interpretation that it was the act of the Irrigation, Agricultural, and Manufacturing Company, and not that of the individuals who signed it. But this is not the only purpose of the cpntract or the only benefit to flow from its execution. A right of way by the terms of the contract is conveyed to appellant. The verbiage of the contract that granted this right is, \u201cThis conveyance being in consideration of tire conditions previously expressed and to include the right of way one hundred feet in width through our tracts of land not previously conveyed. \u2019 \u2019 The condition previously expressed is the erection and maintenance of the depot. This contract is signed by the appellee, together with other individuals, and not as the representatives of the irrigation company. \"The only reference made in the contract of their acting in its execution as agents of the Irrigation, Agricultural, and Manufacturing Company is in the particular that grants to the appellant certain lands in consideration of its establishing and maintaining a depot. The maker of this. instrument evidently intended in granting a right of way over \u201cour lands\u201d to convey to the appellant the enjoyment of an easement and right not contemplated and conveyed by the previous terms of the contract. The grantors in preparing this instrument have employed words of their own selection indicating the objects and purpose of the contract. The intent of the parties gathered from the language of the contract was evidently to grant a right of way to appellant over the lands of the individuals owned by them at the time they signed the contract, dependent on a performance of the conditions imposed by the terms of the contract upon appellant. 2 Dev. on Deeds, secs, 835, 836, 838, 839, 848, 882; Pike v. Monroe, 58 Am. Dec., 751; Salisbury v. Andrews, 19 Pick., 251; Coffin v. Douglass, 61 Texas, 407; Shoe Co. v. Ferrell, 68 Texas, 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\">The circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract as stated in the answer, and the acting under it by appellant in constructing its road over the land and using it for years prior to this suit as a right of way, tend to establish the fact that the parties to the contract placed upon it the same construction as is here contended for by appellant. 2 Dev. on Deeds, sec. 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the answer, and for this reason the case will be reversed and remanded, and we so report it.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Adopted June 23, 1891.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
