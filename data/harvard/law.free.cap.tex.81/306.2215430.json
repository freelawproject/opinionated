Sale of Land by Corporation\u2014Acts of President.\u2014The authority merely to execute the instrument to complete a sale of land by statute given to the president of a private corporation (Rev.

Charter and By-Laws which do not Empower the President to Sell.\u2014 The charter of appellee states its purpose: \u201cThe acquisition by purchase or otherwise and the location and subdivision of lands, the management and leasing thereof, and the sale and conveyance of the same in lots and subdivisions or otherwise.\u201d The by-laws contain the provisions: \u201cThe board of directors shall have the general management of the company. It [the board] may delegate all its powers fully or in part to one or several of its members. The lands of the company may be sold or leased for cash or on a credit, and at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the board of directors.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that by these provisions authority to sell was not given to the president.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b323-10\">5. Recognition by Board of Directors. \u2014 That sales of land by the president had been uniformly approved by the board of directors would not evidence a power to sell on credit without reserving the vendor\u2019s lien upon the land; the former sales had always been for cash, or secured by the vendor\u2019s lien.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b323-11\">6.

But it would not authorize the sale upon terms materially variant from those upon which sales of land are uniformly made. To determine such terms the general custom of the country may be shown; also the fact that under the homestead and administration laws the vendor\u2019s lien is the only security a vendor on credit can rely upon.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b323-12\">7.

It is alleged that the board of directors meet in Paris, France, and that the president transacts the business of the company at its office in Weatherford, Texas, selling and conveying the lands of the company. There is nothing in the charter, by-laws, or resolutions retaining vendor\u2019s liens in land sales. 2 Mora, on Priv. Corp., secs. 3, 599, 606, 610 (note 2), 617; Bank v.

G. Martin and J. H. Milliken, who, together with F. E. Milliken, S. H. Milliken, and L. H. Fitzhugh, were made parties defendant. The three last nam\u00e9d defendants were sued as subsequent purchasers. After the institution of the suit J. B. Simpson became the purchaser of whatever interest Fitzhugh had in a portion of the lands, and was permitted to intervene in the suit to defend his right. There was a judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the intervener and the defendants, from which Fitzhugh and Simpson have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae0S\">The grounds upon which the cancellation of the conveyances were sought were fraud and the want of authority in Duke to sell the property upon the particular terms upon which it was attempted t\u00f3 be conveyed. The first deed was dated March 18, 1885, and purported to convey to W. G. Martin twenty-six sections of the land in consideration of the sum of $9920 paid in cash and the sum of $950 due one day after date, as evidenced by Martin\u2019s note, and as recited in the conveyance \u201cthe further consideration of a certain promissory note for $40,-000, bearing 10 per cent interest from date, executed by J. H. Milliken December 15, 1884, to W. G. Martin or bearer, and transferred and delivered by said W. G; Martin to E. W. Duke, president of the Franco-Texan Land Company, on the 18th day of February, 1885, due and payable December 18,1886.\u201d It was also recited that the notes were received \u201cin full payment of the balance of the purchase price of the lands;\u201d and the testimony showed that it was distinctly understood between the parties to the transaction that the vendor\u2019s lien should be waived. This deed was not acknowledged by Duke until the 20th of February, 1885, on which day Martin conveyed toJ. H. Milliken a half interest in the thirty-three sections conveyed therein. On the 10th of March, 1885, Duke, as president of the plaintiff corporation, also conveyed to Martin and J. H. Milliken eight other sections of land for the consideration as recited of the reconveyance to the company by Martin and Milliken of seven sections of the land conveyed to them by the first deed. The obligation referred to in the recitals of the first deed as a promissory note contained a provision that it was \u201ccollectible\u201d in horses of a certain brand at $30 per head.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The court found that Duke was not- authorized to convey the land on a credit without reseiwing the vendor\u2019s lien, and also that he had no authority to sell the land for a promise to pay money, which the promisors were entitled to discharge in horses' at a stipulated price per head. The correctness of these conclusions is questioned by appellants. The question so raised is the leading one in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>There is a distinction to be kept in view between the authority of an agent or officer of a corporation to sell its real estate and the authority conferred by our statute upon the president to execute the conveyance to pass the title. Eev. Stats., art. 600. The authority merely to execute the instrument to complete a sale does not imply authority to make the sale. For example, the president of one of our State banking corporations could not sell a building owned by the bank for the purposes of its lawful business without authority from its board of directors. If, however, the board should make the sale themselves, or the president himself or other agent, under authority conferred by them, should do so, a conveyance executed by him as president under the seal of the corporation would pass the title. The president of a corporation organized to acquire and sell lands may be constituted an agent to make sales, but like any other agent for that purpose he is restricted to the powers conferred upon him by the governing body. In short, we must in this case distinguish between Mr. Duke as the president of the company and Mr. Duke as its agent. In determining the extent of Duke\u2019s authority as agent we are of opinion that these principles must be recognized and applied: First, the agent can not have authority to do that which the corporation has not the power to. do; second, he must in case of a corporation under our general law derive his authority from the board of directors; third, the directors may confer the authority by by-law or resolution, or probably by a vote not entered of record; and fourth, when the power is conferred in neither of these methods it may be implied from a recognition and adopting of the agent\u2019s transactions or other acts on part of the directors which would reasonably induce third parties dealing with him to believe and to act upon the belief that he has authority to do the act in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The charter of the plaintiff corporation states its purpose to be \u201cthe acquisition by purchase or otherwise and the location and subdivision of lands, the management and leasing thereof, and the sale and conveyance of the same in lots and subdivisions or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlY\">The by-laws contain the following provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u201cThe board of directors shall have the general management of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u201cIt [the board] may delegate all its powers fully or in part to one or several of its-members.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">\u201cThe lands of the company may be sold or leased for cash or on a credit, and at such times and on such terms as may be determined by th\u00f3 board of directors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">The majority of the directors seem to have resided in Paris, France, and to have held their meetings there, but the president resided and kept his office in Texas. FTo express authority was shown which empowered that officer to make sale of the lands of the corporation, but it was proved that the persons who had successively held the office of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>president had habitually exercised this power, and that their action had been recognized by the other officers of the corporation. But the evidence also showed that in no instance until the transaction in question had any president sold any land of the company upon a credit without retaining a lien upon it for the unpaid purchase money. It was also proved by a large number of witnesses that the invariable custom in selling lands in the country where those in controversy were situate was to retain a vendor\u2019s lien when the sale was made in whole or in part upon a credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\">From the fact that the presidents of the company were accustomed to sell its lands and that the proceeds were transmitted to France and divided among the stockholders it is necessarily implied that they were authorized by the board of directors to make sales. But is it to be inferred that they were empowered to make sales upon terms materially variant from those upon which such sales were uniformly made? We think not. \u201cIf the agency arises by implication from acts done by the agent with the tacit consent or acquiescence of the principal, it is deemed to be limited to acts of a like nature.\u201d McAlpin v. Cassiday, 17 Texas, 463. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In determining the question it is probable that the invariable custom of the country to retain the vendor\u2019s lien for securing the unpaid purchase money in the sale of lands should be looked to, though we are not prepared to say that such custom or the custom of the presidents of the company should control an express authority to sell upon other terms if such authority had been shown to exist. We think also that we should not lose sight of the fact that under our exemption and probate laws the vendor\u2019s lien is perhaps the only absolute security upon which one. who conveys real estate upon a credit can rely for the performance of the vendee\u2019s obligation to pay. The custom of which we have heard so much in this case certainly tends to show that it was so. regarded in the country where these lands are situate.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">But should we be mistaken in this, there is another ground upon which it must be held that the court did not err in concluding that Duke exceeded his authority in making the transaction in question. The corporation was organized for the purpose of acquiring lands and for selling and conveying the same. It can hardly be held that the power to\" sell and convey carries with it a power to exchange them for personal property, and certainly not when as in this case the charter does not empower the corporation to acquire and hold such property for mere purposes of trade. Is it to be implied then from the facts in evidence in this case that any such authority was intended to be conferred upon Duke? A power to sell conferred by a natural person does not authorize the agent to barter the property. Reese v. Medlock, 27 Texas, 120; Trudo v. Anderson, 10 Mich., 357; Same Case, 81 Am. Dec., 795; Organ Co. v. Starkey, 59 N. H., 142; Lumpkin v. Wilson, 5 Heisk., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>555; Mfg. Co. v. Givan, 65 Mo., 89; Victor, etc., Co. v. Huler, 44Wis., 265; Rogers v. Bass, 46 Texas, 505. It follows, then, that an agent who was authorized merely to sell upon a credit could not take for a deferred payment a written promise which the promisor had the election to discharge in anything but money. Ho express authority being shown for Duke to make this particular transaction, and no circumstances appearing from which such authority can be implied, it is clear that the conveyance was without authority and subject to be canceled as against all persons claiming under it. The rule is well settled that all persons dealing with a corporation must take notice of the powers conferred upon\" it by its charter, and that its agents can not exercise any authority in excess of these powers. Alexander v. Cauldwell, 83 N. Y., 480; Davis v. Railway, 131 Mass., 258; Seileman v. Railway, 27 Gratt., 119; Pearce v. Railway, 21 How., 441; Murphy v. Louisville, 9 Bush., 189. Therefore as to the want of authority to sell the land for a promise to pay money or deliver horses in the alternative, the question of actual notice may be laid out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"AILr\">But the court found that all the defendants had notice of Duke\u2019s.want of authority to make the sale, and it is insisted that as to Martin and J. H. Milliken this finding was error. But except in certain cases persons dealing with an agent are bound to know the limitations upon his powers. If he has been held out as a general agent or as having a special authority which he does not in fact possess the rule does not apply. There was evidence to justify the conclusion that J. H. Milliken was interested with Martin in the original transaction, and that both knew it had been the uniform practice of the company to sell only for money and to retain a vendor\u2019s lien for the unpaid price when sales were made upon a credit. At all events they were not induced by any act of the plaintiff\u2019s officers into the belief that Duke had authority to do otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Many of the appellants\u2019 assignments of error present in various forms the questions we have discussed, and such need not be considered in detail. But there are others which require a disposition at our hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The appellants asked the trial judge to file his conclusions of law and fact, and now complain that the findings filed by him are insufficient upon two grounds: first, because the conclusions of law and the conclusions of fact are not distinct, but are blended together; and second, because the findings of fact are incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In Heirs of Ryon v. Rust, 65 Texas, 529, it is said: \u201cIf it should happen that some legal conclusion should be included in the findings of fact it certainly would not vitiate the whole statement of the judge.\u201d Again, it is held that when the conclusions of fact are not sufficiently frill the omission should be called to the attention of the trial judge \u201cby exception or motion, or in some other proper method.\u201d Railway v. Fossett, 66 Texas, 338. When there is in a case that is tried without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>a jury a question of fact upon which the testimony is conflicting, and the trial judge has not filed his conclusions of fact, this court is bound to presume that his determination of the question has been such as will support the judgment, when in truth he may have made a contrary finding and has erred in a conclusion of law based upon it. In such a case the appellant fails to secure by his appeal a review of the determination of the legal question and a reversal of the judgment for error in the ruling,\u00b0if error has been committed. It is for this reason, in part at least, that the statute provides that \u201cupon a trial by the court the judge shall at the request of either of the parties also state in writing the conclusions of fact found by him separately from the conclusions of law.\u201d Rev. Stats., art. 1333. The duty is only devolved upon the judge when the request is made, and we are of opinion that when findings of fact have been put in writing and filed a party should not be permitted to complain of a failure to find upon any particular issue without a special request therefor. In the absence of such a request the presumption should be that the party complaining of the judgment has not been prejudiced by the court\u2019s omission. In this case there was no exception pointing out a failure to find upon any particular question of fact; nor was there a request for any additional finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">It is also complained that the court erred in holding that the use of the lands should offset the interest on the purchase money actually paid in the transaction, and in decreeing that the plaintiff should repay the principal only. There was evidence to warrant the conclusion that the rent of the lands was equal to the interest on the money. The decree in this particular was a proper adjustment of the equities between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">We think, however, there was error in so much of the decree of the court below as allowed the plaintiff corporation the period of two years and six months within which to repay to the defendants who were found entitled thereto the sum of money which was actually paid' to Duke and which was nsed by the company. The practical effect of the judgment is to deprive the appellants of the land and at the same time to allow the appellee to pay back the consideration received fpr it at its own convenience. This is inequitable. We are of opinion that the most satisfactory decree which can be made in like cases is that the plaintiff shall recover the land upon condition that he pay the defendant the money received, and that npon his doing so he have his execution, but that should he fail to do so the defendant should be quieted in his title and possession. Consequently a time should be fixed at which the plaintiff\u2019s right to pay and recover the land should cease and be determined. A period of time may therefore be properly allowed, but the equity of the defendant demands that it should be short, and ordinarily neither the convenience nor the wants of the plaintiff should be allowed to affect the question. Such is the decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>in this case, except that the time allowed is unreasonably long. Since the plaintiff in a suit of this character demands equity he should come prepared to do equity; and there may be cases in which the court should decline to enter a decree until the plaintiff has paid into court for the use of the defendant that which equity requires him to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Accordingly the judgment in the particular mentioned will be reformed so as to require the appellee to repay the money received for the land within sixty days from this date, and as so reformed the judgment will be affirmed. Appellee will be adjudged to pay the costs of the appeal. And it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\n<em>Reversed and reformed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Delivered June 9, 1891.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
