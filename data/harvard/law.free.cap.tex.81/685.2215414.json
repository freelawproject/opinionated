Employer and Employe \u2014 Safe Machinery. \u2014 A charge in an action by an employe for injuries, etc., that \u201ca duty imposed by law upon a railway corporation is to do everything that can reasonably be done for the safety of its employes,\u201d is equivalent to requiring the use of ordinary care in reference to the matters referred to.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b701-7\"><em>2. </em>Same\u2014Safe Machinery.\u2014It was error, however, to add that it was the further duty of the corporation \u201cto furnish safe machinery for the use of its employes,\u201d and that a failure to do so would render it liable for any injury resulting from defective machinery unless the negligence of plaintiff contributed to the injury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b701-8\">3.

When a person engages in a particular employment he is presumed to do so with a knowledge of and with the intent to take all the risk incident to said employment. If the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was, as alleged in his petition, an employe of the defendant, and that at the time he was injured, if he was injured, he was performing his duty as such employe, and that in the discharge of said duty he was using a hand car furnished by defendant for said purpose, and that said hand car had a defective wheel; and further, that said defective wheel was the cause of the injury to plaintiff, if any, and you further find plaintiff was injured, and that he did not contribute to his injury, then you will find for plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">The declaration that the law imposed upon appellant the duty \u201cto do everything that can reasonably be done for the safety of its employes,\u201d may be-deemed only as an instruction that it was the duty of appellant to use ordinary care in reference to the matters referred to, and if the charge stopped with this there would be nothing of which appellant ought to complain; but the charge goes further and informed the jury that it was the duty of appellant \u201cto furnish safe machinery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>for the use of its employes,\u201d and that a failure to do so would render it liable for an injury resulting from defective machinery unless the negligence of plaintiff contributed to the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The words \u201csafe machinery,\u201d in the connection used, would mean machinery so perfect that it could be used without danger resulting from any defect in it, and the law does not make it incumbent on railway companies or other employers to provide such machinery, but to use ordinary care to avoid such defects as may expose employes to danger while using it with ordinary care. If it be contended that the word \u201creasonably\u201d should be held to qualify the words under consideration, we are of opinion that such was not the intention, and that the jury could not so have understood the charge. This is illustrated by the following part of the charge intended to apply the law to the facts of the case. That part of the charge in effect informed the jury that they would find for the plaintiff if \u2018 said hand car had a defective wheel; and further, that said defective wheel was the cause of the injury to plaintiff\u201d unless his own negligence contributed to the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The hand car may have been defective and the injury may have resulted from that, without contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff, and the defendant still not be liable if it had used that degree of care in reference to the hand car which the law required of it, and whether it had done so should have been left to the determination of the jury under a proper charge, instead of one which informed the jury that liability would exist if the machinery was defective and injury resulted therefrom in the absence of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">It is unnecessary to discuss the other assignments of error, but for the errors referred to .the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Delivered October 23, 1891.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
