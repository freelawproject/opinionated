Mrs. R. was to keep the girl for a year, and was to give her victuals and clothes for her services. Some time in May, 1810, Mrs. R. removed to Washington, and brought the petitioner with her, whether with or without the permission of Mr: Ball, is entirely uncertain. It was probably, though not certainly, with his knowledge. In October, 1810, Mr. Ball married, and soon after took the petitioner into his possession; and carried her home, he then residing in Virginia; . Mrs.\u2019 R. gave her up, being of opinion, though the girl had remained \u00a1with her only seven.or eight months, that she was. bound to give her up when required by her master. Mr. B; afterwards rempved himself into the city, and brought the petitioner with him. 'Upon this'testimony the;counsel for the petitioner prayed the court below to instruct the jury, that if they <em>her</em>lieved, from the evidence,- that the defendant knew of the intended importation of the petitioner by Mrs. R., and did not object to it; then, such importation entitled the petitioner to her freedom; and, further, that it was competent to the jury to infer, from' his knowing of the importation, and not objecting to it, that such importation was made with his- consent. This instruction the Court refused.to give; but did instruct the jury -that if they should be of opinion that Mrs. R. was, at the time she brought the petitioner into the city of Washington, a citizen of the United States coming into the city of Washington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>with <em>abona fide </em>intention of settling-therein, then her importation of said slave was' lawful, and did not entitle the petitioner to her freedom, whether the said importation were or were not made with the consent of the defendant. An exception was taken to this opinion, and the jury having found a verdict for the defendant, on which judgment was rendered by the court, the cause was brought into this court by' writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-8\">Key, for the plaintiff in error, and petitioner, cited</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY\">the act of the assembly of Maryland, of 1796, c. 67 s. 1, 2., contending, that its'true construction applied only te <em>bona fide </em>owners, and pot to bailees or hirers.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-9\">Law, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG\">stated, that the domiicil of the owner had been in Virginia, and that she was a <em>bona fide </em>emigrant from that state.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">delivered the opinion of the court, and after stating the facts, proceeded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">This cause depends \u25a0 on an act of the - state of Maryland, which is in force, in the county pf Washington. The first, section of that statute enacts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u201c that it shall not be lawful to bring into this state any negro, mulatto, or other slave, for sale, or to reside within this state ; and any person brought into this state contrary to this act, if a slave before, shall, thereupon, immediately gease to be the property of the person or persons so importing or bringing such slaves within this state,, and shall be free.\u201d The 2d section contains a proviso in favour of citizens of the United States coming into this state with a <em>bona fide </em>inten? tion of settling therein, and bringing slaves with thenp The 4th section enacts, that \u201cnothing in this act contained shall be construed or taken to affect the right of any person or persons travelling op sojor ming with any slave or slayes within this state, such slave or slaves not being sold or otherwise disposed of in this state, but carried by the owner out pf the state, or attempted to be carried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">This act appears tt&gt; the court not to comprehend the case'- now under consideration. The expressions of that part of the first section which prohibits the importation of slaves, are restricted to cases of importation \u201c for sale or to reside in this state.\u201d The petitioner was obviously not imported for sale, nor is the court of opinion that the short time, for which she was to continue with Mrs. Rankin can satisfy the words, \u201c to reside within this state.\u201d The legislature must have intended to prohibit a general residence, pot a special limited residence, where the slave is to remain for that portion of the year for which she was hired that still remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">If on this point the first section of the act could be thought doubtful, the fourth section seems to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>prove that doubt. It declares that \u201c nothing in the act. contained shall be construed or taken to aflfect the right of any person travelling or <em>sojourning </em>with any slave' or slaves within this state, such' slave or slaves not being sold or otherwise disposed of in this state, but carried by. the owner out of this state, or attempted to be carried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-3\">This section sufficiently. explains the. residence contemplated by the legislature in the first section. The term <em>sojourning, </em>means something more than \u201c travelling,\u201d and applies to a temporary, as contra-distinguished from apermanent, residence. The court is also of opinion* that the act contemplates and punishes an importation or bringing into the state by the master or owner of. the. slave. This cons truer tion, in. addition to its plain justice, is supported by the words of the first Section. That section declares* that a person brought into this state as a.&amp;laye con-! trary tq this act, if a slave before, shall, thereupon, cease tube the property of the person or persons so importing orbringing such slave within this state, and shall be free.\u201d It is apparent, that the legislature had in view the case of a slave brought by the owner, since it, is the property of the person importing the slave which is forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">Upon the best consideration we have been able to giye this statute, the court is unanimously qf opinion, that the petitioner acquired no right to free.d\u00f3n\u00ed by having been brought into the county of Washington by Mrs. Rankin for one year\u2019s service, she having been in the course of the y\u00e9ar carried back tp Virginia by her master,</p>\n<p id=\"AqE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The circuit court appears, to have considered the case as coming, within the proviso of the 2d section. \u00b0Fni\u00b0n court wfere even to be thought mistaken, the error does not injure the petitioner, and is, therefore, no cause for reversal. The court is unanimously of opinion, that the judgment aught ta be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
