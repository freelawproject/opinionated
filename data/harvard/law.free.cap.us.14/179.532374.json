These causes comebefore the court upon appeals from the circuit court of the district, of Columbia, for the county of Alexandria. The material facts upon which the questions now to be decided arise, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">Hepburn &amp; Dundas being indebted to John Dun-lop .&amp; Co., of Great Britain, on account of certain mercantile dealings which had taken place between those parties, t;he precise amount whereof was disputed, an agreement in writing was entered into on the 27th of September, 1799, between the said Hepburn' &amp; Dundas, and Colin Auld, the attorney in fact of John Dunlop &amp; <em>Co.; </em>whereby it was stipulated that the parties mutually agreed to submit all matters in dispute, respecting the demand of Dunlop &amp; Co., to certain arbitrators named in the agreement, whose award should be made on or before the 1st day of January following. That Auld, as the agent, of Dunlop &amp; Co., would, on the next day, to wit, the 2d day of January, 1800, accept, from Hepburn &amp; Dundas, the sum which should be awarded to Dunlop &amp; Co., in bills of exchange, or in Virginia currency, at the par of <em>exchange; </em>and upon such payment being made in either Way, that Auld would give to Hepburn &amp; Dundas a full, receipt and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>discharge of all the claims and demands of Dunlop &amp; Co. against them .; that, in case Hepburn &amp; Dundas should not, , on the said 2d day of January, pay the amount of the said award, either in bills of exchange or money, they should, on that day. assign to Auld, as attorney of Dunlop &amp; Co., in the fullest tnanner, a contract entered into in the, year 1796, by Hepburn &amp; Dundas, with a certain William Graham, for the sale of 6,000 acres of land lying on the river Ohio, for the recovery of which, on account of the non-payment of the ' purchase money by Graham,. H\u00e9pburn &amp; Dundas had brought an ejectment, which was then depending; that this assignment should be accompanied-by a'power of attorney irrevocable, to enable the ,sa?d Auld to pursue all legal means to recover the possession of the land, or to enforce the payment of 18,000 dollars, the amount of the purchase money, whichever of these measures Auld might prefer. Hepburn &amp; Dundas farther stipulated not' to interfere with the measures which Auld might choose to pursue for the recovery of the land or the purchase money, and, farther, that whenever any. suit brought, or to be brought, for the land, should be judicially determined, or otherwise settled, by an amicable compromise, Hepburn &amp;. Dundas would convey the same to the person whoi by such determination or compromise, should be acknowledged to be entitled to it in the manner expressed in the contract with Graham. It was also stipulated, that if the purchase money for the said land, with interest thereon to the 2d of January, 1800, should be insufficient to discharge the. sum which might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>awarded to Dunlop &amp; Co., Hepburn &amp; Dundas should, on that day, pay to Auld as much moncv as should make up the <em>deficiency; </em>and if, on the other hand, the said pur,chase money and interest should fall short of the sum awarded, that Auld would, o\u00fc the same day, pay to Hepburn <em>&amp; </em>Dundas the excess over and above the sum awarded. Lastly, it was stipulated, that if Auld should recover the land, and be enabled to sell the same for more than was allowed to Hepburn &amp; Dundas, by the said agreement, together with the costs and expenses attending the recovery, Auld should pay to Hepburn &amp;. Dundas the expenses incurred in prosecuting the suit commenced by them for the recovery of this land. In pursuance of these articles, an award was made by the day mentioned,in the submission, which award stated, that the stun of 4,379Z. 9s. - O^c/;, sterling, including interest, would be due to Dunlop &amp; Co, on the 1st day-of January, 1800. . This sum fell short of the purchase money and interest, due by Graham to the same period, the sum of 494/. 6s. 8c/., Virginia currency. . Hepburn &amp; Dundas having prepared a deed of assignment of Graham\u2019s contract,1 and a power of attorney, as stipulated in the above-mentioned agreement, offered to deliver the same tp Auld on the 2d of January, 1800, which he refused to accept, because the deed recited, as a part of the consideration, that a release had been executed by Auld, of all the claims and demands whatsoever of Dunlop &amp; Co. against Hepburn &amp; Dundas, and' because, as is asserted by Auld, Hepburn <em>&amp; </em>Dundas required Auld to execute such a release prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>delivery of the deed of assignment. The suit of Hepburn &amp; Dundas against Graham, for the recovery of the 6,000 acres of land, was prosecuted , against his heirs; and in May, 1801, by a compr\u00f3-? mise between Hepburn &amp; Dundas, and the defendants in the ejectment, judgment was rendered in favour of Hepburn &amp; Dundas.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">' Without noticing, particularly, the conduct of those parties subsequent to the transactions. of the 2d of January, 1800, as well as on that day, it may be sufficient to say, that if the tender made by Hepburn &amp; Dundas was, upon the condition asserted by Auld, to have, been annexed to it, and if, in consequence thereof, any legal advantage accrued to him, it was waived by, his subsequent conduct, As late as February! 1807, Auld made a tender of the difference between, the sum awarded to Dunlop &amp; Co., and the purchase money and interest due upon Gra - ham\u2019s contract, and demanded a deed; but this demand was made in a manner, and under circumstances, which this court, upon a former occasion, deemed unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Things remained in this situation, until some time, about April, 1801, when Hepburn &amp; Dundas instituted a suit at law against Auld, for the difference, between the sum awarded to Dunlop &amp; Co.\u2019 and the amount of the purchase money and interest due by Graham\u2019s contract, on the 2d of January, 1800. About the same time a suit at law was commenced by Auld, against Hepburn &amp; Dundas, upon, the agreement of the 27 th, of September, 1799, tore-cover the whple \u00a1?um. awarded. In., the first case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>this court, upon a writ of error, decided upon the pleadings, (which were so drawn as to present the point,) that. Hepburn and Dundas had no right to demand of Auld a release of all claims and demands against Dunlop &amp; Co., to be executed as a precedent act to the assignment of Graham\u2019s contract, and the delivery of the power of attorney; and, on that ground, judgment was rendered against Hepburn &amp; Dundas.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In the other case,. the pleadings presented the question, whether the recital of such a release in the deed of assignment offered to be deliver\u00e9d by Hepburn &amp; Duhdas, invalidated the tender? Upon a writ of error, it was decided, by this court, that the. recital of the release could not Impair the rights of Dun-lop <em>&amp; </em>Co., under the agreement of September, 1799, and that it formed no objection to the assignment; consequently, that the tender and refusal amounted to a performance, in like manner as if. Auld had accepted the 'assignment; but that Hepburn &amp; Dundas would still be obliged to execute a proper deed of assignment, and a conveyance of the land, whenever they should be required to do so. Judgment was, accordingly, rendered in this suit against Auld.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Hepburn &amp; Dundas having been thus. defeated in their attempt at law, to enforce a performance of the agreement, filed a bill in equity, praying-for a specific performance. The answer of Auld contained, amongst other objections to .a specific performance', an allegation that the title of Hepburn &amp; Dundas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>to the land was defective. Hepb\u00fcrn &amp;. Dundas then set forth th\u00e9ir title in a supplemental bill. ' This suit came on to be heard, upon an appeal to this' court, at the same time that Auld\u2019g suit at law against Hepburn &amp; Dundas, above' mentioned, -was decided, This court determined, 1st. That since Auld-had, by his conduct subsequent to the 2d of January, 1800, waived all objections to the tender of the assignment of Graham\u2019s contract on that day, and did riot refuse to receive a conveyance which Was offered to be made by Hepburn &amp; Dundas, in June, 1801, bn account of any defect in the title, but for other reasons which would equally have Operated with him had there been no such defect, Hepburn &amp; Dundas would still be entitled to a specific performance if they could then make a good title. 2dly. That the title appeared by the bills to be defective as to 20, acres, being Thomas West\u2019s part of Mrs. Bronaugh\u2019s 1,000 acr\u00e9s, arid also his part of Fraricina Turner\u2019*) interest -in the same tract, and also on account of the failure to record Thomas West\u2019s deed to Hepburn &amp; Dundas for 1,000 acres. For these defects in the title,' the bill was dismissed.<footnotemark>c</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\">Presuming that this decree, which seemed to close for ever the doors of a court of equity against Hepburn &amp; Dundas, opened them to Dunlop &amp; Co. to get rid of the contract altogether, Auld filed the bill which' is now under consideration, stating, amongst other things, the -previous and present inability of Hepburn &amp; Dundas, to make a good title to this. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>land ; and praying that the agreement may be set aside, and the debt awarded to Dunlop &amp; 'Co., with the interest thereon, to be decreed; or, that, if the court should consider Dufalop &amp; Co. under an obligation to accept of the land; that only the reasonable value of the land at the time when Hepburn &amp; Dun* das\u2019s title to it was perfected, should be allowed. The bill, also, contains the general prayer for such relief as is consistent with equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Hepburn &amp; Dundas seem to have given a very different construction to the above decree, and supposing that if, within a reasonable time after it was pronounced, they could remove the objections to their title which were pointed out in the decree, they might still call for a specific performance, they soon obtained a conveyance from the heirs of Thomas West, of all their\u2019right, title, and interest, in and to this land,, and on the 27th of March, 1809, less than a month after the decree of dismission by this court, they offered to convey to Auld a good and sufficient title. This offer being refused, Hepburn &amp; Dundas'filed a bill against Colin A\u00fald, as attorney of Dunlop &amp; Co., getting forth their ability and readiness to convey an unexceptionable title to this land, and praying that Auld, or Dunlop &amp; Co., might be compelled to accept of a conveyance, and to pay the difference between the agreed value of the land and the sum awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">These suits came on to be heard at the same time. In the suit brought by Dunlop &amp; Co., against Hepburn &amp; Dundas, it was, decreed by the court below that Hepburn and the heirs of Dundas should p\u00e1y to Dunlop &amp;.Co., or their agent, the sum of 33,060 dollars 37 cents, being the amount of the sum award\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ed, with.interest thereon, at five per cent., from the 1st January, 1800, till the.time of rendering the decree; but that the sum of .21,112 dollars, part thereof, might-be discharged by a conveyance, .within a certain time, of the above land to Auld in trust for Dunlop <em>&amp; </em>Co. From this decree an appeal was prayed by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">In the other suit, brought by Hepburn &amp; Dundas against \u25a0 Auld, a decree, was made, that up\u00f3h the complainant\u2019s paying to Auld, as attorney of Dunlop &amp; Co., the sum of 11,966 dollars 37 cents, and conveying to the said Auld, in trust for Dunlop &amp; Co., On. of before a certain day, the above-mentioned land, the said Auld, as attorney of said Diinlop &amp; Co., should execute and deliver to Hepburn &amp; Dundas such, a receipt and discharge of all the claims and demands of Dunlop &amp; Co. against them as the court might approve. From this decree both sides agaip \u2022 Appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Against so much of these decrees as -compel Auld to accept of a conveyance in trust for Ddnlop &amp; Co.,in part discharge of the debt decreed to be\u2019paid by Hepburn &amp; Dundas to Dunlop &amp; Co., <em>the </em>following objections-have -been made, and are now to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">1st., That- Hepb\u00fcrn &amp; Dundas were, guilty of a fraudulent misrepresentation of . the value of this <em>land; </em>and, also, of a wilful concealment of the defects in the title, whereby Auld was induced to enter into the agreement of September, 1799.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">2d. A want of authority in Colin Auld to enter into an agreement for taking a conveyance of land in discharge of the debt due to Dunlop &amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>3d. The refusal of Hepburn &amp; Dundas to assign Graham?s contract, on the 2d of January, 1800, ex-&gt; cept upon a condition which they had. no right to exact, and their interference in the suit with Graham\u2019s heirs* and the compromise made with them, wlierfeby (it is'contended) they disabled,, themselves from executing the agreement of. September, 1799.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">4th. That the title to the land is yet defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">5th. That the former decree, dismissing Hepburn <em>&amp; </em>Dundas\u2019s bill for a specific performance, is, a perpetual bar to the relief sought by their present bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">6th. That. Dunlop &amp; Co. being aliens, and incapable of holding lands .in Virginia, a court of equity will not compel them to. execute their agreement, even if. Hepburn &amp; Dundas had .been always in a condition to perform it on their part.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">1. The first objection appears to be unsupported, by the evidence. In respect to the value of the.land, the representations made of it in the letters of Hepburn &amp; Dundas to Dunlop &amp; Co., and to Colin Auld, affirm no fact which is proved to be untrue. Those letters contain expressions of the opinion of Hepburn &amp; Dundas, that the land was an ample security for the debt due to Dunlop &amp; <em>Co.; </em>and it must be admitted, that in their letter to Colin Auld of the 6th. of Septemb\u00e9r, 1799, they seem to have indulged themselves in very extravagant notions of its valu\u00e9. But it is to be remarked that the grounds of this calculation are fairly stated in the letter, and an opportunity is afforded to Auld to inquire, into them and to judge for himself: besides which, it should be recoll\u00e9cted that Auld having agreed, in his letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>of the 4th of September,, two days before the date of this letter* to submit to the award of arbitrators, \u2022 ' and to receive ah assignment qf Graham\u2019s contract at. the stipulated sum to be paid by Graham, Hep-bum &amp; Dundas could have had no motive, at that time, to make, an untrue representation of the value \u2022 of the land. At no antecedent period does it appear that they had made an u\u00f1candid statement, upon this subject, to Dunlop &amp; Co., of to Auld. Their opinion of the real value of the property might be incorrect j but a mistaken opini\u00f3n of. the value of the property, if honestly entertained, and stated as Opinion merely, unaccompanied by an assertion, or statement, untrue in fact, can never be considered as a fraudulent misrepresentation. That Hepburrf, &amp; Dundas intended no deception, is. evident from the following considerations: 1. That the offer made by them, to Colin Auld, of this land, was that of .a se-, curity only, for the debt due to Dunlop &amp; C\u00f3., which was\u2019declined by Auld, upon the grourid, that if payment of the debt to Dunlop &amp; Co. w\u00e1s to be postponed until the suit with Graham should be concluded, Dunlop &amp; Co. ought to be entitled to all the benefit of the contract with Graham, and for this reason, a proposition was made by 'him to accept an assignment of that contract, and to pay the difference between the purchase money and interest thereon, and the sum which might be awarded,. in case the latter should fall short of the former. 2. That Hepburn &amp; Dundas had, in the year 1796, sold this land to Graham for the sum at which Auld agreed to take it, and-as evidence of their opinion, that the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>land had;, since that, sale, risen in value, they'had instituted a suit at law against Graham in order to avoid the sale, and. to recover back the land. If any farther answer to this-objection be necessary, it may be sufficient to add, that the fraud now charged against Hepburn &amp; Dundas was not thought of, and certainly not' imputed to them, when the former suit of Hepburn <em>&amp; </em>Dundas, for a specific, performance, was depending.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">As to the alleged concealment by H\u00e9pburn <em>&amp; </em>Dundas of defects in their title,.there is every r\u00e9ason to believe that they were unknown to them until some time in the year 1805, when they endeavoured to remove them, and supposed they had. done so. The only objection suggested by the special verdict in the ejectment, was the want of a partition deed between- the original grantees of this land, which objection this court has declared to be- insufficient to bar Hepburn &amp; Dundas from asking/ for a specific performance of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">2. The next objection to the decree, below is, that Auld had no authority, in virtue of the power of at- \u25a0 torney from Dunlop <em>&amp; </em>Coi, to enter into an agreement to receive ]and in discharge of the debt due by Hepburn &amp; Dundas.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">This, like the former, is a new objection, no* thought of, or argued, as a reason against a specific performance in the former suit, it is unnecessary to examine, with critic\u00e1l nicety, the import of the expressions- used in the power of attorney to Auld. He was empowered to sue for,, and to compound and agree, for all debts due to Dunlop <em>6^ </em>Co., and,.in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>general, to do all other lawful acts; needful for those purposes, as fully as Dunlop &amp; Co. could do. Under this authority, he entered into the agreement with Hepburn <em>&amp; </em>Dundas, which, there is no reason to doubt, he communicated in due time to his constituents, and it is perfectly fair to consider their acquiescence in that agreement as amounting to a ratification of it. It would be-most inequitable to permit Dunlop <em>&amp; </em>Co., at the distance of many years after this agreement was made, to controvert the authority of their agent, and to say they are not bound to perform, it, although it must be admitted that, during all that time, it was'in their power to enfprce it against Hepburn &amp; Dundas, had it been their wish or interest to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\">3. The third objection to the decrees below., is the refusal of Hepburn <em>&amp; </em>Dundas to assign Graham\u2019s contract on the 2d January, 1800, except upon a condition which he had no right to exact, and their interference in the suit with Graham\u2019s heirs, and the compromise made with them. In answer to the different parts of this objection, it might be sufficient to remark, that they were urged by Colin Aiild in his answer to Hepburn &amp; Dundas\u2019s former bill; that they were considered by this court, and decided to be insufficient to deprive Hepburn &amp; Dundas of the, relief prayed for. However true the allegation may be, that Hepburn &amp; Dundas refused to assign Gr\u00e1ham\u2019s contract, and to deliver the power of attorney to Auld on the 2d of January, 1800, unless Auld would first execute a release of all claims and demands of Dunlop &amp; Co. against Hepb\u00farn &amp; Dundas, yet the subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>q\u00fa\u00e9nt conduct of Auld amounted to a waiver of .all objections on that account: his, and his counsel\u2019s* letters to Edward Graham, in which he was assert-<footnotemark>e</footnotemark>d to be the assignee of the contract with Graham; his instructions to Cook to attend to' the ejectment, and to get it brought, to a speedy decision; his engaging counsel in that suit; and, in short, his whole conduct throughout the year 1800, all tend to prove, that the transaction of the. 2d of January,. 1800, \u2019had not, in any manner, impaired the rights of the parties under <em>the </em>agreement now alleged to have been violated by Hepburn <em>&amp; </em>Dundas.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">As to the compromise said to have been made by Hepburn &amp; Dundas with the claimants under Graham, their conduct,. upon that occasion, appears to have been unexceptionable. That a judgment against those claimants, at an early day, was anxiously desired by Auld, and the assistance of Hepburn <em>&amp; </em>Dundas, to effect that object, was expected and required by him, is apparent, from the above letters from him to Edward Graham, and from many other facts' proved in the <em>former </em>suit. The endeavours of. Auld <em>to </em>hasten the decision of- the ejectment, and to obtain a judgment, for the land, seem to have been unremitting, until some time in December, 1800, when he declined interfering any farther in the business- ; but, neither then, nor at any subsequent period, did he express to Hepburn &amp; Dundas a disin-\"\" clination to obtain a judgment, nor did he forbid them from proceeding to effect it. It is objected, under this head,, that Hepburn &amp; Dundas, contrary to an express stipulation in the agreement with Auld, re-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>leased to the defendants in the ej\u00e9ctment the right Which, as trustee, for Auld, they had \u00a1 to demand mesne profits during the time fh at Hepburn <em>&amp; </em>Dundas had been out of possession of the land; and, farther, that they, consented to permit-those deferid,antsi to retain possession of the premises for a year after the judgment Was rendered.- Neither of these \u2019allegations are supported By the .evidence in the cause. The agreement made by Hepburn &amp; Dundas with the heirs of Graham, in relation to the <em>costs of </em>the suit and the mesne profits, disavows, in the most explicit terms, all power in them, and all intention to release either of those claims, but stipulates to indemnity those defendants against these claims, in case they should b\u00e9 made and enforced by Auld, who is declared to be alone entitled to make them. This- contract of indemnity, therefore, did not amount to a release, nor did it impair the rights of Dunlop &amp; Co. under their agreement with Hepburn &amp; Dundas. As to the remainder of this objection, it is founded altogether upon the deposition of Mr. Sheffey, the counsel for Graham\u2019s heirs, which, as it 'is explained by the same witness in a subsequent deposition, proves no more, than that such a proposition had been made by Edward Graham to Mr. Hepburn. . That it was not accepted by him, is manifest by the judgment itself, which is unconditional, as well as by an agreement made between Hepburn &amp; Dundas and Edward Graham, the day after the judgment was entered,</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">4. The next objection is, that the title of Hep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>burn &amp; Dundas to this land, or to some part thereof is still.defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">In the opinion given by this court, at February term, 1809, in the suit brought by Hepburn &amp; Dundas, fora specific performance, the title was declared to be unexceptionable except, 1st. As to 208 acres, being the part of Sarah Bronaugh\u2019s 1,000 acres, to which Thomas West was entitled as one of the heirs of Mrs.. Bronaugh, and Of Francina Turner, and, ,2dly. As to 1,000 acres, the original share of Thomas West, which had b'een conveyed by him' to Hepburn &amp; Dundas by a deed which had not been recorded. These defects. have since been cured by a conveyance to Hepburn &amp; Dundas by the heirs of Thomas West, bearing date the 20th of March, 1809, of all their title to the aforesaid parcels. of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">. It.is,- nevertheless, contended, that' this' conveyance is insufficient to pass a clear and undisputed title inasmuch as the land may be bound by the claims of creditors, or of purchasers subsequent to the deed from Thomas West to Hepburn &amp; Dundas. The answer given at the bar to these suggestions is en-, tircly satisfactory to the court. If the land be exposed to the claims of subsequent purchasers or 'mortgagees under West,. to be effectual against Hepburn &amp; Dundas, the deeds must have been recorded within eight months after the death of West, at the latest period, either in the. general court, or in the district or. county court where the land lies.. Had any such, deeds been so recorded, it was in the power of Auld to have proved the fact by the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>cords of some one of those courts, and the want of such proof destroys all presumption that any such \u25a0 \u25a0 , conveyances were.nlad.e.</p>\n<p id=\"Amd\">As to judgments against West, they too must be of record; and, after a lapse of 10, years since,his death, the co.urt cannot presume the existence of such judgments. As to specialties in' which'-the heirs of West are bound, if there be such, which is not proved, they cannot affect this land in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser under those heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">5. The next objection made to the decrees below, is, that the dismission of the former bill of Hepburn &amp; Dundas, for. a specific -performance, is a bar to their present bill for the same object. This objection is well founded. If a bill, by the vendor of land, seeking a specific performance of the contract, be dismissed on account of a defect in the title, the doors of a court of equity are, and ought to be, for ever closed against him, notwithstanding he should, afterwards, have it in his power to make a good title; unless, perhaps, in a case where an original bill, in the nature of a bill of review, might be entertained. But the present bill is not founded upon new matter,' discovered since the hearing of the former cause, and which it -was not in the power of Hepburn &amp; Dundas to produce at that time. It is not pretended that he was ignorant who were the heirs of Thomas West, or that he could not as well have procured a deed from them before, as after the former decree. His ignorance was not of a matter of feet, but of law. He erroneously supposed that his .title was good, and on account of the defects existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>in it, at the .time of the decree, his bill; was dismissed. The rule of the court of equity to decree a specific performance, if the vendor is able to make a good title befoi\u2019\u00e9 the decree is. pronounced, is an indulgence which he is not entitled to by the .terms of his contract. A majority of this court approves of the rule as a general one, but is not disposed to extend it as such. If, in a case peculiarly circumstanced, an extension of the time for completing the title would be proposed, and should be intended to be granted, the court would either continue the cause, in order to give the vendor time to perfect his title, or would dismiss the bill without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\">The questions, then, which remain to be .decided,, are, 1st. Whether Dunlop &amp; Co. are entitled to the relief for which they specifically prayed ? and if not, then, 2dly. Are they entitled to any other, and what relief, under the general prayer in their bill?</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">1st. The relief specifically prayed for consists of two parts, 1st. That the agreement of September, 1,799, may be rescinded, and the sum awarded, with interest, decreed to be paid. If this should be de-. nied, and Dunlpp &amp; Co..be compelled to receive, a conveyance of the land, then, 2dly. That the reasonable value only of the land at the time .when the title was perfected should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">As to the 1st. Most of the objections which' have been urged against the decrere of the court below, for a specific performance, <em>were </em>relied upon by the counsel for Dunlop &amp; Co., as sufficient to set aside the contract. These have already been considered;, and the result has been shown -to be, that, if the bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>of Hepburn <em>&amp;, </em>Dundas, for a specific performance, were unaffected by the dismission of their former bill, none of these objections would be sufficient to preclude them from the relief sought by their present bill, 'If so, they are insufficient to enable Dun-lop &amp; Co. to obtain a decree to rescind the contract. There are many cases in which a court of equity, although it would not dec\u00edee a specific performance, will yet refuse to order a contract to be cancelled. The inability of the vendor to make a good title at' the time the decree is to be pronounced, furnishes a very good reason for excluding him from relief in a court of equity; and yet it does not follow that the court will, for this reason merely, set aside the .con-, tract. Generally speaking, a court of law is competent to afford an adequate remedy to either party, for a breach of the contract by th\u00e9 other, from whatever\u2019 cause it m\u00e1y have <em>proceeded; </em>and whenever this is the case, a resort to a court of equity is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">But if the contract o\u00faght not, in conscience, to bind one of the parties, as if he had acted under a mistake, or was imposed upon by the other party, or the like, a court of equity will interpose and- afford a relief, which a court of common law cannot, by setting aside the contract j and having thus ob-. tained jurisdiction of the principal question, that, court will proceed to make such other decree as. the justice, and equity of the case may require. Whether inability in the vendor to make a title, is, of itself, unattended by some peculiar circumstances of hardship, sufficient to justify the court in. setting aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the contract, need not now be decided. This is certainly not a case where, the exercise of this branch of equity jurisdiction can be fairly demanded' by Dunlop &amp; Co. .Within a month after the recovery of the judgment against the heirs of Graham, Hepburn &amp; Dundas tendered to Colin Auld a conveyance-of the land, which was refused, not on account of any defect in the title, but for reasons which ..would \u00e9qually have operated with him had there been nor such defect. Immediately after the defects in the title were pointed out by this court, they were re-mo, ed, and the conveyance of an unexceptionable title was tendered and refused. Had Hepburn &amp; Dundas been in a condition to make. such a title a month sooner, this court, instead of dismissing their bill, would have decreed a specific performance. Under such circumstances it would be inequitable to set aside the contract. The alienage of the com-, plainaots is urged as an additional reason.for setting aside this contract. Although\" the incapacity of the purchaser to hold land might afford a reason for denying a specific performance upon the prayer of Hepburn &amp;; Dundas, (a point, however, not intended, to be decided,) it is certainly insufficient to entitle the vendor, Under the circumstances of this .case, to a decree to \u201crescind the contract. But the court does not mean to intimate an opinion that the terms of this contract did. expose this land to the danger which is apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">It appears by the contract* and the previous correspondence between these parties, that they contemplated a sale of. this land, in- the event of the eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>tract with Graham being rescinded, and that the proceeds thereof should, b\u00e9 paid oyer to Auld, in discharge of so much of the debt due by Hepburn &amp; Dundas to Dunlop-&amp; Co., as the purchase money due by Graham, with interest thereon to .the 1st of January, 1800, .would amount t\u00f3; and this whether the land should sell for more or less than that sum. In this view of the case, the land was considered as a security for a stipulated sum, and Hepburn &amp; Dundas were constituted trustees for whoever might become the purchasers of it. A conveyance to Auld or to Dunlop &amp; Co. does not appear to have been contemplated. But if, in point of law, it should be true that Auld, by neglecting, to proceed against Graham's representatives for . the recovery\u2019of the land, in the name of Hepburn Dundas, separated the interests of his constituents, this can surely afford n\u00f3 sound reason for setting aside the contract. It is-sufficient if Hepburn &amp; Dundas are able and ready to make a conveyance when they shall be required to dctso. ' .</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">2d. The other specific relief prayed for, is, that Hepburn &amp; Dundas may . be credited on account , of the land. for no more than its real value in March, 1809, when a conveyance was tendered and refiised. A decree, of this sort would be an anomaly in the jurisprudence of \u00e1 court of equity. It would be an affectation of decreeing a. specific p\u00e9rformance contrary, to the terms of the contract upon which the decree is to operate. It would be, in fact, to make a contract for the parties altogether different from what they had made for themselves, and h\u00e9n to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Cree an execution of it. There is no precedent, and certainly no principle of equity to sanction such, a decree. Either the contract of the parties must be executed according to the terms of it, or it cannot' be executed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The only remaining question, then, is, whether, under the general prayer, the court can grant any, and what relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">There can be no question but that it is competent to Dunlop &amp; Co., to ask for a specific performance of the agreement, so far as it can now be performed, ..although the court, cannot listen to a similar prayer from Hepburn &amp; Dundas. But this is not the relief specifically stated in this bill; and it is supposed to be unreasonable to compel a specific, performance under the general prayer for relief, in opposition to the specific prayer that the contract may be set aside. To this objection, it may well be answered, that if it be improper to rescind, or to modify, the contract, nothing remains to be done, under th\u00e9 general prayer, but to dismiss the bill, or to decree an, execution of the contract. But, as the former cannot be presumed to be the object of the general prayer, it would seem to follow that an execution of the contract was intended to be asked for,, in case the specific relief should be denied. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">For these reasons the court will decree \u00e1 specific performance, so far as it is practicable^ and considering Hepburn &amp; Dundas as trustees for the person \u2022 or persons to whom this land may be sold, the conveyance will be decreed to be made tb such persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>as may become the purchasers of the land under the decree of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The residue of the decree below, which allows to th\u00e9 complainants, Dunlop &amp; Co., interest upon the slim awarded from the 1st of January, 1800, to the time of the decree, is objected to by Hepburn &amp; Dundas, upon the ground that the purchaser of land, to whom neither a conveyance has been made, or possession delivered, is to be considered in equity as the owner, and, of course, entitled to the rents and profits; and that the right of the vendor to the purchase money draws after it a correspondent right to demand interest upon the same until it is paid. This, it must be acknowledged, is the general principle which prevails in the courts of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">But it would seem to be inequitable to apply it to a case like the present. Here the purchase money was in the hands of the vendor at the time the contract was made. It consisted of a debt due by the vendor to the purchaser, which the former bound himself, by his agreement, to discharge by bills of exchange or cash,, or by an assignment of a contract for land, and a conveyance of a good title to it, and with money to make up any deficiency which might arise by the agreed price of the land falling short of the debt. Neither bills nor cash were paid, nor was the contract assigned, or a conveyance made, for it turned out that the vendor could not make a good title to\" the whole of the land until March, 1809. They have always retained pos.session, and the land is, in reality, unproductive of profits in any measure equal to the. interest on the ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>debt. This debt unquestionably bore interest from the moment it was ascertained and agreed.to be paid; and not having been paid, nor a,tender qi a good title to the land made, until March; 1809, it would be highly unjust to stop interest on the debt,, until that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\">The written arguments of the counsel, which have been sent'to the cohrt, present two questions in re?, lation to interest, which remain to be noticed. It is contended, by the .counsel for Dunlop &amp; Co., that interest ought to'be calculated upon, the sum composed of principal ana interest, stated, by the arbitrators, to be due on the 1st of January, 1800, at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, from that day. On the other side it is insisted that no-more than 5 per cent, per annum should be allowed, and this not op the suit found by the arbitrators to be due, but upon the principal sum only.</p>\n<p id=\"A5K\">The court is of opinion; that, although the award .does pot direct the. sum which is found to be due, by Hepburn &amp; Dundas <em>to be paid </em>to-Dunlop &amp;-Co., yet it ascertains the sum which was due' 'on the 1st of January, 1800, and the agreement, upon which the submission .was made bound Hepb\u00farn &amp; Dundas to pay that sum. when it should be so ascertained. The two instruments, taken together, amount to a contract to pay a specific sum, and are clearly within the words, as well as the fair interpretation of the law of Virginia, passed in the1 year 1796, which fixed the rate of interest at 6 per, cent., per annum. This principle being settled, it follows. that, the interest must be calculated upon the sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ascertained by the award td. be due on the 1st of January, .1810. To separate the principal .from the interest, even if the award furnished materials for such an operation, would be, in effect, to set aside, the award, and to vary the agreement with which it is, intimately connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\">It. is therefore the opinion of the court, that Hepburn &amp; Dundas ought to pay interest upon the sum awarded by the arbitrators, after the rate of 6 per Cent, per annum, from the 1st of January, 1800, to the 27th of March,. 1809, when they were .able to make, and did in fact tender, a good and sufficient conveyance to the agent of Dunlop &amp; Co. From the 27,th of March, 1809, interest ought to stop; hut Hepburn &amp; Dundas ought to account with Dunlop &amp; Co,, for the rents and profits of the 6,000 acres of land from that period to the time of rendering this decree.<footnotemark>d</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9Q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Decree. \u2014 These causes came on to be heard this 8th day of February* 1816, on the transcript of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>records, and were argued by counsel, whereupon, it is decreed and ordered, that the decree of the k . circuit court of the district of Columbia for the county of Alexandria, in the suit of William Hepburn and the heirs and executors of John Dundas against Colin Auld, agent and attorney in fact for John Dunlop &amp; Co., be reversed and annulled,..and this c\u00f3\u00fcrt, proceeding to give such \u2022 decree as the said circuit court ought to have given, it is further ordered and decreed that the said bill be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayi\">And it is further decreed and ordered, that the decree in the suit of John Dunlop &amp; Ce. against William Hepburn and the heirs and executors of John Dundas1 be reyersed, each party paying his own. costs in this court.

It was particularly in' not furnishing an adequate remedy for the breach of contracts; where the spirit of the agreement required a specific performance, that these defects were disclosed. For, except in real actions and ejectment, where the proceedings are <em>in rem, </em>and the actions of detinue and replevin, where the. thing sued for is specifically recovere.d, a court of common law uniformly gives a compensation in money for civil injuries, whether arising <em>ex contractu </em>or <em>ex delictu. </em>This remedy is frequently insufficient to repair the \u2022 injury sus\u00bb tained by the parties, and to place theta in the sanie situation they were in before the breach of the contract. Hence the origin of that jurisdiction, which, although it was long contested by the courts of common law, has at length been firmly established, and maturecf into a regular system. This system is, however, remarkably sub* ject to the exercise of discretion according to the peculiar circumstances of each particular case, But few inflexible rules can therefore be laid down concerning ifo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Among those admitting of the fewest exceptions are the following: \u2014 1st. This equitable jurisdiction extends to all cases where either the res in dispute, or the party, is within the jurisdiction of the court; for it proceeds' <em>in personam </em>as well as in rent, and wherever the land or other thing in controversy is not within its reach, it will compel the specific performance of an agreement by means of its appropriate process acting on the parties. 1 <em>Ves. </em>447. \u2018454. \u2014 2d. A specific performance will not be decreed of an agree-sent Whereupon' damages could not be recovered, at law.

And there are also several other cases of exceptions to this general rule, where, although the agreemont was void at law, a specific performance has been decreed, there being a clear ground for the interference of equity, according to the general' rules of the court, 2 <em>Eq.
