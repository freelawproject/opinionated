Whether- this court has jurisdiction ? 2d. Whether it has been rightly exercised in the present case ?\u25a0 \u2014 1. Cotemporaneous construction, and the uniform practice since the constitution was adopted, confirms the jurisdiction of the court. The authority of all th\u00e9 popular writers who were friendly to it, is to the sam\u00e9 effect; and the letters of <em>Publius </em>show .that it was agreed, both by its friends and foes, that the judiciary power extends to this class of cases. In the conventions, by which the constitution was adopted, itwas'n\u00e9ver denied by its <em>friends </em>that its powers extended as far as its <em>'enemies </em>alleged.' It was admitted, and justified as expedient and necessary. Ascending from these popular and parliamentary authorities, to the more judicial evidence of what is the supreme law of the land, we find \u00e1 concurrence of opinion. This government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>is not a mere confederacy, like the Grecian leagues, or the Germanic constitution, or the old continental confederation. In its legislative, executive, and judicial authorities, it is a national government, to every purpose, within the scope of the objects enumerated in the constitution. Its judicial authority is analagous to its legislative: it alone has the power of making treaties; those treaties are, declared-to be the law of the land ; and the judiciary of the United States is exclusively vested with the power of construing them. The second section* article third, of the constitution provides, that the' judicial power \u201cshall extend to all cases jn law of equity, arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and the treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority,\u201d &amp;c.- The word <em>shall, </em>is' a sign of the future tense, and implies' an imperative mandate, obligatory upon those to whom it is addressed. The verb <em>extend, </em>is said to mean nothing more than <em>may extend; </em>but the neuter verb, and'not the verb active, is used, and imports that the power <em>shall </em>extend \u2014 it shall <em>teach to, </em>or over. \u201c All cases,\u201d is an emphatic expression, and shows that it cannot extend to a limited number of cases. The state legislatures cannot make treaties. Why should the state judicatures be offended at being excluded from the authority of \u2022expounding them ? 2. Has congress exercised the power vested in it according to the constitution ? . If the jurisdiction be exclusive and paramount, it must be exercised according to the discretion of congress, the .constitution having prescribed no specific mode; it must operate upon the people of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>in-their personal and aggregate capacities, upon them and all their magistrates and tribunals. Congress <em>must </em>establish a supreme court. They <em>may </em>establish inferior courts. The-supreme court .must Have the'appellate jurisdiction vested in them by the constitution, and congress cannot denude them of it,,by failing to establish <em>inferior </em>tribunals. Those tribunals may not exist-; and, therefore, the appellate jurisdiction must extend beyond appeals from the courts of the United States only. The state courts \u00e1re to adjudicate under the supreme law of the landas a rule binding upon. them. They do not act upon it as judges determining by a foreign, law, in a case of <em>lex </em>loci, for example; they act upop it as a municipal law of the st\u00e1te where they sit, but derived from the government of .the United .States. 3. As to the remedy of the plaintiffs in error. This court is not limited to a mandate as the only remedy. The judiciary act provides, (section 24.,) that when a-cause has been once remanded, this court may award;a writ of execution upon its own judgment. The eause is now before the court, so as to enable it to do this; the. record is well certified, acceding to the law and practice of Virginia,. and of every pther state, under the seal of the court \u00e1\u00f1d\u201e signature of the clerk. Even supposing it necessary to take a retrospective view, and look at the former record, it originated, and still remains, in this forum, and it is unnecessary to send to the court of appeals for it..</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-3\"><em>Tucker, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT-\">1.-. At common law the Writ of error must be returned by the court itself. It is im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>perfect in this case, and, therefore we have a right to a certiorari, or writ of diminution. . But there is no error; the court of appeals have done nothing; and, thei\u2019efore, there is no error in their proceedings. It.is a mei-e omission to do what they ought to have-done, and no judgment can be rendered here to reverse what they\u2019have not done. This court cannot award execution upon the judgment in the original cause. -That, judgment is final; it is <em>functus officio, </em>and nothing more .can be done with it. The original cause is not brought here again completely, and, therefore, the provision in the 24th section of the judiciary act does not apply. 2. Is the judiciary act constitutional ? This court, undoubtedly, has all thfe incidental powers necessary to cari\u2019y into effect the powers expressly given by the constitution. But this-cannot extend to the exercise , of any power inconsistent with'the whole genius, spirit, and tenor of the constitution. . Neither the practice and acquiescence under it, nor cotemporaneous expositions can apply, because they are contradictory. State courts have refused to execute the penal laws of the United States, and the coui't of appeals ground themselves on the resolutions of the Virginia legislature in 1798; but this court will disregai'd these controversial political party works. .The chief defect of the former confederation was, that it acted on political, and not on natural, persons.. The whole scheme of the constitution aims at acting on the citizens of the United States at large, and not on the state authorities. The philological criticism upon the third article is unsound. <em>Shall </em>is merely a sign of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>fiiture. tense, and not imperative; the laws of the United States havjrig, in some instances, giyen conjoint jurisdiction to the state courts, and upon that argument must be unconstitutional; - \u2018t Extend,\u201d. or \u201c shall extend,\u201d merely imports that it <em>may </em>extend. Congress are bound to establish tribunals, inferior to the supreme court. How els\u00e9 are.crimes against the United States <em>jto </em>be-punished, since the supreme court have not original jurisdiction of these cases ? The state courts are bound by treaties as a part of the supreme law of the land, arid they must construe them in order to pbey them. The only constitutional method of giving any greater effect to the supremacy 'of treaties, would have been by\".enabling the parties claiming under them to sue in the national courts. 3. There are three classes of cases enumerated as of appellate jurisdiction:' that of treaties only applies to this case; but in this case, the British treaty was not <em>principally, </em>only <em>incidentally, </em>in question. It does not appear upon the-face-of the record that the judgment was upon the treaty: It was not upon the treaty; the court of appeals, in their judgment, have expressly declared that it-was not upon the treaty, by affirming that part of the judgment of the district court at Winchester which determined in favour of the treaty.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-9\"><em>Dexter, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APP\">Every advocate is a citizen, and, on great constitutional questions, his duty to his client does not-require him to conceal any opinion he may have formed. This cause may be safely carried through, without falsifying the true ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>position of the constitution. Believing that it is essential to the national welfare that congress should have the right of arming the courts of the United States with every authority necessary to give complete effect to the judicial powers granted by the -constitution, I dissent from the court of appeals of Virginia, when they deny, that the appellate jurisdiction of the national tribunals extends to cases involving the construction and validity of treaties. But the question is, h\u00e1s congress provided an adequate method of exercising it ? 1. Before a writ of elror goes from this court to a state court, it must appear on the face of the record, 1st. That the construction or validity of a treaty is drawn in question. 2d. That the title or claim supposed to be infringed was specially set up or demanded by - the party. 3d. That the state court did decide respecting the title or claim under the treaty. In the present instance, suppose that there had been no case made, and that all the facts stated had been given in evidence, and a general, verdict rendered thereon : the case is precisely in that predicament. The de-. termination of the 'court was not limited-, in any degree, to the construction of a treaty, which was only one of the numerous facts stated on which the title of the parties depended. How can this court ascertain on which of these facts the state court determined, or that it determined upon the treaty? The alienage of Lord Fairfax\u2019s devisee, and the question whether the lands didnot escheat without office found, noiight have been the point of decisipn, avoiding to cbn-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>sider the construction or validity of the treaty, which applies only to things confiscable. Congress have not said that,this court shall determine conjecturally, but that the party shall specially set up his claim on the record, in order to see wheth\u00e9r a treaty has been infringed. He may plead the matter specially, or except to the opinion of the court; but if he chose to make an agreed case in the most general way, is this court'to amend the defects of his proceeding? 2. As to the constitutionality of the judiciary act. It' is agreed that the judicial powers granted by the constitution are exclusive, or exclusive in the election of, congress; but that any <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction is given by the constitution is what I deny. It is neither expressed nor implied; nor is there any necessity far it: for these suits might be removed from the state courts, as are suits commenced by foreigners and citizens of different states, in the first instance, or in the moment any question touching a treaty arose, instead of being brought up by the offensive mode-of a writ of error, directed to a court which is as supreme in its appropriate sphere a? this court. Whether.the court where the suit is commenced will, or will not, \u25a0 consent; the national court may. take jurisdiction. If the state court pertinaciously proceeds, notwithstanding ; its proceedings would be <em>coram nonjudice. </em>The original and the appellate jurisdiction .are opposed to each other by the constitution. The first cannot regard the state courts; nor the latter: for it is only the residuum of the mass of power before given, which does not expressly include appeals from the state courts. Why is it to be supposed that the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>courts will exercise any part of that mass of power? There is no necessity for it, since the, laws might provide a constitutional mode, of excluding them. If they have-not provided such a mode, it is not for this court to supply the defect. By attempting it, they will, begin a conflict between, the national and state authorities that may-ultimately involve both in one common, ruin. The taper of judicial, discord may become the torch of civil war, and though the breath of a judg\u00e9 can extinguish \u25a0 the first, the wisdom of the statesman may not quench the latter. \u00cd lament that the courts of so patriotic a state as Virginia have denied the complete and exclusive dominion of the national government over the whole surface of the judicial power granted by the people to that government. \u201cJoin or pie,\u201d was the wordvwhen we were represented as a disjointed serpent, of which Virginia \u25a0 was \u25a0 the head. From that head sprung our \u201c immortal chief,\u201d armed with the asgis of wisdom. '' But that great man, and those who advised him, improvidently assented to a law, (the judiciary act,) which-is neither constitutionally nor. politically adapted to enforce, the powersmf the national courts in an amicable and pacific manner. I have never feared th\u00e1t this -government was too strong: I have always feared, it was not strong enough. I have long inclined to the belief, that the centrifugal force was greater than the centripetal. The danger is, not that we shall fall into the sun, but that we may \u2022 fly off in eccentric orbits, and never return to our perihelion. But though I will struggle to preserve' all the constitutional powers of the national' govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ment, I will not strain and break the constitution its\u00e9jfj in order to assert them; there,is danger too oh that side. The poet describes the temple of Fame as situated on a mountain covered with ice. The palaces of power are on the same frail foundation; the foot of adventurous ambition often slips, in the ascent, and sometimes the volcano bursts, and inundates with its lava the surrounding country, But I fear not that this court will be wanting ip. the firmness which becomes its station; and if it believes that it may, constitutionally, and legally, exert its powers upon the state courts, in this form, (which is what I deny,) it will not,regard consequences in the exercise of its duty: it will say, with another august tribunal, \u201c <em>Fiat </em>justitia, <em>ruat cadumF.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-9\">Jones, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlFa\">The states are deprived, by the' constitution, of the character of perfect states, as defined by jurists; they \u00e1re still sovereign, <em>sub modo; </em>but the hational government pervades all their territory, and acts upon \u00e1ll their citizens. The state judicatures are essentially incompetent to pronounce what is the .law; not in the limited sphere of their territorial jurisdiction, but throughout the union and the world. The constitution, aft. 3., sec. 2., has distinguished between the causes properly national, and \u201c controversies\u201d which it was thought expedient vest in the courts of the United States. The judiciary act covers the first completely, the last only partially. It is said -the doctrine contended for. involves the old anomaly of the national government, acting,not on individuals, but on state authorities; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>but this government must act in this manner by appeal from the state courts, or it cannot act at all. If you have an appellate jurisdiction, their judgment is your judgment. You may execute this your judgment ; you need not remand the cause to the state court. These are mere arbitrary forms, which the court may discard, or adopt, at pleasure. Neither is it necessary to send a writ of error to the state court; you may cite the parties themselves to appear in your forum, as soon as a question touching, a treaty arises. There is no necessary connection between an appellate tribunal and the court appealed <em>from; </em>it is sufficient that the parties have originally litigated before the court of first instance. The house of lords, an English common law court, |iolds appeals from the court of sessions, in Scotland, a civil law tribunal. The union between that country and England is similar to our federative constitution. '\u25a0 'In whatever mode \"the appellate jurisdiction may be exercised, it. is still liable to the difficulties suggested. The process by which a cause is to be removed \u2018ik&gt;m the state court, before judgment, must be addressed to that court; and if it still proceeds, the remedy must be as offensive as ut present. But it would-, also, be ineffectual and dilatory. Suppose, in a case of original jurisdiction, an ambassador pro- \u25a0 secutcd for a supposed crime in a state court, he might be imprisoned, or put to death, before .the national authority could be interposed, unless it act directly oti the state judicature. In this case, the court may act directly on the cause and the parties, in order to carry into complete effect the appellate powars with which It is invested by the constitution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>laws. There is nothing in the record importing that the court of appeals determined on the ground of the party\u2019s title merely. Nor is it necessary that the treaty, under which that title is set up, should be specified in a bill of exceptions, or propounded in argument. It is sufficient that the claim is stated upon the r\u00e9cord, and that the title depends upon the treaty. This court is not to pronounce a mere abstract opinion upon the validity, or construction, of the treaty ; it may, therefore, decide on other incidental matters; and, if the party has a good:title under the treaty,' it is to enforce and protect that title. . As -to the sufficiency of the return, the law merely requires a transcript of the record to be removed, and, by the rules of this court, a return by the clerk is sufficient.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b343-4\">Story, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AfT\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">This is a- writ of error from the court of appeals of Virginia, founded upon the refusal of that court to obey the mandate of this court, requiring the judgment rendered in this very Cause, at February term, 1813, to be carried into due execution. The following is the judgment of the court of appeals rendered on the mandate : 4iThe court is unanimously of opinion, that the \u25a0 app\u00e9llate power. of the supreme court of the United States does not extend to this court, under a sound construction of the constitution of the United States; that so much of the 25th section of the act of congress to establish -the judicial courts of the United States, as extends the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court to this court, is not in pursuance of the constitution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>United States ; that the writ of error, in this cause, was improvidently allowed under the authority of that act; that the proceedings thereon in the supreme court were, <em>coram non </em>judice, in relation to this court, and that obedience to its mandate be declined by. the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The questions involved in this judgment are of great importance and delicacy. Perhaps it is not too much to affirm, that, upon their right decision, rest some of the most solid principles which have hitherto been' supposed to sustain and protect the constitution itself. The great respectability, too, of the court whose decisions we are called \u00fap,on to review, and the entire deference which we entertain for the learning and ability of that court, add much t\u00a9 the difficulty of the task which has so unwelcomely fallen upon us. It is, however,-a source of consolation., that we have, had the assistance of most able and learned arguments to aid our inquiries <em>; </em>and that the opinion which is now to be pronounced has been weighed with every solicitude to come to a correct result, and matured after solemn deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Before proceeding to the, principal questions, it may not be unfit to dispose of some preliminary considerations which have grown out of the arguments at the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">The constitution of the United States was ordained and established, not by the states in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the constitution declares, by \u201c the people of the United States.\u201d There can be no doubt that it was cothpetent to the people to invest the general go<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>vernment with all the powers which they might deem proper knd necessary; to extend or restrain these powers according to their own good pleasure* and to give them a paramount and supreme authority. As little doubt can there b\u00e9, that the people had a right to prohibit to the states the exercise of any powers which were* in their judgment, incompatible with the objects of the general compact; to make the _powers of the state governments, in given cases, subordinate to those of the nation, or to reserve to themselves those sovereign authorities :which they might not choose to delegate to either. The constitution was not, therefore, necessarily carved out of existing state sovereignties, nor a surrender of powers already existing in state institutions, for the powers of the states depend upon their own constitutions ; and the people of every state had the right to modify and restrain them, according to \u00abtheir own views of policy or principle. On the other hand, it is perfectly clear that the sovereign powers vested in the state governments, by their respective constitutions, remained unaltered and unimpaired, except so far as they were granted to the government of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">These deductions do not rest upon general reasoning, plain and obvious as they seem to be. They have bejen positively recognised by one of the articles in', amendment of the constitution, which .declares, that .\u201c the powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution* nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the <em>states </em>respectively, or <em>to the people\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>.The government, then, of the United States, can claim no powers which are not granted to it by the constitution, and the powers actually granted, must be such as are expressly given, or given by necessary implication. On the other hand, this instrument, like every other grant, is to have a reasonable construction, according to the import of its terms ; and ryhere a power is expressly given in' general terms, it is not to be restrained to particular cases, unless that Construction grow out of the context expressly, or by necessary implication. The words are to be taken in their natural and obvious sense, and not in a sense unreasonably restricted or enlarged.</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">The constitution unavoidably deals in general language. It did not suit the purposes of the peo-r pie, in framing this great charter of our liberties, to provide for minute specifications of its powers, cr to declare the means by which those powers should be carried into execution. It was foreseen that this would b\u00e9 a perilous and difficult, if not an impracticable, task. The instrument was not intended to provide merely for the exigencies of a few years, but was to endure through a long lapse of ages, the events of which were locked up in the inscrutable purposes of Providence. It could not be foreseen what new changes and modifications of power might be indispensable to effectuate the. general objects of the charter; and restrictions and specifications, which,-at the present, might seem salutary, might, in the end, prove the overthrow of the systern itself. Hence its powers are expressed in general terms, leaving to the legislature, , from time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>time, to adopt its own means to effectuate legitimate objects, and to mould and model the exercise of its powers, as its own wisdom, arid the public interests, , \u2022 3hould require. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">With these principles in view,, principles in respect to which no difference of opinion ought to be indulged, let us now proceed to the interpretation of the constitution, so far as regards the great points in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">The third article of the constitution is that which must principally attract our attention.. The 1st. section declares, \u201c the judicial power of th\u00e9 United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such other inferior courts as the congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish.\u201d The 2d section declares, that \u201c the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law or equity, arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and the treaties made, or which shall, be made, under their authority; to all. cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to. all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states; between a state and citizens of another state;' between citizens of different states; between citizens of the sam\u00e9 state, claiming lands under the grants of different states; and between a state or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects.\u201d It then proceeds to declare, that \u201cin \u00e1ll c\u00e1ses affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the supreme court shall have <em>original jurisdiction. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>In all the. other cases before mentioned the supreme court shall have <em>appellate jurisdiction, </em>both as to law arid fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations, as the congress shall make.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Such is the language of the article-creating and defining the judicial power of the United States. It is the voice of the whole American people solemnly-declared, in establishing one great department of that government which was, in many respects, national, and in all, supreme It is. a part, of the very same instrument which \\yas to act not merely upon individuals, but upon states; and to deprive them altogether of the exercise of some powers of sovereignty, and to restrain and regulate them in the exercise of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Let this, article be carefully weighed and considered. The language, of the article throughout is manifestly designed to be mandatory upon tlie legislature. Its obligatory force. is so imperative, that congress could not, without a violation of its duty, have refused to carry it into operation. The judicial power of the United States <em>shall be vested </em>(not may be vested) in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish. . Could cqngress have lawfully refused to create a supreme court, or to vest in it the Constitutional jurisdiction <em>? </em>\u201c The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, <em>shall hold </em>their offices during good behaviour, and <em>shall, </em>at stated times, receive, for their services, a compensation which, shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\u201d Could congress create or limit any other tenure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the judicial office? Could they refuse to pay, at stated times, the stipulated salary, or diminish it. durins: the continuance in office ? But one answer can , \u2022 \"t x- ' -x XT. \u2022 xii be given to these questions: it must be'in the negative. The. object of the constitution was to establish three great departments of government; the legislative, ,fhe executive, and the judicial departments.. The first was to pass, laws, the second to approve and execute them, and. the third to expound and enforce them. Without the latter,. it would be impossible to carry into, effect some of the express provisions of the constitution. How, otherwise* could crimes against the United States be tried and punished ? How could causes between two states be heard and determined? .The judicial power must,, therefore, be vested in some court* by <em>congress': </em>and to suppose that it w.as not .an obligation binding on them, but might, at their pleasure, be omited or declined, is to suppose thqt, under, the sanction .of the constitution, they might defeat the constitution itself; a construction which would lead to such a result cannot be sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The same expression, \u201c shall be vested,\u201d occurs in other parts' of the constitution, in defining the powers of the other co-ordinate br\u00e1nchcs of the government. The first article declares that. \u201c all legislative powers herein granted .s/m\u00fc <em>be vested, </em>in a congress of the United States.\u201d Will it be contended that the legislative power is not absolutely vested? that the words merely refer to Some future act, and mean only that the legislative power may, hereafter be vested? The second article declares that \u201c the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>executive power <em>shall be vested </em>in a president of the United S\u00edat'\u00e9s of America.\u201d Could congress vest it in any other person; or, is it to await' their good pleasure, whether it is to vest,at all? It is apparent \u25a0that such a construction,, in either case, would be utterly inadmissible. ; Why, then, is it entitl\u00e9d to a better support in reference to the judicial- department ?</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">If, then, it is a duty of congress to vest the judicial power of th'd United States, it is a duty to vest the <em>whole judicial power. </em>The language, if imperative as to one part, is imperative as to all. If it were otherwise, this anomaly would exist, that .congress might successively refuse to vest the jurisdiction in any one class .of cases enumerated in the constitution, arid thereby defeat the jurisdiction as to all; for the constitution has not singled out any 'class on which congress are bound to act in preference to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The next consideration is as to the courts, in which the judicial power shall be vested. It is manifest that a supreme court, must'' be <em>established; </em>but whether it be equally obligatory to establish inferior count's, is a question of some difficulty. If congress may lawfully omit to establish inferior courts, it might follow, that in some of the-enumerated' c\u00e1ses the judicial power could nowhere exist. The supreme, court can have original jurisdiction in two classes of cases only, viz. in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and in cases in which a state is a party. . Congress cannot vest, any portion of the judicial power of the United States, except in courts ordained and established by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>itself; and if in any of the eases enumerated in the constitution, the state courts did not then possess jurisdiction, the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court (admitting that it could act op' state courts) could not reach those cases; and, consequently, the injunction of the, constitution, that the judicial power \u201c <em>shall be vested\u201d </em>would be disobeyed. It would seem, therefore, to follow, that congress are bound to create some inferior courts, in which to vest all 'that jurisdiction which, under the constitution, is <em>exclusively </em>vested in the United States,, and of which the supreme epurt e\u00e1nnot take original cognizance. They might establish one or more inferior courts; they might parcel out the jurisdiction among such courts, from time to time, at th\u00e9ir own pleasure. But the whole judicial power of the-United States should be, at all times, vested either in an original or appellate form, in some courts created under its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"AV61\">This construction will be fortified by an attentive examination of the second section of the third article. The words are \u201c the judicial power <em>shall extend\u201d. </em>&amp;c. Much minute and elaborate criticism has been employed upon those words. It has been argued that they are equivalent to the words \u201c may extend,\u201d and that \u201cextend\u201d means to widen to new cases not before within the scope of the power., For the reasons which have been already stated, we are of opinion that the words are used in an imperative sense. They import an, absolute . grant of judicial power. They cannot have a relative signification applicable to powers Already granted; for the American <em>people </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>had not made any previous'grant. The constitution was for a new government-, organized with new substantive powers,-and not a mere supplementary char-^er a g-ovemment already existinsf.. The confe0 <em>J -a . \u25a0 </em>. deration was a compact between states; and its structure and powers were wholly unlike those of the Rational government. The constitution was 'an act of the\" people of the United States to supercede the confederation, and not to be ingrafted on it, as a stock through which it was to receive life and nourishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">If; indeed; the relative signification, could ,be fixed upon the term \u201c extend,\u201d it could not (as we shall hereafter see) subserve the purposes of the argument insupport-of which it has been adduced. This imperative sense of the words \u201c shall extend,\u201d is strengthened by the context. It is declared that \u201c in all cases- affecting ambassadors, &amp;c., that the\u2019supreme court <em>shall have </em>original jurisdiction.\u201d Could congress -withhold original jurisdiction in these cases from the supreme court ? The clause proceeds \u2014 \u201c in all the other cases before mentioned the supreme court shall have appellate-jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulation^, as the-congress shall make.\u201d The very exception jhere shows that the framers of the constitu.tion used the words in an imperative sense. What necessity could there'exist for this exception if the preceding words were not used in that sense ? Without such exception, congress would, by the preceding words, have possessed a complete power to regulate the appellate jurisdiction, if the language were. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>only equivalent to the words \u201c may have\u201d1 appellate jurisdiction. It is apparent, then, that. the exception wasinterided as'&amp;limitation upon the preceding words, to enable congress to regulate and restrain the 'appellate power, as'the public interests might, from, time to time, require..</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Other clauses in the constitution might be brought in aid of this construction; but a minute examination, of them caniiot be necessary, and would oocupy too much time. It will, be found that whenever a particular object is to be\u2019 effected, the language of the constitution is always imperative, and cannot be disregarded without violating the first principles \u00f3f pub-: lie dutyv On-the-other hand, the legislative powers are given in language which implies discretion, as from the nature of legislative power such a discretion must ever he exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">It being, then, established that the language of this clause is imperative, the next question is as to the cases to which it shall apply. The answer is found m the constitution itself. The judicial power shall extend to all the cases enumerated'in the constitution. As the mode is not limited, it may extend to all such cases, in any form, in which judicial power may be exercised. It may, therefore, extend to them in the shape of original or appellate jurisdiction, or both; for there is nothing in the nature of the -;ases which binds to the exercise of the one in preference to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In what cases (if any) is this judicial power exclusive, or exclusive at the election of congress?\" It will fee observed that there \u00e1re two classes of cases enu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>iterated in the constitution, between which a distiridtipn seems to be drawn. The first class includes cases arising Under the constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States; cases, affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and cases' of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. In this class the expression is, and that the' judicial power shall extend to <em>all cases ) </em>but in the subsequent part of the clause which embraces all the. other cases, of national cognizance, arid forms \u2022 the second class, the word \u201ca//\u201d is dropped seemingly <em>ex-\u2018industria. </em>Here;the judicial authority is to extend to controversies (not to <em>all </em>controversies) to which the United States shall be a party, &amp;c. ' From this difference of phraseology, perhaps, a difference of constitutional intention may, with' propriety; be inferred. It is hardly to be presumed that the variation in the language could have been accidental. It must have been the rbsult of some determinate reason ; and it is not vpry difficult to find a reason sufficient to support the apparent change of intention. In respect to. the first class, it may well have been the intention of the framers of the constitution imperativ\u00e9ly to extend the judicial poWer either in am original or appellate form to <em>all cases; </em>and in the latter class to leave it to congress to qualify the jurisdiction, original or appellate, in such manner as public policy might dictate.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The vital importance of all the cases enumerated in the first class f\u00f3 the national sovereignty, might warrant such a distinction. In the first place, as to cases arriving under the constitution, l\u00e1ws, and treaties of the United States. - Here the state courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>could not. ordinarily possess a direct jurisdiction. The jurisdiction over such cases could not exist in the state courts previous to the adoption \u00f3f the constitution, and it could not afterwards be directly'conferred on. them; for the constitution expressly requires the judicial power to be vested in courts ordained and established by the United States. This class of cases would embrace civil as W'ell as criminal jurisdiction, and affect not only our internal policy, but our \u2018foreign- relations. It would, therefore, be perilous to restrain^ it in any manner whatsoever, inasmuch as it might hazard the national safety. Th\u2019e same remarks may be urged as\u2019to cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls* who are emphatically placed under the guardianship of the law of nationsand~as to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, the admiralty jurisdiction embraces all questions of prize and salvage, in the correct adjudication of which foreign nations are deeply interested; it embraces also\u2019maritime torts, contracts,'and offences, in which the pririciples of the law and comity of nations often form an essential inquiry. All these cases, then, enter into' the national policy, affect the national rights, and may compromit the national, sovereignty. The original or appellate jurisdiction ought not, therefore, to be restrained, but should be commensurate with the mischiefs intended to be remedied, and, of course, should extend to all cases whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">A different policy might weh be adopted in reference to the second class of cases ; for although it might be fit that the ju \u25a0\u2019icial power should extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>to all controversies to which the United States should be a party* yet . this power m\u2019ght not. have been imperatively given, least it should imply a right to take cognizance- of original suits brought against the- United .States \u25a0 as. defendants in their own courts. It might not have been deemed.-proper to submit the sovereignty of the United States,-.against their-own will, to judicial, cognizance, either to enforce rights or to.prevent wrongs; and as to the other cases of the second class, they might well be left to be. exercised under the -exceptions and regulations which congress might, in their wisdom, choose to apply. |t is also worthy of remark, that congress seem, in a gpod. degree, in- the establishment of the present judicial system, to have adopted this distinction.. In the first class .of cases, the jurisdiction is. pot limited except by the subject matter; in the' second, it is made materially to depend upon the value in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">We do not, however, profess\u2019 to place -any implicit reliance upon the ' distinction which has here been stated- and endeavoured tube illustrated. It has the . rather been brought into view in deference to the legislative opinion, which has so long acted upon, and enforced, this distinction. But there, is, certainly, vast weight in the argument which has been urged, that the constitution is. imperative upon congress to vest all the judicial power of the United States, in the shape of original jurisdiction, in the supreme and inferior courts created under, its. own authority. At all events, whether the one construction or the other prevail, it is-manifest that the judicial power of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>United States is- unavoidably, in some cases, exclusive of all state authority,,and in all others, may be made so at the election of congress. Np part of the criminal jurisdiction of the United States can, consistently with the constitution, be delegated to state tribunals: The admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is of the same exclusive cognizance; and it pan only be in those cases Where, previous to the constitution, state , tribunals possessed jurisdiction independent of national authority, that they can now constitutionally exercise a concurrent jurisdiction'. Congress, throughout the judicial act, and particularly in the 9th, 11th, and. 13th sections, have legislated upon the suppositi\u00f3n that in all. the cases to which the judicial powers of the United States extended, they might rightfully yest exclusive jurisdiction in their own courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">But, even admitting that the language of the constitution is not mandatory, and that congress may constitutionally omit to vest the judicial power in courts of the United- States, it cannot be denied that when it is vested, it may be exercised to the utmost constitutional extent..</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">This leads us to the consideration of the great question as to the nature and extsnt of tne appellate jurisdiction of the United States. We have already seen that appellate jurisdiction is given by the constitution to the supreme court in all cases where it has not original jurisdiction; -subject, however, to such exceptions and regulations as congress may prescribe; It is, therefore, capable of embracing every case enumerated in the constitution, which is not exclusively to be decided by way of original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>jurisdiction. But the exercise bf appellate jurisdiction is far from being limited by the-terms of the constitution to the supreme c\u00f3urt. There can, be no doubt that congress may create a.succession of inferior tribunals, in each of which it may vest appellate as well as original jurisdiction. The judicial ppWer is delegated by the constitution in the. most gperaerAl terms, and may, therefore, b\u00e9 .exercised by congress under every'variety of form*, of appellate Or original jurisdiction. And as there is nothing in the constitution which restrains or limits this power, it must, therefore, in all other cases, subsist in the utmost latitude of which, in its own nature, His susceptible.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">As,' then, by the terras of- the constitution, the appellate jurisdiction is not. limited as to the supreme cb\u00fart, and as to this court it may be exercised in all other cases than those of which it has original cognizance, 'what is there to restrain its exercise over state tribunals in the enumerated cases ? The appellate power is . not limited- by the terms of the third article to any particular Courts. The words are, \u201c the judicial power (which includes appellate power) shall extendi\u00f3 <em>all cases\" </em>&amp;c., and \u201c in all other cases bef\u00f3te mentioned the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction.\u201d. It is the case, then, and not <em>the Court, </em>that gives the jurisdiction. If the judicial power extends to the ease, it will be in vain to search in the letter of the constitution for any qualification as to the tribunal where it depends. It is incumbent^ then, upon those, who assert such a qualification to show its existence by necessary implication. , If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>text be. clear and distinct, no restriction upon its plain and obvious import ought to be admitted, unless the inference be irresistible.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">If the constitution meant to limit the appellate jurisdiction to cases pending in the courts of the United States,, it would necessarily follow that the jurisdiction, of these courts would, in . all the cases enumerated in the constitution, be exclusive of state tribunals. How otherwise,couid.the. jurisdiction extend to <em>all </em>cases arising under the constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, or <em>to all cases </em>of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ?. If some of these cases might be entertained by state tribunals, and no appellate jurisdiction as to them should exist, then the appellate power would not extend to <em>all, </em>but to <em>some, </em>cases. If state tribunals might exercise, concurrent jurisdiction over all or some of the other classes of cases in the constitution without control, then the appellate jurisdiction of the United States might, as to such cases, have.no real existence, contrary to the manifest intent of the constitution. Under such circumstances, to give effect to. the judicial power, it must be construed to be exclusive; and this not only when the <em>casus foederis </em>should arise directly, but when it should arise, incidentally, in cases pending in state courts. This construction would abridge the jurisdiction of such court, far more than has been ever contemplated in any act of congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">On the other hand, if, as has been contended, a discretion be vested in congress to establish, or not to establish, inferior courts at their own pleasure, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>congress should\" riot establish such courts, the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court would have nothing to act upqn, uhless it could aoi upon cases pending in the state courts. Under such circumstances it must be held that the appellate power would extend to state courts; for the constitution is peremptory that it shall extend to c\u00e9rtain enumera-; ted cases, which cases could exist in no other courts, Any other construction, Upon this supposition, would involve this strange contradiction, that a discretionary power vested in congress, and which they might rightfully omit to exercise, would defeat the absolute injunctions of the constitution in relation to th\u00e9 whole appellate pow\u00e9r..</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">But it is plain that the framers of the constitution did contemplate that cases within the judicial cognizance of the United States not only might but would arise in the state courts, in the exercise of their ordinary jurisdiction, With this view the sixth article - declares, that \u201c this constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and,all treaties made, Or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States* shall be the supreme law. of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d It is obvious that this obligation is imperative upon the state judges in their official, and not merely in their private, capacities. From the very nature of their judicial duties they would be called upon to pronounce the law applicable to the case in judgment, They were not to decide merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>according to the laws or constitution of the state, but according to the- constitution, laws and treaties of the United States \u2014 \u201c the supreme law of the land.\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">:A moment\u2019s consideration will show us the' necessity and propriety of tipis provision in eases where the jurisdiction of th\u00e9 state courts is unquestionable. Suppose a contract for the payment of money is made' between citizens of the same state, and performance thereof is sought, in the courts of that state; no person can doubt that the jurisdiction completely and exclusively attaches,, in the'first instance, to such courts. Suppose at the trial the defendant sets up in his, defence a tender under a state law, making paper money a good tender, or a state law, impairing, the obligation pf such contract, whieh law, if binding, would defeat the suit. The constitution of the United States has declared that no state shall make any thing but,gold or' silver coin a tender in payment of debts, or pass a law impairing the obligation of contracts. If congress shall not have passed a law providing for the removal of such a,suit to the courts of the United States, must not the state court proceed tp hear and determine it ? Can a mere plea in defence be of itself a bar to further proceedings, so as to prohibit an inquiry into its truth or legal propriety, when no other tribunal exists to whom judicial cognizance of such cases is confided ? Suppose an indictment for a crime in a state court, and the defendant should allege in his defence that the crime was created by an <em>ex post facto </em>apt of the state, must not\u2019 the state court, in the exercise of a jurisdiction which has already rightfully attached, have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>right to pronounce oh the'validity and sufficiency of the defence? It would be extremely difficult, upon any legal principles, to give a negative answer to these inquiries. Innumerable instances of the same Sort might be stated, in illustration of the position; and unless the state courts could sustain jurisdiction in such cases, this cl\u00e1us\u00e9 of the - sixth article would he without meaning or effect:, and public mischiefs, of a most enormous magnitude, would inevitably ensue.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">It&gt; must, therefore, be conceded that the constitution not only contemplated, but meant tb provide for cases within the scope of the judicial power of the United States, which might yet depend before state tribunals. It was foreseen that in the exercise of their ordinary jurisdiction, state courts would incidentally take cognizance of cases arising under the constitution, the laws, and treaties of the United States. Yet to all these cases the judicial power, by the very, terms of the constitution, is to extend. It cannot extend by original jurisdiction if that was already rightfully and exclusively attached in the state courts, which (as has been already shown) may occur; it must, therefore, extend by appellate jurisdiction,, or not at all. It would seem to follow that the appellate power of the United States must, in such cases, extend to,state tribunals; and if in such Cases, there is no reason why it should not equally attach upon all others within the purview of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">It has been argued that such an appellate jurisdiction over state courts is inconsistent with the genius <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>of our governments* and the Spirit of the constitutions That the latter was never desjgned to act upon state sovereignties, but only -upon the people, and that if the: power exists, it will materially impair the., sovereignty of the states, and the independence Of their courts. We cannot yield to the force of this region* ingj it assumes.principles which we cannot admit, and draws conclusions to which we do not yield out* assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\">It is a mistake thatrthe constitution was not designed to operate upon states, in. their corporate capacities. ' It is crowded with provisions which restrain of annul the sovereignty of the states in some of the highest branches of their prerogatives. The tenth section of. the first article contains a long list, of disabilities and prohibitions imposed upon the states. Surely, when such essential, portions of state sovereignty are taken away, or prohibited to be ex,ercised, it cannpt.be correctly asserted that the constitution does not act upon the states. 'Ihe language of the constitution is also imperative upon thg states as to the performance of many duties. It is imperative upon the state legislatures to make laws prescribing the time, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, and for electors of president and vice-president. And in these, as well as some other cases, congress have, a right to revise, amend, or supercede the laws which may be passed by state legislatures.- When, therefore, the states , are stripped of some of the highest attributes \u00f3f sovereignty, and the same are given to the United States; when the legislatures'of the states are, in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>respects, under the control of congress, and in every case are, under the constitution, bound <em>by </em>the paramount authority of the United States; it is certainly difficult to support the argument that the appellate poWer over the decisions of state courts is contrary to the genius of our institutions. The courts of the United States can, without question, revise the proceedings of the executive and legislative authorities of the states, and if they are found to be contrary to the constitution, may declare them to be of ho legal validity. Surely the exercise of the same right over ju&lt; icial tribunals is not a higher or more dangerous act of sovereign power.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Nor can such a right be deemed to impair the- independence of state judges. It is assuming the very ground in controversy to assert that they possess an absolute independence of the United States. In respect to the powers granted to the United States-, they are not independent; they are 'expressly bound to obedience by the letter of the constitution; and if they should unintentionally transcend their authority, or misconstrue the constitution, there is no more reason for giving their judgments an absolute and irresistible force, than for giving it to the acts of the . other co-ordinate departments of state sovereignty.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">The argument urged from the possibility of the abuse of the revising power, is equally unsatisfactory. It is always a doubtful course, to argue against the use or existence of a power, from the possibility of its abuse. It is still more difficult, by such, an argument, to ingraft upon a general power a restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>tion which.is not to be found in the terms in which it is given. From the very nature of things, the absolute' fight of decision, in the last resort* must , , '. . i \u2022 \u2022 rest somewhere^ \u2014 wherever it may be vested it is susceptible of abuse. In all questions of jurisdiction the inferior, or app\u00e9llate court, must pronounce the final judgment; and common sense, as well as legal reasoning, has conferred it upon the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">It has been further argued against the.existence of -this appellate power, that it would form a novelty in our judicial institutions. This is certainly a mistake. In the articles of confederation, an instrument framed with infinitely more deference, to state rights and state jealousies, a power was given to congress to establish \u201c courts for revising and determining, finally, <em>appeals </em>in all cases, of captures.\u201d It is remarkable, that no power was given to entertain <em>original </em>jurisdiction in such cases; and, consequently, the appellate power (although not so expressed in terms) was altogether to be exercised in revising the decisions of state tribunals. This was, undoubtedly, so far a surrender of st\u00e1te sovereignty.; but it never was supposed to be a power fraught with public danger, or destructive of the independence of state judges. On the contrary, it was .supposed to be a power indispensable to the public safety, inasmuch, as pur national rights might otherwise be compromitted, and our national peace been d\u00e1ngered. Under the present constitution the prize jurisdiction is confined to the courts of the United States; and a power to revise the decisions-of state courts, if they should .assert jurisdiction over prize causes, cannot be lesa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>important, or less useful; than it was under the confederation.</p>\n<p id=\"A5i\">In this connexion we are led again to the construe- ^ tion of the words of tile constitution, the judicial power shall extend,\u201d <em>&amp;c. </em>If, as has been contended at the bar, the term \u201c extend\u201d have \u00bf relative signification, and mean to widen an existing power, it will then follow, that, as the confederation gave-an appellate power over state tribunals, the constitution enlarged or widened that appellate power 10 all the other cases in which jurisdiction is .given to the courts of the United States. It is not.presumed that the \u00cdearn\u00e9d counsel would ehtioSe to adopt such a Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">It is further argued, that ri\u00f3 great, public mischief can result from a construction which shall limit the appellate' power of the United States to cases in their own courts: first,\u2019 because state 'judges are bound by ari oathuto support the constitution of the United States, arid must be presumed to be riien of learning and integrity <em>&lt;; </em>and, s\u00e9condly, because congress must have an unquestionable right to remove all cases within fhe scope of the judicial power from the state .courts tp the courts of the United States, at any time before final judgment,' though not after final judgment. As to the first\u2019 reason^admitting \u2022that the judges of the. state courts are, arid always will be, of as iriuch learning, integrity, and wisdom, as those of the courts of the United States, {which we very cheerfully admit,) it does not aid the argument. It is manifest that the constitution has proceed\u00e9d upon a theory of its'own, and given or with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>held powers according to the judgment of the American people, by whom it was adopted. We can 1 r . <em>J </em>1 * . only construe its powers,' and cannot inquire mto the policy or principles which induced the grant of them. The constitution has presumed (whether rightly, or wrongly we do . not inquire) .that state attachments, state prejudices, state.-jealousies^ and state interests, might, some times obstruct, or control, or be supposed to obstruct or control, the regular administration of justice. . Hence, in controversies between states; between citizens of different <em>states; </em>between citizens claiming grants under different-states;. between a state aiid its citizens, * or foreigners, and between citizens and foreigners, it enables the parties, under the authority of congress, to have the controversies heard, tried, and determined before the national tribunals. - No other reason than that which has been stated can be assigned, why some, at least, of those cases should not have been left to the cognizance of the state courts. In respect to.the other enumerated cases \u2014 -the cases arising under the constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, cases affecting ambassadors and other public. ministers, and cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction \u2014 Reasons of a higher and more extensive nature, touching the safety, peace, and sovereignty of the. nation, might well justify a grant of exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">This is not all. A motive of another kind,. perfectly compatible with the most sincere respect for state tribunals, might induce the grant of appellate power over their decisions. . That motive is the importance, .and even necessity of <em>uniformity </em>\u00f3f deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>sions throughout the whole United States, Upon all subjects within the purview of the constitution. Judges of equal learning and integrity* in different states, might differently interpret a statute, or a treaty of the United States, or even the constitution itself: If there were no revising authority to control these jarring and discordant judgments, and harmonize them into uniformity, the laws, the. treaties, and the constitution of.the United States would he different in different states, and might, perhaps, nev\u00e9r liave precisely th\u00e9 sam\u00e9 construction* obligation, or eifibacy, in any two states. The public mischiefs that would attend such a state of things would be truly deplorable; and it cannot be believed that they could have escaped the enlightened convention which formed the constitution. What, iftdeed, might then have been only prophecy, has, now become fact; and the appellate jurisdiction must continue to be the only ad\u00e9quate .remedy fob such evils.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">There is an additional consideration, which is entitled to great weight. The-constitution of the United States was designed for the .common and equal benefit of all the peop\u00ed\u00e9 of the United States. The judicial power was granted for the same benign and salutary purposes. It was not to be-exercised ex* clusiv\u00e9ly for t]ie benefit, of parties who might be \u2022plaintiffs, and would elect tlje national forum, bui also for the- protection of defendants who might be entitled to try their rights, or assert, their priviliges, before the same forum.- Yet, if the construction contended for be correct, it will follovy, that as the plaintiff may always elect the state court,- the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>fendant may be deprived of all the security which the constitution intended in aid of his rights. Such a state of things can, i\u00f1 no respect, be considered as giving' equal rights. To obviate this difficulty, we are referred, to the power which it is admitted congress possess to remove suits from state courts to the national courts; arid this forms the second ground upon which the. argument we are considering has been attempted to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">. This power of removal is not to be found in express terms in any part of the constitution; if it.be given, it is'only given by implication, as a power necessary and proper to carry into effect some express power. The power of removal is certainly not, in strictness of language; it presupposes an exercise of original jurisdiction to have attached elsewhere. The' existence of this power of removal is familiar incourts acting according to the course of the common law in criminal as well as civil cases, and it is exercised before as well as after judgment. \u2022 But this is always deemed in both cas\u00e9s an exercise of appellate, and not of original jurisdiction. If, then, the right of removal be included in the appellate jurisdiction, it is only because it is one mode of exercising'that power, and as congress is not limited by the Constitution? to any particular &gt;mode, or time of exercising it,, it may authorize a removal, either before or after judgment. The time^ the process, and the manner, must be subject to its absolute legislative control: A writ of error is, indeed, but a process \u2022 which removes the record of.one court to the possession of another court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>and enables the latter to inspect the proceedings, and give such judgment as its own opinion, pf the law and justice of the case may warrant. There is nothing in the nature of the process which forbids.it froni being applied' by the legislature to interlocutory as well as final judgments. And if the right of removal from state courts exist before judgment, because it is included in . the. appellate power, it'must, for the same reason, exist after judgment. \u25a0 And if the appellate power by the constitution does not include cases pending in state courts, the right of removal, Which is but a'mode of exercising th\u00e1t powrer, canndt be applied.to them. Precisely the same objections, therefore, exist as to the rigut of removal before judgment, as after, and both must stand or fall together. Noir, indeed, would the. force of the arguments on either side materially vary, if the right' of removal were an exercise, of original jurisdiction. \u2022 It would equally \u25a0 trench upon , the jurisdiction and independence of state tribunals;</p>\n<p id=\"AWP\">The remedy, too, of removal of suits would be utterly inadequate.to the purposes of the constitution,, if it could act* only on the parties, and,not upon the state courts. In respect to criminal prosecutions, the difficulty.seems, admitted to be insurmountable5 and, in respect to civil suits, there would, in many cases, be rights without corresponding remedies. If -state courts should deny the constitutionality of the authority to remove suits from their, cognizance, in what, manner could they be compelled to relinquish the jurisdiction ? In respect to criminal cases, there would at once he an \u00e9nd of all control, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>state decisions would be paramount to the constitution ; and though in civil sdits the courts of the United States might act upon the parties, yet the state courts might act in the \u00e1ame way.; and this conflict of jurisdictions would not only jeopardise private rights, but bring into imminent peril the public interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">On the whole, the court are of opinion, that the appellate power of the United States does extend to cases pending in the state courts; and that the 25th section of the judiciary act, which authorizes the :exercise of this jurisdiction in,the specified cases, by a writ of error, is supported by the letter and spirit of the constitution. We find no: clause.' in that instrument which limits this power; and we dare not interpose a limitation where the people have not been disposed to create one.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Strong as this conclusion stands upon the general language of the constitution, it may still derive support from other sources. It is an historical fact, that this exposition of the constitution, \u25a0 extending its ap~ pel late power to state courts, was, previous to its adoption, uniformly and publicly, avowed b) its friends, and admitted by its enemies, as the basis of their respective reasonings, both in \u00e1nd out of the state conventions. It is \u2022 an historical fact, that at the time when the judiciary act was submitted te&gt; the deliberation's of the first congress, composed,, as- if was, not only of men of great learning and. ability, but of men who had acted a principal part in framing, supporting, or opposing that constitution, the same exposition was explicitly declared and admitted by the friends and by the opponents of that system. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>is an historical fact,' that the supreme court of the United States have, from time to time, sustained this appellate jurisdiction in a great variety of cases, brought from the tribunals of many of the most important states in the union, and. that no state tribunal has ever breathed \u00e1 judicial' doubt on the subject, or declined <em>tq obey the </em>mandate of <em>the </em>supreme court, until .the present occasion. -This weight of contemporaneous exposition by all parties, this acquiescence of enlightened state courts, and these judicial decisions of the supreme court through so long a period, do, as we think, place the doctrine upon a foundation of authority which cannot be shaken, without delivering over the subject to. perpetual and irremediable doubts.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The next' question which has been argued, is, whether the case at bar be within the purview of the 25th section of the judiciary act, so that this court may rightfully sustain the present writ of <em>error. </em>This section, stripped of. passages Unimportant in this inquiry, enacts, in substance, that a final judgment or decree in any suit in the highest court of law or equity of a state, where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority excised under, the United States, and the decision is against their validity; or' where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under, any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the constitution, treaties, or laws, of the United States, and the decision is in favour of such their <em>validity; </em>or of the constitution, or of a treaty or statute of, or commission held under, the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>States, and <em>the decision is against the </em>title, <em>right, privilege,or exemption, specially set up or claimed by either'party under such </em>clause of the said constitution, treaty, statute, or commission, may be re-examin\u00e9d and reversed or affirmed in the supreme court of the United States, upon a writ of error, in the same manner, and under the same regulations, and the writ shall have the same effect, as if 0ie judgment or .decree complained of had been rendered or passed in a circuit court, and the proceeding upon the reversal shall also be the same, <em>except that the. supreme court, instead of remanding the cause for a final decision, as before provided, may, at their discretion, if the cause shall have been, once remanded before, proceed to a fined decision of t]ie same, and award execution. </em>But no other error ,shall' be assigned or regarded as a ground of reversal in any such c\u00e1se as aforesaid, <em>than such.as appears upon the face of the </em>record, <em>and immediately respects the before-mentioned question- </em>of validity - or construction of the said constitution, treaties, statutes, commissions, or authorities in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">That the present Writ of error is founded upon a judgment of the court below, which drew in question and denied the validity of a statute of the United States, is incontrovertible, for it is apparent upon the face of,the record; That this judgment is final upon, the rights of the parties is equally true; for if well founded, the former judgment pf that court was of conclusive authority, and the former judgment of.this court utterly void. - The decision was, therefore, equivalent'to a perpetual stay of proceedings upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the mandate, and a perpetual denial of all the. rights acquired under it. The case, then, falls directly \"within the terms of the act. It is a final judgment in a suit in a.'state court, denying the validity of a statute, of the United States; and unless a distinction c\u00e1n be made. between proceedings under a mandate, and proceedings in an original suit, a writ of error is? the proper, remedy to revise that judgement. In our opinion no legal distinction exists between the cases. .</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In causes remanded to the circuit courts, if the mandate be not correctly executed, a writ of error or appeal has always.been supposed to be a proper remedy, and has been recognized as such, in the former decisions of this court. The statute gives the same effect to writs'of error from the judgments of state courts as of the circuit courts; and in its terms provides for proceedings where the same cause may be a second time brought up on writ of error before the supreme court. There is no limitation or description of the cases to which the second writ of error may be applied; and it ought, therefore, to be coextensive with the cases which fall within the .mischiefs of the Statute, It .will hardly be denied that this, cause stands in. that predicament; and if so, then the appellate jurisdiction of this court has rightfully attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">But it is contended, that the former judgment of this coutt was rendered upon a case not within the purview of this section ol the judicial act, and that as it was pronounced by an incompetent jurisdiction, it tvas utterly roid, and cannot be a sufficient founds<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>tion to sustain any subsequent proceedings. To this argument several answers may be given. In the first place, it is not admitted that, upon this writ of error, the former record is before us, The error now assigned is not in the former proceedings, but in the judgment rendered upon the -m\u00e1ndate issued after the former judgment. The question now litigated is not upon the construction of a treaty, but upon the . constitutionality of a statute of the . United States, which is clearly within our jurisdiction. In the next place, in ordinary cases a second, writ of error has never been supposed to draw in question the propriety of the first judgment, and it is difficult to perceive-how such a proceeeding could be sustain\u00e9d upon principle. A final judgment of this court is supposed to be conclusive upon the rights which it decides, and no. statute has provided any process by which this court can revise its own .judgments. In several cases which have been former\u2019y adjudged in this court, the same point was argued by counsel, and expressly overruled. It was solemnly held that'a final judgment of this court was conclusive upon the parties, and could not be re-examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">In this case, however, from motives of a public nature, we are entirely willing to wave all objections,- and to go back and re-examine the question of jurisdiction as it stood upon the record formerly in judgment. We have great confidence that our jurisdiction will, on a careful examination, stand confirmed as well upon principle as authority. If will be recollected that the action was an ejectment for a parcel of land in the Northern Neck, <em>formerly </em>belonging to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Lord Fairfax. The original plaintiff claimed the-land under a patent granted to him by the state of Virginia, in 1789, under a title supposed to be vested in that state by escheat or forfeiture. The original defendant claimed the land as devisee under the will of Lord Fairfax. The parties agreed to a special statement of facts in- the nature of a special verdict, \u00abpon which the district' court of Winchester, in 1793, gave p general judgment for the defendant, which judgment was afterwards reversed in 1810, by the court of- appeals, and ,a general judgment was rendered for the plaintiff; and from this last judgment a writ of error was brought to . the supreme court. The statement of facts contained a regular deduction of the title'of Lord Fairfax until his death, in 1781,, and alsp the title of his. devisee, it also contained a regular deduction of the tide of the plaintiff, under the state of Virginia, and further referred to the treaty of. peace of 1783, and to the acts of Virginia respecting the lands of Lord Faixfax, and the supposed, escheat or forfeiture thereof, as component parts of the. case.. No facts disconnected with the titles thus set \u00fao by the parties were alleged-on either side, \u25a0 It is apparent, from this summary explanation, that the title thus set up by the plaintiff might be open to other objections ; but the title of the defendant' was perfect and complete, if it was protect\u00e9d by the treaty of 1783. If, therefore, this court had authority to examine into the, whole record; and to decide upon the legal validity of the title of the defendant, as well as its application to the tre'aty \u00a9f peace, it would be q case within the express pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>view of the 2,5th section of the act; .for there was nothing in the record upon which the court below could have decided but qpon the title as connected with the treaty; and if the title was otherwise good, its sufficiency must have depended altogether upon its protection under the treaty. \u2019 Under such circumstances it was strictly a suit where was drawn in question the construction of a treaty,-and the decision was against the title specially set up or'claimed by. the 'defendant.. It would fall, then, within the very terms of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"A0NN\">The objection urged at the bar is, that this- court cannot inquire into the title, but-simply into the correctness of the construction.put upon the treaty by the court of <em>appeals; </em>and that their judgment is not re-examinable Lert, unless it appear on- the face- of the record that some construction was put upon the treaty. If, therefore, that court might. hav,e decided the case upon the invalidity of the, title, (and, <em>non </em>\u25a0constat, that they did not,) independent of the treaty, there is an end of the appellate jurisdiction of this court. In support of this objection much stress is laid upon the last clause of the section, \u25a0 which declares, that no other cause shall he regarded as a ground of reversal than such as- appears <em>on the face </em>of the record and <em>immediately </em>respects the construction of the treaty, &amp;c., in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">If this be the true construction of the section, it will be wholly inadequate for the purposes wThich it professes to have in view, and may be evaded at pleasure. But wc see no reason for adopting this harroiv construction; and there are the strongest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>reasons against it, founded upon the words as .well as the intent of the legislature. What is\u2019the case for which the body of the section provides a remedy hf writ of error ? The answer must be in the words of the. section, a suit where is .drawn in question the construction of a treaty, and the decision is against <em>the title set up by the party. </em>It is, therefore, the decision against tire title set up with reference to the treaty, aiid not the mere abstract' construction of the treaty itself, upon Which the statute intends to found the appellate jurisdiction. How, indeed, can it be possible to decide whether a title be within the protection of a treaty, until it is ascertained' what that title is, and whether it have a legal validity ? From the very necessity of the cas\u00e9, there must be a preliminary inquiry into the existence and structure of the title, before the court can construe the treaty in reference to that title. If the court below should decide, that the title was bad, and,- therefore, not protected by the treaty, must not this' court have a power to decide the title to be good, and, therefore, protected by the. treaty ? Is not the treaty, in both instances, equally construed, arid the title of the party, in reference to the,treaty, equally ascertained and decided ? . Nor does the clause relied on in the objection, impugn this construction. It requires, that the error upon which the appellate court is to decide, shall appear on the face of the record, and <em>immediately respect-' </em>the questions before mentioned ia the section. One of the questions is as to the construction of a treaty upon a title specially set up by a party, and every error that immediately respects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>that question, must, of course, be within the cognisanee, of the court. The title set ud in this case is apparent upon the face of the record, and immediately ;respects the decision of that question;, any error, therefore, in respect to that title must be re-examinable, or the case could never be present\u00e9d to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The restraining clause was manifestly intended for a very different purpose. It was foreseen that the parties might claim-under various titles, and might assert various defences, altogether independent of each other. The court might admit or reject evidence .applicable to one particular title, and not to all, and in such cases it was the intention of congress, to limit what .would otherwise have unquestionably attached to the court, the right of revising all the-points involved in the cause. It therefore restrains this, right to such errors as respect the* questions specified in the. section; and in this view, it has an appropriate sense, consistent with the preceding clauses. We are, therefore, satisfied, that, upon principle, the case was rightfully before us, and if the point were perfectly new, we should not hesitate to assert the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">But the point has been already decided by this court upon solemn argument. In Smith v. The State of Maryland, (6 Cranch, 286.,) precisely the same objection was taken by counsel, and. overruled by the unanimous opinion of the court. That case was, in some respects, stronger than the present; for the court below decided, expressly, that the party had no title, and, therefore, the treaty could not operate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>upon it. This court entered into an examination of that question-, and being of ithe same opinion, affirmed the judgment. There cannot, then, be an authority which could more completely govern the present question.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">It has been asserted at the bar.that, in point of fact, the court of appeals did not decide either upon the treaty or the title apparent upon the record, but upon .a compromise made under an act of the legislature of Virginia. If it be true (as we are informed) that this was \u00ab private act, ter take effect only upon a certain condition, viz. th\u00e9 execution of a deed of release of certain lands, which was matter <em>in pais, </em>it is somewhat difficult to understand ;how the .court could take judicial cognizance oftheact, or of the performance of the condition, unless-spread upon the record. At all events, we are bound to consider that the court did decide upon the facts actually before them. The treaty of peace was not necessary to have be\u00e9n stated, for it was the supreme law of the land, of which, all courts must take notice. And at the time of thb decision in the court of appeals and in this court, another treaty had intervened, which attached itself to the title in controversy, and, of course, must have been the supreme law to govern the decision, if it. should be found applicable to the case. It was in this view that this court did not deem it necessary to r^st its former decision upon the treaty of peace, believing that the title of the defendant was, at all events, perfect ugder the treaty , of 1794.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The remaining questions' respect more the practice than the principles of this court. The forms of process, and the modes of proceeding in the exercise of jurisdiction ar\u00e9, with few exceptions; left .by the legislature to be regulated and changed as this court may, in its discretion, deem expedient. . By a rule of this court, the\" return of a copy of a record of the proper court, under the seal of that court, annexed to the writ of error, is declared to be \u201c a sufficient compliance with the mandate of the writ.\u201d The record, in this case, is duly certified by the clerk of the court of appeals, and annexed to the writ of error. The objection, therefore, which has been urged to the sufficiency of the return, cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Another objection is, that it does not' appear that the judge who granted' the writ of error did, upon issuing the citation, take the bond required by the 22d section of the judiciary act.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">We consider that provision as merely directory to the judge; and that an omission does riot avoid the writ of error, If any party be prejudiced by the omission, this court can grant him summary relief, by imposing such terms on the other party as, under all the circumstances, may be legal and proper. But there is nothing in the record by whiph we can judicially know whether a bond has been taken or not; for the statute does not require the bond to be returned to this court, and it might, with equal propriety, be lodged in the court below, who would ordinarily execute the judgment to be rendered on the writ. And the presumption of Jaw is, until the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u2022trary appears, that every judge who signs a citation has obeyed the injunctions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">We have thus gone over all .the \u2019principal questions in the cause, arid we'deliver oin* judgment with entire confidence, that it is consistent with the constitution and laws of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">We have not thought.it incumbent on us to give any opinion upon the question, whether this court have authority to issue a writ of .mandapius to'the court of appeals to enforce 'the former judgments, as we do not think itnecessarily involved in the decision of this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">It is the opinion, of the whole, court, that the judgT ment of the court of appeals of Virginia, rendered on the mandate in this cause; be r\u00e9v\u00e9rsed, and the judgment o' the district court, held at Winchester, be, and the. same is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Johnson,. J. It- will be observed in this case, that .the \u00f3ourt disavows all intention to decide on the right'to issue, compulsory process to the state <em>courts; </em>thus leaving us, in my opinion, where the constituition arid laws place us \u2014 supreme over persons and cases as far as,our judicial powers extend, but not \u00a1asserting any compulsory control over the state tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">In this view I acquiesce in their opinion, but not altogether in the reasoning, or opinion, of my brother who delivered it. New minds are accustomed to the same habit of thinking, and our conclusions are most satisfactory to ourselves when arrived at in. pur own way.</p>\n<p id=\"AWm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>1 have another reason for expressing my opinion on this occasion. I view this question as one of the most momentous importance; as one which may af- \u2022 <em>c </em>.l feet, m its consequences, the permanence or the American union. It presents an instance of collision between the judicial powers pf the union, and one of the greatest states in the union, on a point the most delicate and difficult to be adjusted, On the one hand, the general government must cease to exist whenever it loses the power of protecting itself in the exercise of its constitutional powers. Force, which acts upon the physical powers of man,, or judicial process, which addresses itself to his moral principles or his fears, are the only means to which governments can resort in the ex\u00e9fcise of their authority. The former is happily unknown to the genius of our constitution, except as far as it shall, be sanctioned by the latter; but let the latter be obstructed in its progress by .an-opposition which it cannot overcome or put ,by,, and the resort must be to the former, or government is no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">On the other hand, so firmly am I persuaded, that the American people can no longer enjoy the blessings of a free goveraraeiit, whenever- the state sovereignties shall be prostrated at the feet of the general government, nor the proud consciousness . of equality and security, -any longer than the independence of judicial power\u00bb snail be. maintained consecrated and intangible, that, I could borrow the language of a celebrated orator, and exclaim, \u201c I rejoice that Virginia has resisted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Yet here l must claim the privilege of expressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>my regret, that the opposition of the high and truly respected tribunal of that state had not been marked with .a little more moderation. The only point necessary, to be decided in the case then before then! was, \u201c <em>whether they were bound to obey the mandate emanating from this </em>court?\u201d But in the judgment entered on their minutes, they have affirmed that the case was, in this court, <em>coram nonjudice, </em>or, in other words, that this court had not jurisdiction over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">This is assuming a truly alarming, latitude of judicial power. Where is it to end ? It,is an acknowledged principle of, I believe, -every court in the world, that not only the decisions, but every thing done under the judicial process of courts, not having jurisdiction, are, <em>ipso </em>facto, void^ Are, then, the judgments of this court to be reviewed in every court of the union ? and is every recovery of money, every change of property, that has taken place under our process, to be considered as null, void, and tortious?</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We pretend not to more infallibility than other courts composed of the same frail materials which compose this. It -would be the height of affectation to close our minds upon the recollection that we have been extracted from the same seminaries in \u25a0which originated the learned men who preside over the state tribunals. But there is one claim which we can with confidence assert <em>in our own name' </em>upon those tribunals \u2014 the profound, uniform, and unaffected respect which this court has always exhibited for state decisions, give us strong pretensions to judicial comity. And another claim I may assert, in <em>the name of the American people', </em>in this court, every state in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>tlie union is represented; we are constituted by the voice of the union, and when decisions take place, which nothing but a spirit to give grpund and harmonize can. .reconcile, ours is the syperor claim upon the comity of the state tribunals. ' It is tbe nature of. the human mind to press a favourite , hypothesis too tar, but magnanimity will always be ready to sacrifiee'the pride of opinion to public welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">In the case befpre us, the collision has been, on our part, wholly unsolicited. The exercise of this appellate jurisdiction over the state decisions has long been acquiesced in, and when the writ of error, in this case, 'wps allowed <em>by the president of the court of appeals of Virginia, </em>vVe were sanctioned in supposing that we were to meet with' the ,sanie acquiescence there. Had that court refused to grant the writ in .the .first instance, or had the question'of jurisdiction, or oh the mode, of exercising, jurisdiction, been made here originally, wp should have been put .on our guard, and might have so modelled the process of the court-as to. strip it of the offensive- form of a mandate. In this case it might have been brought down to what probably the 25th section of the judiciary \u2022 act meayt it should be, to wit, an alternative judgment, either that the state court may finally proceed, at its option, to carry into effect the judgment of this court, or, if it declined doing so,, that then this court would proceed itself &lt;to execute it. The language, sense, and operation of the 25th section on tljis subject, merit particular attention. In the preceding section, which has relation to causes brought up by writ of error from the circuit courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>of the United States, this court is instructed not to issue executions, but to send a special mandate to .... , .r . T the circuit court to award executipn thereupon, in case of the circuit court\u2019s refusal to obey such man-' date, there could be no doubt as to the ulterior measures; compulsory process might, unquestionably, be resorted to. Nor, indeed, was there any reason to. suppose that they ever would refuse; and, therefore, there is no provision made.for authorizing this court to ex\u00e9cute its own judgment in cases of that description. But not so, in eases brought up from the state courts; the framers of that law plainly foresaw1 that the state courts might refuse ;v and not being willing to leave ground for the implication, that compulsory process must be resorted to, because no - specific provision was made, they have provided the means, by authorizing this court, in case , of reversal of the state decision, to execute its own judgment.. In case \u00f3f <em>reversal </em>only was this necessary; for, in case of affirmance, this collision could' not arise. It is true, that the. words of this section are,' that this court may,. <em>in their discretion, </em>proceed to execute its own judgment. But these Words were very properly put in, that it might not be made imperative upon this' court to proceed indiscriminately in this Way: as it could only be necessary in case of the refusal of the state courts; and this idea is fully confirmed by the words of the 13th section, which restrict this court in issuing the writ of mandamus, so as to confine it expressly to those courts which are constituted by the United States,</p>\n<p id=\"b387-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>In\u2019 this point of view the legislature is completely vindicated from all intention to violate the ..dependence of the state judiciaries. Nor can this court, with any more correctness, have imputed to it similar intentions. The form of the m\u00e1ndate issued, in this case is that known to appellate tribunals, and used in the ordinary cases of writs of error from the courts of the United States. It will, perhaps, not be too much, in such cases, to expect of those who are conversant in the forms, fictions, and technicality of the law, not to give the process of courts too .iteral a construction. They should be considered with a view to the ends they, are intended to answer, and the lavff and practice in which they originate. In this view, the mandate was no more than a mode \u00abof submitting to that court the option which the 25th section. holds out to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">Had the decision of the court of Virginia been confined to the point of their legal obligation to carry the judgment of this court into effect, I should have thought it unnecessary to make any further observations in this c\u00e1use. But we are called upon to vindicate our general revising power, and its due exercise in this particular case..</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Here, that I may not be charged with arguing upon a hypothetical case,, it is necessary to ascertain what the real question is which this court is now called to decide on.'.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In doing this, it is necessary, to do what, although, in the abstract, of very questionable propriety, appears to be generally acquiesced in, to. wit, to review the case as it originally came up to this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>on the former writ of error. The cause? then, came up upon a case stated between the parties, and under the .practice of that state, having the effect of a special verdict. The case stated brings into view the treaty of peace with Great Britain,.and then proceeds to present the various laws of .Virginia, and the facts upon which the parties found their respective titles. It then presents no particular question, but refers generally to the law arising out of the case. The original decision was obtained prior t\u00f3 the treaty of 1794? but.\u00bfbefore the case was adjudicated in this Court, the treaty of 1794 had been concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The difficulties, of the case arise under the construction, of the.25th section above alluded to, which? as far as it relates to this case, is in these words: \u201c A final -judgment or decree in any suit, in the highest court pf law or equity of a state in which a decision in the suit could be had,\u201d \u201c where is drawn in question the construction of any clause of the. constitution or of a treaty,\u201d \u201c and the decision is against <em>the title </em>set up or claimed by either party under such clause, may be re-exatnined and. reversed, or affirm\u00e9d.\u201d. \u201c But no other error shall be assigned or regarded as \u00e1 ground of reversal in kny such case as aforesaid, than such as appears on the face of th\u00e9 record, and immediately respects the before-mentioned questions of Validity or construction of the said treaties,\u201d &amp;o.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa_\">The first point decided under.this state case was, that the judgment being a part of the record, if that judgment was not such as, upon that case, it -Ho-ht to have been, it was an error apparent on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>face of the record. -But it was contended that the case there stated presented a number of points upon which the decision below may have been found-? r . . - <em>J </em>ed, and that it did not, therefore, necessarily appear to h\u00e1ye been an error immediately respecting a question on the construction of a treaty. But the court held, that as the reference was general to the law arising out of ..the case, if one question arose, which called for the construction of a treaty, and the decision negatived the right set up under it, this court will, reverse that decision, and that it- is the duty of the party who would avoid the inconvenience of this principle, so' to mould the case as to obviate the ambiguity. And under this point arises the question whether this court can inquire into the title of the party, or whether they are so' restricted in their judicial powqrs \u2019 as to be confined to decide on the Operation of a treaty Upon a title previously ascertained to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">If there is any one point in the case on which an opinion may be given with confidence, it is this, whether we consider the letter of the statute, or the spirit, intent, or meaning, of th-? constitution and of the legislature, as expressed in the 27th section, it is equally dear that the title is the primary object to which the attention of the court is called in every such case. The words are, \u201cand th\u00fa decision be against <em>the title,\u201d </em>so set up, not against <em>the construction of the treaty </em>contended for by- the party setting up the title. And how could' it be otherwise ? The title may exist, notwithstanding the decision of the state courts to the contrary; and in that case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>party is entitled to the benefits intended to be secured by the tr\u00e9aty. The decision to his prejudice may have been the result of those very errors, partialities, or defects, in state jurisprudence against which the constitution intended to protect the individual. And if the contrary doctrine be assumed, what is the consequence ? This court may then be called upon to decide on a mere hypothetical case \u2014 to give a construction to a treaty without first deciding whether there Was any interest on which that treaty, whatever be its proper con.str\u00fcction, would operate. This difficulty was felt, and weighed in the case of Smith and. the State of Maryland, and that decision was founded upon the idea that this court was not thus restricted\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">But another difficulty presented itself: the treaty of 1794* had become the supreme law of the land since the judgment rendered in the court below. The defendant, who was at that time an alien, had now become confirmed in his rights under that treaty. This would have been no. objection to- the correctness of the original judgment. Were we, then', at liberty to notice that treaty in rendering the judgment of this court ?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Having dissented from the opinion of this court in the original case, on the question of title, this difficulty did not present itself in my way in the view I then, took of the case. But the majority of this court determined that, as a public law, the treaty was a part of the lavr of every case depending in this <em>court; </em>that, qs such, it was not necessary that it should be spread upon the record, and that it was obligatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>upon this court, in rendering judgment upon this writ of error, notwithstanding the original judgment may have been otherwise unimpeachable. And to this opinion I yielded my. hearty consent; for it cannot be maintained that this court is. bound td give a judgment unlawful at the time of rendering it, in consideration that the same judgment would have been lawful at any prior time. What judgment can now be lawfully rendered'between the parties is the question to which the attention of the court is called. And if the law which sanctioned the original judgment expire, pending an appeal, this court has repeatedly reversed the judgment below* although rendered whilst the law existed. So, too, if the plaintiff in error die, pending suit, and his land descend on an \u00bflien, it cannot be contended that this court will maintain the suit in right of the judgment, in favour of his ancestor, notwithstanding his present disability..</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">It must here be recollected, that this is an action, of ejectment. If the term formally declared upon expires pending the action, .the court will permit the plaintiff to amend, by extending the term \u2014 why ? Because, although the right may have been in him at the commencement of the suit, it has ceased before judgment, and without this amendment he could not have judgment. But suppose the suit were really instituted to obtain possession \u00f3f a leasehold, and the lease expire before judgment, would the court permit the \u00a1party to amend in opposition to the right of the case ? On the contrary, if the term formally declared on were more extensive than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>lease in wnich the legal.title was founded, could they give judgment for more than costs ? . It must b,e recollected that, under this judgment, a <em>writ of restitu\u00ed tion </em>is the; fruit of <em>the </em>law. This, in its very nature, has relation to, and must be founded upon, a present existing right at the time of judgment. And whatever be the cause which takes this right away, the remedy must, in the reason and nature of things, fall with it.</p>\n<p id=\"A1W\">When all these incidental points ar\u00e9 disposed ,of, we find the question finally reduced to this- \u2014 does the judicial power of the United States exteiid to the revision of decisions of state courts, in cases arising under treaties ? But, in order to generalize the question, and present it in the true form in which it presents itself- in this case, we will inquire whether the constitution sanctions the exercise of a revising power over the decisions of state.tribunals in.those cases to which the judicial power of th\u00bb- United States extends ?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">And here it appears to me that the great difficulty is on the other side.- That the real doubt is, whether the state tribunals can constitutionally exercise jurisdiction in any of the cases to which the judicial' power of the United States extends.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">Some cession of judicial power is contemplated by the third article of the constitution: that which is ceded can no longer be retained. . In one of the circuit Courts of the United States, it has been decided (with what correctness I will not say) that the cession of a.power to pass an uniform act of bankruptcy,' although not acted on by the United States, dc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>prives the states o\u00ed tne power oi passing laws to that effect. With regard to the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, it would be difficult to prove that the. states could resume it, if the United States should abolish the courts vested with that jurisdiction; yet, it- is blended with the other cases of jurisdiction, in the second section of the third article, and ceded in the same words. But it is contended that the se? cond section of the third article contains no express cession of <em>jurisdiction; </em>that it. only vests a power in congress to assume jurisdiction to the extent therein expressed. And under this head arose the discussion on the construction proper to be given to that article.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">On this part of the case I shall not pause long. The rules of construction, where the nature of the instrument is ascertained, are familiar to every one. To me the constitution appears, in every line of it, to be a contract, which, in legal language, may be denominated tripartite. The parties are the people, the states, and the United States. It is returning in a circle to contend, that it professes to be the exclusive act of the people, for what have the people done but to form this compact ? That the states are recognised as parties to it is evident from various passages, and particularly that in which the United States guaranty to each state a republican form of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The security and happiness of the whole was the object, and, to prevent disscrdon and collision, each surrendered those powers which might make them dangerous to each other. Well aware of the sensi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>live irritability of sovereign states, where their wills or interests clash, they placed themselves, with regard to each other, on the footing of sovereigns upon the ocean; where power is mutually conceded to act upon the individual, but the national vessel must remain unviolat\u00e9d. And to remove all ground for jealousy and complaint, they relinquish the privilege of being any longer the exclusive arbiters of their own justice, where the rights of others come <em>in </em>question, or the great interests of the whole may be affected by those feelings, partialities, or prejudices, which they meant to put down for ever.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Nor shall I enter into a minute discussion on the meaning of the language of this section. I have seldom found much good result from hypercritical severity, in examining the distinct force of words. Language <em>is </em>essentially defective in precision; more so than those are aware of who are not in the habit of subjecting it to philological analysis. In the case before us, for instance, a rigid construction might be made, which would annihilate the powers intended to be ceded. The words are, \u201c shall extend to;\u201d now that which <em>extends to, </em>does not necessarily <em>include in, so </em>that the circle may enlarge until it reaches the objects that limit it, and yet not take them in. But the plain and obvious sense and meaning of the word <em>shall, </em>in this sentence, is in the future sense, and has nothing imperative in it. The language of the framers of the constitution is, \u201c We are about forming a general government \u2014 when that government is formed, its powers shall extend,\u201d &amp;c. I therefore see nothing imperative in. this clause, and certain!) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>it would have been very unnecessary to use the word in that sense; for, as there was no controlling power constituted, it would only, if used in an imperative sense, have imposed a moral obligation to act. But the same result arises from using it in a future sense, and the constitiition everywhere assumes, as a postulate, that wherever power is given it will be used or at least. used, as. far as the interests of the American people require it, if not from the natural proneness of man to the exercise of power, at least from a sense, of duty, atid the obligation of an oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Nor can I see any difference in the\u2019 effect of the words used in this section, as to the scope of the jurisdiction of the United States5 courts over the cases of the first and second description, comprised in that section. \u201c Shall extend to controversies,\u201d appears to me as comprehensive in effect, as \u201c sljalh extend to all cases.\u201d For, if the judicial power extend <em>\u201c </em>to controversies between citizen and alien,\u201d &amp;c., to what controversies of that description does it not extend? If no case can be pointed out which is ex* cepted, it then extends to <em>all controversies.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">But I will assume the construction as a sound one, that the cession of power to the general government, means no more than that they may assume the exercise of it whenever they chink it advisable. It is clear that congress have hitherto acted under that impression, and my own opinion is in favour of its correctness. But does it not then follow that the jurisdiction of the state court, within the range ceded to the general government, is permitted, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>may be withdrawn whenever congress think prop\u00e9r to do so? A\u00e1 it is a principle that every one may renounce a right introduced for his benefit, wfe will admit that as congress have not assumed such jurisdiction, the state courts may, constitutionally, exercise jurisdiction in such cases. Yet, surely, the general power to withdraw the exercise of it, included in it the right to modify, limit, and restrain that exercise. \u201c This is my domain, put not your foot upon it, if you do, yon are subject to my laws* 1 have a right to exclude yoii altpgetherI have,- then, a right to prescribe the terms of your admission to a participation. As long as you conform to my laws, participate in peace, but I reserve to myself the right of judging how far your acts are conformable to my laws.\u201d Analogy, then, <em>to </em>the ordinary exercise of sovereign authority, Would sustain the exercise of this controlling or revising power.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">But it is argued that a power to assume jurisdiction to the constitutional extent, does not necessarily carry with it a right to exercise appellate power over the state tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">This is \u00e1 momentous question, and pne on which I shall reserve myself uncommitted for each particular case as it shall occur. It is enough, at present, to have shown that congress has not asserted, and this court has not attempted, to exercise that kind of authority in <em>personam </em>over the state courts which would place them in the relation of an inferior' responsible body <em>without their own acquiescence. </em>And I have to\u00f3 much confidence in the state tribunals to believe .that a case ever will occur in which it will b\u00e9 necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>fob the general government to, assume a controlling power over these tribunals.. But is it difficult to 1 . . \u25a0 \u201e . suppose a case which will call loudly for some remedy or restraint? Suppose a foreign minister, or an officer, acting regularly under authority from the United States, seized to-day, tried to-morrow, and hurried the next day to execution. Such cases may occur, and. have occurred, in other Countries. The angry vindictive passions of men have too often made their way into judicial tribunals, and we cannot hope for ever fo escape their baleful influence, in the case supposed, there ought to' be a power somewhere to. restrain .or punish, or the union must be dissolved. At present the uncontrollable exercise of criminal jurisdiction is most\u2019 securely confided to the state tribunals. The courts of the United,States are vested with no power to scrutinize into the proceedings of the state courts in criminal <em>cases; </em>on the contrary\u00bb the general government has, in more than one instance, exhibited their confidence, by a wish to vest them with the execution of their own penal law. And extreme, indeed,-1 flatter myself, must be the c\u00e1se in which the general government could ever be induced to assert .this right; If ever such a case should, qCcur, it will be time enough to decide Upon their constitutional power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"A_S\">But we' know that by the 3d article of the constitution, judicial power, to a certain extent, is vested in the general government, and that by the same instrument, power is given to pass all laws necessary to carry into effect the provisions of the constitution. At present it is only necessary to vindicate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>laws which they have passed affecting civil cage's pending in state tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"A7x\">. . In legislating on this subject, congress, in the true spirit <em>of </em>the Constitution, have proposed to secure fa every one the full benefit of the constitution, without forcing any one necessarily into the courts of \u25a0the United States. With this view, ifi one class of cases, they have not taken away absolutely from the state courts all the cases to which their judicial power extends, but - left it to the plaintiff to bring his action there, originally, if he choose^ or to .the defendant to force the plaintiff into the courts of the United States where they have jurisdiction, and the former has instituted his suit in the state courts., In this case they have not made it legal for the defendant to'plead to the jurisdiction; the effect, of which would be to put an end to the plaintiff\u2019s suit, and oblige him, probably at great risk or -expense, to institute a new action; but the act has given him a right to obtain an order for awemoval, on a petition to the state court, .upon which the cause, with all its. existing advantages, is transferred to the circuit court Of the United States. This, I presume, can be subject to no objection; as the legislature has an \u25a0 unquestionable right to make the ground of removal a ground of ple\u00e1 to the jurisdiction, and the court must then do no more than it is now called upon to do, to wit, give an order or a judgment^ or call it what we will, in favour of that defendant. And so far from asserting the inferiority of the state tribunal, this act is rather that of a superior, inasmuch as the circuit court of the United States becomes bound, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>by that order, to take jurisdiction of the case. This method, so much more unlikely to affect official delicacy than that which is resorted to in the other \u00bb class of cases, might, perhaps, have been more happily applied to all the cases which the legislature thought it advisable to remove from the state courts. But the other class of cases, in which the present is included, was proposed to be provided forin a different manner. And here, again, the legislature of the union evince their confidence in the state tribunals ; for they do not attempt, to give original cognizance to their own circuit courts of such cases, or to remove them by petition and order; but still believing that their decisions will be generally satisfactory* a writ of error is not given immediately as \u00e1 question within the jurisdiction of the United States shall occur, but only in case the decision shall finally, in the court of the last resort, be against the title set up under the constitution, treaty, &lt;5Lc.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In this act I can see nothing which amounts to an assertion of the inferiority or dependence of the state tribunals. The presiding judge of the state court is himself authorized to issue the writ <em>of error., if he </em>will, and thus give jurisdiction to thesupreine court : and if he thinks, proper to decline it, no compulsory process is provid ed by law to oblige him. The party who imagines himself aggrieved is then at liberty to apply to a judge of the United States, who issues the writ of error, which (whatever the form) is, in substance, no more than a mode of compelling the opposite party to appear before this court, and maintain the legality of his judgment obtained before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>state tribunal. An exemplification of a record is the common property of every one who chooses to apply and pay for it, and thus the case and the parties are brought before us; and so Far is the1 court itself from being brought under the revising power of this court, that nothing but the cas\u00e9, as presented by the Record and pleadings of the parties, is considered, and tho opinions of the court are never resorted-to unless for the purpose of assisting this court in forming their own opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The absolute necessity that there was for congress to exercise something'of a revising power over cases and parties in the state courts^ will appear,from this consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Suppose the. whole extent of the judicial power of the United States vested in their own conbts, yet such a provision would not answer all the ends of the constitution, for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">1st. Although the plaintiff may, in such case, have the full benefit of the constitution extended to him, yet the defendant would not; as the plaintiff might force him into the court of the state at hjs election.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">2dly. Supposing it possible so tp- legislate as \u2022 to give the courts of the United States original jurisdiction in all cases avising under the constitution, laws, &amp;c,, in the-words of the 2d section, of the 3d article, .(a point on which I have some doubt, and which, in time might, perhaps, under some, <em>quo minus </em>fiction, or a willing constr\u00faction, greatly accumulate the jurisdiction of tir\u00f3se courts,) yet a very large class of cases would remain unprovided for. incidental questions would ofteri arise, and as a court of competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>jurisdiction in the principal case must decide all such questions, whatever laws they arise under, endless might be the diversity of decisions throughout the union upon the constitution, treaties, and laws, of the United States; a subject on which the tran-, quillity of the union, internally and externally, may materially depend.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">I should feel the more hesitation in adopting the opinions which I express in this case, were I not firmly convinced that they are practical, and may be acted upon without compromitting the harmpny of the union, or bringing humility upon the state tribunals. God forbid that the judicial power in these states should ever, for a moment, even in its humblest departments, feel a doubt of its own independence. Whilst adjudicating on a subject which the laws of the country assign finally to the revising power of another tribunal, it can feel no such doubt. Ah anxiety to do justice is ever relieved by the knowledge that what we do is not final bet weep the parties. And no sense of dependence can be felt from the knowledge that the parties, not the court, may be summoned before another tribunal. With this view, by means of laws, avoiding judgments obtained in the state co\u00fcrts in cases over, which congress has constitutionally assumed' jurisdiction, and inflicting penalties on parties who shall contumaciously persist .in infringing the constitutional rights of Others \u2014 under a lib\u00e9ral extension of th\u00e9 writ of injunction and the <em>habeas corpus ad </em>subjiciendum, I flatter myself that the full extent of the constitutional revising power may be sefcured to the United. States, and tile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>benefits of it to the individual, without ever resorting to compulsory or restrictive process upon the state tribunals; a right which, I repeat again, congress has hot asserted, nt\u00edr has this court asserted, nor does' there appear any-necessity for asserting.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The remaining points in the case being mere questions of practice, I shall make no remarks upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
