No claim was filed for the goods in either -.of the courts below. But, upon'the hearing, the district court dismissed the libel, upon the ground, that the property, to whomsoever belonging, was protected by the 15th article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u00aef the treaty of 1795 with Spain, by. which\u00bb free ships make free <em>goods; </em>and this decree was affirm- \u2022 \u00ae # # # , \u25a0 \u2022 * cd\u00bb upon the same principle, in the circuit court.

Whenever a prize is brought to adjudication in the admiralty, if, upon the hearing of the cause upon the ship\u2019s papers, and the evidence taken in preparatory, the property appears to belong to enemies, it is immediately condemned. <em>If </em>its national character appear doubtful, or even neutral, and no claim is interposed, the court do not proceed to a final decree, but the cause is postponed, with'a view to enable any person, having title, to assert it, within a reasonable time, before the court. This reasonable time has been, by the general usage of nations, fixed to a year and a day after the institution of the prize proceedings ; and if no claim be interposed within that period, the property is deemed V* be abandoned, and is condemned to the captors for contumacy and default of the supposed owner. In the . present case the prescribed period had not elapsed at the time when the district court proceeded to decree a dismissal of the lib\u00e9l. A claim cannot, by the practice of <em>this </em>court, be for the first time interposed here, in prize causes this court can exercise only an appellate jurisdiction,-and between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>parties who have litigated in the court below. We are all, therefore, of opinion that this cause ought to be remanded to the circuit court, with directions to allow the claim to be filed in that court; and, also, to allow the libel to be amended so as to conform to the general allegation of prize, and enable the captors to obtain condemnation of the property,, if the asserted claim shall not be sustained, and the property shall not appear entitled to the protection of the Spanish treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Case remanded.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b320-9\"><em> </em>Vide Appendix, note II,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
