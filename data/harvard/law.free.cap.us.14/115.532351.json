This was an action of ejectment commenced by the plaintiff in error in that court. On the trial of the cause, the plaintiff produced and . read in evidence an entry made on the 25th of Feb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ruary, 1778, in the name of Ephraim! Dunlap, for 400 acres- of land in the point between Tennessee and Holston rivers. Also, a grant to said Dunlap, issued in virtue \u00f3f, and founded: upon,, said- entry, under the great seal , of the state \u00b0f North Carolina, ..dated the 29th of July, 1793;. vvhich grant was duly registered. The plaintiff also, produced, and read in evidence, a. deed, of conveyance, with the certificates of, prob\u00e1\u00ede and, registration endorsed, from Dunlap, the grantee, to John Rhea, Also, a deed -pf conveyance from said Rhea to .the lessor of the plaintiff; It- was also proved that the land lies within the boundaries of what was the state of North Carolina at the time of making said entry, and within;the,'county of Washington; likewise, Within the territory ceded by the state pf North Caroling to the United States, in 1789', and within the now county of Blount, in the district of East Tennessee.; that it lies pn the .south side of Holston. river, and between Big Pige\u00f3jti and Tenn\u00e9&amp;see river,, and west of a line described in the 5.th section of the act of the general assembly pf INorth Carolina, passed-in April, 1778, .chap. 3. Also., within the. tract of country secured-to, the Indians in 1791, by the treaty of Holston, and . that the Indian title thereto was relinquished in 179\u00c1by. the treaty of Telhco, The defendant prbdBc\u00e9d and gave ip evidence* a gr\u00e1n\u00ed . from the \u00e1tate of Tennessee to himself, made opt and authenticated in the manner prescribed by the laws of Tennessee, and, dated the 18th of May, \u00cd810, which covers, and includes the, whole of the land in his possession, and for which-this suit was brought; The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>plaintiff, by Iiis counsel, moved the court to charge pnd. instruct the jury, that, an entry was actually made with the entry, taker of Washington county, within which the land lay; that the entry was evidence that the consideration money was. paid as required by law: that paying the consideration money, jpid making the entry, created a contract between the state of North Carolina and the said Dunlap, which vested <em>a </em>right in him to the land in dispute, and that it was not in the power of the legislature, at a subsequent period, to destroy the right thus' vested,' or rescind Said contract, without the consent of the said Dunlap. That haV-? ing the same land afterwards surveyed and granted, iri the manner prescribed by the laws of North Carolina, vested in the said Dunlap and his heirs a complete title both at law.and in equity; and, that the conveyance. from Dunlap to Rhea, and- from Rhea to the lessor of the plaintiff, vested a complete legal title in him, and,' therefore, he was entitled to a verdict.\u201d Which charge and instruction the court refused to give to the jury ; but, on the contrary,' charged and instructed them, \u201c that the said entry and grant were both null and void, and vested no title whatever in the said. Dunlap, because, at the tipie .of m\u00e1king said entry, and obtaining said grant, the land included therein lay in a part of the . Country where the laws of North Carolina had. not authorized their officers to permit lands to be entered,-or to issue grants therefor; and although the entry and grant might have been piade in the form required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>by law, yet no interest whatever passed from the state of North Carolina to Dunlap thereby*, and, therefore, they <em>ought to </em>find a verdict for the defendant.\u201d A verdict was rendered accordingly, and a judgment pronounced thereon. To which charge and instruction the plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted, and the cause was brought into' this court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-8\"><em>Key, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASP\">The question in this cause turns upon the validity of an act of assembly of North Carolina, of April, 1778, repealing a former act of November, 1777, c. 1. s. 3., under which the plaintiff\u2019s entry was authorized. It is an <em>ex post facto </em>law, which the state is incompetent to pass; its own courts have decided, that a law, depriving a university of its lands, was unconstitutional and void.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> This court has determined that a l&amp;w in the nature of a convention or contract cannot be so repealed as to devest rights of property previously acquired under it.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> As to the Indian' title, the usufruct only, of this waste land, was reserved to <em>them; </em>and. the legislature might grant lands subject to,the extinguishment of their title to the domain of property. This was a mere temporary arrangement, and the title of the natives was. extinguished by the treaty of Tellico. There was, therefore, nothing to prevent an entry of lands anywhere within the territorial limits of North Carolina.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AZad\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>Pickens </em>and Jones, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWn\">1. The correct mode of ascertaining the nature and effect of the <em>contract </em>(as it has been called) between the state and the plaintiff, is by a reference to the plain interpretation of the act of 1777, connected with the local history of that period, and the eircumstance.s of the entry. The law provides, that entries may be made in the several counties of the state of all lands therein* not previously granted, and which shall <em>have, accrued to the state by treaty or conquest; </em>most manifestly implying the necessity of a previous extinguishment of the Indian title. By the treaty of the Long Island of Hdlston, of the 20th of July, 1777, art. 5th, a boundary between. thoTndians and the whites is. defined; and, by art. 6th, the Indians are guarantied against all intrusion. The whole system of local laws establishes a police over the territory in question, with the express view of preventing the natives from being disturbed in the enjoyment of their rights. In 1778, finding that individuals, in the situation of the plaintiff, either wilfully or through mistake* had made entries within the Indian reservation, .the legislature passed an act recognising the limits fixed by the treaty of the year preceding, prohibiting future entries, and avoiding those already made within those limits. 2. But supposing the <em>entry </em>to have been valid as a claim,\u2018or right of pre-emption, against other pitmens, it was hot <em>lawfully </em>consummated by a subsequent survey and patent. Is the entry of such stern, unbending authority, as, by relation back, to dispense with the necessity df subsequent steps ? - Certainly not. By the act of 1783, the Indian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>boundary was changed, in conformity, with the treaty of Hopewell, and the issuing of grants, for land\u00e1 within the reservation was prohibited. The land in question continued by that treaty, and by \u00e1 subsequent treaty made in 1791, between the United States arid the Cherokees, Within the limits of the latter. The surtey and grant were made in opposition to all these treaties and laws; and, in 17.89; North Carolina ceded to the United States, this, territory, in which the state of Tennessee'was erected, in 1791, the treaty of Holston once more guarantiee the Indians against intrusion. So that the. plaintiff\u2019s 'counsel has tp bear up; not only against the municipal laws of the country, but against the. most solemn pacts and conventions.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-8\"><em>Key, </em>in reply.,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak4L\">The plaintiff\u2019s right, commenced by a valid entry, could never be impaired by subsequent laws and treaties. The primitive Indian title Was' merely subordinate, and subject to extinction. If, by the payment of the fees upon his entry, the plaintiff acquired an incipient right under the law then in force, it cannot be effected by any subsequent act. His grant is dated 1793, and a presumptiori thence. arises,' that he had complied with, all preceding requisites. The cession of 1789 contains a reservation for perfecting titles where.entries had been made. The act of 1778 shows, that the former law had allowed arid, countenanced,entries in Washington pounty; it is net . a declaratory, bu.t a repeal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ing statute, showing that the first law had not been mistaken nor misconstrued.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\"><em> Heywood. </em>Trustees of the University v.

Carolina and the chiefs of that part of the Cherokee nation called the <em>Overhill </em>Indians; and that a boundary between the state and the said Indians was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>established. When the legislature of North Caro-''' lina were passing the act of November, 1777? establishing offices for receiving entries of claims fob lands in the several counties within the state, it is improbable that the foregoing circumstances were not contemplated by them; and hence must have arisen the restriction in the act, as to lands \u201c which have accrued, or shall accrue, to this state, by treaty or conquest.\u201d If this be not the ground or reason of the provision, it will be difficult to find one on which it can operate* It may be asked, where was the land which was to accrue by <em>treaty or conquest, </em>if not within the 'chartered limits, of that state ? If it was' in a foreign country, or from a sister State, the re-. striction was unnecessary, because, in either case, it was not within the limits of <em>any,county </em>within that state, and, of course, not subject to b\u00e9 entered for. The restriction must apply, then, to lands within the chartered limits of the state, which it contemplated would be acquired, by treaty or conquest, from the Indian tribes, for none other can.be imagined. It is not to be presumed, that the legislature intended, so shortly after making the treaty, to violate it, by permitting entries to be made west of the line fixed by the treaty. From the preamble \u00f3f the act, as well as other parts of it, it is clearly discernible that- the legislature intended \u201c to parcel out their v\u00e1cant lands to industrious people, for the settlement thereof, and increasing the strength and number of the people of the country, and affording a comfortable and easy subsistence for families.\u201d Would these objects be attained by permitting settlements en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>eroaching \u00f3n the .lands lately, set apart, by treaty, for the use of, the \u00edndiafi tribes ? by provoking hostilities with these tribes, and diminishing the strength\" of the country by a cruel, unnecessary, and unprofitable warfare with them ? Surely not. However broad and extensive the words of the act may be, authorizing the entry takers of any county to receive claims for <em>my lands </em>lying in such county, under certain restrictions, yet, froi\u00e1 the whole context of the act, , the legislative intention, to prohibit and restrict entries from being made on lands reserved for Indian tribes, may be discerned. And this construction is fortified and supported by the,act of April, 1778, passed tp amend and explain the act of November, 1777 ; the 5th section of which expressly forbids the entering or surveying any lands within the Indian hunting grounds, recognises the western boundary, as fixed by the above-mentioned treaty,- .and declares void all entries and surveys which have been, or shall thereafter be made withip the Indian boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">It is objected, that the act of April, 1778, so far as it relates to entries made before its passage, is unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">If the reasoning in the previous part of this opinion be correct, that objection is not well founded. That reasoning is founded upon the act of 1777, and the history and-situation of the country at that time. The act of 1778 is referred to, as a legislative declaration, explaining and amending .the act of 1777. It is argued that there is no recital in the act of 1778, declaring,that the actof 1777 had been misconstrued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>or mistaken by the citizens of the state; or, that entries had been made- on. lands, contrary to the meaning and intention of that act; and, that the'5th section is an exercise of legislative will, declaring null and void rights which had been acquired under.a previous Jaw. Although the legislature may not have made the recital and declaration in the precise terms mentioned, nor used the most appropriate expressions to communicate their meaning, yet it will <em>b\u00e9 </em>seen, by a careful pefusal of the act, that they , profess to explain, as well as to amend, the act of 1777. Upon a full review of all the acts of \u2019the legislature of North Carolina, respecting the manner of appropriating their vacant lands, and construing them <em>in pan materia, </em>there is a uniform intention manif\u00e9sted to prohibit \u00e1nd restrict entries from being made on lands included within the Indian boundaries. Therefore, this court- unanimously affirms the decision of the circuit court with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"c\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b140-9\"> 6 <em>Cranch, </em>87.
