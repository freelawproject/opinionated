The decree of the district court was affirmed in the circuit court, September term, 1814, <em>pro </em>forma, for the purpose of taking the cause., .by appeal, before the supreme court, for its final determination ; which was accordingly done, and the decree of the circuit court, reversed, February term, 1815, except as to the undivided fourth part which Mr., Pinto claimed of certain goods,- part bf the cargo, his claim to. which was relinquished by his counsel, on the argument of the cause before the supreme court. All the other property claimed by Mr. Pinto, for himself and\u2019others, was ordered to be restored to him. The cause was then remanded to the circuit court, with directions to carry the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>cree of the supreme court into 'effect; and the man, date for that purpose was filed in the circuit court* April term, 1815, and. an order made in pursuance of the mandate. It was then stated, and madejo appear to the satisfaction of the circuit court, that, after the Nereid and .her cargo had been libelled by the captors, as prize of war, in the district court, and after the condemnation thereof, except the parts of the cargo which were claimed by Mr. Pinto, and during, the pendency of such claim, Peter H. Schenck* the prize agent of the Governor Tompkins, entered the whole of the cargo of the Nereid at the custom house of the city of New-York, and secured th\u00e9 duties thereon.; Mr. Pinto having consented that the goods, which, he claimed should be entered with the others, and be subject to' the payment of s\u00fcch duties as they were by law liable to, without prejudice to his rights under his claim ; that the prize agent did enter the goods, so condemned, (as also the said goods of which Mr. Pinto claim\u00e9d the one fourth,) as. prize goods, and bonded therefor for prize duties; but was required by the collector of the customs, and did enter all the residue of the goods, claimed by Mr. Pinto, as neutral property* subject to the full duties payable on goods regularly, imported in foreign bottoms, and bonded for the same accordingly. The goods claimed by. Mr. Pinto were afterwards, and before condemnation, sold by the marshal of the district, together wHh the goods condemned, in pursuance of an order of .the district court, to which Mr. Pinto also consented, subject to. the same reservation of his rights; and the proceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>of the .sales of the goods claimed by Mr. Pint\u00f3, after deducting the duties, were paid into court; the amount of the said duties having been paid by the marshal to the prize agent, with the consent of Mr; Pinto, for the prize agent\u2019s indemnity. The difference between the duties thus secui\u2019ed to be paid 'by the prize agent on the goods finally restored to Mr. Pinto, according to the decision of the supreme court, and those whichi would have been payable on them, as prize goods, under the act of the 2d of August, 1813, entitled, \u201c An act for reducing the duties payable on prize goods captured by the private armed vessels of the United States,\u201d amounted to 11.079 dollars and 59 cents. After the mandate and decree of the supreme court, respecting the restitution of the goods claimed by Mr, Pinto, was carried into effect by the circuit court, there remained in the district court the sum of 18,771 dollars and 63 cents, being the amount of the net proceeds of the fourth part of the goods, Mr. Pinto\u2019s claim to which had. been relinquished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"An73\">A motion was made in the circnit court on behalf of Mr. Pinto, that the prize agent should be ordered to pay to him, out of any of the proceeds of the sales of the, condemned part of the Nereid and cargo, and which were in, or might come to, his hands, the said sum of 11,079 dollars and 59 cents, the difference between the two rates of duties on the goods finally restored to Mr. Pinto, as before mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-4\">It then appeared to this court that three bonds had been given, by the prize agent, for the duties on those goods, which were thus ordered to be restored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>to Mr. Pinto; that the two of those bonds which first became due had been paid by the prize, agent; but that the last, which became payable on the -9th \u00f3f F\u00e9bruary, 1815, and which was for the sum of 8,782 dollars and 97 cents, the collector had suffered, as he said, to remain unpaid until it should be asc\u00e9rtained whether the property, on which said duties were thus secured, was condemned to the captors* or restored to the claimant. That after 'the m\u00e1ndate of the supreme. court was returned . to the circuit court, the collector required the prize agent \u2022to pay this bond, arid he paid the same accordingly on the 7 th of April, 1815. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-3\">The court were divided in opinion on the: point respecting' the rates of duties chargeable on the goods so restored to Mr. Pinto; whereupon' it. wras ordered that the said sum of ll,079 dollars 59 cents shall remain subject to the opinion of .the supreme ..court, and that the residue of the 18,77.1 dollars . 65 cents be paid to Mr. Schenck, as the prize agent.

Act of . the 26th of June, 1812, s. 14., which repeals the Non-Importation Act, so far as respects goods \u2018\u2018 captured from the enemy, and made good and la wild prize of warand declares that such goods, \u201cwhen imported and brought into the United States, shall pay the same duties as goods imported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ih American vessels in the ordinary course of trade,\u201d &amp;c. 2d. The act of the 2d of August, 1813, which provide s \u201c that all goods <em>captured from the </em>enemy, and made good and lawful prize of war, &amp;c., and brought into the-United States, shall be allowed a deduction of thirty-three, and one third per centum.\u201d 3d. The acts of non-importation, prohibiting the importation of British goods. 3. The goods in question being of British manufacture, could only bo imported under the Prize Act, and the act of the 2d of August,-1813. They were captured from, the enemy, for they were onboard an enemy\u2019s vessel; ihfcy were <em>taken </em>as enemy\u2019s' property; they were <em>captured and brought in as good and'lawful- prize of war. </em>2. The character of the goods is determined at the time they were brought inf it.is not to be determined by subsequent events: duties are payable on goods on their being first imported or brought in; and the Prize Act\u2019 puts these goods on the, same footing with other importations, and, of course, -makes the duties: oh them payable at the same time. 3. The , word? \u201c good and lawful prize of war,\u201d - refer to the time of capture, and not of condemnation. By the very act of capture, the goods became prize; and being captured by a lawfully commissioned vessel, were good and lawful prize. The expression \u201cstick goods,\u201d' refers to goods so captured: They are to-pay <em>when </em>brought in, and not subsequently, upon condemnation. 4. The condemnation does not make the goods prize of war; it merely puts an end to the <em>jus recuperandi </em>of the former owner, and gives a new title to the purchaser. The character of prize is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>then* either, confirmed by condemnation, or lost by restitution. If the property is restored, it is releas* ed from the character it had before borne from 'the tiipeof ckpture, and ceases to be prize of war, but being captured and brought in as such, is to pay the prize duties. ;</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-3\">Pinkney, for the respondents and captors;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGo\">The' question now raised seemed to .be. settled by the decisi\u00f3n in the case of the. Concord, at the last term. But, independently of authority, the question, is .manifestly against the claimant. ; 1. The goods were not entered- under the Prize Act, and. the act of the 2d of August, 1813; but as neutral property imported in a foreign bottom,, and having been sold,., are evidently liable to the full duties on such goods,, unless these. acts authorize a diminution of them* 2. 'These acts do not authorize such, diminution; the goods were not captured <em>from the enemy, </em>and haye. never been <em>made good and bwfulprize. </em>They were taken from Mr. Pinto,, who was no enemy, either in fact or constructively, according to the, judgment of the court. If any thing, then, has made them law* ful prize, h\u00f3w has. it happened that they have been <em>restored\u25a0? </em>The claimant\u2019s counsel, to avoid the ap* pearance of too bold a paradox, mitigates his conclusion on this head in such a way as proves nothing for the purpose of his argument. He \u00e9nds with saying,,that these goods were <em>captured </em>and <em>brought inito the United States as </em>good and lawful prize;. He-can scarcely, however, have intended to stop here; for if his conclusion goes no farther, it surrenders the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>whole argument, unless it can be shown that to seize and bring jn as prize that which is not good and lawful prize, and never can becom\u00e9 so, makes good and lawful prize of the thing so seized and brought m; or, in other words, that a seizure,and bringing in, <em>as </em>prize,, of neutral property, makes it, <em>ipso </em>jure, good priz\u00e9, although the owner is, nevertheless, entitled to have it again, as <em>riot </em>being good prize, and has, ia fact, got it again accordingly. 3. The character of these goods, with reference to their liability to duty, was not determined at the time they were brpught in. If they had been specifically restored, and withdrawn from the United States by the claimant, they would have been liable to no duty. 4. The words \u201c made good and lawful prize,\u201d do not refer to the captur\u00e9 merely: the act speaks of the capture first, and then adds, \u201c and made good and lawful prize.\u201d The capture, too, must be of <em>enemy\u2019s </em>goods, either in fact, or in contemplation of la w. To say, that the goods are, by the act of capture, made good and lawful prize, because the capture is made by a <em>lawfully </em>commissioned cruiser, is to drop more than a moiety of the definition' of <em>good and lawful </em>prize, or, rather, to insist on that which is not an essential part of its definition. Prize may be made (as a droit) by a <em>non-commissioned captor; </em>but <em>good and lawful prize </em>cannot be made by any captor, unless the goods be liable to condemnation. It is the <em>formula </em>of a sentence of condemnation, to \"condemn the thing taken as \u201c good and lawful prize\u201d to the captors; and this, not because it was taken by a lawfully \u25a0commissioned cruiser, out because, being so taken, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>was under all the circumstances' subject to confisca* tion. 5. Capture gives possession; but it is the con-. demnation which ascertains that the things taken are good prize of war: until condemnation, it cannot be known whether they are good prize or not. But, ., certainly, it is self-evident, that after restitution \u2019it must be held, that they were <em>not </em>good prize. The condemnation does more than destroy the <em>jits recuperandi. </em>It establishes what nothing else can establish, that the goods were lawful prize. . Restitution, on the other hand, establishes, conclusively;, that they <em>never were </em>lawful prize, although they might be justifiably seized, upon probable cause, as such.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Avv\">Marshall, Ch.
