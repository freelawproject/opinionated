The captured vessel was on her way, under the direction of a prize master and crew, to the port of Salem for adjudication. The indictment laid the of-fence as committed upon the high seas. The ques-, tion made was, whether the circuit court has jurisdiction over common law oifences against the United States ? on which the judges of that court were divided in opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-8\">The <em>Attorney-General </em>stated that he had given to this case an anjdous attention:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3Ad\">as much so, he hoped, as his public duty, under whatever view of it, rendered necessary. That he had al,so examined the opinion of the court, delivered at February term, 1813, in the case of the United States v. Hudson and Goodwin. That considering the point as decided in that case, whether with, or without, argument, on the part of those who had preceded him as the rfcua' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>sentative of the government in this court, he desired respectfully to state, without saying more, that it was not his intention to argue it now.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-4\">, Story, J., I do not .take the question to be settled by. that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-5\">Johnson,.

Whenever counsel can be found ready to argue it, I shall devest myself of all prejudice arising from that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-7\">. Livingston, J. I am disposed to hear an argument o.'. the point. This case-was brought up for that purpose, but until the question is re-argued, the case of the United States v. Hudson and Goodwin must be taken as law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AmO\">Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alq\">delivered the opinion, ol the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Upon the question now before the court a difference of opinion has existed, and still exists, among the members of the court. We should, therefore, have been willing to have heard the question discussed upon solemn argument. But the attorney-general has declined to argue,,the cause; and no counsel appears for the defendant. Under these circumstances the court would not choose to review their former decision in the case of the United States v. Hudson and Goodwin, or draw it into doubt. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>will, therefore, certify an opinion to the circuit court in conformity with that decision. <em>J .</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4L\">Certificate for the.defendant.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\"><em> </em>Vide, 1 Gallison, 488, for the learned and elaborate opinion of Mr. J.
