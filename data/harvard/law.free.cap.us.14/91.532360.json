The case of Hepburn &amp; Dundas v.

The subsequent c\u00e1se of Strawbridge et al. v. Curtis et al. shows that all the parties on the one side, and all the parties on. the other, must be. authorized to sue and be sued in those, courts, or there is .a defect of jurisdiction. The right of action was joint, but they might have, severed it, which they, did not, and they are incompetent to join ip point of jurisdiction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-7\">Key, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A57\">A citizen of the Mississippi. territory has a right to sue in the courts of . the United States. This point was left, open in the decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the case of Sere v. Pitot.<footnotemark>c</footnotemark> There is a manifest distinction, in this respect, between the right of a citizen of the district of Columbia, and of the Mississippi territory. The jurisdiction of the district court of Louisiana, is the same with that of .Kentucky; The several territories <em>are </em>\u201c members of the American confederacy.\u201d The constitution puts the citizens of the district of Columbia on the same footing with inhabitants of. lands ceded for the use of dock--, yards, &amp;c.; they <em>arc not </em>\u201cmembers of the American confederacy.\u201d The district has no legislative, executive, nor judicative authority, power, or privileges. The territories have them all. They ar\u00e9 in a sort of minority and pupilage; have the present right of sending delegates to Congress, and of being here-\u2019, after admitted to all.the.immunities of <em>states^, </em>in the peculiar sense of the constitution. In this c\u00e1se, each party takes an undivided interest, and has a right to a separate action,'whether the inheritance;.be of moyeable or of real property.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-5\">Harper,in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYO\">There is no distinction, in'this-particular, between the district of Columbia and the territories. Congress might give to the district a delegate, with the. same privileges as- the delegates from the territories. The United States are the common sovereign of all these communities; and may grant or refuse this, or any other, privilege, at their pleasure.- The action is brought jointly, not each claiming his 'several part; and the court cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>disconnect- the parties. The petitioners, complain under the civil law, by the rules of which it. i,s not \u2019 <em>J </em>. competent for them to seyer.. Spanish law; which prevailed in Louisiana before its acquisition by this country, is a modification of the Roman. By the civil law, inheritances of real as well as personal property, are joint. What is the mode of proceeding? Though ambiguous and mixed, it is chiefly the civil law process, like our chancery proceedings. All parties must, therefore, regularly h\u00e1ve been before the court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\"><em> </em>2 <em>Crunch, </em>445.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"c\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\"> 6 <em>Cranch, </em>336.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A0N\">Marshall, Ch.

Ellzey, this court determined,, on. mature consideration, that a citizen of the district of Columbia could not maintain a. suit in the circuit court of the United Stpteg., That opinion is still retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">It has been attempted t\u00f3 distinguish, a <em>Territory </em>from the- district of Columbia ;' but the court is of opinion, that this distinction cannot be maintained, They may .differ in. many respects, but neither, of them is a state,'in the Sense in which that term is used in the constitution. . Every reason assigned for the opinion of the court, that a citizen of Columbia was not capable of suing in the courts of the United States, under.the Judiciary Act, is equally applicable to a citizen of a territpry. Gabriel Winter, then,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>being a citizen of the Mississippi Territory, was incapable of maintaining a suit alone in the circuit' court of Louisiana. Is his case mended by being associated with others who are capable of suing in that court ? In the case of Strawbridge et al. v. Curtis et al., it was decided, that where a joint interest is prosecuted,. the jurisdiction cannot be sustained, unless each individual be entitled to claim that jurisdiction. In this case it has been doubted, whether the parties might elect to. sue jointly or s\u00e9verally. However this may be, having elected to sue jointly, the court is incapable of distinguishing their case, so far as respects jurisdiction, from one in which they were compelled to unite. The circuit court of Louisiana, therefore, had no jurisdiction of the cause, and their judgment must, on that account, be reversed, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"b\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\"><em> </em>3 <em>Cranch, </em>262.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
