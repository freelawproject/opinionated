Holstoft. The plaintiff claimed by virtue of a grant, issued' by the state of North. Carolina, bearing date the th of December, 1791. The defendant claimed under a grant from the state of Tennessee\u2019, bearing dat\u00e9 the 2d of January, 1809. The defendant, by his Counsel, obj\u00e9ct\u00e9d to the grant under Which the plaintiff cl\u00e1im\u00e9d title being admitted in evidence, on the. ground that it was for land which the laws of North Carolina had prohibited from being efttef\u00e9d, surveyed, or granted. The court sustained the objection, and prohibited the grant from going in eyid\u00e9hce-to the jury; whereupon a verdict \u00bfnd judgment was rendered in favour <em>of </em>the -defendant <em>A </em>bill of exceptions was taken, to the' opinion of the court, and the cause was. brought up to-this court. by \u25a0prfit.of error.</p>\n<p id=\"AuL\">The correctness of the opinion of the circuit court depends on the sound construction of the act of the general \u00e1ssembly of the state of North Carolina, \u00edpassed in 1783, c. 2. s. 5 and 6, whereby the lands, within certain limits therein' designated, (including the lands in controversy') are reserved for the Ch\u00e9<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>pekee Indians,; and the citizens prohibited from enter-; jpg. and surveying lands within those limits. It is contended, on the part of the plaintiff, that this act cannot be construed, nor did the legislature mean to give the Indians a' <em>right of property </em>in the soil, but merely the <em>use and enjoyment </em>of it. That the succeeding legislatures, by the acts of 1784, <em>1786, </em>and 1789, have changed this reservation for the use of the Indians, and given unlimited access, for tne purposes of making entries and surveys \u201c to all lands not before specially located,\u201d and io 44 all vacant lands\u201d within the limits of the state. Consequently, locations could be made, and grants issued to perfect titles of lands, lying within the limits of the Indian reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Whether the legislature had the power, or intended to give the Indians a <em>right of property </em>in the soil, .or merely <em>the use and enjoyment </em>of it, need not be inquired into, nor decided, by this court; for it is perfectly clear, that the 5th section of the act of 1783, c. 2., prohibits all persons from making entries. pr surveys for any lands within the bounds set apart for'the Cherokee Indians, and declares all such entries and grants thereupon, if any should be made, utterly void: They had the power, and have declared, unequivocally, an intention, to prohibit entries from being made within thos\u00e9 reservations. The several acts of .1784, 1786, and 1789, although, they contain general expressions, which, if taken singly, might seem to sanction entries and surveys for 44 all lands not before specially located,\u201d or to 44 all vacant lands;\u201d yet, when taken together, these gene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ral expressions must be controlled by the restrictions and prohibitions as to the reservations for the Indian tribes. The reasoning used in the case of Preston v. JBrowder, applies with equal, if not greater, propriety, to this case. And, although at different periods different sections of these reservations have been subjected to appropriation by entries and surveys, it has been in consequence of the several treaties with the Indians, by which the boundaries of the reservations have been .altered, and the . Indian claim, extinguished; but it is believed, that the mere ear-. <em>tinguishment </em>of the Indian title did not subject the land to appropriation, until an act of .the legislature authorized. or permitted it. Whatever doubts this court might entertain on this subject, were they now construing these laws upon the first impression, that doubt would be removed on a view .of the case, of Avery v. Strother, in the Reports in Conference, p. 43i;, decided bythe judges of the supreme court'of North Carolina. This is a decision directly in point\u2019, made by.the supreme court of the state, construing the laws brought into the view of this court, and is decisive of this case. And; as this court have been uniformly disposed to pay great resp\u00e9ct to the decisions of the state, courts respecting titles to real estate, this decision has its full influence on the present question; and, therefore, the judgment of the circuit court is unanimously affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
