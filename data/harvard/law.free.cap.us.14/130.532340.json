This cause was argued by <em>Hughes </em>and <em>Talbot, </em>for the appellants, and Hardin, for the respondents. It was, principally, a question of fact arising under the local laws of real property in Kentucky, for an outline of which the general reader is referred to the Appendix, note I., where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Will be found an exposition of the elementary principles, applicable to this class of Causes. '</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b151-3\">Marshall, Ch. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYK\">delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">This is . an. appeal from a decree of the circuit court of Kentucky, by which the plaintiff\u2019s bill was' dismissed:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The object of the-suit is to-enjoin the proceedings of the defendant at law, and to obtain from him a conveyance for so much of the land contained in his patent as interferes with the entry and survey made by th\u00e9 plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The plaintiff claims by virtue of an entry made on the 17th of January, 1784, the material part of which is set forth in the bill in these words : \u201c Richard Masterson enters 22,277 and a half acres of land, on treasury warrant No. 19,455, to be laid off in a parallelogram twice as long, as wide, to include a mulberry tree marked thus, \u201c F,\u201d and two hiccories, with four chops in each, to include the said three marked trees near the centre .thereof j the said trees standing near the Hunter\u2019s trace, leading from Bryant\u2019s station over to the waters of Hinkston, on the dividing ridge between the waters of Hinkston and the <em>waters </em>of Elkhorn.\u201d This entry has been surveyed, he states, according to location, and that part of it which covers the land in controversy has been assigned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The validity of this entry constitutes the most essential point in the present controversy. If it cannot be sustained, there is an end of the plaintiff\u2019s title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>if it can,'other points arise in the case which must he. decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">This question depends on the construction of that clause in the land law which requires that warrants shall be located so specially and precisely, as that others may be enabled, with certainty, to locate other Warrants oh the adjacent residuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">' In the construction of. an act so interesting to the people of Kentucky, it is of vital importance that principles be adhered to with care, and that as much uniformity as is. practicable be observed in judicial decisions. This court has ever sought, with solicitude, for the true . spirit of the law, as settled in the state tribunals, and has conformed its judgments to the rules of those tribunals whenever it has been able to find them established.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">In the cases which have been, on different occasions, examined, that absolute certainty which would remove every doubt from the mind of a subsequent locator, appears never to have been required. The courts of Kentucky have viewed locations with that indulgence which the state of the country, and the general character of those who first explored and settled it, would seem to justify; and have required only that reasonable certainty- which was attainable in such a country, and might be expected from such men as were necessarily employed. The effort has been to sustain rather than to avoid entries; and, although the motives which led to this course of adjudication are inapplicable to late entries, made on Ja,nd supposed to be previously appropriated, yet it is not understood that different rules of construction-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>have. ever been applied to entries of different dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\">By these rules, a certainty to a common intent, a description which will not mislead a subsequent lo~ eator, which will conduct him, if .he uses reasonable care and diligence, to the place where the objects are to be found, will satisfy the law, and sustain the <em>.entry; </em>but s\u00fcch a certainty must exist, or th\u00e9 entry cannot.be sustained. .</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">A location- usually consists of some general description which, designates the place in which\u2019the particular object is to be found, and of a description of the particular object itself. The general description must be such as would enable a man intending to locate the adjacent residuum, by making those inquiries which would be in his power,' and which he would naturally make, to know the plae\u00e9 in which he-was . to search for the particular or locative call, so nearly,. that, by a reasonable search, he might find the object mentioned in that particular or locative call, and avoid the land located. If-the description- will fit a different place better, or equally well, ;it is too .defective, because, if it does not mislead the subsequent locator, it leaves him in doubt where to search.</p>\n<p id=\"AxB\">The general description in this case is, \u201c the Huntfer\u2019s trace,- leading from Bryant\u2019s station over, <em>ter </em>the waters, of Hinkston, on the dividing ridge between the waters of Hinkston and the waters of Elk-horn.\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Will this description designate ithe place! in which the tfe\u00e9s called for in the location are.t\u00f3 be found \u25a0?</p>\n<p id=\"AgaU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Bryant\u2019s station is a fixed place of public, noto r\u00ede* ty. It is on the great road leading from Lexingtoii T \u2022 ' \u2022 , . i . , \u00b0 i \u00ae to Limestone, on the Ohio, which road crosses the dividing ridge between'the waters of Elkhorn and Licking, which is the ridge mentioned in MastersonV entry. This road had been travelled by hunters, but seems to have been known by the name of the Blue Lick, or Buffalo trace, and .-not by the name of the Hunter\u2019s trace.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">A trace which was, at the time, called the Hunr ter\u2019s trace, leaves this great -road at Bryant\u2019s station, and proceeds in a direction west of north, until it crosses North Elkhorn, where it divides : the left-hand, or more western trace, after entering a road .leading from Lexington to Riddle\u2019s station, on Licking, or that branch of Licking called Hinkston, crosses the dividing ridge about the head waters of \u00e1 creek now called Townsend, which empties into the stream running by Riddle\u2019s station a little above_ that station.- This creek was; in the year. 1784, known by the name of Hinkston Creek, or, perhaps, Hinkston\u2019s Mill Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The right; or more eastern fork, again divides nearly two miles before it reaches the dividing ridge, Each of these trices crosses the dividing ridge to the head waters of Cooper\u2019s run, which empties into Stoner\u2019s fork. ' The more eastern of them crosses Stoner\u2019s fork, and, passing Mas tin\u2019s station, terminates very near that place. Cooper\u2019s run empties into Stoner\u2019s fork, which either empties' into Hinkston, and then passing by Riddle\u2019s station, empties into Licking; or, uniting with Hinkston, forms, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>south fork of Licking, and passes Riddle\u2019s station with that name. The river, from the junction between Stoner and Hinkst'on, seems to have been known both by the name of the South Fork and of Hinkston\u2019s Fork. .</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">All these traces were, in f\u00e1ct, hunters\u2019 traces; but eadh of them, except that leading to Mastin\u2019s station, was distinguished by some name peculiar to itself, generally by the station or place to which it led, as Riddle\u2019s trace, the Blue Lick trace, &amp;c.; and no one of them, except that leading to Mastin\u2019s', was notoriously and pre-eminently called \u201c the Hunter\u2019s trace.\u201d There is some testimony that this was also known by the name of Mastin\u2019s trace; but the great mass of testimony in the cause proves, incontrcvertibly, that this trace was known and distinguished, generally, by the peculiar appellation of \u201c the Hunter\u2019s trace.\u201d It is on this trace that the location was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The Hunter\u2019s trace, then, used in such a manner as to satisfy those interested in the inquiry, that it was intended to be employed as the name of some particular trace, would have been considered as designating the trace leading from Bryant\u2019s to Mastin\u2019s station, and would have been sufficient to show that the lands located by Masterson were on that trace. Had no farther description of it been attempted, but the trees called for had been said to stand on \u201c the Hunter\u2019s trace,\u201d where it crosses the dividing ridge between the waters of Hinkston and Elkhorn, it would have been clear that the trace was referred to by its name of greatest notoriety, by a name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>which no other trace <em>received; </em>and, both the trace and the part of the trace where, th'e objects specially-called for must be found, would (have been designated with sufficient certainty. There is no evidence in this cause, nor is the court apprized that any other trace, distinguished as \u201c the Hunter\u2019s trace,\u201d led from any other place than. JBryanfs station, over the dividing ridge between the waters of Elkhorn and Hinkston, and, consequently, a reference to this trace, by its name, was all that was necessary for its designation, and would hav\u00e9 designated, it most unequivocally. But a farther description has been attempted, and this, has produced the difficulty felt in deciding this, cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">It will not be pretended, that the-locator was confined to this reference to the name, or might not add to the description, and make it more minute; but if, in doing so, he has destroyed its certainty, if he has created doubts with respect to the trace. intended,, which may mislead subsequent locators, the validity -of his location becom\u00e9s questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The words added to the Hunter\u2019s trace\u201d are, \u201c leading from Bryant\u2019s station over to the waters of Hinkston.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">These words are hot unme\u00e1ning, nor does the court feel itself authorized to reject them as surplus-age <em>; </em>nor do they form any part of the name of the trace. Why, then, are they introduced? Subsequent locators might consider them as explanatory of the words \u201c the Hunter\u2019s trace.\u201d If,they are so explanatory, there is, o, rtainly, much plausibility afforded to the conclusion, that the locator did not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>mean to refer to the trace by its. name .; for if such was his intention, (there being no other trace, \u00f3f the same name,) a farther description would be unnecessary, and a more particular description would be impossible. Perplexity and confusion may be introduced, but an object cannot be. rendered more certain than by bestowing on it its particular and appropriate name, if that name be one of general notoriety. The court felt the- force of the argument, that i4- the Hunter\u2019s trace,\u201d leading. from Bryant?s station over to the, waters of Hinkston, might be understood in the same sense with the words <em>^ </em>the Hunter\u2019s trace,\u201d or, 44 that hunter\u2019s trace which leads from Bryant\u2019s station over to the waters of Hinkston.\u201d Understood in th\u00e1t sense, the additional and, explanatory p\u00e1rt of the description might be Considered as its essential part, and might control the words 44 the Hunter\u2019s trace,\u201d which, connected as they are in this description, are not incapable- of application to other hunters\u2019 traces, though not usually designated by that particular name.. If this wer\u00e9 to be received as the true construction, there are s\u00f3 many oth\u00e9r traces leading across this dividing ridge, from Bryant\u2019s station to the waters of Hinkston, that all pretension to certainty, in this location, must be surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">On this part of the case, the court has felt considerable difficulty; and it is not without hesitation, that it has finally adopted the opinion, that 44 the Hunter\u2019s trace\u201d is to be considered as referred to by its name; and, that the additional words; 44 leading from Bryant\u2019s station over to th\u00e9 waters of Hinkston,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>are nearly an affirmation that \u201c the Hunter\u2019s traee,\u2018 does lead from that station to. those waters. It leads to Stqner\u2019s fork, which empties into, or unites with, Hinkston\u2019s fork, which afterwards empties into the. main Licking. These branches are,, all of them* called forks of Licking, and, therefore, it would seem to the court reasonable, .(as is indeed indicated, (by much of the testimony,) that this ridge was rather-considered as dividing the wafers of Elkhorn from those of Licking than from those of Hinkston. But Stoner\u2019s fork, to which this trace leads, may, without impropriety, be denominated, as it, sometimes has been denominated^. \u201c the Waters of Hinkston.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">It cannot escape notice, that if this trace had been designated as. that leading to Mastin\u2019s station, it would have been freed from all ambiguity. But it, has been decided in Kentucky, and necessarily so decided, that a locator ought not to be held to the most certain description . of which the place is susceptible. A description which distinguishes it from any other, although a better or still more certain description might be given, is all that is required,.</p>\n<p id=\"Azj\">Having, with, much difficulty, ascertained the trace, the neyt inquiry is, on what part of this trace the land, entered by Masterson ought' to lie. The location says, generally,.\u201c on the dividing ridge between the waters of Hinkston and the waters of Elkhorn.\u201d It has been objected, that neither the side of the ridge nor the side of the trace, is sp\u00e9eified; and that, to search both sides of the-ridge and of the trace, is imposing an unreasonable labour, on subsequent locators. The court does not think so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The ridg\u00e9 is not of such breadth as to render the search on both sides the trace, from the foot of the ridge on one 'side, to the foot of the ridge on the other, a very unreasonable one. But the trees must be found on the ridge, and a subsequent locator is not bound to search for them elsewhere. The trees having in thems\u00e9lv\u00e9s no notoriety, it is the mor\u00e9 necessary that the place on which they stand should be correctly \u25a0 described, and so described, that persons interested in discovering them, might know how to find them. Let us then examine the testimony to this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Richard Masterson, who made the location, provea the place where the. trees stood. They abe now cut down, but a mulberry stump remains, which is the stump of the tree he marked, is No. 33., west three poles from a white oak, now standing. He gives no description of the plage;</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Henry Lee was with Masterson when he marked the trees, and saw him mark them, They had been hunting on the trace on Cooper\u2019s <em>run; </em>and, on their return, he says, \u201c on the aforesaid trace, or path, <em>after crossing the dividing </em>ridge, near \u00e1 srhall branch waters of Elkhorn, Richard Masterson marked,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">This testimony would rather indicate that, in the opinion of the witness, the trees did not stand on the. ridge.,</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Simon Kenton describes the crooked oak mentioned by Masterson and Jay: \u201c it does not stand on the dividing ridge.\u201d On being further interrogated he says, \u201c he well believes tftat the crooked oak stands on ground which is a spur of the dividing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ridge which leads down to the junction of the branches,\u201d which .unite a small distance below the mulberry stump.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\">Jri the course of his examination, .this witness says, that if he could not have found these trees on. the ridge,. and had found them where they stood, he. should have taken them, for the trees called for in Mastersorfs entry; but. in no part of his testimony does he indicate that he would have searched for them on the spur where they stood.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Zachariah Easton, the surveyor, gives a very accurate description of the place. The mulberry stump stands between two branches, three , poles from the eastern, thirty poles from the western, and. forty one poles from their junction.' Along the trace, which crosses the branch several times, the stump is one hundred and ninety poles from the top of the ridge. The stump stands, not on the dividing ridge itself, hut on a spur of the ridge, which doesn\u00f3t continue along the trace, but .takes a direction west thereof and unites with the main ridge, as would seem from . tHe plat, sixty or seventy poles west oE the point at which the trace crosses it.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Not a single witness deposes that , the stump is on the ridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">No testimony has been offered-to \u00edhe co\u00fart to ittd\u00face. the opinion that, in Kentucky, a spur of a ridge <em>ii </em>considered as the ridge itself, and the contrary seems reasonable. Spurs sometimes extend' for considerable distances, and are certainly distinguishable from the ridge from which they project. If, in this &lt;?ase, the trace had led up this spur, a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>locator migffi: have considered it as a continuation of the ridge, But the trace does not lead up the spur. \u2022 It crosses a branch after passing the spur, ana Then comes to the ridge. The court is of opinion that subsequent locators could not be expected to continue their search after reaching the foot of the ridge, and that the description fails in stating the marked trees to be on the dividing^ ridge, instead of stating them To be on a spur of the dividing ridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The decree, therefore, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill, is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Decree affirmed,.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
