The plaintiffs alleged that a motor vehicle purchased from the defendant Lipman Motors did not perform as the plaintiffs had been led to expect. The facts are fully set out <em>in Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>184 Conn. 607, 440 A.2d 810 (1981). Originally, the action was brought in six counts but all the counts were dismissed by the trial court for the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to present a prima facie case. On appeal, this court remanded the case to the trial court for retrial on the three counts alleging breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>supra. Upon retrial, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendants on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The plaintiffs have appealed to this court alleging error (1) in the trial court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act; (2) in the trial court\u2019s failure to find a breach of express warranty; and (3) in the trial court\u2019s failure to find a breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The trial court filed a lengthy and detailed memorandum discussing each of these issues. <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 107, 471 A.2d 980 (1982). After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs of the parties and their arguments, we conclude that there is no error in the trial court's judgment \u201cand that the memorandum of decision filed by the trial court adequately and properly disposes of the contentions of the parties before us. That decision may be referred to for a detailed discussion of the facts and the applicable law. It would serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>no useful purpose to repeat them here.\u201d <em>Ribicoff </em>v. <em>Division of Public Utility Control, </em>187 Conn. 247, 248, 445 A.2d 324 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
