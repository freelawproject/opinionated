In the first case, the defendant was charged with risk of injury under General Statutes \u00a7 53-21<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sexual assault in the fourth degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1) (A)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> resulting from actions involving a thirteen year old female on October 16,1981. In the second case, the defendant was charged with three counts of risk of injury under \u00a7 53-21 resulting from actions involving a fifteen year old female on October 27 and November 3, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The jury might reasonably have found the following facts: At the time of the incident in the first case, the defendant, Dennis M. Perruccio, was an electronics shop teacher at Ellis Technical School in Danielson. A thirteen year old girl was enrolled in a one week introductory course in the defendant\u2019s shop program. On October 16, 1981, the defendant followed this girl into an empty locker room. When the defendant asked her for a good-bye kiss, she kissed him on the cheek. The defendant kissed her, then put his right hand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>underneath her shirt and felt her left breast, outside of her bra. He then pushed her bra up and felt her breast again. He tried to put his left hand down inside the back of her pants, but she resisted. A few days later, the girl informed her parents of the incident. School officials were notified in mid-November.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In the second case, a fifteen year old girl met the defendant at a dance at Ellis Technical School in the spring of 1980. Although the girl was not a student at Ellis at that time, she enrolled there in the fall of 1980. On October 27, 1980, she remained alone after school with the defendant to make posters. The defendant had previously requested and received permission from the girl\u2019s mother allowing her daughter to remain after school. After the defendant told the girl that they had to go out to buy poster materials, they left the school together in the defendant\u2019s car and proceeded to the defendant\u2019s home in Norwich. When they arrived at the house, the defendant invited the girl into his house. They sat on a couch together, listened to music, and talked while the girl drank a beer. While on the couch, the defendant kissed the girl and touched her breasts under her clothes. The defendant then carried her into the bedroom, undressed her, and had sexual intercourse with her. The girl testified that she did not resist any of the defendant\u2019s advances or actions because she was too afraid of what would happen if she tried to stop the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">On November 3,1980, the defendant again arranged to have the fifteen year old girl stay after school. They again went to the defendant\u2019s house and had intercourse. This time, however, both removed their own clothes. After both incidents, the defendant told the girl not to tell anyone because he would get into trouble. She, in fact, did not inform anyone of these incidents until November of 1981 when she gave a statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>After consolidation of these two cases and a trial by jury, the defendant was found guilty of all charges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant timely appealed in each case, and on January 3, 1983, this court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for consolidation of the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In the first case involving the thirteen year old girl, the issues presented are: (1) whether \u00a7 53-21 as applied to the defendant is void for vagueness and thus unconstitutional, and (2) whether \u00a7\u00a7 53-21 and 53a-65 et seq. form an unconstitutional statutory pattern and violate the principle of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The defendant maintains that the application of \u00a7 53-21 in this case violates his due process rights since the statute is void for vagueness. He argues that his conduct was not violative of \u00a7 53-21 for two reasons: (1) the touching of the breast is not an act prohibited by \u00a7 53-21, and (2) even if this court decides that such an act violates \u00a7 53-21, the defendant did not have fair warning at the time the incident occurred. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">This court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 428 A.2d 322 (1980), recently set out the basic principles to be considered when a statute is attacked as void for vagueness. First, the constitutionality of the challenged statute is to be determined by the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue. Id., 57. \u201c[Tjhat a statutory provision may be of questionable applicability in speculative situations is usually immaterial if the challenged provision applies to the conduct of the defendant in the case at issue.\u201d Id., 58. Second, the statute must give fair warning in order to enable a person to know what conduct he must avoid. \u201c[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law.\u201d Id., 60, citing <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926). Thus, \u201ca penal statute may survive a vagueness attack solely upon a consideration of whether it provides fair warning.\u201d Id., 61. \u201cReferences to judicial opinions involving the statute, the common law, legal dictionaries, or treatises may be necessary to ascertain a statute\u2019s meaning to determine if it gives fair warning.\u201d Id., 62-63, citing <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>423 U.S. 48, 50, 96 S. Ct. 243, 46 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The conduct of the defendant in sliding his hand under the thirteen year old girl\u2019s bra and feeling her breast is the claimed \u201cact likely to impair the . . . morals of [a] child\u201d under \u00a7 53-21. The defendant argues that there must be a touching of \u201cprivate parts\u201d for an act to come within the statute and that a breast does not qualify as such a \u201cprivate part.\u201d An examination of \u00a7 53-21 reveals that the term \u201cprivate parts\u201d is not employed; there is nothing in the statute suggesting that such an area of the body need be touched before a violation occurs. Furthermore, we have never held that it is necessary that a defendant touch the \u201cprivate parts\u201d of a victim in order to commit an offense under the risk of injury statute. Quite to the contrary, we held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>150 Conn. 245, 188 A.2d 65 (1963), that the risk of injury statute proscribed two general types of behavior likely to injure physically or impair the morals of a minor under sixteen years of age: \u201c(1) deliberate indifference to, acquiescense in, or the creation of situations inimical to the minor\u2019s moral or physical welfare\u201d and \u201c(2) acts directly perpetrated on the person of the minor and injurious to his moral or physical well-being.\u201d Id., 250. The first of these two categories clearly indicates that it is not necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>have any touching of any part of the body to violate \u00a7 53-21; the creation of a prohibited situation is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Although we recognize that a direct \u201ctouching\u201d is not a necessary element to a \u00a7 53-21 offense, we find in this appeal that the defendant\u2019s \u201ctouching\u201d of the breast was an act \u201cdirectly perpetrated on the person of the minor and injurious to his moral . . . well-being.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>supra, 250. Section 53-21 does not specify the \u201cacts\u201d or \u201csituations\u201d deemed \u201clikely to impair the morals of [a] child\u201d; hence, we look to the penal code for guidance since \u00a7 53a-2 states that \u201cthe provisions of this title shall apply to any offense defined in this title <em>or the general statutes, </em>unless otherwise expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 53a-65 provides the definitions applicable to sexual offenses. The code does not adopt the term \u201cprivate parts\u201d but instead uses the broader term \u201cintimate parts.\u201d Under subsection (8) of the statute, \u201cintimate parts\u201d is defined as \u201cthe genital area, groin, anus, inner thighs, buttocks or breasts.\u201d The legislature chose not to limit illicit sexual acts to the commonly accepted term of \u201cprivate parts\u201d or genital areas, but to include in such acts the involvement of other parts of the body including the breasts. It is clear from \u00a7 53a-2 that this broader definition of \u201cintimate parts\u201d is to apply not only to the sections of the penal code pertaining to sexual offenses but to <em>all </em>sections of the general statutes pertaining to such offenses including \u00a7 53-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Equally lacking in merit is the defendant\u2019s claim that he had no fair warning that breast fondling was a prohibited act. He suggests that \u00a7 53-21 is unconstitutionally vague since the list of acts covered under the statute is left \u201ccompletely open and undefined.\u201d We have previously recognized in <em>State </em>v. <em>Chetcuti, </em>173 Conn. 165, 377 A.2d 263 (1977), that \u201claws maybe gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>eral in nature so as to include a wide range of prohibited conduct. The constitution requires no more than a reasonable degree of certainty.\u201d Id., 167, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>332 U.S. 1, 7-8, 67 S. Ct. 1538, 91 L. Ed. 1877 (1947). Furthermore, the meaning of the words \u201cacts likely to impair the . . . morals of a child\u201d have been clarified through several opinions of this court. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Coulombe, </em>143 Conn. 604, 124 A.2d 518 (1956), the offense involved the touching of the genitals of a nine year old girl. The defendant \u201cput down [her] pants . . . put his hands in [her] pants\u201d and \u201ctouched her flesh.\u201d Id., 605-606. In a number of other cases involving \u00a7 53-21, this court\u2019s opinions reveal that the conduct in question concerned indecent acts perpetrated on a victim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>152 Conn. 196, 205 A.2d 488 (1964); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>supra. These opinions serve to warn a potential violator that the deliberate touching of the private or intimate parts of a child under sixteen in a sexual and indecent manner is prohibited. Since the conduct of the defendant with the thirteen year old girl involved such a deliberate touching of an intimate part of her body, the defendant\u2019s behavior rendered him a violator as to whom the statute was not vague. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 64-65, 428 A.2d 322 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Lastly, we consider whether there exists a conflict between \u00a7 53-21 and \u00a7 53a-65 and related statutes which forms an unconstitutional statutory pattern. The defendant first contends that the inconsistent pattern of these two statutes makes it easier to commit an act under \u00a7 53-21, the more serious offense. Essentially, he argues that since the only difference between \u00a7 53-21 and \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1) (A) is the intent element, the accused is deprived of an opportunity to be found guilty of sexual assault in the fourth degree, a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The defendant was charged in this case with both risk of injury and sexual assault in the fourth degree for the same conduct with the thirteen year old girl. The defendant\u2019s objection to this multiple charge is unsound since we have previously held that the same act can constitute a violation of each of these statutes. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>186 Conn. 45, 438 A.2d 872 (1982), this court held that as to these two statutes, one is not deemed to be a lesser included offense of the other. The necessary elements of the two statutes are distinct. The sexual assault statute requires proof of specific intent or an intentional sexual contact. The risk of injury statute requires a situation or act which could endanger the child\u2019s health or impair the child\u2019s morals. Id., 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Equally without merit is the defendant\u2019s claim that he has been charged twice for the same offense in violation of the double jeopardy prohibition. We have recently addressed this precise issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>187 Conn. 73, 444 A.2d 896 (1982). In that case, we held that the imposition of sentences on both a sexual assault in the second degree and risk of injury did not violate the constitutional right not to \u201cbe subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const., amend. V. It is only when \u201cthe elements of one offense as defined by the statute include the elements of a lesser offense; or if one offense is merely nominally distinct from the other\u201d that double jeopardy attaches. <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>supra, 91. Since sexual assault in the fourth degree and risk of injury each require proof of an element not required by the other, the defendant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Accordingly, no error is found in the first case.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">We next consider the errors claimed by the defendant in the second case involving the fifteen year old girl. The defendant maintains that (1) the trial court erred in its charge to the jury on the issue of consent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>(2) \u00a7 53-21 as applied in this case is void for vagueness, and (3) \u00a7 53-21 unconstitutionally impairs the right to privacy of himself and the fifteen year old female.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">First, we must note the unique factual situation involved here. This case involves a female between the ages of fifteen and sixteen. Her age of fifteen years allows her to consent to sexual activity under the penal code; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), 53a-73a (a) (1) (A); yet at the same time to initiate a prosecution for risk of injury under \u00a7 53-21. The defendant contends that there was error since the trial court charged the jury that \u201cconsent on the part of the child under sixteen years of age is not a defense to the charge (of risk of injury).\u201d He maintains that the court\u2019s refusal to charge that consent was a defense unduly limited the jury in determining whether the sexual activity impaired the morals of the minor. The defendant\u2019s argument is based on the fact that since the age of consent is fifteen in the sexual assault statutes, it is possible for a person between fifteen and sixteen years of age to consent to sexual activities which might be deemed likely to \u201cimpair her morals\u201d <em>but for the fact that consent was given. </em>Furthermore, the defendant argues that <em>if </em>consent is not a defense, then \u00a7 53-21 is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The issue of consent vis-a-vis \u00a7 53-21 is one of first impression in Connecticut. We begin our inquiry with an examination of the \u201cSex offenses\u201d part VI of the penal code; \u00a7 53a-65 et seq.; which reveals a pattern of ages below which and circumstances under which sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ual activity is forbidden. These statutes outline what constitutes corruption of the young as well as improper sexual activity with a minor. The preface to the penal code, however, gives strong indication that noncommercial, consensual sexual activity in private has no place in the criminal law. The penal code comments state that \u201c[sjections 53a-65 to 53a-81 adopt the basic principle that non-commercial sexual activity in private, whether heterosexual or homosexual, between consenting, competent adults, not involving corruption of the young by older persons, is no business of the criminal law .... These sections [\u00a7\u00a7 53a-65 through 53a-81] are concerned principally with prohibiting <em>non-consensual </em>sexual activity . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The original penal code adopted in Connecticut prohibited any sexual intercourse with a person under sixteen years of age. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 53a-66. Yet, in 1975, \u00a7 53a-66 was repealed and the new \u00a7 53a-71 (a) changed the age of consent to fifteen. With this change, the legislature clearly indicated that a person who had attained the age of fifteen was an adult capable of making an intelligent choice in matters relating to sex. Since, however, the legislature did not amend the age in the risk of injury statute to correspond with this revision of the sexual assault statutes, we are faced with the anomalous situation of a fifteen year old who may consent and willingly participate in sexual activity and still initiate the prosecution of her \u201cpartner\u201d under \u00a7 53-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The defendant also correctly points out that <em>if\u00a7 </em>53-21 is construed to apply to a situation where a fifteen year old girl consents to normal sexual relations, while other criminal statutes appear to permit such activity, then \u00a7 53-21 would be unconstitutional if applied under such circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If this fifteen year old girl consented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>to or initiated sexual contact, then it is clear that the defendant was not provided with fair warning that his conduct was prohibited. All earlier risk of injury cases have involved the <em>perpetration </em>of acts on victims under the age of sixteen. The only warning which the case law in Connecticut provides to a potential offender pertains to <em>subjecting or perpetrating </em>indecent acts on an <em>unwilling </em>victim. These cases have not presented to us possible instances of willing and voluntary participation by a person between the ages of fifteen and sixteen. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>187 Conn. 73, 444 A.2d 896 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>186 Conn. 45, 438 A.2d 872 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>183 Conn. 17, 438 A.2d 1165 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 428 A.2d 322 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>162 Conn. 112, 291 A.2d 750 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gelinas, </em>160 Conn. 366, 279 A.2d 552 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>152 Conn. 196, 205 A.2d 488 (1964); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>150 Conn. 245, 188 A.2d 65 (1963); <em>State </em>v. <em>Coulombe, </em>143 Conn. 604, 124 A.2d 518 (1956); <em>State </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>139 Conn. 234, 93 A.2d 154 (1952). When a person legally capable consents to or initiates sexual contact and activity, the case law and statute itself provide no fair warning or notice of statutory prohibition. \u201c \u2018[W]e insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tedesco, </em>175 Conn. 279, 288, 397 A.2d 1352 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">In view of our conclusion that consent is a determinative issue, a new trial is ordered. Whether the fifteen year old girl consented to sexual activities with the defendant is a factual determination and, as such, is clearly within the province of the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>170 Conn. 110, 112, 365 A.2d 99 (1976) (issue of \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d in rape case is question of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>for the jury). Thus, the trial court committed error in denying the defendant's request at trial for a jury instruction on consent. An instruction on consent must be given at the new trial. Furthermore, if the jury determines that consent was given, we instruct the court to dismiss the risk of injury charges since \u00a7 53-21 would then not be violated as applied to the particular facts of this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53-21. injury or risk of injury to, or impairing morals OF, children.
