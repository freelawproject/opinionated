Upon the Rules Committee\u2019s denial of his request, Podolsky filed a complaint with the Connecticut Freedom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Information Commission (FOIC) on December 12,1977. On March 8,1978, after a hearing at which all the parties participated, the FOIC ordered the Rules Committee to provide Podolsky with access to its meetings pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 1-21<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and with advance notice of its meetings pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 l-21c.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On March 17, 1978, the Rules Committee appealed the FOIC order to the Superior Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, and on August 7, 1981, the Superior Court sustained its appeal. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>court then granted Podolsky\u2019s petition for certification. He now appeals from the judgment of the Superior Court sustaining the Rules Committee\u2019s appeal.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the record of the proceedings before the FOIC reveal the following facts. The Rules Committee is a body composed of judges of the Superior Court. Its function is to consider proposed changes in the rules of practice for the Superior Court, and to recommend amendments to the Practice Book, which may be adopted by vote of the Superior Court judges. Once proposed Practice Book amendments have been approved by the Rules Committee, they are published in the Connecticut Law Journal, and are subject to public comment before their adoption by the judges. The Rules Committee does not, however, permit members of the public to attend the deliberative sessions at which the committee debates suggested rule changes and formulates specific amendment proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Podolsky sought access to the meetings of the Rules Committee on the basis of his claim that the Rules Committee, although a judicial body, exercises only administrative functions, and therefore is a \u201cpublic agency\u201d within General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and is governed by the open meeting rules of the Freedom of Information Act. General Statutes \u00a7 1-21. The Rules Committee urged, in opposition, that: (1) the Freedom of Information Act, as a matter of statutory construction, does not apply to its activities; and (2) if the Freedom of Information Act were to be held applicable, the act would unconstitutionally intrude upon the inherent rule-making powers of the judiciary, in violation of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Conn. Const., arts. II, V.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The FOIC ordered the Rules Committee to admit Podolsky to its meetings. It concluded that the Rules Committee performed an administrative function within the Judicial Department. The FOIC disclaimed any jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of the Freedom of Information Act as applied to the Rules Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The trial court sustained the appeal of the Rules Committee. Because the Rules Committee does not adjudicate individual disputes, the trial court accepted the FOIC\u2019s ruling that the Rules Committee performed an administrative function for the purposes of \u00a7 l-18a (a). Having thus found the Freedom of Information Act applicable, the court then held that the legislature had unconstitutionally intruded upon the judicial power of the constitutional courts and had thereby violated the strict separation of powers guaranteed by the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>On this appeal, Podolsky claims that the trial court erred in holding the Freedom of Information Act to be unconstitutional when applied to the Rules Committee. The Rules Committee, while defending the trial court\u2019s ruling, also maintains, as an alternate ground in support of the trial court\u2019s judgment; Practice Book \u00a7 3012; that the Freedom of Information Act should be construed to exclude its activities. Because we agree with the Rules Committee\u2019s statutory argument, we find no error without reaching the constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The central issue before us is the proper construction of \u201cadministrative function\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 l-18a (a), since it is undisputed that the Freedom of Information Act itself applies, with respect to the Judicial Department, only to officials or bodies who perform administrative functions. The act itself offers no guidance as to what is \u201cadministrative.\u201d The term \u201cadministrative\u201d has no generally accepted plain meaning, but is commonly used to refer to a wide range of activities extending from the day to day management of an organization or an estate\u2019s internal housekeeping functions to the conduct of the entire official business of the government. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979); Webster, Third New International Dictionary (1961). Nor is there a sharp line of demarcation, as the trial court opined, between activities which are adjudicatory and those which are administrative. In zoning matters, for example, it is well understood that quasi-judicial functions are denominated administrative, while the enactment of regulations is considered a legislative function. See <em>Conto </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>186 Conn. 106, 111, 439 A.2d 441 (1982); <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>178 Conn. 657, 660, 425 A.2d 100 (1979). We must therefore look beyond the face of the statute to ascertain the proper meaning of \u201cadministrative functions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>In endeavoring to interpret the language of \u00a7 l-18a (a), we must take account of our duty, when presented with a constitutional challenge to a validly enacted statute, to construe the statute, if possible, to comport with the constitution\u2019s requirements. <em>Beccia </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>192 Conn. 127, 133, 470 A.2d 1202 (1984); <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>190 Conn. 460, 470, 461 A.2d 443 (1983); <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 128, 440 A.2d 848 (1981); <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Appeal Board, </em>170 Conn. 668, 674, 368 A.2d 20 (1976); <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Empire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>167 Conn. 499, 507-508, 356 A.2d 139 (1975). This general principle of construction is of particular importance in the context of the present litigation, which involves extraordinarily sensitive issues surrounding the delicate balance among the coordinate branches of our state government. We therefore turn to the legislative history, to scholarly analyses and to our own precedents to determine whether the legislature intended to apply the Freedom of Information Act to the Rules Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The legislative history of the Freedom of Information Act contains almost no discussion of the act\u2019s application to the judiciary, and hence provides little guidance for construction of the \u201cadministrative functions\u201d of the Judicial Department. The legislative history does, nevertheless, reveal a legislative concern for the independence of the judiciary and a legislative intent to avoid a collision with the prerogatives of the constitutional courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">When first enacted in 1975, the reach of the Freedom of Information Act within the Judicial Department was limited to the inferior courts established by the legislature; it did not apply to the constitutional courts at all.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In describing the proposed act on the floor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>General Assembly, Representative Burke explained: \u201cThe Freedom of Information Act covers all branches of government. Executive, Administrative, Legislative and Judicial insofar as the Judicial-Administrative functions, except the Supreme Court of Connecticut and the Superior Courts. The reason these courts were not included is that there is a grave constitutional problem in legislative rule-making for constitutional courts.\u201d 18 H. R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1975 Sess., p. 3911. Even with respect to the nonconstitutional Probate and Common Pleas Courts, coverage was limited to their \u201cadministrative functions,\u201d although the scope of the courts\u2019 administrative functions was nowhere detailed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In 1977, at least partly in response to the merger of the Superior Court with the Court of Common Pleas,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the legislature amended the Freedom of Information Act to include the constitutional courts with the \u00a7 l-18a (a) definition of covered agencies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The 1977 amendment, however, like the original act, limited its applicability to the undefined \u201cadministrative functions\u201d of the Judicial Department. Both houses of the General Assembly passed the amendment by consent, without debate or discussion. 20 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1977 Sess., pp. 2794, 2843-44; 20 H. R. Proc. Pt. 7, 1977 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Sess., p. 2806. There is no indication in the recorded history that the legislature perceived this amendment as having any particular constitutional significance, and certainly no evidence that it was intended to stimulate a confrontation with the Judicial Department by extending the act\u2019s open meeting provision to a significant portion of the judiciary\u2019s business.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The legislative history, then, supports a restrictive reading of the term \u201cadministrative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">An interpretation of \u201cadministrative functions\u201d that excludes the judicial rule-making power is consistent with the analytic distinctions developed by scholarly commentators. In determining the proper scope of judicial rule-making, three classes of concerns may be identified: concerns that go to substantive rules, concerns that go to procedural rules, and concerns that go to administrative rules. It is the distinction between procedural and administrative rules that is at issue in this case. That distinction turns upon whether we are dealing with matters involved in the adjudication of cases, which are procedural, or with matters involved in the internal organization of large and complex systems of courts, which are administrative. Levin &amp; Amsterdam, \u201cLegislative Control over Judicial Rule-Making: A Problem in Constitutional Revision,\u201d 107 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1, 33-34 (1958); see also Kay, \u201cThe Rule-Making Authority and Separation of Powers in Connecticut,\u201d 8 Conn. L. Rev. 1, 31 n.147 (1975). Following this analytic model, we believe it is appropriate to confine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u201cadministrative functions\u201d in \u00a7 l-18a (a) to matters relating to the management of the internal institutional machinery of the court system.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">We have recognized a role for \u201cadministrative functions\u201d that relates to the internal management of the court system in our opinion in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 251 A.2d 49 (1968). There we upheld the constitutionality of a statute providing for the appointment of a judge of the Superior Court to act as administrator of the unified Probate Court system. In rejecting the plaintiff probate judges\u2019 claim that the act encroached on their inherent judicial authority to manage the affairs of their courts, we emphasized the limited responsibilities of the administrator, which \u201cconcerned [only the] . . . efficient administrative, accounting and record-keeping procedures to be followed in the Probate Court . . . .\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>supra, 160. We also upheld the constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 45-4f,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> authorizing the Probate Court administrator to propose rules of probate practice and to compile a Probate Practice Book, by narrowly construing the administrator\u2019s rule-making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>authority as \u201climited to rules as to efficient administrative procedures including accounting and record keeping.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>supra, 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Like the Probate Court administration statutes upheld in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-5a<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and 51-9,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the statutes which describe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>duties of the chief court administrator and the executive secretary, respectively, provide further examples <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of administrative tasks.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Those statutes speak mainly to the accounting, personnel, scheduling and record-keeping activities of the Judicial Department. They do not purport to extend delegation of legislative authority to the rules of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The Rules Committee of the Superior Court plays no role in the management of the internal institutional machinery of the court system. It is charged, instead, with the responsibility of formulating rules of practice and procedure that directly control the conduct of litigation. It sets the parameters of the adjudicative process that regulates the interactions between individual litigants and the courts. Accordingly, we hold that the Rules Committee does not perform \u201cadministrative functions\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 l-18a (a) and is not subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (a) provides: \u201c \u2018Public agency\u2019 or \u2018agency\u2019 means any executive, administrative or legislative office of the state or any political subdivision of the state and any state or town agency, any department, institution, bureau, board, commission or official of the state or of any city, town, borough, municipal corporation, school district, regional district or other district or other political subdivision of the state, and also includes any judicial office, official or body but only in respect to its or their administrative functions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-21 provides in part: \u201cmeetings of government AGENCIES TO BE PUBLIC.

They involved courts whose rule-making authority had different constitutional bases than does ours, and statutes that expressly provided that judicial rule-making be public. Nonetheless, we note that the statutory provisions were, in those cases, held to violate the separation of powers. <em>In re 1976 P.A. 267, </em>400 Mich. 660, 663, 255 N.W.2d 635 (1977); <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>93 Nev. 614, 617-18, 572 P.2d 521 (1977); <em>In re 12 P.A.C.S. </em>\u00a7 <em>1703, </em>482 Pa. 522, 528, 394 A.2d 444 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
