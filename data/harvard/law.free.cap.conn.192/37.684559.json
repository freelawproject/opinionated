When the mother returned home from her job at a nursing home, she noticed that her child\u2019s face was scratched and her lip was bruised and swollen. She questioned the defendant about her daughter, and he stated that the child had fallen down some stairs. That same evening, the mother again left her child with the defendant while she worked her second job from 8 p.m. until midnight. When the mother returned home after work, she found blood on a cloth with which she was washing her daughter\u2019s vaginal area after the child used the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">A medical examination at Waterbury Hospital revealed bruises on the front of the child\u2019s thighs and stomach, as well as cuts on her right side and stomach. The outside of the child\u2019s vagina was red and swollen; there were also bruises on the inside of her vagina. The hymen was found intact. The medical report stated: \u201cFINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Child abuse. Possible sexual assault.\u201d The defendant was located and questioned by a member of the Waterbury police department the following day. After he admitted verbally that he had hit the child with a belt, he was arrested and charged in connection with the child\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>On March 8,1982, after plea negotiations, the state filed a bill of particulars and a substitute information charging the defendant in the first count with the crime of injury or risk of injury to, or impairing the morals of, a child; General Statutes \u00a7 53-21;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in the second count with the crime of sexual assault in the fourth degree; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1). The defendant was sentenced to a prison term of not less than two nor more than four years following his guilty plea<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to a charge of injury or risk of injury to, or impairing the morals of, a child under \u00a7 53-21. The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss challenging the constitutionality of \u00a7 53-21, first made prior to the entry of his plea and later renewed, was denied immediately prior to the imposition of his sentence. On May 11,1982, the court filed a memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. On May 28, the defendant appealed to this court from the denial of his motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The two issues presented to us in this appeal are (1) whether an erroneous finding that the defendant \u201cadmitted that he intentionally subjected the child to sexual contact\u201d vitiates his guilty plea to a violation of \u00a7 53-21 based upon an information charging both an impairment of the health as well as the morals of a child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>and (2) whether \u00a7 53-21 as applied to the facts of this case is unconstitutionally vague so as to violate the defendant\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">At the outset, it is necessary to outline the precise crimes with which the defendant was charged and to which he pleaded guilty. Count one of the substitute information charged the defendant with \u201cthe crime of Injury or Risk of Injury to, or Impairing the morals of, a child, in violation of Section 53-21 of the General Statutes.\u201d The bill of particulars charged that the defendant \u201cbeat this baby about the head and body with, among other things, a belt. He also intentionally subjected this baby to sexual contact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">We note that the substitute information employs the alternative or disjunctive \u201cor\u201d while the bill of particulars employs the conjunctive \u201calso.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The substitute information in this case is improperly drafted since \u201c[a]n information which charges the commission of two or more offenses in the alternative is fatally defective<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for the reason that it does not definitely apprise the accused of the specific charge against him. Though the statute makes criminal the commission of several acts stated disjunctively, the information must charge in the conjunctive since otherwise it would be uncertain which of two or more accusations was intended.\u201d <em>Grasso </em>v. <em>Frattolillo, </em>111 Conn. 209, 212, 149 A. 838 (1930); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>164 Conn. 162, 167, 319 A.2d 381 (1972). In this case, however, the faulty substitute information is remedied by the bill of particulars, which sets out the charges in the conjunctive. \u201c \u2018The office of a bill of particulars is to supply both the accused and the</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>court <em>additional </em>information concerning an accusation that the defendant has committed an act or acts constituting a criminal offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>167 Conn. 260, 269, 355 A.2d 11 (1974), quoting 41 Am Jur. 2d, Indictments and Informations \u00a7 163. Therefore, since the substitute information and the bill of particulars are read together, it is clear that the defendant was charged with two criminal acts violative of \u00a7 53-21: (1) doing an act likely to impair the health of a child (beating with a belt) and (2) doing an act likely to impair the morals of a child (subjecting to sexual contact). The defendant maintains that the facts which he admitted when he pleaded guilty did not include the allegation that he had had sexual contact with the child. Rather, the defendant claims that he understood the recitation of facts<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to involve only that portion of the statute concerning endangerment to the <em>health </em>of the child. Succinctly stated, the defendant states that he pleaded guilty only to beating the child with a belt (endangering her \u201chealth\u201d), and that he did not plead guilty to any sexual contact (\u201cimpairing her morals\u201d). Since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>defendant was charged under \u00a7 53-21, a criminal statute embodying several alternative acts, his claim is without merit even if his contention that he admitted only to the beating of the child is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>supra, 168, we held that where an information alleges a crime to have been committed in more than one way, a guilty finding stands if the evidence would support a conviction based upon any one of the statutory alternatives. In this case, even though we find nothing in the transcript to indicate that the defendant admitted to anything more than beating the child with a belt, his plea must stand. Since the defendant was charged with committing an act likely to impair the health <em>and </em>an act likely to impair the morals of a child, the uncontested fact that the defendant beat the child with a belt adequately supported the judgment of guilty in violation of \u00a7 53-21 even if the trial court\u2019s finding of an impairment of morals is disregarded. The erroneous finding in the memorandum of decision was a harmless error insofar as the validity of the guilty plea was concerned. See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The defendant also argues that since there was confusion in his mind as to the portion of the statute to which he was pleading guilty, his plea was not knowing, voluntary and intelligent, and it was in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 711.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In order for a plea of guilty to be constitutionally valid, the record must affirmatively disclose that there is a factual basis for the plea and that the defendant entered the plea voluntarily and intelligently. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 710-713; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chil-dree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 119, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983); <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>173 Conn. 360, 373, 377 A.2d 1108 (1977). \u201c \u2018[I]f a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is not equally voluntary and knowing, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore void.\u2019 <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>170 Conn. 469, 473, 365 A.2d 1100 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim that his plea was not intelligent and, therefore, that it was involuntary is unsound. \u201cUnless the defendant has had real notice of the nature of the charge against him, the plea cannot constitute an intelligent admission.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>174 Conn. 338, 340, 387 A.2d 550 (1978), quoting <em>Henderson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 645, 96 S. Ct. 2253, 49 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1976). The plea must also be supported by a factual basis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>supra, 473. Such a factual basis is absent when the recited facts reveal less than all the elements of the crime charged. Id., 472. A reading of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s presentation of the facts in the present case; see footnote 6, supra; reveals that the defendant had \u201creal notice\u201d of the nature of the charge. The recitation contains facts pertinent to the charge of impairment to health (hitting with a belt), as well as to the charge of impairment to morals (sexual contact). These facts were recited to the defendant at the plea hearing and include all of the elements to support a charge of risk of injury as set out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>189 Conn. 1, 7-8, 454 A.2d 256 (1983): \u201c(1) that the victim was less than sixteen years old; (2) that the defendant had perpetrated an act upon the victim; (3) that this act was likely to be injurious to his health; and (4) that the defendant had a general criminal intent to perform such act.\u201d The defendant also indicated that the facts were substantially correct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, we may presume that the nature of the plea proceedings and all documents, such as the bill of particulars and medical reports, were explained to the defendant by his counsel. As we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>182 Conn. 176, 184, 438 A.2d 46 (1980): \u201c[T]he court was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>to presume that \u2018defense counsel routinely explain the nature of the offense in sufficient detail to give the accused notice of what he is being asked to admit.\u2019 <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 647, 96 S. Ct. 2253, 49 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1976); <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>173 Conn. 360, 375-76, 377 A.2d 1108 (1977). Except for those inquiries which are constitutionally mandated or are required by our rules; Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 711-713; the court is not obliged to assume the role of the defendant\u2019s counselor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Lastly, the \u00a7 711 requirement of an adequate factual basis is also satisfied by the transcript of the plea hearing. The defendant was fully apprised of the nature of the charge, of the maximum sentence, and of the panoply of constitutional rights of which he could avail himself. Therefore, we find that the lower court properly accepted the guilty plea of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s second argument, that the section of \u00a7 53-21 which deals with impairment of health is so vague as to violate the due process provisions of both article first, \u00a7 8 of the state constitution and the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He submits that in order to survive a vagueness challenge, a statute must (1) give fair notice or warning that the conduct is proscribed, and (2) establish reasonable guidelines for law enforcement officials and triers of fact in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The defendant argues that \u00a7 53-21 fails to comply with this two-part test.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">This court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 428 A.2d 322 (1980), recently set out the basic principles to be considered when a statute is attacked as void for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>vagueness. First, the constitutionality of the challenged statute is to be determined by the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue. Id., 57. \u201c[T]hat a statutory provision may be of questionable applicability in speculative situations is usually immaterial if the challenged provision applies to the conduct of the defendant in the case at issue.\u201d Id., 58. Second, the statute must give fair warning in order to enable a person to know what conduct he must avoid. \u201c[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law.\u201d Id., 60, quoting <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926). \u201cThus, a penal statute may survive a vagueness attack solely upon a consideration of whether it provides fair warning.\u201d Id., 61. \u201cReferences to judicial opinions involving the statute, the common law, legal dictionaries, or treatises may be necessary to ascertain the statute\u2019s meaning to determine if it gives fair warning.\u201d Id., 62-63, citing <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>423 U.S. 48, 49-50, 96 S. Ct. 243, 46 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201chealth\u201d as the \u201cstate of being hale, sound, or whole in body, mind or soul or well being. Freedom from pain or sickness.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979). The words \u201cact likely to impair the health of a child\u201d have also been elucidated through several opinions of this court. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Palozie, </em>165 Conn. 288, 292, 334 A.2d 468 (1973), we found that each of three separate acts would be sufficient to convict the defendant of an act likely to impair a child\u2019s health: (1) \u201c[strapping a child to a degree that bruises with some scabbing covering an area of three or four inches result and further causing a two-to-three-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>inch area to become black and blue,\u201d (2) \u201cthrowing a child against a chair, bruising his head, and then stepping on his back, which caused vomiting that night and the next day,\u201d or (3) \u201cslapping his son and then \u2018poking\u2019 his son in the nose.\u201d In <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>189 Conn. 1, 6, 454 A.2d 256 (1983), we found that the defendant\u2019s act of pushing a child \u201cinto a wall and then to the floor\u201d which caused the child to sustain \u201ca bloody nose, a split lip, a lump on his head, facial bruises, and red marks on his arm\u201d was violative of that portion of \u00a7 53-21 dealing with acts likely to impair a child\u2019s health. In addition, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>150 Conn. 245, 188 A.2d 65 (1963), this court further defined acts viola-tive of this latter portion of the risk of injury statute as \u201cacts directly perpetrated on the person of a minor and injurious to his moral or physical well-being.\u201d Id., 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">It is not necessary that this statute list the precise actions prohibited by it. Penal laws may be general and prohibit a wide range of conduct; the constitution requires no more than reasonableness of certainty. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chetcuti, </em>173 Conn. 165, 167, 377 A.2d 263 (1977), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>332 U.S. 1, 7-8, 67 S. Ct. 1538, 91 L. Ed. 1877 (1942). This court\u2019s opinions pursuant to \u00a7 53-21 make it clear that an act injurious to the physical well-being of a child is prohibited. These cases give fair warning that the defendant\u2019s act of hitting a child with a belt was proscribed at the time he committed the act. \u201cThis is not a situation where the state is holding an individual \u2018criminally responsible for conduct he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.\u2019 <em>United States v. Harriss, </em>[347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S. Ct. 808, 98 L. Ed. 989 (1954).] On the contrary, this is an instance where the statute \u2018as authoritatively construed [applies] without question to certain activities.\u2019 <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>[415 U.S. 566, 578, 94 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Ct. 1242, 39 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1974).]\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>supra, 64-65. Considered in light of the defendant\u2019s opprobrious conduct, the statutory language is not vague as applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Lastly, the defendant argues that the principle of lenity should be employed to decrease his sentence to one year or less. This claim of lenity, however, was not raised by the defendant when he entered his guilty plea on March 8, 1982. At no time during the sentencing hearing did defense counsel raise the lenity claim. The lower court\u2019s written memorandum of May 11, 1982, makes no mention of lenity. We are not bound to consider questions not raised at trial by a defendant even in a criminal case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, 173 </em>Conn. 545, 560, 378 A.2d 588 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 provides: \u201cAny person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that its life or limb is endangered, or its health is likely to be injured, or its morals likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\"> The second count of sexual assault in the fourth degree was nolled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b53-8\"> An appeal ordinarily lies only from a final judgment, and there can be no judgment in a criminal case until sentence is pronounced. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grotton, </em>180 Conn. 290, 293, 429 A.2d 871 (1980). When the defendant filed his appeal from the denial of his motion to dismiss, he had already been sentenced on May 10, 1982. Thus, that the defendant has not stated that he appeals from imposition of the sentence is a mere technical defect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\"> While \u201cand\u201d is ordinarily used to conjoin sentences or phrases, the word \u201calso\u201d has a conjunctive connotation and is thus a synonym for \u201cand.\u201d See Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus (3d Ed.) \u00a7 40.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b54-9\"> We do not mean to imply that this defect may not be waived by the failure to raise a timely objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b55-5\"> At the plea hearing, the following facts were recited by the state\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u201cMr. O\u2019Sullivan: . . . On January 27,1981, at approximately one p.m., the complainant . . . along with Noreena Carol, Department of Youth Services, came into the Vice and Intelligence Division of the Waterbury Police Department and indicated the following information with regard to [the complainant\u2019s] child . . . who was two years old at the time, and George Eason, who was her boyfriend and is this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u201cShe alleged that she works two jobs. And, that one of the jobs she works at is in a nursing home and the other is in Friendly\u2019s Ice Cream Parlor. That she returned home from the nursing home on the day in question and she noticed that her daughter . . . had a large scratch on her face and her lip was bruised and swollen.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u201cShe questioned George Eason about the incident as he was babysitting for her at that time.

And, at that time, she thought [the child] might need to go to the bathroom. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>So, she took her into the bathroom and then washed her off afterward and noticed blood on the wash cloth.
