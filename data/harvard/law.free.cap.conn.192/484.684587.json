The plaintiff, the state of Connecticut, brought an action against Robert F. Stengel, Administrator for the estate of Melvin Michaels, to recover for goods and services furnished Michaels at a veterans\u2019 home in Rocky Hill. After the trial court had rendered its judgment for the plaintiff, the plaintiff filed a motion for further articulation of judgment in which it sought to recover costs, counsel fees and interest. The trial court awarded the plaintiff only customary costs. The plaintiff appeals from the denial of interest. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The relevant facts are presently undisputed. The decedent, Melvin Michaels, a veteran of World War II, received care and treatment at the Rocky Hill Veterans\u2019 Home and Hospital from July 12,1968, to June 1,1976. After his death, the state, on March 28, 1980, sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>mitted a timely written claim for payment to the defendant administrator, which the administrator disallowed on April 28, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The state initiated a suit, seeking only money damages, on June 6, 1980. After intervening proceedings terminated in a mistrial, the case was heard in the trial court on November 30,1981. The trial court rendered its judgment awarding the state damages in the amount of $23,682.79 on June 6,1983. Both parties had agreed, by written stipulation, to waive the normal time period for rendition of a judgment under General Statutes \u00a7 51-1831).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Presumably the delay in the trial court\u2019s judgment was attributable at least in part to the pendency of the related case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Lach, </em>189 Conn. 726, 457 A.2d 1079 (1983), in which our decision, in the state\u2019s favor, was released on April 19,1983. Because the judgment rendered by the trial court in the present case did not expressly address the award of costs or interests to the state, the state promptly filed a motion for further articulation, seeking costs, interest, double costs and counsel fees. In denying the state\u2019s motion, except for the award of customary costs, the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision reflected its conclusion that its denial was an exercise of judicial discretion. One factor in that exercise of discretion was the court\u2019s determination that the administrator\u2019s dis-allowance of the state\u2019s claim had not been \u201cwithout just cause or for the purpose of delay.\u201d The state has appealed only from the denial of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In its appeal, the state acknowledges that the sole question before us is whether the denial of interest by the trial court constituted an abuse of discretion. The issue was so framed in the trial court and it necessarily is so limited here. The state has not assigned as error the trial court\u2019s finding that the administrator\u2019s disal-lowance of the state\u2019s claim was not \u201cwithout just cause or for the purpose of delay.\u201d We must therefore decide whether, despite the administrator\u2019s good faith, the trial court was bound to award interest to the state in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u201cThe allowance of interest as an element of damages is . . . primarily an equitable determination and a matter lying within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Bertozzi </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>164 Conn. 463, 467, 323 A.2d 553 (1973). While this court has frequently upheld the exercise of discretion to award prejudgment interest for unpaid monetary claims; <em>Gallicchio Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Oil Co., </em>191 Conn. 104, 110, 463 A.2d 600 (1983); <em>H. B. Toms Tree Surgery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>187 Conn. 343, 348, 446 A.2d 1 (1982); <em>Wells Laundry &amp; Linen Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Acme Fast Freight, Inc., </em>138 Conn. 458, 463, 85 A.2d 907 (1952); <em>Venezia </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>118 Conn. 325, 333, 172 A. 90 (1934); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Macdermott, </em>82 Conn. 572, 574, 74 A. 686 (1909); <em>Selleck </em>v. <em>French, </em>1 Conn. 32, 33 (1814); we have never held the denial of such an award to be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The reasons advanced by the state in support of its argument of abuse of discretion are unpersuasive. The state argues that we must award interest because the estate was unjustly enriched through use of the disputed moneys while this litigation was pending. Whether that enrichment was unjust is the crux of the determination that we normally entrust to those vested with discretion to grant or to deny interest. In the case before us, the state argues that dispositive weight must be given to the determination that disallowance of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>claim was wrongful and to the substantial delay that attended that determination. In balancing the equities, however, the court may well have taken into account that the administrator\u2019s disallowance was not wholly without legal basis and that the state itself acquiesced in a substantial part of the delay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the light of these circumstances, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 51-183b. (Formerly Sec. 51-29). judgments in civil actions, time limit.

The parties may waive the provisions of this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-12\"> Although the state complains that an earlier ruling of mistrial, induced by conduct of the administrator, wrongfully added to the delay, the state has not assigned that ruling as error. We must therefore presume that the mistrial was properly ordered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
