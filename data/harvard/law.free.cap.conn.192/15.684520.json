J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR\">The defendants, Joseph Trantolo and Vincent Trantolo, are members of the bar authorized to practice law in the state of Connecticut. They have appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment reprimanding them for violating Disciplinary Rule 2-101 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (hereinafter DR 2-101). Because we hold that the defendants\u2019 actions are not prohibited by the Code of Professional Responsibility, we find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The defendants operated several law offices in the state under the name of \u201cThe Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo and Trantolo.\u201d In September, 1978, the defendants launched an advertisement campaign involving four commercials,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which were broadcast by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>a Hartford area television station. On January 16,1981, the plaintiff<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed a substituted complaint in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain against the defendants, alleging that the four commercials violated DR 2-101.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>that DR 2-101 prohibits attorneys from advertising their services on television and, in the alternative, that these advertisements were prohibited because \u201cthey contained a false, fraudulent, misleading, deceptive, self-laudatory or unfair statement [or] claim and they were presented in an extravagant format and in an undignified manner,\u201d also in violation of DR 2-101. The complaint requested that the court order the defendants to show cause why they should not be \u201cdisbarred or otherwise disciplined\u201d for the alleged violations. The defendants responded by denying that the commercials violated DR 2-101 and by claiming in a special defense that the advertisements were protected speech under the first amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 4 of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The trial court rendered judgment against the defendants on April 22, 1981, and reprimanded them for the violation. The trial court ruled that DR 2-101 does not permit televised advertising by attorneys and that the advertisements were not constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">In their appeal the defendants claim that the trial court erred in holding that DR 2-101 prohibits televised advertisements and that the advertisements could not be considered constitutionally protected commercial speech. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We begin by noting that the Code of Professional Responsibility, as adopted by the judges of the Superior Court,* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> neither explicitly prohibits nor explicitly authorizes the advertising of legal services through the electronic media. The plaintiff contends, however, that the evolution of DR 2-101 into its present form demonstrates that the Superior Court judges clearly intended to restrict lawyer advertising to the various print media. The defendants argue that the rule intends no such limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Before 1977, the Connecticut Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 2-101, essentially followed the provisions of the American Bar Association\u2019s (hereinafter ABA) Model Rule. Subsection (A) prohibited \u201cany form of public communication that contains professionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>self-laudatory statements calculated to attract lay clients.\u201d The rule went on to define a \u201cpublic communication\u201d as including \u201ccommunication by means of television, radio, motion picture, newspaper, magazine, or book.\u201d Connecticut Code of Professional Responsibility DR 2-101 (A) (1976); ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility DR 2-101 (A) (1976). Subsection (B) stated that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not publicize himself, his partner, or associate as a lawyer through newspaper or magazine advertisements, radio or television announcements, display advertisements in city or telephone directories, or other means of commercial publicity.\u201d Connecticut Code of Professional Responsibility DR 2-101 (B) (1976); ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility DR 2-101 (B) (1976). In effect, the code prohibited any form of advertisement of legal services. In 1977, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 U.S. 350, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810, reh. denied, 434 U.S. 881, 98 S. Ct. 242, 54 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1977). In <em>Bates </em>the court considered a challenge to Arizona\u2019s DR 2-101 (B), which was identical to the Connecticut rule, on grounds that the rule violated the first amendment. The court struck down the rule as an unconstitutional abridgement of free expression, holding that although a state may impose some restrictions on lawyer advertising, it may not impose a blanket suppression of such speech. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Arizona, </em>supra, 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In 1978, the judges of the Superior Court responded to <em>Bates </em>by amending DR 2-101 to its present form. Instead of prohibiting all advertising, the rule now specifically authorizes advertising in \u201cprinted publications\u201d and identifies a variety of data concerning types of services offered, location, financial arrangements, and biographical information that may be published. DR 2-101 (B). It prohibits an attorney only from making a \u201cfalse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>fraudulent, misleading, deceptive, self-laudatory or unfair statement or claim.\u201d DR 2-101 (A). Although the ABA Model Code revision <em>after Bates </em>specifically authorizes advertisements through electronic media, the Connecticut Code neither explicitly authorizes nor explicitly prohibits television or radio advertisements. The plaintiff argues, and the trial court ruled, that the Superior Court judges\u2019 authorization of published advertisements, and the accompanying guidelines, demonstrate that the judges intended to continue the ban on electronic media advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The rules of statutory construction apply with equal force to Practice Book rules. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>183 Conn. 520, 521, 441 A.2d 41 (1981). \u201cWhere the meaning of a statute [or rule] is plain and unambiguous, the enactment speaks for itself and there is no occasion to construe it. Its unequivocal meaning is not subject to modification by way of construction. <em>Holmquist </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>168 Conn. 389, 393, 362 A.2d 971 (1975); <em>Hurlbut </em>v. <em>Lemelin, </em>155 Conn. 68, 73, 230 A.2d 36 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Springer, </em>149 Conn. 244, 248, 178 A.2d 525 (1962).\u201d <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>Board of Education, 177 </em>Conn. 68, 73, 411 A.2d 28 (1979). If a statute or rule is ambiguous, however, we construe it with due regard for the authors\u2019 purpose and the circumstances surrounding its enactment or adoption. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 552, 400 A.2d 712 (1978); <em>City Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>163 Conn. 149, 157, 302 A.2d 252 (1972). Because DR 2-101 does not address the issue of electronic advertising, it is ambiguous and must be construed to determine its true meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">We are persuaded that the rule does not intend a blanket prohibition on advertising through electronic media. Given that the current version of DR 2-101 was adopted in direct response to <em>Bates, </em>it is obvious that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the Superior Court judges intended to formulate a rule that would carry out the mandate of <em>Bates. </em>Although the United States Supreme Court did not address specifically the propriety of electronic advertising in the <em>Bates </em>decision, the reasoning of the court\u2019s opinion clearly indicates that a complete ban on such advertising is repugnant to the freedom of speech guarantees embraced by both the United States and Connecticut constitutions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such a ban, therefore, was not intended by the judges of the Superior Court in adopting DR 2-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The constitutional protection for commercial speech was unequivocally established for the first time in <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>425 U.S. 748, 96 S. Ct. 1817, 48 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1976). There the court struck down a state statute barring pharmacists from advertising the prices of prescription drugs. It ruled that commercial speech, defined as communication designed to further the speaker\u2019s economic interests, merits limited first amendment protection and may not be prohibited absent a showing of compelling reasons. The court noted that society\u2019s \u201cstrong interest in the free flow of commercial information\u201d required first amendment protection for commercial speech. <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>supra, 764. \u201cSo long as we preserve a predominantly free enterprise economy, the allocation of our resources in large measure will be made through numerous private economic decisions. It is a matter of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>interest that those decisions, in the aggregate, be intelligent and well informed. To this end, the free flow of commercial information is indispensable.\u201d Id., 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">From there the United States Supreme Court went on to strike down Arizona.\u2019s total ban on all lawyer advertising in <em>Bates </em>on the grounds that such a ban inhibited the free flow of commercial information thereby thwarting both the bar\u2019s obligation to make legal services available to all who need them and the consumer\u2019s ability to select intelligently an attorney. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Arizona, </em>supra, 377 (citing ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility, Ethical Consideration 2-1 [1976]).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The United States Supreme Court has made clear, however, that the state is not powerless to regulate commercial speech when the interests of its citizens so require. <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corporation </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission of New York, </em>447 U.S. 557, 563-64, 100 S. Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1980); <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Arizona, </em>supra, 383-84; <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>supra, 770-73. \u201cTruthful advertising related to lawful activities is entitled to the protections of the First Amendment. But when the particular content or method of the advertising suggests that it is inherently misleading or when experience has proved that in fact such advertising is subject to abuse, the states may impose appropriate restrictions.\u201d <em>In the Matter of R.M.J., </em>455 U.S. 191, 203, 102 S. Ct. 929, 71 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1982). The standard that the state must meet in order to justify the prohibition of a nonmisleading statement is a stringent one. The state must assert a substantial interest in the restriction, and the regulation must \u201cdirectly advance the governmental interest asserted\u201d and be no \u201cmore extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.\u201d <em>Central Hudson Gas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>&amp; Electric Corporation </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission of New York, </em>supra, 566, quoted in <em>In the Matter of R.M.J., </em>supra, 203-204 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The state\u2019s interest in regulating advertisements for legal services is certainly substantial. But a blanket restriction on television advertising is not the sort of narrow regulation that the Supreme Court countenanced in <em>R.M.J. </em>and <em>Central Hudson Gas. </em>In order to satisfy constitutional standards a rule restricting speech must be reasonably designed to prohibit only those statements that threaten a legitimate interest. Freedom of speech simply does not tolerate the sort of blanket approach for which the plaintiff argues. A total ban on advertising through the electronic media would not only exceed the state\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting potential consumers, but its overinclusiveness would also keep a great deal of information from consumers, thereby hindering their ability to make an informed choice. The United States Supreme Court has stated \u201cthat people will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enough informed, and that the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication rather than to close them.\u201d <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>supra, 770; see <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corporation </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission of New York, </em>supra, 562; <em>Linmark Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Willingboro, </em>431 U.S. 85, 92, 97 S. Ct. 1614, 52 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In permitting electronic media advertising by attorneys the Tennessee Supreme Court noted that \u201c[tjhis [freedom of speech] protection would be fragile indeed if it were only applied to certain media and not to others. Advertising is advertising irrespective of the device or instrumentality employed.\u201d <em>In re Petition For Rule of Court, </em>564 S.W.2d 638, 643 (Tenn. 1978). Some mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>bers of our society are functionally illiterate. Many others, because of handicaps, financial circumstances, or personal preference, do not avail themselves of printed material. Thus, television and radio are the informational media of choice for many, and of necessity for others. To restrict the advertising of legal services to those who read published materials would deny these nonreaders important information with no corresponding benefit to them or any other segment of society. We find such a restriction to be repugnant to the commercial speech doctrine and thus violative of both the first amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 of the Connecticut constitution. We conclude, therefore, that DR 2-101 does not contemplate a blanket prohibition on lawyer advertising through the electronic media.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">We hasten to add that lawyer advertising is subject to reasonable regulations. For example, the judges of the Superior Court may continue to prohibit the dissemination of unlawful, false, or misleading information irrespective of the media used; <em>In the Matter of R.M.J., </em>supra, 203; <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corporation </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission of New York, </em>supra, 566; and the judges may adopt regulations designed to assure that only useful, factual, and relevant information is conveyed in advertisements for legal services. But all such regulations must be tailored toward protecting consumers and providing them with relevant and truthful information.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The trial court based its reprimand on its finding that television advertisements are per se a violation of DR 2-101. Therefore, the court did not consider whether the defendants' actions violated the rule on any other grounds. Because we hold that televised advertisements do not constitute a per se violation of DR 2-101, the reprimand may only stand if the advertisements vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>late the rule in some other way. Specifically, the defendants might be reprimanded if the advertisements were false, fraudulent, or misleading. DR 2-101 (A). On this issue the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. After examining the record, including viewing the four commercials in question, we conclude that the trial court could not have found that the plaintiff had satisfied its burden. The advertisements inform the listener of the value of professional legal assistance in certain situations and make known that the defendants are willing and able to provide such services. Thus they are informative and in no way misleading or deceptive. If some members of the audience find them distasteful, such consumers might very well react by shunning the service offered, thereby imposing an informal sanction more effective than any formal regulation. We hold, therefore, that the defendants did not violate the disciplinary rules by the use of these commercials.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In the opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-9\"> The trial court identified and summarized the commercials as follows: \u201cThe four commercials which were viewed by the court at the hearing may be designated for ease of reference as the \u2018Divorce Case\u2019, \u2018Mumbo Jumbo\u2019, \u2018Accident Case\u2019 and \u2018Bankruptcy Case\u2019 advertisement, respectively. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">\u201cThe \u2018Divorce Case\u2019 scene showed a couple discussing a division of their property. After they agree to split everything \u2018right down the middle\u2019, the husband uses a power saw to cut through a table and a sofa while their dog looks on soulfully, possibly with some concern that he may suffer the same fate.
