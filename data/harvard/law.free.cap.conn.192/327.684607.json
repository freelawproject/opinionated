They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u201c(1) Is a cause of action which sounds in medical malpractice and which has been commenced more than three years from the date of the negligent act or omission complained of, barred by the statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-584, if the plaintiff did not discover and could not, in the exercise of care, reasonably have discovered the nature of her injuries within three years from the date of the negligent act or omission complained of?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u201c(2) Does the representative of the estate of a deceased child have a cause of action under Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 52-555 (Wrongful Death Statute) where the negligent act claimed to be the proximate cause of the injuries resulting in death occurred before the child was conceived?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u201c(3) May the representative of the estate of a deceased child bring a cause of action under Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 52-555 more than three years after the negligent act or omission complained of, where the child was not conceived until more than three years after the negligent act or omission complained of?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The parties have stipulated to the following facts: In 1966 the plaintiff Jane McDonald was given blood tests by the defendant Haynes Medical Laboratories, Inc., and diagnosed as having type 0, RH-positive blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>On July 7, 1973, she gave birth to a baby boy. The child was bom in an erythroblastic condition due to RH-factor incompatability, and died that day from erythro-blastosis fetalis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Manchester Memorial Hospital performed a blood test and discovered that Jane McDonald was in fact blood type 0, RH-negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The plaintiffs<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed suit in July, 1975, against five defendants, four of whom have settled the claims against them. The only remaining defendant is Haynes Medical Laboratory, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-584<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 52-555<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6are identical with respect to the language used by the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Assembly to limit the time for bringing specific causes of action: Suit must be filed \u201cwithin two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered, and except that no such action may be brought more than three years from the date of the act.or omission complained of.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In <em>Vilcinskas </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>144 Conn. 170, 127 A.2d 814 (1956), this court, interpreting the predecessor of \u00a7 52-584 (General Statutes [1949 Rev.] \u00a7 8324),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> stated, \u201cthe words \u2018act or omission complained of in \u00a7 8324 are intended to mean something different from injury or damage. The date of the act or omission complained of is the date when the negligent conduct of the defendant occurs and is not the date when the plaintiff first sustains damage.\u201d Id., 173; accord <em>Dincher </em>v. <em>Marlin Firearms Co., </em>198 F.2d 821 (2d Cir. 1952); cf. <em>Prokolkin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corporation, </em>170 Conn. 289, 296-97, 365 A.2d 1180 (1976) (interpreting General Statutes \u00a7 52-577). We also acknowledged the anomalous possibility that the statutory time limit for bringing suit could expire before any injury was sustained. <em>Vilcinskas </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>supra, 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>In 1957, the General Assembly responded to this problem by passing Public Acts 1957, No. 467, which provided in pertinent part: \u201cNo action to recover damages . . . shall be brought but within one year from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered, <em>and except that no such action may be brought more than three years from the date of the act or omission complained of </em>. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) At the same time the General Assembly enacted Public Acts 1957, No. 532, which repealed the prior wrongful death statute and replaced it with a new statute that extended the permissible period for bringing suit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is noteworthy that the language used by the General Assembly was exactly the same as used in Public Acts 1957, No. 467, a fact recognized by the Senate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>It is apparent from the recent history of both General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-555 and 52-584 that the General Assembly intended both statutes to have the same effect. The cause of action, whether brought in the party\u2019s individual capacity (\u00a7 52-584) or in a representative capacity (\u00a7 52-555), must be filed no later than three years from \u201cthe act or omission complained of.\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 52-577.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Despite the fact that the General Assembly spoke in clear and precise language previously interpreted by this court; cf. <em>Sawyer Savings Bank </em>v. <em>American Trading Co., </em>176 Conn. 185, 189, 405 A.2d 635 (1978) (legislature presumed to know of relevant legislation as judicially construed); the plaintiffs, relying upon cases from other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> would have this court \u201cbalance the equities between the rights of an injured plaintiff and the rights of a defendant to defend . . . against stale claims,\u201d and except from the statutes\u2019 coverage instances where the injury is inherently undiscoverable. We have no such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>At the outset we note that the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the cases cited in their brief is misplaced. It is true that those cases hold that the statute of limitations does not run until the date the injury occurs; but in each case the courts were discussing an accrual<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or discovery statute of limitations quite unlike \u00a7\u00a7 52-555 and 52-584.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The statutes in question are clear on their face and the language employed has previously been construed by this court. Apart from modifications not relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the present case, the statutes have remained unchanged for more than a quarter of a century. It is not the function of this court to alter the will of the legislature merely because the results are unfair. <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>175 Conn. 463, 474-75, 399 A.2d 1280 (1978). Instead it is our duty to construe the language as used by the legislature. <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 730, 433 A.2d 1009 (1980), and cases cited therein. Absent any indication that the General Assembly no longer intends the phrase \u201cfrom the date of the act or omission complained of\u201d to be construed in accordance with our decision in <em>Vilcinskas </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>supra,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we hold that the three year limitation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-555 and 52-584 begins to run from the date of the negligent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Our answer to Question 1 is Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Our answer to Question 3 is No.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Because of the disposition of this case, we express no opinion on Question 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">In this opinion Healey, Grillo and Ment, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 52-235. reservation of questions of law.

They do not question, and therefore we do not decide, whether either statute withstands a challenge based on article first, \u00a7 10, of the Connecticut constitution, which provides: \u201cAll courts shall be open, and every person, for an <em>injury </em>done to him in his person, property or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.\u201d (Emphasis added.)
