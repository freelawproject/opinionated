Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APc\">The defendant, Jose M. Binet, was convicted by a jury of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which crime occurred on October 23, 1979, in Bridgeport. On appeal, he claims that the trial court erred: (1) in denying his motion in limine which sought to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>vent his impeachment by the use of his February 1, 1980, conviction of robbery in the third degree, and (2) in denying his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Certain evidence should be set out to put the issues on appeal in proper focus. On October 23,1979, at about 11 p.m., Richard Brackett had stopped his car for a traffic signal at an intersection in Bridgeport. While stopped, he was accosted by two young males, one of whom had a handgun. The two males were the defendant and one Frank O\u2019Grine. One pointed the gun to the victim\u2019s head and told him to take off his glasses and get out of the car. He was sprayed with something he later found out was some sort of mace and he was ordered to get into the back seat. The two males got into the front seat and asked the victim to give them his money and a short leather jacket he was wearing. After he had done so, he was ordered out of his car. Brackett thereupon went into a nearby bar and telephoned the police. Officer Lawrence Sobkowich, who was in the area, received a radio transmission in his squad car concerning the robbery. That officer spotted Brackett\u2019s car, verified its license number with the radio room and radioed for the assistance of another car. Another car in the area manned by Officers Anthony Gomes and Alan J. Stach was dispatched and joined Sobkowich. After some pursuit, two police cars forced the Brackett car to a halt in the area of Father Panik Village, a housing development. The defendant exited the car and started across the street. Sobkowich shouted: \u201cStop. Police.\u201d The defendant turned in Sob-kowich\u2019s direction. At the trial, Sobkowich testified that \u201c[i]n, I believe, his right hand he had a pistol, a revolver. I fired one shot at him and he fled.\u201d When Gomes got out of his car, he heard \u201ca gunshot.\u201d Gomes, who had been a special policeman for five years in Father Panik Village before becoming a regular policeman, recognized the defendant as he left the Brackett car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Although Gomes chased the defendant some distance into Father Panik Village, he lost the defendant behind some buildings. Gomes never saw the defendant \u201cshoot anything\u201d that night. O\u2019Grine was chased and apprehended by Stach. Stach testified that as he was chasing O\u2019Grine, \u201csomeone fired a shot behind me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The defendant was not arrested for the October 23, 1979 robbery until May 19, 1980. When he was arrested, he admitted taking part in that robbery. Officer Robert Mencel, who arrested him at that time, testified that the defendant said that the gun used was a \u201cblank gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of error is the denial of his motion in limine which sought to preclude the state from impeaching him with his prior conviction of robbery in the third degree dated February 1, 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this motion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant maintained, inter alia, that \u201cthe probative value of this evidence on the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>credibility is far outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.\u201d At the hearing on this motion, the defendant stressed the fact that not only did the prior conviction involve a similar crime, but that the prior felony conviction and the instant robbery, both of which occurred in Bridgeport, were quite close in point of time \u2014 about nine months before trial. He also pointed out that the instant robbery occurred on October 23,1979. The state argued that a prior felony conviction could properly be used to attack credibility and that a cautionary instruction by the court to the jury that its use went to credibility could be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion, the court said that there had been \u201cat this stage ... no showing on the defendant\u2019s part . . . that the prejudicial effect on him of this type of inquiry by the State would outweigh the probative value on the issue of credibility.\u201d The court made the observation that what defense counsel was suggesting was that in each case where a defendant had a prior conviction of the crime with which he was presently charged, \u201cthat would automatically constitute prejudicial impressions on the Jury which the Court should protect against.\u201d Although it ruled against the defendant, it said that it did not \u201cknow how I would think, at the time that that is attempted to be used, how the case would come in up to that point, whether it would be prejudicial at that point in time.\u201d The court told defense counsel that his motion could be renewed at trial. We find no error in the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In considering the motion in limine, we look to certain established guidelines to furnish direction for ruling on this claim. There is, of course, no per se rule prohibiting impeachment of a defendant by proof of a prior conviction of a crime similar to that for which he is being tried when that prior conviction is offered to attack his credibility. The fact that such evidence does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>not merely show criminal tendencies but may also be significant in proving some of the issues in a case does not alone justify its admission because the court must also weigh its probative value against its prejudicial tendency. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>189 Conn. 631, 640, 458 A.2d 379 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 513, 519-20, 447 A.2d 396 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 23, 444 A.2d 213 (1982). The weighing or balancing process invokes the exercise of a sound judicial discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>supra, 521-22; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>162 Conn. 1, 10, 291 A.2d 240 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>160 Conn. 47, 52, 273 A.2d 689 (1970). A trial court\u2019s decision denying a motion to exclude a witness\u2019 prior record, offered to attack his credibility, will be upset only if the court abused its discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>supra, 644; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>supra, 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\u201cEvidence has probative value if it tends to prove an issue.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>547 F. Sup. 929, 934 (E.D. Tenn. 1981). \u201cThe probative value of evidence is merely its tendency to persuade the trier of fact on a given issue.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>555 F.2d 1273, 1276 (5th Cir. 1977). On the other hand, it is important to point out that \u201c[ijmplicit in this balancing approach is recognition of the fact that the danger of unfair prejudice is far greater when the accused, as opposed to other witnesses, testifies, because the jury may be prejudiced not merely on the question of credibility but also on the ultimate question of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>supra, 1275. We have recognized that \u201c[wjhere the prior crime is quite similar to the offense being tried, a high degree of prejudice is created and a strong showing of probative value would be necessary to warrant admissibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 644, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>supra, 522. Realistically and fairly, the credibility import of a prior conviction is not to be weighed against the credibility import of some other evidence, but it is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>weighed against its potential prejudicial effect on the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>411 Mich. 517, 520, 309 N.W.2d 525 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">These general guidelines are among those to be considered in passing upon the exercise of discretion in denying the in limine motion. The specific circumstances, however, before the court at that time merit some comment. The motion was heard before jury selection, and the record discloses that counsel, particularly defense counsel, did not provide the court with much information. The trial court did not have any real knowledge of the evidence to be offered in the case and it had only scant knowledge of the claims of the parties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case, the record before the court at that time could hardly provide it with a solid basis upon which to grant the defendant\u2019s motion. See generally <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>565 F.2d 170, 171 (1st Cir. 1977). The defendant had the burden on this motion to demonstrate that character of prejudice that entitled him to a ruling in his favor; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>405 A.2d 1181, 1186 (R.I.1979); <em>People </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>32 Cal. App. 3d 242, 108 Cal. Rptr. 399 (1973); and he did not sustain that burden. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>We now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial. We find error. It is necessary that certain circumstances be set out to put the analysis and resolution of this claim in proper focus. After several days of trial, the state had rested its case-in-chief, and the defendant took the witness stand. On direct examination the defendant was not asked if he had any prior felony convictions. Early during his direct examination, however, he admitted, without hesitation, that he and Frank O\u2019Grine were both in Brackett\u2019s car,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that he (the defendant) pulled out a gun, that they asked Brackett for his money and that they thereafter put Brackett out of the car. At that time, he also said that the gun he showed was a \u201cblank gun\u201d which \u201c[j]ust shot blanks . . .\u201d not \u201cbullets\u201d and \u201cjust made a noise.\u201d He stated that he had purchased this gun sometime in July, 1979, at a certain pawnshop on Main Street in Bridgeport. This was part of the evidence going to the defendant\u2019s claim under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) making it an affirmative defense to a charge of robbery in the first degree \u201c[tjhat such pistol, revolver ... or other firearm was not a weapon from which a shot could be discharged.\u201d Thereafter, on cross-examination, the defendant admitted that he was with O\u2019Grine, that he pointed a gun at the victim but that this was the blank gun that he had purchased at the pawnshop.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Upon concluding his direct examination, defense counsel, in the absence of the jury, again renewed his motion to exclude the prior robbery conviction asserting essentially the same bases as in his motion in limine. The state, not the defense, then asked permission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>voir dire the defendant and it was granted without objection. On the voir dire, the defendant admitted the prior robbery conviction. The court again denied the defense motion to bar its use for impeachment purposes, pointing out that it could be used to go to credibility only. The jury returned and, upon inquiry by the state, the defendant admitted that he had been convicted of the felony of robbery in February, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Immediately after the defendant admitted this prior felony conviction, the prosecutor asked: \u201cDid you have any pistol with you at the time of the offense for which you were convicted?\u201d Defense counsel immediately objected and asked that the jury be excused. After the jury was excused, the prosecutor stated that she would withdraw the question \u201cif there\u2019s going to be an objection to it,\u201d and she said that the purpose of the question was to ascertain whether the defendant \u201chad the gun with him during the period of time from the time he purchased it to the time of this offense for which he\u2019s being tried.\u201d The court observed that the question went a \u201clittle bit beyond\u201d the credibility purposes for which it had allowed the prior conviction to be used. Maintaining that she did not ask the question \u201cto take anything away from the theory of credibility,\u201d she then said: \u201cI merely want to know whether or not he carries this gun with him all the time.\u201d The prosecutor then said that she withdrew the question. Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial. In moving for a mistrial, defense counsel argued that the question, even though unanswered, clearly raised an inference in the jury\u2019s mind that the gun involved in the case on trial was also used in the earlier robbery;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that inquiry into the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>cumstances of the prior conviction for credibility purposes was improper except for purposes of specifying the prior crime and the date of conviction; and that the inference raised was \u201ctotally and absolutely unnecessarily prejudicial\u201d thereby destroying the defendant\u2019s opportunity for a fair trial. The court agreed that the question was improper but refused to order a mistrial. Immediately after the jury returned, the court stated that it had sustained the defendant\u2019s objection and instructed: \u201cI would ask you to disregard completely the question that was asked. Put it out of your minds and [do] not consider it at all in your deliberations.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s refusal to declare a mistrial denied him his right to a fair trial and due process of law under the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In doing so, he argues that, under the circumstances, counsel for the state \u201cdeliberately sought to bring before the jury significantly prejudicial evidence which was clearly inadmissible\u201d and that the challenged inquiry was made in bad faith. The state, on the other hand, claims that on the \u201centire record\u201d the mistrial was properly denied, arguing that there was no bad faith and that the prosecutor gave a reasonable answer for propounding the question. Claiming that the trial court gave curative instructions both at the time the motion for mistrial was denied and in its final instructions to the jury,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the state maintains that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ant\u2019s rights were not violated and that the denial of the mistrial motion was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\u201cThe general rule in Connecticut is that a mistrial is granted only where it is apparent to the court that as a result of some occurrence during trial a party has been deprived of the opportunity for a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 703, 443 A.2d 915 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 25, 438 A.2d 867 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>178 Conn. 116, 143, 422 A.2d 749 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1013, 100 S. Ct. 661, 62 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1980); see Practice Book \u00a7 887. When a mistrial is sought on the ground that a prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law the same standard applies. <em>See State v. Cosgrove, </em>186 Conn. 476, 488-89, 442 A.2d 1320 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>176 Conn. 367, 372, 407 A.2d 1001 (1978). The burden on the defendant is to show that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were prejudicial in light of the entire proceeding. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>supra, 488-89; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>supra, 372; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinsey, </em>173 Conn. 344, 348-49, 377 A.2d 1095 (1977). The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>supra, 488-89, citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1001, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\u201c \u2018A state\u2019s attorney should scrupulously avoid questions of probable impropriety . . . \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 719-20, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979). \u201cA demonstrated deliberate effort by a prosecutor to influence the jury against the defendant through the attempted introduction of obviously inadmissible evidence may entitle the defendant to a new trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>486 F.2d 172 (8th Cir. [1973]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>168 Conn. 230, 249, 362 A.2d 925, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 851, 96 S. Ct. 95, 46 L. Ed. 2d 74 [1975].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>182 Conn. 52, 58, 437 A.2d 843 (1980). While the absence of bad faith by a prosecutor is to be accorded considerable weight in a given case, that, however, is not to say that a showing of good faith by the prosecutor is \u201cdeterminative.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>168 Conn. 230, 249, 362 A.2d 925, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 851, 96 S. Ct. 95, 46 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1975). Indeed, it is \u201cwell established that serious prosecutorial misconduct, regardless of the prosecutor\u2019s intentions, may so pollute a criminal prosecution as to require a new trial, even without regard to the prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>supra, 251. Crucial considerations in appellate adjudication of such questions are not only the need, where demonstrated, to discipline prosecutors where reprehensible conduct is present but to assure ultimate fairness to the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>supra, 252; <em>see Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">There can be no colorable claim by the state that the question, which the trial court itself said was improper, was not deliberately asked. Just prior to jury selection, the same counsel for both the state and the defendant had argued the motion in limine before the same judge and that motion alleged that the prior conviction was robbery in the <em>third </em>degree \u2014 an offense that does not require a weapon. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-136. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>denying that motion at that time, the court said that it would allow the use of that prior conviction on the issue of credibility. The defendant renewed the motion at trial. After a voir dire sought by the state, and not the defendant, the court again denied the motion but ruled that the prior conviction would be admitted \u201cfor [the] purpose of impeachment only\u201d and that the state would be \u201climited ... by the rules.\u201d After the defendant admitted the prior robbery, the improper question was asked. At this point, we must note two things. First, at the time the improper question was asked, the defendant had already offered evidence going to his affirmative defense, i.e., that the gun he admittedly used in the instant robbery \u201cwas not a weapon from which a shot could be discharged.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4). Proof of this, which was the defendant\u2019s burden by a fair preponderance of the evidence, would \u201creduce\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or mitigate<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the offense from first degree robbery as charged to second degree robbery. Second, in oral argument before us, the defendant\u2019s counsel argued that the defendant, in his testimony, \u201ctacitly admitted\u201d that he committed sec.ond degree robbery; he also maintained that this was \u201cour\u201d position at trial, and, therefore, it was that crime for which the defendant should have been convicted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>It has been pointed out that \u201c[t]o \u2018mitigate\u2019 an offense is to introduce proof which results in a \u2018reduction of the punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>324 A.2d 203, 207 (Del. 1974), referring to <em>Connell </em>v. <em>State, </em>46 Tex. Crim. 259, 81 S.W. 746 (1904). The impermissible inference raised by the improper question under all the circumstances gravely impaired the defendant\u2019s right to make his affirmative defense in a fair and proper manner. There is nothing to suggest or explain that any factual predicate existed for the question, particularly with the written in limine motion already indicating a non-weapon robbery. \u201cIt is improper conduct for the [prosecution] to ask a question which implies a factual predicate which the examiner knows he cannot support by evidence or for which he has no reason to believe that there is a foundation of truth. ABA Standards Relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice: The Prosecution Function \u00a7 5.7 (d); 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 1808 at 276 (3d ed. 1940).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>542 F.2d 1283, 1307 (7th Cir. 1976); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>635 F.2d 814, 819 (10th Cir. 1980). The state does not point to a factual basis to support the clear implication of the question, i.e., that the defendant used a gun in the prior robbery. Moreover, the facts underlying the prior crime could not be elicited under the circumstances as the court had twice already limited the use of the prior felony conviction to impeachment purposes. Therefore, considering the clear absence of any factual basis for the improper question- and the specific limitations set by the court on the use of that conviction by the state, \u201cthe sequence of questions invited the jury to consider the questions as more than evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s credibility.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number><em>Fields </em>v. <em>United States, </em>396 A.2d 522, 527 (D.C. Ct. App. 1978), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>528 F.2d 661, 667 (D.C. Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">We have pointed out that even a showing of good faith by the prosecutor is not determinative of the issue because serious prosecutorial misconduct may so pollute a criminal trial so as to require a new trial even without regard to prejudice to the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>supra, 251. There is, however, grave prejudice here. Here there was \u201carguably\u201d; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lossiah, </em>537 F.2d 1250, 1252 (4th Cir. 1976); \u201cin the light of the entire proceeding\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 562; a case made on the affirmative defense which, if proven by only a fair preponderance of the evidence, would have reduced the crime charged to second degree robbery.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The question remains whether the defendant, despite the efforts of the trial court to eliminate the taint caused by the improper question, was denied a fair trial. The trial court gave instructions to this end, not only at the time the question was placed but also during its final instructions. We have always given great weight to such instructions in assessing claimed errors.

On the other hand, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>180 Conn. 167, 170-71, 429 A.2d 848 (1980), we said that \u201ca curative instruction is not inevitably sufficient to overcome the prejudicial impact\u201d of inadmissible evidence.

We have before us a case which is unique in that the defense has practically conceded guilt of robbery in the second degree, both at trial and before us, and also because the question involved was of such a prejudicial impact on the jury that it effectively destroyed the defendant\u2019s credibility and gravely impaired his right to attempt to establish the affirmative defense which would have precluded a conviction of first degree robbery. In this context, we must observe that even the jury had some difficulty understanding what the affirmative defense involved. The only question the jury sent out during their deliberations was \u201cclarify, to us, the difference between first and second degree robbery again, and what preponderance of evidence is, very confusing. This we are in disagreement about. Please explain.\u201d The state had a thin case; the evidence for guilt on the crime charged was hardly overwhelming.

The state charged the defendant with robbery in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) in that \u201cin the course of the commission of the crime he or another participant displayed what he represented by his words or conduct to be a firearm, to wit: a pistol . . . .\u2019\u2019It is an affirmative defense under this statute that the weapon used is one from which a shot could not be discharged. The defendant asserted this defense. At the trial he testified that he had used a pistol in the robbery but claimed that it could only fire blanks. On cross-examination, upon inquiry by the state, the defendant admitted that in February, 1980, he had been convicted of robbery. The prosecutor then inquired whether the defendant had a pistol with him at that time. Upon objection by the defendant the question was subsequently withdrawn. After denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial the court immediately gave the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>jury a cautionary instruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later in its charge to the jury the court again cautioned the jury about the prosecutor\u2019s question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority concludes that not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>only was the question improper but that the implicit suggestion that on another occasion the defendant had used a pistol in a robbery was so prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">\u201cThe general rule in Connecticut is that a mistrial is granted only where it is apparent to the court that as a result of some occurrence during trial a party has been deprived of the opportunity for a fair trial. . . . The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1001, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983). When measured against this standard, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the occurrence denied the defendant a fair trial is incomprehensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">It is stated that \u201c[t]he impermissible inference raised by the improper question under all the circumstances gravely impaired the defendant\u2019s right to make his affirmative defense in a fair and proper manner.\u201d This statement does not reveal a self evident truth. The issue before the jury was not whether the defendant used a pistol. That was admitted. Nor was it whether the pistol was fired or even whether it was loaded. The narrow question was whether the pistol was capable of firing a shot and it was the defendant\u2019s burden to establish by a fair preponderance of the evidence that a shot could not be fired from the pistol. The mere fact that a pistol is possessed or displayed on more than one occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>sion says absolutely nothing about its capacity to fire bullets. To hold otherwise is not only to indulge in convoluted logic but also to enshrine speculation in the pantheon of rational thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The jury were aware that the defendant had been convicted of another robbery. They were instructed that they could consider this previous conviction but only on the question of the defendant\u2019s credibility. They were specifically instructed that they were not to speculate about the answer to the prosecutor\u2019s question and were to draw no adverse inferences against the defendant from the stricken question. While it is obvious that the jury rejected the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense I fail to see how they could have been influenced by the knowledge that the defendant purportedly had used a pistol in another robbery. The defendant testified that the pistol he used in the crime charged was a \u201cstarter pistol\u201d he had purchased at a pawnbroker\u2019s in July, 1979. The pawnbroker testified that at the time of the alleged purchase he did sell \u201cstarter pistols.\u201d The defendant admitted that he had committed two robberies. He further admitted that he displayed a pistol in one of them, namely, the offense charged. If the jury were inclined to accept the defendant\u2019s explanation that the pistol was a \u201cblank gun\u201d and if they were inclined to believe that a gun was used in the other robbery, then they could have inferred that it too was a \u201cblank gun.\u201d I would find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">In this opinion Shea, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\"> \u201cCOURT\u2019S PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS TO JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">\u201cThe Court: I will so indicate, that the Court had you retire to the jury room, there was a motion outstanding, and an objection outstanding made by defense counsel. The Court has heard arguments and has sustained the objection of defense counsel. I would ask you to disregard completely the question that was asked. Put it out of your minds and not consider it at all in your deliberations. The Court, upon final instructions to you, will instruct you as to what consideration you can give to the testimony relating to a prior conviction. You will be limited to your considerations of that type of testimony as the Court instructs and I would ask you to keep that in mind at this point in time. You may proceed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\"> \u201cPARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF COURT\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS TO JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">\u201cNow, it is also my recollection, ladies and gentlemen, that the defendant and another witness Mr. Valentin admitted to having been convicted previously of crime. Now, evidence of those convictions may be considered by you only as affected their credibility as witnesses. We have a statute in Connecticut which provides that no person shall be disqualified as a witness because of conviction of crime, but that such conviction may be shown to affect his credibility. The fact that a witness was convicted of a crime, then, does not disqualify him as a witness and it should not be considered by you in that light. Under the old common law of course, persons who had been convicted of infamous crimes were not qualified to be witnesses at all. The statute which I refer to has been construed to have as its purpose to make persons who have been convicted of crime competent witnesses. However, it was not the intention of the legislature to make such a person necessarily entitled to full credit. The fact of the conviction is one of the factors for you to take into consideration, along with any other material facts in determining the credibility which you will accord to the defendant and to Mr. Valentin\u2019s testimony. Now, in this regard, I will caution you that evidence of prior conviction of the defendant, of a crime, even if said crime is of a similar nature to the crime of which he is presently charged, cannot be treated by you in any way as proof that the defendant is guilty of the crime of which he presently stands charged. In other words, such evidence is limited in its effect, and you may consider it only as to any weight it might have on the credibility to be afforded the testimony offered by Mr. Binet on direct or cross-examination. The evidence was permitted by the Court for that limited purpose only and should be considered by you only in that light. Now, further, you may recall that a particular question was posed to the defendant or the accused by the State on cross-examination, after his admission of a prior crime. And this was objected to by counsel for the defendant and arguments on that objection were heard by the Court out of the presence of the jury. Now, the Court sustained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>objection raised by the defense and the question was disallowed and no answer from the defendant was forthcoming. I would remind you, as I instructed you earlier in this charge, that you must not consider any evidence which was offered and refused. You must dismiss from your minds the question posed which was disallowed by the Court and stricken from the record. You must not speculate as to what answer may have been given to the disallowed question and no inference adverse to the accused may be drawn from the question which was stricken.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
