In the fourth count of the complaint the plaintiffs allege that the defendant has engaged in an unfair trade practice in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 38-61 and that such conduct violates the provisions of \u00a7 42-110b (a) (Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act \u2014 CUTPA). The defendant, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 147, filed a request that the plaintiffs revise their complaint by separating the fourth count into two separate counts. The court, <em>Cretella, J., </em>overruled the plaintiffs\u2019 objection to the defendant\u2019s request. Thereafter, the plaintiffs having declined to file a substitute pleading as required by Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u00a7 149, the court, <em>Fracasse, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion for partial judgment of nonsuit. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Although the appeal is from the judgment of nonsuit the assigned error is the decision overruling the plaintiffs\u2019 objection to the defendant\u2019s request to revise. That request was for the plaintiffs to separate the \u201ccauses of action\u201d alleged in the fourth count. The narrow issue presented in such a request is procedural not substantive. The sufficiency of the allegations is not involved. The question is whether the fourth count states two separate and distinct causes of action, in which case they should be contained in separate counts. Practice Book \u00a7 138. Unless the causes of action are both separable from each other and separable by some distinct line of demarcation a single count is appropriate. <em>Veits </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>134 Conn. 428, 438, 58 A.2d 389 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u201cA cause of action is that single group of facts which is claimed to have brought about an unlawful injury to the plaintiff and which entitles the plaintiff to relief.\u201d <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co. </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>139 Conn. 186, 197, 91 A.2d 778 (1952). \u201cA right of action at law arises from the existence of a primary right in the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>and an invasion of that right by some delict on the part of the defendant. The facts which establish the existence of that right and that delict constitute the cause of action.\u201d <em>Pavelka </em>v. <em>St. Albert Society, </em>82 Conn. 146, 147, 72 A. 725 (1909). \u201cIt is proper to amplify or expand what has already been alleged in support of a cause of action, provided the identity of the cause of action remains substantially the same, but where an entirely new and different factual situation is presented, a new and different cause of action is stated.\u201d <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>G. Fox &amp; Co., </em>148 Conn. 327, 330, 170 A.2d 724 (1961). If, however, the plaintiff\u2019s claims for relief grow out of a single occurrence or transaction or closely related occurrences or transactions they may be set forth in a single count and it does not matter that the claims for relief do not have the same legal basis. <em>Veits </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The allegations of the fourth count spell out a single cause of action. The plaintiffs seek to bring an action under CUTPA based on a claimed violation of an insurance statute. It is alleged that the defendant used conflicting meanings of \u201cactual cash value,\u201d that one meaning was used in selling insurance and a different meaning when a claim was presented. The plaintiffs allege that such conduct constitutes an unfair trade practice within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 38-61 and a violation of CUTPA. The sufficiency of these allegations as a basis for an action against the defendant was not before the trial court in its consideration of the defendant\u2019s request to separate. The only issue was whether the fourth count contained a single cause of action or two separate and distinct causes of action. The fact that the plaintiffs\u2019 statutory action under CUTPA is based on an alleged violation of another statute does not transform the plaintiffs\u2019 single cause of action into two causes of action. Whether the conduct which is alleged to have caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>involves a breach of a common law duty or a violation of one or more statutes or both there is but one cause of action. There being but one cause of action there was nothing for the plaintiffs to separate. The thrust of the defendant\u2019s request is to revise the fourth count of the complaint beyond recognition by removing the heart of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Under our adversary system a party may not be compelled to become his opponent\u2019s amanuensis.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to be proceeded with according to law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\"> The defendant moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was not taken from a final judgment. We denied the motion. A judgment of nonsuit may be rendered for failure of a party to comply with an order to separate causes of action. <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Mallory Battery Co., </em>188 Conn. 145, 150, 448 A.2d 829 (1982). A judgment of nonsuit is a final judgment from which an appeal lies; <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Revson, </em>159 Conn. 427, 430, 270 A.2d 559 (1970); notwithstanding that the cause remains undisposed of on other issues. Practice Book \u00a7 3001; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>124 Conn. 639, 642, 1 A.2d 761 (1938). A plaintiff may be nonsuited as to one of several divisible causes of action without affecting his right to proceed as to the others. <em>Warlick </em>v. <em>Reynolds &amp; Co., </em>151 N.C. 606, 613, 66 S.E. 657 (1910); 27 C.J.S., Dismissal &amp; Nonsuit \u00a7 52. The exception to this rule which precludes an appeal from a partial judgment; <em>Kilbride </em>v. <em>Dushkin Publishing Group, Inc., </em>186 Conn. 718, 724, 443 A.2d 922 (1982); applies only to judgments entered after the granting of a motion to strike.
