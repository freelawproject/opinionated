Fetterman, a former tenured professor at the University of Connecticut (hereinafter UConn), brought this action against UConn, the members of its board of trustees, certain officials at UConn, the members of the state employees\u2019 retirement commission, and the UConn chapter of the American Association of University Professors (hereinafter AAUP). She sought damages and declaratory relief for actions which she claims resulted in loss of salary, fringe benefits, pay for accumulated vacation and sick leave, and past and future retirement benefits. The trial court, <em>Corrigan, J., </em>granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction since the plaintiff had failed to pursue and exhaust her administrative remedies prior to commencing the action. It is from this judgment that the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint alleges the following facts: The plaintiff was a tenured professor at UConn and was a member of the AAUP at UConn from September 1,1966, through the 1978-79 academic year. By 1979, she had become eligible for voluntary retirement under a state retirement plan. On March 18,1979, the plaintiff accepted a position at the University of Massachusetts (hereinafter UMass) which represented a substantial professional advancement. In April of 1979, she sent a letter of resignation to UConn requesting that her date of resignation and retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>be December 31,1979. She also requested permission to begin using 180 days of accumulated vacation and sick leave at UConn and to continue on the active payroll until the effective date of her retirement. Upon learning that the plaintiff was on the payroll of two universities at the same time, UConn began in June of 1979 to withhold the plaintiffs paychecks, keeping them in escrow pending the resolution of the matter. On November 1,1979, the plaintiff was retired. However, since she was classified as an \u201celeven-month appointment\u201d rather than a \u201cnine-month appointment,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she was denied accrued vacation or sick leave and credited with twelve years, six months of employment rather than thirteen years, two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The plaintiff claims that while she was in the process of moving from her position at UConn to her new position at UMass, and while she continued to hold her tenured appointment at UConn and to render the services required of her there, her salary was cut off prematurely, and that she was dismissed without requisite hearings and in violation of several state and federal constitutional protections. This dismissal resulted in both immediate losses and prospective losses. The immediate losses claimed are the loss of salary from June, 1979, through December, 1979, loss of fringe benefits during that period, and loss of pay for accumulated vacation and sick leave. The prospective losses relate to retirement income, because those factors on which retirement benefits are based were shortened: the date of retirement, the years of service and the average annual regular salary for the three highest-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>paid years of state service, with the resulting reduction of benefits to continue for the remainder of the plaintiffs life. The plaintiff sought the following relief under the Connecticut Declaratory Judgment Act; General Statutes \u00a7 52-29; and the federal Civil Rights Act of 1871; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 and 1988;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the defendants named in their official capacities only (including UConn, members of its board of trustees, and members of the state employees retirement commission), declarations of the lawful dates of the plaintiff\u2019s retirement, her term of state service, and her removal from the state payroll, as well as a declaration that the bases on which actions were taken to stop the plaintiff\u2019s salary were unconstitutional and invalid; as to the individual defendants, five university officials who acted to stop the plaintiff\u2019s salary and who are named as defendants both in their individual and official capacities, compensatory and exemplary damages, together with costs and attorney\u2019s fees, as a result of infringements of state and federal constitutional protections; and as to the defendant union AAUP, the collective bargaining unit for the faculty at UConn, compensatory and exemplary damages substantially similar to those sought from the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The plaintiff presents the following issues in this appeal: (1) whether the trial court erred by requiring the plaintiff to pursue and exhaust her administrative remedies as a condition to subject matter jurisdiction, (2) whether the trial court erred in failing to construe pertinent provisions of the Trustees\u2019 Rules and the collective bargaining agreements to determine whether the defendants were required to institute hearings before suspending the plaintiff\u2019s salary, and (3) whether the trial court erred in excluding affidavits offered by the plaintiff at the hearing on the motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In a counterstatement of issues and alternative grounds upon which the judgment could be affirmed, the defendants submit that the trial court\u2019s dismissal was proper since (1) the plaintiff did not exhaust the contractual remedies available to her, (2) the plaintiff did not exhaust the administrative remedies available to her under UConn\u2019s laws and bylaws, (3) a declaratory judgment could not be rendered because all persons having an interest were not given reasonable notice, and (4) sovereign immunity barred an award for damages against UConn and the defendants sued in their official capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In order to facilitate an understanding of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, it is virtually essential to have at hand the sections of the relevant statutes and provisions of the collective bargaining agreements and UConn bylaws which were the subject of the motions to dismiss. Chapter 68 of the General Statutes is entitled \u201cCollective Bargaining for State Employees\u201d (hereinafter the act). Its provisions provide a comprehensive scheme for regulating the labor relations between state employees and the state as their employer. See General Statutes \u00a7 5-270 et seq. Under the authority of the act, UConn and AAUP entered into two successive collective bargaining agreements (hereinafter agreement^]) which governed the terms and conditions of the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>employment at UConn. Article 10 of each of the agreements makes provision for a grievance and arbitration procedure. A grievance is defined therein as <em>\u201ca </em>dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the terms or provisions of this agreement.\u201d The three step procedure begins with an informal discussion between the employee and the immediate UConn official involved. At the option of the employee, the AAUP may join the discussion. The final step involves arbitration; the AAUP, at the request of the employee, may proceed to arbitration at step 3. The decision of the arbitrator is to be final and binding, subject to statutory review procedures. The plaintiff also cites article 10.3 which provides: \u201cIf prior to seeking resolution of dispute by filing a grievance under this contract, or while the grievance proceeding is in progress, a member seeks to resolve the matter in any other forum, whether administrative or judicial, the Board [of Trustees] shall have no obligation to entertain or proceed with this grievance procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Article 10 also provides for a fifteen day time limitation for oral presentation and a thirty-seven day time limitation for -written presentation at step 1. If a grievance is not so presented, it is not deemed a grievance under the agreement. This arbitration procedure does not apply to matters of policy or grievances involving the UConn board of trustees\u2019 bylaws. For these matters, the agreements provide that the employee is required to follow the grievance procedures contained in UConn\u2019s bylaws rather than the contractual grievance/arbitration policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The plaintiff also cites various portions of article X.L. of the UConn laws, bylaws, and rules of the board of trustees. In particular, a tenured appointment may be terminated only for cause and <em>upon the </em>affirmative vote of nine trustees; adequate cause for dismissal must relate directly and substantially to the professional fit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ness of the faculty member; pending final decision on dismissal proceedings, for which detailed hearing procedures are provided, the faculty member may be suspended from duty or reassigned only if immediate harm to himself or others is threatened by continued performance of duties and with salary to continue during suspension; and faculty members with tenured status who are dismissed for reasons not involving moral turpitude are to receive their salaries for at least one year from the date of notification of dismissal. Lastly, the plaintiff cites article X.L. 13: \u201cNo member of the professional staff or other employee in the service of the University shall devote to private purposes any portion of the time due the University without the consent of the President. Members of the professional staff may take on outside consulting and research activities only after the specific project has been approved by the President [or the Provost]. Such approval shall take into account the time required, the nature of the service, potential conflict of interest, and the contribution of such activities to the professional advancement of the staff member. Any changes with respect to these matters after the project has been initiated shall also require approval in advance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Initially, it is important to recognize that at the hearing on the motions to dismiss, the lawyer for UConn stated that \u201c[w]e see no question of fact that\u2019s at issue right now.\u201d Accordingly, the trial judge treated the motions to dismiss as motions to erase which admit \u201call well pleaded facts, the complaint being construed most favorably to the plaintiff. <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>152 Conn. 228, 233, 206 A.2d 106 (1964).\u201d <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 227, 464 A.2d 45 (1983), quoting <em>American Laundry Machinery, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>190 Conn. 212, 459 A.2d 1031 (1983). A favorable construction of the complaint in this case reveals the following relevant \u201cfacts\u201d: the plaintiff was dismissed from her posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>tion at UConn as of June, although she was not retired\u2019 until November of 1979, and (2) no dismissal proceedings were held nor was any vote of the UConn board taken to terminate her position at UConn. The complaint contains no claim by the plaintiff that she pursued any contractual remedy under the collective bargaining agreement or any state administrative remedy under the bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">We first consider the claims of the plaintiff involving UConn, members of its board of trustees, members of the state employees retirement commission, and the five UConn officials in their official and individual capacities. The plaintiff maintains that UConn\u2019s characterization of her leaving the university as \u201cconstructive resignation\u201d constituted a deprivation of her due process rights and entitled her to legal and equitable remedies, including damages and declaratory relief, under \u00a7 1983 and the Connecticut Declaratory Judgment Act. In addition, she claims that article X.L. 13 of the Trustees\u2019 Rules which restricts outside activities of UConn employees is void for vagueness, that its overbreadth acts as an \u201cinvalid chilling restraint and impingement upon activities,\u201d and that it violates her rights under the state and federal due process clauses. She also claims that her termination \u201cwithout the required hearings and findings in connection with dismissal proceedings\u201d deprived her of due process rights. Count six is designed to pursue a class action, claiming that UConn\u2019s differing treatment between nine-month and eleven-month appointments violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. She also alleges that UConn\u2019s termination of her salary and other compensation without a hearing provided in the Trustees\u2019 Rules violated the due process and equal protection clauses of both the state and federal constitutions in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In her last count concerning UConn, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>plaintiff claims that UConn unduly interfered with and hindered her right to pursue her profession in violation of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The trial court in this case dismissed the entire case for the plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On appeal, the plaintiff maintains that since her dismissal was covered by the board\u2019s bylaws and grievable <em>only </em>to the board of trustees, a state administrative remedy, exhaustion was not required with respect to her \u00a7 1983 claims due to the recent holding in <em>Patsy </em>v. <em>Board of Regents of the State of Florida, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S. Ct. 2557, 73 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1982). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In the <em>Patsy </em>case, decided subsequent to the trial court\u2019s issuance of its memorandum of decision in this case, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201c[bjased on the legislative histories of both [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1997e, we conclude that exhaustion of state administrative remedies should not be required as a prerequisite to bringing an action pursuant to \u00a7 1983.\u201d Id., 516. The defendant UConn would seek to limit the holding of this case to \u00a7 1983 actions brought only in the federal courts. The incongruous result of such a limited interpretation, however, would be to allow plaintiffs instituting federal court actions to do so without exhausting state administrative remedies, while requiring plaintiffs suing in Connecticut courts to first exhaust such remedies. Since it is clear that claims for liability for deprivation of federal constitutional rights under \u00a7 1983 are claims as to which there is concurrent jurisdiction; <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 3 n.1, 100 S. Ct. 2502, 65 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1980); <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>173 Conn. 303, 306-11, 377 A.2d 327 (1977); we think that such a limitation on the court\u2019s holding is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Although we find that exhaustion was not required in this case on the \u00a7 1983 claims, we agree with the defendants that alternative grounds sustain the dismissal as to certain of the plaintiffs claims. Sovereign immunity is the alternative ground which will lead to dismissal of those portions of counts one through eight for which damages are requested in prayers two and three as well as the second half of prayer five.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The claims for damages brought against UConn and certain officials at the university are, in effect, actions against the state as a sovereign and are, therefore, barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. See <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>184 Conn. 339, 439 A.2d 1033 (1981). Consequently, such claims are subject to dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 143 of the Practice Book.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u201cWe have long recognized the common-law principle that the state cannot be sued without its consent. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 623, 376 A.2d 359 (1977); <em>Textron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>167 Conn. 334, 339, 355 A.2d 307 (1974). We have also recognized that because the state can act only through its officers and agents, a suit against a state officer concerning a matter in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>which the officer represents the state is, in effect, against the state. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra; <em>Textron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>supra; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 295, 297, 294 A.2d 290 (1972); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>151 Conn. 259, 262, 196 A.2d 596 (1963); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Argraves, </em>146 Conn. 316, 320, 150 A.2d 295 (1959). Therefore, we have dealt with such suits as if they were solely against the state and have referred to the state as the defendant. <em>Anselmo </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>135 Conn. 78, 79-80, 60 A.2d 767, cert. denied, 335 U.S. 859, 69 S. Ct. 132, 93 L. Ed. 405 (1948); <em>Rusch </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>130 Conn. 26, 34, 31 A.2d 457 (1943).\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>supra, 342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Independence, </em>445 U.S. 622, 100 S. Ct. 1398, 63 L. Ed. 2d 673, reh. denied, 446 U.S. 993, 100 S. Ct. 2979, 64 L. Ed. 2d 850 (1980), the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201c[w]here the immunity claimed by the defendant was well established at common law at the time Section 1983 was enacted, and where its rationale was compatible with the purposes of the Civil Rights Act, we have construed the statute to incorporate that immunity.\u201d Id., 638. The doctrine of sovereign immunity was well established at common law at the time \u00a7 1983 was enacted. It is supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>a strong policy reason; that is, to prevent the imposition of enormous fiscal burdens on states. As concluded by the court in <em>Quern </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 99 S. Ct. 1139, 59 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1979), Congress did not intend \u201cby the general language of Section 1983 to override the traditional sovereign immunity of the States.\u201d Id., 341. \u201cSection 1983 does not explicitly and by clear language indicate on its face an intent to sweep away the immunity of the States; nor does it have a history which focuses directly on the question of state liability and which shows that Congress considered and firmly decided to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States.\u201d Id., 345. The court in <em>Quern </em>noted that \u201cneither the language of the statute nor the legislative history discloses an intent to overturn the States\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity by imposing liability directly upon them.\u201d Id., 344 n.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">At oral argument, counsel for the plaintiff admitted that sovereign immunity was a bar to those claims involving UConn and those individuals sued in their official capacities. As to those defendants sued in their individual capacities, however, it was argued that the doctrine was inapplicable. Under the circumstances presented to us in this case, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The doctrine of sovereign immunity does not mandate that all suits against government officers in either their official or individual capacities, since they are in effect against the government, must be barred. The rule is well settled, however, that a suit against an officer of a state as representing the state in action and liability, where the state is the real party against whom relief is sought, and where judgment for the plaintiff, <em>although nominally against the officer as an individual, </em>would operate to control the action of the state or subject it to liability, is barred. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Par-izek, </em>158 Conn. 304, 259 A.2d 642 (1969), and 72 Am. Jur. 2d, States \u00a7 108. Since the plaintiff makes no claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>in this case that any of the defendant officers sued in their individual capacities acted pursuant to an unconstitutional enactment or in excess of statutory authority; see <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, 624, quoting Block, \u201cSuits Against Government Officers and the Sovereign Immunity Doctrine,\u201d 59 Harv. L. Rev. 1060, 1080 (1946); sovereign immunity requires dismissal of those portions of counts one through eight requesting relief by way of damages in the second, third and fifth prayers for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">A careful reading of <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, also requires us to deny the first prayer for relief which seeks a declaratory judgment as to the official dates of the plaintiffs termination for removal from the payroll and retirement. In <em>Horton, </em>we recognized that sovereign immunity does not generally bar judgments in declaratory judgment actions when state officials are involved: \u201cThe declaratory judgment procedure in Connecticut . . . is peculiarly well adapted to the judicial determination of controversies concerning <em>constitutional rights </em>and . . . the <em>constitutionality </em>of state legislative or executive action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 626. The plaintiffs <em>in Horton, </em>children enrolled in public schools in Canton, sought declaratory judgments declaring the educational financing system violative of the state and federal constitutions. Holding that sovereign immunity did not bar this suit against various state and town officials, we stated: \u201cA [judicial] holding to the contrary would foreclose proper judicial determination of a significant and substantial <em>constitutional </em>question the determination of which is manifestly in the public interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 628. Since the first prayer for relief seeks a declaratory judgment not alleged to involve a constitutional infringement or violation, this claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">As for the plaintiffs remaining claims vis-a-vis the defendant UConn, the trial court on remand will be left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>to consider on the merits the relief requested in the first half of prayer five and both sections (a) and (b) of the \u00a7 1983 claim in prayer six (from UConn\u2019s conduct as outlined in counts two through eight of the complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We next consider the plaintiffs claims against the defendant union AAUP. Count six of the complaint alleges that the AAUP condoned the maintenance of the dual system of appointments (i.e., nine-month and eleven-month employees), that said conduct of AAUP was not under color of state law, and that said conduct violated \u00a7 1983 and the equal protection clause of the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The plaintiffs count nine alleges that UConn and AAUP entered into two collective bargaining agreements, and that she requested AAUP to protect her rights, but that AAUP arbitrarily and in bad faith failed to take reasonable steps to protect such rights against actions by the other defendants. In addition, the plaintiff alleged that by entering into said agreements and by refusing to act to protect the plaintiffs rights, AAUP acted in concert with the other defendants in depriving the plaintiff of equal protection and of equal privileges and immunities entitling the plaintiff to relief under \u00a7\u00a7 1985 and 1988. Count ten repeated the allegations of the ninth count and alleged that by AAUP\u2019s refusal to act to protect her rights, it breached its duty to represent the plaintiff as required by the Collective Bargaining Act for State Employees and the collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">We find that the plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim in count six was improperly dismissed even though the plaintiff alleged that none of the actions taken by the AAUP was under color of state law. Section 1983 of 42 U.S.C. is available to redress deprivations under color of state law of rights, privileges and immunities secured by federal statutes as well as by the constitution. See <em>Maine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>v. <em>Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 100 S. Ct. 2502, 65 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1979). It has been held, however, that private persons, jointly engaged with state officials in a challenged action, are acting \u201cunder color of law\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983; if a complaint makes such allegations of a joint enterprise, the complaint is not defective if it fails to allege that the private defendant was acting under color of state law. See <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 27, 101 S. Ct. 183, 66 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1980). Although the plaintiff in this case did not employ the words \u201cjoint enterprise,\u201d she did allege that the \u201cdefendant Trustees <em>and </em>their predecessors, as the University Board, <em>and </em>University administrators, including defendants Wilson and Kersting, <em>and </em>defendant UCONN-AAUP\u201d violated \u00a7 1983. (Emphasis added.) Since the doctrine of sovereign immunity is not applicable to the union and since we have previously determined that exhaustion of the contractual or state administrative remedies was not required, we hold that count six alleges sufficient facts against the AAUP to withstand dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The plaintiffs \u00a7 1985 claim must fail since it is well settled that in order to make a viable claim under \u00a7 1985, the complaint must allege invidiously discriminatory, class-based animus and must allege facts showing this invidiousness. In the absence of any evidence of class-based animus, the action must fail. See <em>A &amp; A Concrete, Inc. </em>v. <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe, </em>676 F.2d 1330 (9th Cir. 1982); <em>Hutchens </em>v. <em>Beckham, </em>521 F. Sup. 426 (D. Ga. 1981); <em>Sappington </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>535 F. Sup. 429 (D. Pa. 1982). Since there is an absence of any such claim or facts concerning invidious, class-based animus in the complaint in this case, the trial court did not err in its dismissal of the \u00a7 1985 (3) claim against AAUP.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The plaintiffs final claims against the union, as outlined in count ten of the complaint, are those alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>unfair representation, which is a breach of the AAUP\u2019s duty arising under the act and a breach of the collective bargaining agreement itself. The plaintiff points to the agreement in this case which recognized \u201c[t]he University of Connecticut Chapter of the American Association of University Professors as the exclusive bargaining representative of members of the staff.\u201d She seems to be arguing that the AAUP had some duty to represent her under the collective bargaining agreement at hearings which were never pursued. In fact, the plaintiff argues in her brief that article 10.3 of the agreement cited earlier in this opinion \u201cclearly indicate^) that plaintiff\u2019s claims are not grievable under the collective bargaining agreements . . . .\u2019\u2019By force of such a concession, we think that the plaintiff surrendered any right to claim union representation in regard to that procedure. Had the plaintiff chosen to forego her claim for attorney\u2019s fees and initiate the faculty grievance procedure under the by-laws, she might have been allowed to pursue her claim if the AAUP had failed to represent her. Her pursuit of a judicial remedy, however, in lieu of the administrative grievance remedy extinguished her right to AAUP representation under the controlling agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">As for the plaintiffs unfair representation allegations under the act, she cites \u00a7 5-271 (c) which provides that an exclusive representative of employees \u201cshall be responsible for representing the interests of all such employees without discrimination and without regard to employee organization membership.\u201d The defendant AAUP argues that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is not viable since she must pursue this claim before the state board of labor relations prior to resort to any judicial remedies. Since unfair representation is a prohibited practice of statutory origin, the union argues that no relief is available in court <em>except </em>the enforcement of an order of the state board of labor relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Even if we assume that this claim is properly labeled a prohibited practice under \u00a7 5-272, we do not read the act to provide nor do we find authority for the assertion that any state board of labor relations remedy available to the plaintiff is exclusive. Having alleged a breach of the duty to represent her fairly, and resultant injuries and losses, the plaintiff has adequately set forth a claim of unfair representation; the trial court erred in dismissing this claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">In view of our conclusions herein, as to UConn we uphold the trial court\u2019s dismissal of those portions of counts one through eight which may not be pursued due to the doctrine of sovereign immunity. As to the union AAUP, we conclude that a dismissal as to only count nine and part of ten against them was warranted. Accordingly, we remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings on the following issues: as to UConn, (1) whether the sixth count, involving the \u201cdual system of appointments,\u201d may be maintained as a class action pursuant to \u00a7 88 of the Practice Book, (2) whether article X.L. 13 of the Trustees\u2019 Rules is unconstitutional for the reasons alleged in the second, third and fourth counts of the complaint, and (3) whether the doctrine of \u201cconstructive or implied resignation\u201d in the circumstances of.this case is unconsitutional for the reasons alleged in the first, fifth, seventh and eighth counts of the complaint. As to the Union, we remand for consideration of (1) whether the \u00a7 1983 claim in count six is meritorious, and (2) whether the union breached its duty of fair representation under the act as outlined in count ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">There is error in part, the judgment is set aside in part and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\"> Paragraph 37 of count six described this \u201cdual system of appointments, to wit: \u2018nine-month appointments\u2019 and \u2018eleven-month appointments\u2019; with substantial differences in compensation and other employment benefits, including permitting nine-month appointees to accrue unused vacation and sick leave days and to receive equivalent salaries and compensation for serving only nine-months per year while eleven-month appointees were not permitted to accrue vacation and sick leave days.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-29. superior court may declare rights and legal relations.
