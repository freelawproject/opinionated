We now hold that such an order is not a final judgment and therefore is not appealable until final adjudication of the underlying charges. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">The defendant was charged by substitute information on November 5,1981, with the crimes of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>\u00a7 53a-55, manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a, and carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35. On June 9,1982, the defendant, who was seventeen years old on the date of the alleged crime, filed an application for youthful offender eligibility pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-76b<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 12, 1982, the trial court denied the application, and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In Connecticut an appeal is purely a statutory privilege accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute and the rules of court for taking and prosecuting the appeal are met. <em>State </em>v. <em>Audet, </em>170 Conn. 337, 341-42, 365 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>A.2d 1082 (1976); <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>135 Conn. 262, 266, 63 A.2d 589 (1948), aff'd, 337 U.S. 901, 69 S. Ct. 1046, 93 L. Ed. 1715 (1949). Sections 52-263 and 51-197a of the General Statutes provide that a party who is aggrieved by an order or decision of the trial court may appeal from the court\u2019s final judgment. Thus, an order denying youthful offender status is immediately appealable <em>only </em>if it is a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>179 Conn. 98, 425 A.2d 574 (1979), we held that an order denying youthful offender eligibility is an appealable final judgment. Upon reconsideration in light of the test for finality that has since evolved, we overrule <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell </em>and hold that an order denying youthful offender status is not an appealable final judgment.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u201cThe appealable final judgment in a criminal case is ordinarily the imposition of sentence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Seravalli, </em>189 Conn. 201, 205, 455 A.2d 852 (1983), quoted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Grotton, </em>180 Conn. 290, 293, 429 A.2d 871 (1980). Certain interlocutory orders and decisions, however, satisfy the final judgment rule and may be appealed immediately. \u201cAn otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31; <em>State </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>191 Conn. 506, 467 A.2d 920 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The first prong of the <em>Cureio </em>test for finality is not satisfied here. In response to the defendant\u2019s application the trial court did conduct a hearing concerning the defendant\u2019s eligibility for youthful offender status. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-76d. But this hearing was not a procedure that could be considered \u201cseparate and distinct from the guilt determining process.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra. The hearing to determine youthful offender eligibility is occasioned by the state\u2019s filing charges against the accused and determines only the procedures that will be used to adjudicate those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We turn then to the second prong of the <em>Cureio </em>test for finality to determine if the trial court\u2019s denial of youthful offender status so concluded the rights of the defendant that further proceedings cannot affect them. \u201cA presentence order will be deemed final for purposes of appeal \u2018only if it involves a claimed right \u201cthe legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>186 Conn. 547, 553, 442 A.2d 939, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Moeller </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>459 U.S. 838, 103 S. Ct. 85, 74 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 80 (1982), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>435 U.S. 850, 860, 98 S. Ct. 1547, 56 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1978).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell </em>the three judge majority held that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s determination in the present case denying the defendant\u2019s eligibility to be adjudged a youthful offender deprived him of his statutory right to a private hearing with sealed records. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-76h, 54-76Z, and 54-76o. Subsequent criminal proceedings, no matter what the eventual outcome, cannot regain for the defendant the privacy lost through the denial of his application and consequent public trial. The trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant was not eligible to be adjudged a youthful offender is, therefore, a final, appealable judgment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 99-100. Two judges dissented on the ground that the trial court\u2019s denial of youthful offender status, if erroneous, would not harm the defendant in any way that could not be fully remedied by appropriate appellate relief after conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 102. <em>(Loiselle, J., </em>dissenting). Therefore, the dissent stated that the denial was not a final judgment and thus not immediately appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We now overrule <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell </em>and hold that a trial court denial of an application for youthful offender status is not an appealable final judgment under \u00a7 52-263. We base this holding on our determination that such an order does not meet the second prong of the <em>Cur-do </em>test. We do not agree with the dissenters in <em>Bell, </em>however, that the defendant\u2019s privacy is not irreparably harmed by delaying the appeal and going forward with trial. General Statutes \u00a7 54-76h<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>a defendant who has been accorded youthful offender status enters a plea of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the resulting trial must be conducted in private. Furthermore, one accorded youthful offender status who is detained during the court proceedings must be held in segregation from criminal defendants over the age of eighteen. Once the defendant undergoes a public trial or is detained with the general jail population, his privacy cannot be restored by a subsequent private trial or by subsequent segregation detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Our decision that the trial court\u2019s order is not immediately appealable is founded on a different consideration. In order to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Curdo </em>test the defendant must do more than show that the trial court\u2019s decision threatens him with irreparable harm. The defendant must show that that decision threatens to abrogate a right that he or she <em>then </em>holds. Thus, where a defendant plausibly demonstrates that a trial court order threatens his or her double jeopardy right not to be tried twice for the same offense, the appeal is within our jurisdiction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moeller, </em>178 Conn. 67, 420 A.2d 1153, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 950, 100 S. Ct. 423, 62 L. Ed. 2d 320 (1979). That order is appealable because, at the time of the appeal, the defendant already has an unqualified right to be free from double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>By contrast, no defendant has a right to be accorded youthful offender status. Section 54-76b provides that if the defendant is between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, is charged with a crime other than a class A felony, and has not previously been adjudged a youthful offender or has not been granted accelerated rehabilitation, the defendant has a right <em>to apply </em>for youthful offender status. As part of this right of application the trial court must immediately seal the information or complaint and investigate the application, as the court did in this case. But the decision as to whether youthful offender status should be granted is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. Unlike the double jeopardy protection, no defendant has a right to the privileges that attend youthful offender status until a court accords the defendant that status. Thus, the rights that this defendant claims to be threatened by the trial court\u2019s decision are potential rights to which he is not yet entitled. He cannot, therefore, successfully claim that the trial court\u2019s order irreparably deprives him of a right to private trial and segregated confinement. The trial court\u2019s order does not meet our test for finality and is therefore not appealable until judgment on the underlying charge is rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We stress that this holding is a narrow one. We hold only that when a statute vests the trial court with discretion to determine if a particular defendant is to be accorded a certain status, the defendant may not invoke the rights that attend the status as a basis for claiming that the court\u2019s decision not to confer that status deprives the defendant of protections to which he or she is entitled. For an interlocutory order to be an appealable final judgment it must threaten the preservation of a right that the defendant already holds. The right itself must exist independently of the order from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>which the appeal is taken.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where a decision has the effect of not granting a particular right, that decision, even if erroneous, does not threaten the defendant\u2019s already existing rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">We also stress that the distinction is not one of constitutional rights versus statutory rights. If a statute vests all criminal defendants, or a class of defendants, with a right to certain protections, a defendant within that class may appeal immediately a trial court order that plausibly threatens that right irreparably. Again, the dispositive issue is whether the defendant already enjoys a right that the order threatens irreparably. If so, the order may be appealed immediately. If the order merely denies an application for privileged status, thereby foreclosing the rights that attend such a status, it may be appealed only after final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The appeal is dismissed sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In this opinion Shea and Grillo, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 54-76b. youthful offenders: definitions.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 34, 463 A.2d 566 (1983), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>646 F.2d 132 (4th Cir. 1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Seravalli, </em>189 Conn. 201, 455 A.2d 852 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spendolini, </em>189 Conn. 92, 454 A.2d 720 (1983). Because the defendant has no statutory or constitutional right to youthful offender status unless he has been adjudicated a youthful offender, an order denying that status does not threaten his existing rights, irreparably or otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b107-8\">Peters, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayz\">(concurring). I agree with the majority that it is time to reconsider <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>179 Conn. 98, 425 A.2d 574 (1979). As I noted in my dissent in <em>State </em>v. <em>Spendolini, </em>189 Conn. 92, 97, 454 A.2d 720 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>(1982) , it is difficult to perceive a viable distinction between an immediate appeal of youthful offender status, which <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell </em>permitted, and an immediate appeal of accelerated pretrial rehabilitation status, which <em>State </em>v. <em>Spendolini </em>subsequently prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In the recent decisions of this court, the concept of final judgment has been given, whenever possible, a narrow rather than an expansive interpretation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>191 Conn. 506, 467 A.2d 920 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Seravalli, </em>189 Conn. 201, 209-10, 455 A.2d 852 (1983) , as well as the cases cited by the majority. Although I have not always agreed with this interpretation,' I believe that in matters of this kind, when the majority opinion has prevailed, it is better for me, having voiced my objection without success, to join the majority for the future. The contours of a final judgment are at best elusive. It is important that criminal proceedings not be diverted from their orderly progress to trial and judgment by holding out to the litigants an invitation to speculate about what interlocutory rulings this court may entertain. Although I was a member of the majority in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>and a dissenter in <em>State </em>v. <em>Spendolini, </em>I agree that <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell </em>should now be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">I would like to emphasize the importance of the statement, in the majority opinion, that it is within the competence of the legislature to determine whether disappointed applicants for youthful offender status or accelerated rehabilitation status should be afforded greater rights than they currently enjoy. I take this language to encompass the possibility that the legislature might expressly authorize an immediate appeal, or might restate the rights of applicants for these programs in a more' affirmative way. Under the prevailing interpretation of these programs, since they have been deemed to confer no present rights, their administration is vested in the virtually unreviewable discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>tion of the trial court. If these programs are to have a greater range than we have assigned to them, the legislature must put their amendment on its agenda.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b109-5\">Arthur H.

I do not agree with the reasoning or the result reached by my colleagues in overruling <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>179 Conn. 98, 425 A.2d 574, which was decided in 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Initially, there are important considerations in overruling a precedent which I do not find demonstrated in this case. There can be no doubt that \u201c \u2018[e]xperience can and often does demonstrate that a rule, once believed sound, needs modification to serve justice better. Ziman <em>v. Whitley, </em>110 Conn. 108, 114, 147 A. 370 [1929]; <em>Napier </em>v. <em>Peoples Stores Co., </em>98 Conn. 414, 426, 120 A. 295 [1923]; <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>[142 Conn. 53, 62, 111 A.2d 4 (1955)]; see also <em>Funk </em>v. <em>United States, </em>290 U.S. 371, 54 S.

I concede, as I must, that \u201c[i]t is more important that the court should be right upon later and more elaborate consideration of the cases than consistent with previous declarations. Those doctrines only will eventually stand which bear the strictest examination and the test of experience.\u201d <em>Barden </em>v. <em>Northern Pacific R. Co., </em>154 U.S. 288, 322, 14 S. Ct. 1030, 38 L. Ed. 992 (1894) (Field, J.). As Justice Frankfurter stated, in changing the position he had taken in an earlier case: \u201cWisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.\u201d <em>Henslee </em>v. <em>Union Planters National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>335 U.S. 595, 600, 69 S.

It is crucial to continue to recognize that \u201c[i]f . . . stare decisis is to continue to serve the cause of stability and certainty in the law \u2014 a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>dition indispensable to any well-ordered system of jurisprudence \u2014 a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it.

Rather the majority simply asserts that \u201c[u]pon reconsideration in light of the test for finality that has since evolved, we overrule <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell </em>and hold that an order denying youthful offender status is not an appealable final judgment.\u201d Our cases since <em>Bell, </em>however, do not support this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">This court has clearly approved of and explicated our holding in <em>Bell </em>that a denial of youthful offender status is an appealable final judgment. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 36, 463 A.2d 566 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spendolini, </em>189 Conn. 92, 96, 454 A.2d 720 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>180 Conn. 141, 145-46, 429 A.2d 810 (1980). Like <em>the Bell </em>majority, today\u2019s majority sensibly recognizes, as it must, that its position denying appealability causes irreparable harm to an accused denied youthful offender status. This indeed conflicts with our very recent announcement in <em>Curdo </em>that the second test for finality \u201cfocuses not on the proceeding involved, but on the potential harm to the [defendant\u2019s] rights.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 33. This court aptly expressed its concern of this focus in <em>Curdo </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>irreparable harm rather than the punctum temporis of the particular right when it said that \u201c[a] presentence order will be deemed final for purposes of appeal \u2018only if it involves a claimed right \u201cthe legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>186 Conn. 547, 553, 442 A.2d 939, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Moeller </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>459 U.S. 838, 103 S. Ct. 85, 74 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1982), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>435 U.S. 850, 860, 98 S. Ct. 1547, 56 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1978).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 33-34. Further, in explaining this focal concern, the <em>Curdo </em>court took care to explain and reaffirm our holding in <em>Bell </em>by stating \u201cin <em>Bell </em>the appellant demonstrated a statutory right to be adjudged a youthful offender. We found the privacy rights bestowed by the statute to be in danger of irretrievable loss if the case proceeded through public trial and to final judgment before the appeal\u2019s merits were considered. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 36. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Seravalli, </em>189 Conn. 201, 205, 455 A.2d 852 (1983), in which we reiterated \u201cthat certain presentence orders or actions by a trial court may be considered final for purposes of appeal \u2018where the otherwise interlocutory ruling challenged on appeal cannot, if erroneous, later be remedied by suppression of the evidence or reversal of the conviction after trial.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Grotton, </em>[180 Conn. 290, 293, 429 A.2d 871 (1980)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>[186 Conn. 547, 553, 442 A.2d 939, cert. denied sub. nom. <em>Moeller </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>459 U.S. 838, 103 S. Ct. 85, 74 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1982)]; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Spendolini, </em>189 Conn. 92, 454 A.2d 720 (1983), and cases cited therein.\u201d Thus, the majority\u2019s assertion, that the evolution of our test for finality since <em>Bell </em>requires the overruling of the holding that a denial of youthful offender status is an appealable final judgment, is unsupported by our case law and is not in accord with guiding considerations for overruling an earlier case as set out above. I, therefore, cannot con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>elude that close examination of our cases since <em>Bell, </em>reason, experience or wisdom require the overruling of its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">As I understand the majority opinion, that focal concern for irreparable harm in the final judgment rule is indeed lessened by today\u2019s ruling. I see no ratio decidendi given by the majority on how substantial justice will be served or irreparable harm avoided by today\u2019s ruling which effectively forecloses any judicial review looking to achieve the former or to avoid the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Although I would reach the merits of this appeal, any such discussion would serve no useful purpose under the circumstances. Accordingly, I limit this dissent to the jurisdictional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
