See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lafferty, </em>189 Conn. 360, 456 A.2d 272 (1983), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Lafferty, </em>191 Conn. 73, 463 A.2d 238 (1983). Since we have a full record before us, we may now properly consider whether the trial court erred in concluding that under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-47 (a) (4) the release of an insanity acquittee who is a danger to property would not constitute a \u201cdanger to himself or others\u201d and should be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">A full history of this case is recited in the two previous <em>Lafferty </em>cases. It suffices to say here that the defendant was acquitted on the ground of insanity of embezzling $309,000 from his employer. At trial, the defendant presented evidence showing that at the time of the commission of the crimes, he was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>result of a mental defect known as pathological or compulsive gambling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response to our second remand for articulation, the trial court specifically found that \u201c(1) the defendant, as a result of mental disease or defect, poses a danger to the property of others; and (2) the defendant is likely, as a result of a mental disease or defect, to commit crimes against property as defined in General Statutes Chapter 941 or Chapter 952.\u201d The trial court refused, however, to commit the defendant, believing that a person who posed only a danger to property was not \u201ca danger to himself or others\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-47 (a) (4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons outlined in this opinion, we find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The sole issue presented in this case is one involving statutory construction. The language of \u00a7 53a-47 (a) (4) does not disclose whether the requisite \u201cdanger to himself or others\u201d includes danger to property. Thus, we construe the term \u201cdanger\u201d according to the \u201ccommonly approved usage of the language.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979) defines \u201cdanger\u201d to mean \u201c[]Jeopardy, <em>exposure to loss or injury; </em>peril.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The term is similarly defined in the American Heritage Dictionary (1978) to refer to \u201c[ejxposure or vulnerability to harm or evil; risk; peril.\u201d While these definitions are neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>sarily imprecise, they clearly include a danger to property, such as the financial loss of over $300,000 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">This construction finds additional support in the commentary of the commission to revise the criminal statutes, whose observations this court and the Appellate Session of the Superior Court have had occasion to note in several recent cases. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 471 A.2d 632 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>190 Conn. 496, 461 A.2d 973 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-5), </em>36 Conn. Sup. 527, 416 A.2d 168 (1980). The commentary to \u00a7 53a-47 explains that \u201c \u2018danger to himself or others\u2019 \u2014 is <em>not meant to be confined to physical danger; </em>thus, a kleptomaniac, who constitutes a danger to the property of others, might under appropriate circumstances be held to constitute such a danger.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53a-47 (West Ed. 1971), Commission Comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The conclusion that an insanity acquittee is dangerous when his conduct poses a danger to property is also supported by decisions from other jurisdictions. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a court cited for its comprehensive treatment of this area of the law; see \u201cCommitment of Persons Acquitted by Reason of Insanity: The Example of the District of Columbia,\u201d 74 Colum. L. Rev. 733 (1974); has adhered to this view. In <em>Overholser </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>283 F.2d 195 (D.C. Cir. 1960), the court, noting that a person found to have passed bad checks was dangerous, stated: \u201cWe think the danger to the public need not be possible physical violence or a crime of violence. It is enough if there is competent evidence that he may commit any criminal act, for any such act will injure others . . . .\u201d Id., 198. In <em>Overholser v. O\u2019Beirne, </em>302 F.2d 852 (D.C. Cir. 1961), the court dispelled any notion that larceny, the crime charged in the present case, was not a dangerous offense: \u201c[T]o describe the theft of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>watches and jewelry as \u2018non-dangerous\u2019 is to confuse danger with violence. . . . Larceny, assault and murder are all dangerous; they are simply different areas of prohibited conduct.\u201d Id., 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In other contexts as well, courts have deemed the concept of dangerousness to include nonviolent danger to property. It has been held that deliberate and persistent violation of the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations justifies a denial of post-conviction bail on the ground that the defendant poses a danger to the community. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Karmann, </em>471 F. Sup. 1021, 1022 (D. Cal. 1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Erickson, </em>506 F. Sup. 83 (D. Okl. 1980). A convicted gambler\u2019s post-conviction bail was revoked by the court because he was subsequently indicted for a similar offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Maccioli, </em>110 N.J. Super. 352, 265 A.2d 561 (1970). In that case, the court pointed out that under certain circumstances, gambling offenses, along with other white-collar crimes, seriously threaten the safety of the community to the same extent as certain crimes of physical violence. Id., 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Lastly, we view confinement of the defendant in this case to be consistent with the purposes of \u00a7 53a-47 (a) (4). The trial judge found that the defendant was likely to commit crimes against property in the future.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since the purposes of commitment following an insanity acquittal include the protection of society as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>proper treatment and protection of the defendant; see <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>463 U.S. 354, 103 S. Ct. 3043, 77 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1983); we find that confinement was required in this case. The predatory tendencies of a potential embezzler seriously endanger the public at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 then provided, in relevant part: \u201cIn any prosecution for an offense, it shall be a defense that the defendant, at the time of the proscribed conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. . . . \u201d This section has since been substantially revised. The General Assembly has recently enacted legislation providing that pathological or compulsive gambling may no longer be used as a defense. See Public Acts 1983, No. 83-486, \u00a7 1 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-47 (a) (4) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the court determines that the preponderance of the evidence at the hearing establishes that such person is mentally ill to the extent that his release would constitute <em>a danger to himself or others, </em>the court shall confine such person in a suitable hospital or other treatment facility.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This section has since been substantially revised. See Public Acts 1981, No. 81-301, \u00a7 2; Public Acts 1983, No. 83-486, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\"> In his second articulated memorandum of decision, dated September 8, 1983, the court, <em>Daly, J., </em>indicated that his finding was based on the testimony of Hans Langhammer, a psychiatrist at the Norwich State Hospital. At the hearing required by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-47, Langhammer testified in pertinent part: \u201cIt is more likely than not that he [the defendant] will again indulge at some time in the future at gambling activities. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">\u201cMore likely means 51 percent and up. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">\u201cHe would not be a danger to others in a physical sense, but in a property sense. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">\u201cDue to mental illness, his release would constitute a danger to himself or others in a property sense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
