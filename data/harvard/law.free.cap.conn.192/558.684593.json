(McLaughlin), and the defendant, Ford Motor Company (Ford).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The principal issues presented involve the applicability of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-110a through 42-1 lOg; to nonconsumers, such as automobile manufacturers and dealers. The first count of the complaint alleged that Ford had breached the franchise agreement in several respects by the appointment of another Lincoln-Mercury dealer at a location seven and one-half miles from the plaintiff. The second count repeated the allegations of the first count and added a paragraph claiming that Ford had committed unfair trade practices in violation of CUTPA. On the first count the trial court found a breach only of a procedural requirement of the franchise agreement requiring a hearing before the dealer policy board established by Ford and issued an injunction to secure compliance therewith. The injunction was dissolved after this procedural deficiency had been rectified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the second count judgment was rendered for the defendant, the court finding that no unfair trade practices had been proved against Ford. Although the plaintiffs appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>encompasses both counts, it has briefed no issues related to the first count and any claims of error in the judgment on that count must be treated as abandoned. <em>Czarnecki </em>v. <em>Plastics Liquidating Co., </em>179 Conn. 261, 262 n.1, 425 A.2d 1289 (1979); <em>Sachem\u2019s Head Assn. </em>v. <em>Lufkin, </em>168 Conn. 365, 366, 362 A.2d 519 (1975). With respect to the second count the plaintiff claims that the court erred (1) in denying a motion to amend the complaint after both parties had rested and (2) in failing to apply the proper test for determining whether a party has committed unfair trade practices. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The facts found by the trial court are as follows: On June 1,1972, Ron Kelly Ford, Inc., (Kelly) of New Milford entered into a sales and service agreement with Ford designating Kelly as the dealer for Mercury products in the New Milford locality.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The rights under this agreement were transferred to McLaughlin on August 6, 1973, and from that date McLaughlin has been the dealer of Ford-Mercury products in the New Milford locality.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In the sales and service agreement governing Ford\u2019s relationship with McLaughlin, Ford retained the right to determine \u201cthe numbers, locations and sizes of authorized dealers necessary for proper and satisfactory sales and service representation for [Ford\u2019s products] within and without the DEALER\u2019S LOCALITY.\u201d Ford also retained the right to \u201cappoint additional dealers in VEHICLES within or without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>DEALER\u2019S LOCALITY except that, if an additional dealer [would] be within the DEALER\u2019S LOCALITY and within ten (10) miles driving distance of the Dealer\u2019s principal place of business, [Ford would] not appoint the additional dealer unless a study made pursuant to subparagraph 9 (a) reasonably demonstrate^], in [Ford\u2019s] opinion, that such appointment [was] necessary to provide VEHICLES with proper sales and service representation in such locality.\u201d Under the same provision McLaughlin was given thirty days to review the study and file objections with Ford. In turn, Ford was obligated to consider the objections prior to entering into negotiations with \u201cany dealer prospect.\u201d If McLaughlin\u2019s protestations were unsuccessful, McLaughlin had the right to appeal to the dealer policy board, a tribunal designed to resolve disputes between Ford and its dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The procedural protections provided McLaughlin were subject to one exception: \u201cNothing in this paragraph 9 shall restrict the right of the Company to appoint a dealer in VEHICLES as a replacement for a dealer in VEHICLES, or to fill an established open point for a dealer in VEHICLES, at or near a location previously approved by the Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In July, 1979, Bragg Motors, a dealer of Lincoln-Mercury products in the Danbury locality,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ceased doing business. Thereafter, Ford began to search for a dealer to replace Bragg Motors, and eventually entered into an agreement of representation with Greentree Toyota (Greentree). Greentree\u2019s place of business is located in Brookfield, approximately seven and one-half miles from McLaughlin\u2019s place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Upon learning that Greentree was the most likely candidate to replace Bragg Motors, McLaughlin mailed two letters to the dealer policy board objecting to the appointment of Greentree. The board responded to both letters, informing McLaughlin that it believed McLaughlin\u2019s objections were premature because no recommendation for such an appointment had yet been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">There was no further correspondence between the board and McLaughlin until the latter part of July, 1981, when McLaughlin was informed by letter that \"the Board [was] constrained to support the Lincoln-Mercury Division\u2019s appointment of the Brookfield Ibyota dealer.\u201d The board offered to discuss the matter further, but because of business exigencies, required the discussion to be held within the following week. McLaughlin again objected to the proposal, and requested an opportunity to review the market study referred to in the franchise agreement and also a hearing before the board. McLaughlin was informed on August 7 by wire, and in a letter dated August 10, that there was no market study and that a hearing was scheduled for August 12. McLaughlin declined to appear at the hearing, opting to institute on August 28 the civil suit that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Both parties<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> agreed to expedite the disposition of the case and then proceeded to trial on September 16, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The first claim of error concerns the denial of McLaughlin\u2019s motion to amend its complaint. McLaughlin contends that General Statutes \u00a7 52-128<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>and Practice Book \u00a7 175<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> granted it an absolute right to amend its complaint within thirty days from the return date and that such time had not expired when the amendment was offered even though both parties had finished presenting evidence. The plaintiff further maintains that, even if it did not have an absolute right to amend its complaint, the court, nonetheless, abused its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">We have frequently held that \u201c[wjhether an amendment should be granted at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case lies within the sound discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Jacovino, </em>161 Conn. 462, 471, 290 A.2d 225 (1971); <em>Antonofsky </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>144 Conn. 594, 598, 136 A.2d 338 (1957); <em>Yavis </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>137 Conn. 253, 263, 76 A.2d 99 (1950). Here, the amendment was sought after the <em>defendant </em>had rested. It is inconceivable that either the statute or the rule was intended to restrict the discretion of judges in allowing amendments after commencement of trial and thus upset orderly procedures<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> simply because of the circumstance that, due to expedition of a case by counsel and the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the trial has been virtually completed within thirty days of the return date. We hold that the right to amend without court approval as provided by \u00a7 52-128 and Practice Book \u00a7 175 is applicable only when the amendment is offered prior to commencement of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Nor do we agree that the court abused its discretion in disallowing the amendment made at this late stage of trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cThe trial court has wide discretion in granting or denying amendments before, during, or after trial.\u201d <em>Lawson </em>v. Godfried, 181 Conn. 214, 216, 435 A.2d 15 (1980); see also <em>Citizens National Bank </em>v. <em>Hub-ney, </em>182 Conn. 310, 312, 438 A.2d 430 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">It would be most exceptional to find an abuse of discretion in refusing an amendment offered, as here, at the close of evidence. <em>Freccia </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>163 Conn. 160, 164-65, 302 A.2d 280 (1972); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Toscano, </em>144 Conn. 582, 588-89,136 A.2d 341 (1957). The proposed amendment was in the form of a substitute complaint which primarily elaborated upon the original allegations by referring to and reciting some additional provisions of the franchise agreement. Some new paragraphs were included which detailed the circumstances relating to the initial denial by the policy board of the existence of a market study and its failure to conduct a hearing. The trial court found virtually all of these facts as alleged by the plaintiff in rendering judgment in its favor on the first count. The legal claims of the plaintiff that the sequence of events demonstrated deception on the part of Ford or that the franchise agreement was unconscionable appear to have been considered on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the basis of the evidence presented and were rejected. These CUTPA claims were within the scope of the original complaint which alleged \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practices\u201d generally. The only reference in the memorandum of decision to any deficiencies in the complaint is to the absence of any allegation of consumer deception or that \u201cFord\u2019s conduct is substantially injurious to consumers.\u201d The amended complaint did not seek to remedy this deficiency. The absence of demonstrable prejudice is a factor which strongly supports the conclusion that there was no error in the trial court\u2019s disallowance of the plaintiff\u2019s proffered amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s remaining claim of error concerns the trial court\u2019s ruling on the alleged CUTPA violations. In the memorandum of decision the court stated: \u201c \u2018A trade practice is unfair when it offends established public policy and is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.\u2019 <em>Covenant Radio Corp. </em>v. <em>Ten Eighty Corp., </em>35 Conn. Sup. 1 [390 A.2d 249 (1977)], quoting <em>Spiegel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commission, </em>540 F.2d 287, 293 (7th Cir. 1976). The plaintiff has not alleged, and there has been no evidence, that the challenged conduct of Ford Motor Company is immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous. Likewise, there is no claim that Ford\u2019s conduct is substantially injurious to consumers. \u2018For a trade practice to be deceptive, it must have a tendency and capacity to deceive the consumer.\u2019 <em>Covenant Radio Corp. </em>v. <em>Ten Eighty Corp., </em>supra. As there is no element of deception of consumers present or alleged, the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that Ford has committed a deceptive trade practice must fail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In this appeal, the plaintiff maintains that the trial court erroneously limited CUTPA\u2019s protection to conduct involving consumer injury. McLaughlin further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>maintains that, although Ford\u2019s conduct may not have been oppressive or unethical,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it was against public policy and was substantially injurious to McLaughlin. Any one of these factors alone, McLaughlin maintains, is sufficient to state a cause of action under CUTPA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> McLaughlin maintains, therefore, that the court erred ip denying its requested relief on the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">We agree with the plaintiff that CUTPA is not limited to conduct involving consumer injury. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a) provides in part: \u201cAny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b, may bring an action . . . to recover actual damages.\u201d Person, as defined by the statute, includes: \u201ca natural person, corporation, trust, partnership, incorporated or unincorporated association, and any other legal entity.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a (3). The statute\u2019s coverage is broad and its purpose remedial. <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>184 Conn. 607, 616, 440 A.2d 810 (1981). The General Assembly has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>seen fit to limit expressly the statute\u2019s coverage to instances involving consumer injury, and we decline to insert that limitation. We agree with the plaintiff that a competitor or other business person can maintain a CUTPA cause of action without showing consumer injury. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>36 Conn. Sup. 183, 188, 416 A.2d 170 (1979); see generally Langer &amp; Orm-stedt, \u201cThe Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,\u201d 54 Conn. B.J. 388 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In order to prevail in a cause of action under CUTPA, the facts proved by the evidence must establish either \u201cunfair methods of competition [or] unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\u201d which \u201chave a potential effect on the general consuming public.\u201d <em>Ivey, Barnum &amp; O\u2019Mara v. Indian Harbor Properties, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 528, 533, 540, 461 A.2d 1369 (1983); see also <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>191 Conn. 484, 491-93, 464 A.2d 847 (1983). The plaintiff maintains that the facts as found by the trial court, which are unchallenged, establish such unfair trade practices.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The legislature has directed that \u201ccourts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts to Section 5 (a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45 (a) (1)).\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (b). We followed this mandate recently, and adopted the criteria set out in the \u201ccigarette rule\u201d by the federal trade com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>mission for determining when a practice is unfair: \u201c(1) [WJhether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise \u2014 whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers [(competitors or other businessmen)].\u201d <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>supra, 492-93, quoting <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>405 U.S. 233, 244-45 n.5, 92 S. Ct. 898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1972); see footnote 10, supra.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">At the time McLaughlin initiated suit, there was no public policy, expressed by statute<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or otherwise, prohibiting a manufacturer from exercising a right reserved in a contract to grant an automobile dealership to a competitor who was in close proximity to a preexisting dealer of the same brand. In fact, the public policy existing at that time favored robust competi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 35-24 et seq. (The Connecticut Anti-Trust Act); <em>Elida, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harmor Realty Corporation, </em>177 Conn. 218, 413 A.2d 1226 (1979). Ford\u2019s decision to grant Greentree a dealership did not contravene any public policy existing at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">McLaughlin has not disputed the finding of the court that Ford\u2019s conduct was not unethical or immoral and, therefore, it cannot satisfy the second criterion set out in the \u201ccigarette rule.\u201d Nevertheless, McLaughlin maintains that the third criterion, substantial injury, has been met here, and that it alone is sufficient to establish an unfair trade practice.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">In discussing the third criterion, the federal trade commission has stated: \u201cThe independent nature of the consumer injury criterion does not mean that every consumer injury is legally \u2018unfair,\u2019 however. To justify a finding of unfairness the injury must satisfy three tests. It must be substantial; it must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition that the practice produces; and it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>avoided.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Letter from Federal Trade Commission to Senators Ford and Danforth (Dec. 17,1980) (reprinted in Averitt, \u201cThe Meaning of \u2018Unfair Acts or Practices\u2019 in \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,\u201d 70 Geo. L.J. 225, 291 [1981]). Although the commission was focusing upon substantial injury to consumers, one commentator has claimed that the test is equally applicable when a business person or competitor claims substantial injury. See Averitt, supra, 281-87. We agree. The substantial injury test, as set out by the federal trade commission, strikes the proper balance between the public need for vigorous competition, and the countervailing demand that the method of competition be fair. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>36 Conn. Sup. 183, 188, 416 A.2d 170 (1979); see generally Costas, \u201cUnfair Competition and Unfair Trade Practices \u2014 Transplants to the Unfair Trade Practices Act,\u201d 54 Conn. B.J. 405 (1980); note, \u201cThe Attack on Trading Stamps \u2014 An Expanded Use of \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,\u201d 57 Geo. L.J. 1082 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In this case it is clear from the facts as found by the trial court that McLaughlin cannot meet the second prong of this three-prong test, because the court could reasonably have concluded that its loss was outweighed by continuing benefits to consumers arising from competition. The injury<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> McLaughlin will suffer is a loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>of sales due to an increase in competition from an intra-brand competitor. This type of injury has traditionally been considered insignificant when compared to the benefit to consumers and for that reason statutes and common law permit only limited restriction of methods of competition. <em>See Elida, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harmor Realty Corporation, </em>supra, 231; see also <em>Scott </em>v. <em>General Iron &amp; Welding Co., </em>171 Conn. 132, 368 A.2d 111 (1976); <em>Domurat </em>v. <em>Mazzaccoli, </em>138 Conn. 327, 84 A.2d 271 (1951); Brodigan, \u201cThe Connecticut Antitrust Act,\u201d 47 Conn. B.J. 12 (1973). Increased competition alone, resulting from a practice containing none of the hallmarks of traditionally unfair practices, does not constitute a cause of action under CUTPA. McLaughlin has proven no more. It follows, therefore, that there was no error in denying relief on the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\"> The court found that the agreement did not prohibit Ford\u2019s decision to replace the previous franchisee because Ford was not appointing an <em>additional </em>dealer, but was replacing a preexisting dealer. The court found, however, that one subparagraph required Ford to make a market study, and that another subparagraph gave McLaughlin the right to a hearing before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the dealer policy board. The court further found that an informal study done by Ford satisfied its contractual duties, and that all Ford was now obligated to do was give McLaughlin a meaningful hearing. That hearing was held, and subsequently, on October 30, 1981, the injunction was dissolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\"> The agreement provided that the post office communities of New Milford, Bridgewater, Gaylordsville, Kent, Lakeside, Marbledale, New Preston, Roxbury, South Kent, Washington, Washington Depot, Sherman and South Britain constituted the \u201cNew Milford locality.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\"> The Danbury locality consists of the following post office communities: Danbury, Bethel, Botsford, Brookfield, Brookfield Center, Georgetown, Harleyville, Newtown, Redding, Redding Ridge, Ridgefield, Sandy Hook and West Redding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b576-9\"> Greentree had originally been named a party defendant, but was dropped prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b576-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-128 provides: \u201cThe plaintiff may amend any defect, mistake or informality in the writ, complaint, declaration or peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>tion, and insert new counts in the complaint or declaration, which might have been originally inserted therein, without costs, within the first thirty days after the return day and at any time afterwards on the payment of costs at the discretion of the court; but, after any such amendment, the defendant shall have a reasonable time to answer the same.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b577-11\"> Practice Book \u00a7 175 provides: \u201cThe plaintiff may amend any defect, mistake or informality in the writ, complaint or petition and insert new counts in the complaint, which might have been originally inserted therein, without costs, during the first thirty days after the return day.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b577-12\"> We note in this regard that General Statutes \u00a7 52-130 provides that \u201c(a]ny court may restrain the amendment or alteration of pleadings, <em>so far as may be necessary to compel the parties to join issue in a reasonable time for trial. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In conjunction with General Statutes \u00a7 52-130, it appears reasonably clear that the legislature intends General Statutes \u00a7 52-128 to apply only when the trial has not commenced at the time when the amendment is offered. The construction of General Statutes \u00a7 52-128 proposed by the plaintiff creates an obvious inconsistency with General Statutes \u00a7 52-130; we decline to uphold such a result. Cf. <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 472 A.2d 336 (1984), and cases cited therein (legislature presumed to create one consistent body of law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b578-6\"> On September 21, during the course of a discussion with the court on the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction, McLaughlin\u2019s counsel offered to amend the complaint.

We note, however, that the General Assembly has recently decided to regulate the relationship between a manufacturer of automobiles and the manufacturer\u2019s dealer. See Public Acts 1982, No. 82-445 (codified as General Statutes \u00a7 43-133dd). The federal government and some twenty-five states have also concluded that regulation is necessary. See <em>New Motor Vehicle Board of California </em>v. <em>Orrin W. Fox Co., </em>439 U.S. 96, 101 n.5, 99 S. Ct. 403, 58 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\"> The criteria announced in the cigarette rule have been the subject of several scholarly articles. See Averitt, \u201cThe Meaning of \u2018Unfair Acts or Practices\u2019 in \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,\u201d 70 Geo. L.J. 225 (1981); Craswell, \u201cThe Identification of Unfair Acts and Practices By the Federal Trade Commission,\u201d 1981 Wis. L. Rev. 107 (1981). Recently the commission was called upon to elaborate on these three criteria. See Letter from Federal Trade Commission to Senators Ford and Danforth (Dec. 17, 1980) (reprinted in Averitt, supra, 288).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\"> Public Acts 1982, No. 82-445, which the plaintiff maintains establishes a public policy opposed to Ford\u2019s conduct, had not been enacted at the time Ford began to seek a replacement for Bragg Motors. Nor has the plaintiff pointed to any common law policy that would prohibit Ford from taking the action it did. Absent any indication that the legislature was adopting a previously existing common law public policy when enacting Public Acts 1982, No. 82-445, its enactment does not support the plaintiff\u2019s contenttion that in 1980-1981 the public policy of the state was opposed to conduct similar to that of Ford\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> Public Acts 3982, No. 82-445 recognizes the need for intra-brand competition. The act does not guarantee an exclusive right to operate a dealership within a fourteen mile radius, but rather requires the commissioner of motor vehicles to demonstrate good cause, as defined in the statute, for denying the addition or relocation of a dealer in the objecting dealer\u2019s \u201crelevant market area.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 42-133dd. Similarly, the federal Automobile Dealers Day in Court Act; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1221 through 1225; does not guarantee freedom from intra-brand competition. See <em>Southern Rambler Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>375 F.2d 932, 936 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 832, 88 S. Ct. 105, 19 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\"> The plaintiff relies principally upon the commission\u2019s statement that: \u201cAll three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness. A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three.\u201d Statement of Basis and Purpose, Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures, 43 Fed. Reg. 59,614, 59,635 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\"> For an example of application of this test see <em>All-State Industries of N.C., Inc., </em>75 F.T.C. 465 (1969), aff'd, 423 F.2d 423 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 828, 91 S. Ct. 57, 27 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1970) (requiring disclosure of what effect a transfer to a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument will have on the liability of the transferee for transferor\u2019s breach of contract); see generally Letter from Federal Trade Commission to Senators Ford and Danforth (Dec. 17,1980) (reprinted in Averitt, \u201cThe Meaning of \u2018Unfair Acts or Practices\u2019 in \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,\u201d 70 Geo. L.J. 225, 291-93 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\"> It is not at all clear that McLaughlin\u2019s injury is substantial. The trial court found that there \u201cwas evidence to negate the fears of the plaintiff that the appointment of a dealer in Brookfield will cause irreparable harm by forcing [McLaughlin] out of business.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
