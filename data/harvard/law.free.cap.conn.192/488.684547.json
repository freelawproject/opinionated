The defendant, James West, was charged by information with the sale of a controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 19-480 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The jury might reasonably have found the following facts: On the morning of November 8,1979, an undercover officer went to the defendant\u2019s apartment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>purchased from him a small amount of cocaine for $25.00. The entire transaction took approximately five minutes, during which time the defendant never left the officer\u2019s sight. The officer was the only witness to the sale. She had seen the defendant once before for three to five minutes during a similar transaction between the defendant and an informant. Immediately after her purchase, the officer recorded a detailed description of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Approximately six and one-half months later, on May 21,1980, the undercover officer identified a photograph of the defendant from a six-member photographic array constructed by another officer. She selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array without any hesitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">At the defendant\u2019s trial, which took place on January 17, 18, 19, and 20, 1983, the undercover officer made an in-court identification of the defendant. The only issue at trial was whether the officer had accurately identified the defendant as the person from whom she had purchased the cocaine. The defendant presented an alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the identifications, claiming that the photographic identification violated General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a, which governs the erasure of criminal records, and that the in-court identification was the fruit of the illegal photographic identification. After conducting a hearing on the motion to suppress, the trial court found that the state had obtained the photograph of the defendant, which formed the basis of the out-of-court identification in this case, in connection with a prior unrelated arrest of the defendant on February 12, 1979. The February charges were nolled, and, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a (c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the records of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>charges were \u201cerased\u201d on April 15,1980. Although the trial court agreed with the defendant\u2019s claim that the inclusion of the \u201cerased\u201d photograph in the May 21, 1980 array violated the erasure statute, the court denied the motion to suppress the photographic identification. The court reasoned that the defendant had presented no evidence that the statutory violation was intentional, and that, under those circumstances, suppression of the reliable identification could serve no deterrent purpose. The trial court also denied the motion to suppress the in-court identification, holding that it met constitutional standards of reliability. The court found specifically that the in-court identification was independent of the earlier photographic identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">On appeal the defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress both identifications and in admitting the erased photograph as a full exhibit. Because we hold that the inclusion of the photograph in the identification array did not violate the erasure statute, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a provides for the sealing, erasure and, in certain cases, destruction of police, court and prosecutorial records insofar as they pertain to criminal charges that do not result in conviction or for which the defendant has been pardoned. The defendant bases his claim on General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides in part: \u201cWhenever any charge in a criminal case has been nolled ... if at least thirteen months have elapsed since such nolle, all police and court records of the state\u2019s or prosecuting attorney or the prosecuting grand juror pertaining to such charge shall be erased . . . and the clerk or person charged with the retention and control of such records shall not disclose to anyone their existence or any information pertaining to any charge so erased . . . .\u201d Section 54-142a (e)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> further provides that the clerk or other custodian of erased records must adopt appropriate security procedures to safeguard against unauthorized release of erased records and that \u201c[a]ny person who shall have been the subject of such an erasure shall be deemed to have never been arrested within the meaning of the general statutes with respect to the proceedings so erased and may so swear under oath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The defendant contends that the photograph that was taken as part of the routine processing of his arrest on February 12, 1979, was a police record pertaining to that arrest, and was erased with the rest of that file on April 15, 1980. Because erased records \u201cshall not [be] disclose[d] to anyone\u201d; \u00a7\u00a7 54-142a (c), (e); the defendant asserts that the disclosure of his \u201cmugshot\u201d to the undercover officer violated the erasure statute. He claims further that the sanction for such a violation must be the suppression of any resulting identification. Anything less, according to the defendant, would frustrate the purpose of the erasure statute, which is to protect individuals who are arrested but not convicted from the adverse effects of an arrest record. We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In our construction of the erasure statute, we must consider the requirements of any other statute that regulates the disposition of data acquired by the police in the ordinary course of a criminal proceeding. Under General Statutes \u00a7 29-15,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a person whose arrest has not led to a conviction has the right to have returned to him identifying data such as fingerprints and pictures, if he had no prior criminal record. The defendant, who has a prior conviction, concedes that he has no claim for return of the photograph at issue in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>case. We must decide, as a matter of first impression, whether the erasure statute, \u00a7 54-142a, requires the suppression of a photograph which \u00a7 29-15 permits the police to retain. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We start with the familiar assumption that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 54-142a, was cognizant of existing statutes such as \u00a7 29-15, and intended to create a harmonious and consistent body of law. <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 362, 472 A.2d 336 (1984); <em>City Council </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>180 Conn. 243, 251, 429 A.2d 481 (1980); <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>175 Conn. 127, 130, 394 A.2d 731 (1978). We must, if possible, read the two statutes together and construe each to leave room for the meaningful operation of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 29-15 and 54-142a supports the general presumption that the two statutes were not meant to conflict. Although the history of \u00a7 54-142a does not explicitly indicate whether the legislature intended to make identification data subject to erasure, it does indicate that the legislature was aware of the relationship between \u00a7\u00a7 29-15 and 54-142a, and did not intend the latter statute to repeal the former by implication. Both statutes have been reenacted repeatedly since 1949 with revisions not pertinent to the present conflict, and the legislature has once amended both statutes in a single Public Act. Public Acts 1974, No. 74-163. By that enactment, the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ture amended \u00a7 29-15 to provide that identification data relating to nolled charges would be returnable within sixty days after thirteen months of the nolle, rather than within sixty days of the nolle. The stated purpose of this amendment was to conform the nolle provisions of \u00a7 29-15 to those of \u00a7 54-142a (c). See 17 H. R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1974 Sess., p. 3050.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">We can reconcile the ambit of the two statutes without in any way retreating from our prior cases interpreting \u00a7 54-142a. Where \u00a7 54-142a applies, we held in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 185, 438 A.2d 859 (1981), that \u201c[ejrasure involves sealing the files and segregating them from materials which have not been erased and protecting them from disclosure, except that disclosure is permitted in a few, very limited circumstances described in the statutes.\u201d The fact that erasure requires nondisclosure, even to law enforcement personnel for law enforcement purposes, does not itself establish the conditions under which the statute mandates erasure. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>we concluded (p. 188) that the \u201ccourt records\u201d which were to be erased after the defendant had received an absolute pardon included a mittimus and a presentence investigation report, but not other records compiled by the department of corrections in the course of the defendant\u2019s incarceration. We did not determine what was encompassed by \u00a7 54-142a\u2019s reference to police records, which are also subject to erasure, nor did we consider whether such records include the identification data whose return is regulated by \u00a7 29-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Similarly, <em>Lechner </em>v. <em>Holmberg, </em>165 Conn. 152, 328 A.2d 701 (1973), did not present any question concerning identification data. There, the issue was whether a criminal defendant, who had been acquitted, had a right to obtain a copy of the transcript of his trial for use in a related civil proceeding. We held that a trial transcript was a court record, which, under the ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>sion of the statute then in effect, could not be disclosed to <em>anyone, </em>including the defendant himself.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that a transcript was not an erasable court record because such a reading would frustrate the purpose of the erasure law. As we explained, \u201c[t]he obvious purpose of the statute is to protect [an innocent person] from the harmful consequences of a criminal charge of which he is subsequently acquitted. If an investigator, for example, could gain access to a transcript of criminal proceedings, he could certainly draw inferences therefrom and substantially reconstruct the entire criminal record.\u201d <em>Lechner </em>v. <em>Holmberg, </em>supra, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The \u201cpolice and court records and records of the state\u2019s or prosecuting attorney or the prosecuting grand juror\u201d that \u00a7 54-142a (c) orders to be erased are records \u201cpertaining to [the] charge\u201d which has been nolled. Unlike transcripts, police reports, charging documents and other records covered by \u00a7 54-142a, identification data, as defined by \u00a7 29-15, pertain to the subject individual\u2019s identity and not to any specific criminal charge. Photographs and fingerprints need not disclose when or where a person was arrested, the nature of or circumstances surrounding the crime charged or the names of witnesses from whom further information may be obtained. The defendant does not claim that the photograph whose suppression he seeks contained any information concerning his arrest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is only such descriptive information that is subject to the erasure provisions of \u00a7 54-142a. We therefore hold that the \u201cfingerprints, pictures and description and other identification data\u201d regulated by \u00a7 29-15 are not among the records whose disclosure is governed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u00a7 54-142a. This holding is consistent with the conclusions reached by courts in other jurisdictions. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>97 Misc. 2d 408, 413-14, 411 N.Y.S.2d 830 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Adler, </em>16 Wash. App. 459, 464, 558 P.2d 817 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Our holding that the photograph was not \u201cerased\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a (c) disposes of the defendant\u2019s remaining claims. Because the photographic identification was not illegal, the officer\u2019s subsequent in-court identification could not have been tainted. The photograph, itself, was also admissible as an exhibit before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 19-480 (a) (now \u00a7 21a-277) provides: \u201cpenalty for ILLEGAL MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION, SALE, PRESCRIPTION, DISPENSING, (a) Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance, other than marihuana, or a narcotic substance except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than three thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned and for each subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than five thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 54-142a (c) provides as follows: \u201c(c) Whenever any charge in a criminal case has been nolled in the supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>rior court, or in the court of common pleas, if at least thirteen months have elapsed since such nolle, all police and court records and records of the state\u2019s or prosecuting attorney or the prosecuting grand juror pertaining to such charge shall be erased, provided in cases of nolles entered in the superior court, court of common pleas, circuit court, municipal court or by a justice of the peace prior to April 1, 1972, such records shall be deemed erased by operation of law and the clerk or the person charged with the retention and control of such records shall not disclose to anyone their existence or any information pertaining to any charge so erased; provided nothing in this section shall prohibit the arrested person or any one of his heirs from filing a petition to the appropriate court or to the office of the chief court administrator, as the case may be, to have such records physically erased, in which case such records shall be erased.
