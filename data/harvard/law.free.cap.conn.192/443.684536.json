J.</author>\n<p id=\"ak2-dedup-0\">The plaintiff appeals from the judgment of the trial court terminating her award of alimony. Because we hold that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the plaintiff was living with another person under circumstances that caused such a change of circumstances as to alter her financial needs, there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">The parties were divorced on September 22, 1967, and the defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff $150 per week periodic alimony. In 1980, the defendant moved to \u201cmodify the Judgment by reducing, suspending or terminating the alimony.\u201d The defendant claimed, inter alia, that the plaintiff was living with another man under circumstances that caused a change in her financial needs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Following a hearing on the motion, the trial court found that the plaintiff \u201cis living openly with another man [and] receives support from this other man . . . .\u201d The trial court modified the judgment of 1967 and ordered alimony terminated. The plaintiff appealed and alleges that there was insufficient evidence to find either that the plaintiff was living with another person or that her living arrangements had caused a change in her financial circumstances. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">To modify an award of alimony pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b), the trial court must find \u201cthat the party receiving the periodic alimony is living with another person under circumstances which the court finds should result in the modification, suspension, reduction or termination of alimony because the living arrangements cause such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>185 Conn. 42, 440 A.2d 252 (1981). The trial court so found but the plaintiff argues that its finding was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The evidence before the court showed that Gilbert Poirier had been living in a room in the plaintiff\u2019s home for two years. The plaintiff was paid $30 weekly for food by Poirier and he performed numerous handyman chores for her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These chores included roofing the garage, reconstruction of cubicles remaining from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>defendant\u2019s dental practice, repair and maintenance of a swimming pool, and installation in the plaintiff\u2019s house of a wood stove owned by Poirier. Because of lack of finances, the plaintiff had not previously been able to \u201cfix up\u201d the house. Poirier and the plaintiff are \u201cgoing steady\u201d and \u201coccasionally\u201d have \u201cmarital relations.\u201d The plaintiff would like to marry him. After finding that the plaintiff and Poirier were \u201ccohabiting\u201d and that \u201cthe living arrangements . . . have caused such a change of circumstances as to alter materially her financial needs,\u201d the trial court terminated the alimony award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u201cThis court may reject a factual finding if it is clearly erroneous, in that as a matter of law it is \u2018unsupported by the record, incorrect, or otherwise mistaken.\u2019 <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>[186 Conn. 387, 392, 441 A.2d 629 (1982)]; <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Schaffer, </em>187 Conn. 224, 228, 445 A.2d 589 (1982); Practice Book \u00a7 3060D.\u201d (Brackets in original.) <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>190 Conn. 173, 176, 460 A.2d 945 (1983). There is nothing in the record before us to indicate that the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. \u201cThis court, of course, may not retry a case. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Flammia, </em>169 Conn. 491, 497, 363 A.2d 1048 (1975). The factfinding function is vested in the trial court with its unique opportunity to view the evidence presented in a totality of circumstances, i.e., including its observations of the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses and parties, which is not fully reflected in the cold, printed record which is available to us. Appellate review of a factual finding, therefore, is limited both as a practical matter and as a matter of the fundamental difference between the role of the trial court and an appellate court. See <em>Styles </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>64 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Conn. 432, 450, 30 A. 165 (1894).\u201d <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 391, 441 A.2d 629 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">There was evidence in this case to indicate both that the plaintiff was living with another person and that this living arrangement caused such change in circumstances as to alter her financial needs. While termination of alimony is a harsh result, we are unable to say that the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u201cA factual finding may not be rejected on. appeal merely because the reviewing judges personally disagree with the conclusion or would have found differently had they been sitting as the factfinder. Cf. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>184 Conn. 36, 440 A.2d 782 (1981). . . . This court may not substitute its own opinion as to the living arrangements of the [plaintiff] for the factual finding of the trial court.\u201d <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 391-92, 441 A.2d 629 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-13\"> The defendant also claimed that the plaintiffs employment by Gilbert Poirier had caused a change in the plaintiffs financial circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b) provides: \u201cIn an action for divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment brought by a husband or wife, in which a final judgment has been entered providing for the payment of periodic alimony by one party to the other, the superior court may, in its discretion and upon notice and hearing, modify such judgment and suspend, reduce or terminate the payment of periodic alimony upon a showing that the party receiving the periodic alimony is living with another person under circumstances which the court finds should result in the modification, suspension, reduction or termination of alimony because the living arrangements cause such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\"> The plaintiffs twenty year old son also resided in the house and paid $30 weekly to the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b459-6\"> Although the trial court found a material alteration in the plaintiffs financial circumstances, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b) requires only \u201csuch a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party.\u201d See <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 441 A.2d 629 (1982); <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>185 Conn. 42, 440 A.2d 252 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\"> We have no occasion to consider in this appeal whether alimony that has been terminated might be reinstated, and, if so, the circumstances under which the order might be reinstated. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a); <em>Christiano </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>131 Conn. 589, 592-94, 41 A.2d 779 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">We note that the plaintiff alleges only that the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous due to insufficient evidence. Contrary to counsel\u2019s contention at oral argument, we find no presentation of the issue of whether the trial court abused its discretion in terminating alimony rather than in suspending it or reducing it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
