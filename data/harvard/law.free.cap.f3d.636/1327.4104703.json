This Court affirmed his conviction based on prior precedent. <em>United States v. Beasley, </em>361 Fed.Appx. 86 (11th Cir.2010). However, the Supreme Court granted Beasley\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded Beasley\u2019s appeal for reconsideration in light of <em>Carr v. United States, </em>560 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2229, 176 L.Ed.2d 1152 (2010). <em>Beasley v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 79, 178 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-22\">Beasley\u2019s claim is that \u00a7 2250(a) is inapplicable to his failure to register in Georgia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>when he moved there from Mississippi in January 2007 because he moved to Georgia before an interim rule first rendered SORNA applicable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">In passing SORNA, Congress sought to standardize the varied state sex-offender registries and enhance their effectiveness. <em>See Carr, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2232. Under, \u00a7 2250(a), one who \u201c(1) is required to register under [SORNA,] (2) ... travels in interstate or foreign commerce ... [,] and (3) knowingly fails to register\u201d in the new state is eligible for up to ten years in prison for violating SORNA. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Carr, </em>the Supreme Court clarified that these three elements must be met in sequence. 130 S.Ct. at 2236. Thus, a defendant violates \u00a7 2250(a) only if he \u201cbecomes subject to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements ... [and] <em>thereafter </em>travels and <em>then </em>fails to register.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2236 (emphasis supplied). In so holding, the Court rejected the argument that the first element is met when a defendant is convicted of the underlying sex offense regardless of when SORNA became applicable to him. <em>Id. </em>at 2235. Because the defendant in <em>Carr </em>traveled before SORNA took effect, Carr could not have been \u201crequired to register\u201d under the plain meaning of \u00a7 2250(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">In this case, Beasley was convicted of a state sex offense in Mississippi in 1985. Under Mississippi law, he maintained a current state registration through 2006. He then moved to Georgia in January 2007 and did not register in Georgia. His move to Georgia took place between the July 2006 enactment of SORNA and the February 2007 Attorney General opinion rendering SORNA applicable to him. <em>See United States v. Madera, 528 </em>F.3d 852, 857-59 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that SORNA became applicable to offenders with convictions predating SORNA only after the Attorney General\u2019s February 2007 opinion).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although he had not traveled since SORNA became applicable to him, Beasley was prosecuted under \u00a7 2250(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">We relied on <em>United States v. Dumont, 555 </em>F.3d 1288 (11th Cir.2009), to reject Beasley\u2019s claim. <em>Carr </em>overruled <em>Dumont </em>to the extent that <em>Dumont </em>suggests that \u00a7 2250(a)\u2019s elements do not have to be met in sequence. <em>See Carr, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2234 n. 1; <em>Dumont, </em>555 F.3d at 1292. <em>Carr </em>makes clear that the travel must occur after the defendant becomes subject to SORNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-11\">In light of <em>Carr, </em>we reverse Beasley\u2019s conviction because he was not subject to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements when he traveled to Georgia and did not register. As the government concedes, Beasley did not meet the elements of \u00a7 2250(a) in sequence, as the statute requires under <em>Carr. </em>Accordingly, we vacate Beasley\u2019s conviction and remand for further proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>ings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">. Congress enacted SORNA in July 2006 but did not specify whether it applied to offenders whose convictions predated enactment. <em>See </em>Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, Tit. I, Pub.L. 109-248, 120 Stat. 590 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16901 et seq.). However, the statute delegated to the Attorney General authority to \"specify the applicability of [SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before [July 27, 2006].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913(d). On February 28, 2007, the Attorney General issued an interim rule determining that SORNA\u2019s registration requirements would apply to those whose relevant convictions pre-dated SORNA. <em>See </em>Applicability of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, 72 Fed.Reg. 8894, 8896 (Feb. 28 2007) (to be codified at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 72.3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1358-27\">.
