Blanchet selected the lands and obtained the title, in 1834. The purchase money was not paid within the time required by the law. It was proved, however, that it was paid to G. W. Miles, Receiver, in 1842, in Texas promissory notes.

The plaintiffs had no right to bring a suit in Liberty county, to try the title to-lands lying in Houston county. The suit should be brought m the county where the land lies. Under the general issue,, the defendants should be allowed to prove this fact. John R. Johnson, the witness and Surveyor proved it. The defendants-pleaded specially that their league lies entirely out of Liberty county, and in Houston county, and disclaimed all'title to any of the land lying in old Liberty county, as set out in plaintiffs petition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyF\">H. The deed from Blanchet to Hugh Jackson excepts twenty acres of the league. The same exception is in the deeds from Hugh to John and James Jackson. So plaintiffs-show no title whatever in the twenty acres excepted ; yet they have judgment for the whole league.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-6\">HI. The- Spanish documents, presented in evidence as a muniment of title from the government in this case, are <em>sui generis. </em>The first paper presented purports to be a power of' attorney from- De la Garza to Blanchet, dated 18th March, 1833. The next paper dated the 11th February, 1834, is- a petition from Blanchet to-Woods, the Alcalde of Liberty, averring the sale of land from the government to Garza, designating the same and asking a survey. The next is the order made by Woods admitting the application and directing Hardin to survey the land. The next is the survey without any date. The-next is the petition of De la Garza, dated 31st August, 1830, to the Governor of Ooahuila and Texas, asking, for' the grant' of five leagues. The order then follows, dated October 19th, 1830. Then- follows the decree of Alcalde Woods, conveying-the land, dated- Sth July, 1834. Then follows the certificate-of Henry Iiueg, dated 6th August, 1835, directed to thePolitChief of the department of Nacogdoches-, certifying the Spanish documents aforesaid to be a legal copy of the original,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>which at the request of the party interested heJRueg) had ordered to be placed in the archives of that department then under his charge. A translation of these documents then follows \u25a0certified from the Land Office in 1840.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-5\">Now, is this Spanish document a paper which the law permits to be read as a title 2 It is not a testimonio, or protocol, such as is given to the grantee, under our laws, as a muniment of title. It is not a certified copy, from the General Land Office, (Hart. Dig. Art. 744,) of the original. The testimonio, with the certificate which makes it such, is signed by the \u2022Commissioner, not by Rueg. The latter informs us he has charge of the office of the department of Nacogdoches. How did he get possession of the original 2 Its proper place was in the Alcalde\u2019s office, until it was ordered to be placed in the General Land Office. Where is the original 2 It does not appear from the papers to be in existence. Nothing but Rueg\u2019s copy is in the Land Office. On the 10th October, 1848, Hr. Abbott, counsel for plaintiffs, made an. affidavit (p. 34) continuing the cause for want of a translated copy from Austin of the Spanish title, stating that he could not get one that would be evidence from any other source. Vet that translated copy from Austin never appeared ; the Judge permitting them on trial to read Rueg\u2019s copy, and the translation of Rueg\u2019s copy made in 1840. We know of no law permitting Rueg\u2019s copy to be filed in the Land Office, still less of a law allowing a translation of it to be read in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-6\">IV. The reading of the power of attorney is objected to on like grounds. It is not a muniment of itself. It is not in accordance with law. If intended as a sale, the land had not been granted, and was not for nearly three years afterwards. If Blanchet was using the name of this Mexican to effect a sale to himself, it was a fraud upon the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-7\">V. The receipt of Miles should have been proven before it was read in evidence. The payment should not have been made in promissory notes. Government never extended such favors to purchasers of large grants, made under the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>authority. The money, received by Miles after the time required for payment, was not an official act; and his receipt was but a private paper not executed by virtue of any law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-5\">YI. Under the 15th Section of the Act of Limitations, (Hart. Dig. Art. 3391,) a color of title is raised by possession under a certificate and survey. These papers had ripened into a patent. The certificate was issued shortly after the Land Office opened. The survey followed immediately. The patent did not issue till October, 1845. The suit was brought July 17th, 1847. The defendants took actual possession in 1843, and claimed the benefit of three years limitation. The best evidence of the color of title was a certified copy of the certificate and field notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">YH. We have no objections to the principles laid down in McKinney v. Hancock; there is nothing novel in them. They exhibit the law. One point, though not arising directly in that case, was named by one of the Court, i. e. touching the purchase money. In the case before us, the payments were to be made according to Article <em>22 </em>of the Colanization Law in four, five and six years. From what time 2 From settlement, \u201c <em>dentro de seis anos de establaoidos </em>/\u201d that is, from the date of his being put into possession of the land by the Commissioner ; that is, the date of the decree. This is proved by Article 28, where settlers have liberty of disposing of land by will \u201c <em>desde el dia de su </em>establacimiento, <em>aunque no lo tenga </em>cultivado.\u201d So the decree. The Commissioner, in the name of the State, puts the grantee in real, actual, corporeal and virtual possession. Is not the party then established on the land 2 The payments then are due 5th July, 1838, 5th July, 1839, and 5th July, 1840. But not a dollar is paid until 1842, and then only in depreciated paper. The Legislature never favored such grants by allowing purchasers to pay such debts in such paper. What is the result of this non-payment 2 In the language of the law: <em>\u201cPena de peder su terreno el que faltare a algunos de los </em>plazos.\u201d How if a grantee fails to perform other conditions, such as cultivation of the land with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>in six years, &amp;c., the law provides for an inquest of office, \u201c <em>la autoridad pol\u00edtica proceder\u00e1 luego a recog\u00e9rselo y recogerles \u00e9l </em>titulo.\u201d (Art. 26.) But in the case of non-payment, the law makes no such inquest necessary; but, at the time of any non-payment of what becomes due, the purchaser loses his land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\">The language of Article 22 is not unlike that of Article 30, already defined by this Court, in case of aliens; \u201c <em>no conservara su </em>terreno,\u201d and <em>\u201cpena de perder su </em>terreno,\u201d are the sentences of the law. The inquest in advance, part of the contract, known to both parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-6\">VIII. The Court is referred to Article 27, Colonization Law. The right to alienate applies only to those who have acquired lands by purchase. As the right to sell is derived from the law, its language cannot otherwise be construed. The latter part of the Article shows that the law contemplates the subsequent purchaser shall only have to perform the condition of cultivation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-8\">IX. On the question of the jurisdiction of Alcalde Woods, which was the jurisdiction of Liberty. Under the government of Coahuila and Texas, the counties were known as municipalities. So also in 1835. (Journal of Geni. Council, 341.) The old Constitution calls them counties. The first act fixing the boundaries of Liberty county, calls for the south boundary of Houston county. (Act December 18th, 1837, p. 84.)\u2014 Houston county was taken from the south part of Nacogdoches county. (Act June 12th, 1837, p. 270.) Then the south boundary of the county of Nacogdoches was the north boundary of the municipality, i. e. after the municipality of Liberty was taken out of that of Nacogdoches. Now as Polk county was taken out of the north part of Liberty, the return of John B. Johnson shows that no part of the land covered by McHim\u2019s patent, or claimed by him, lies within the jurisdiction of Liberty. Hence, as the order was to the Alcalde within whose jurisdiction the lands denounced might lie, Woods had no right to go beyond it. The county of Nacogdoches was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>never defined by the present government, but at the first meeting of the Congress of the Republic, the Chief Justices were required to report the boundaries (not to make boundaries) of their counties to the Secretary of State. (Page 133.) Upon these reports the lines between the ancient municipalities of Nacogdoches and Liberty is exhibited, as in the above recited acts.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b406-5\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARE\">This was an action of trespass to try title, brought by the appellees against the appellant Ryan, in the county of Polk, on the 17th of July, 1847. The defendant pleaded \u201c not guilty,\u201d and the statute of limitations. After repeated continuances, the other appellant, McKim, was permitted to become a party defendant, and pleaded \u201cnot guilty,\u201d title in himself, and limitation. After further continuances, the defendants pleaded to the jurisdiction of the Court in the county of Polk, averring that they do not possess or claim any part of the land claimed by the plaintiffs, as lying within the county of Polk; but the land claimed and possessed by them, lies entirely within the limits of the county of Trinity, formerly a part of Houston county. On motion of the plaintiffs, the plea to the jurisdiction was striken out. It appears, from a bill of exceptions in the record, that \u201c the plaintiffs offered in evidence a certified transcript, from \u201cthe Land Office, of a Spanish title to De la Garza, for five \u201c leagues of land; also, a transcript of a power of attorney, \u201c from De la Garza to Pierre Blanehet; also, a deed from \u201c Pierre Blanehet; also, a receipt from Miles for government \u25a0\u201c dues,\u201d (all of which are referred to as contained in the statement of facts,) \u201cto the reading of all of which the defend- \u201c ant objected, but the Court overruled the objections, and \u25a0\u201c allowed the papers to be read ; to which the defendant ex- \u201c cepts. The defendant offered in evidence a certified copy \u201c of the survey for him as assignee of Polly Ryan, also a \u201c certified copy of her certificate. He also offered to prove \u2022\u201c that the condition of cultivating the land within six years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\u201c and setting up permanent land marks, had not Been per- \u201c formedto which the plaintiffs objected, and their objections were sustained by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The title under which the plaintiffs claimed, the copy of which was given in evidence, was issued by the Alcalde of the \u201cjurisdiction of Liberty,\u201d on the fifth day of July, 1834, by virtue of a concession for five leagues, made by the Governor of the Stat\u00e9 of Coahuila and Texas, in October, 1830,. to Augustin Martinez De la Garza, as a purchaser under the 24th Article of the Colonization Law of the 24th of March, 1825. The power of attorney, from Garza to Blanchet, bore-date on the 18th day of March, 1833; and empowered Blanchet to apply for and obtain the title and possession of the land conceded ; h-e designating the land and subjecting himself to the obligations and requirements of the law; and having done so, to sell and dispose- of the land at pleasure. Under this power, Blanchet made the sale, under which the plaintiffs claim the league in question, in 1839, The plaintiff's gave in evidence a survey of the land made by order of the Court in April, 1853, from which it appeared that a part of the league of land, sited for, was in the county of Polk, and a part in Trinity county. One Kitty Ryan was the only person then living on the land. One Hornsby had a part of his field on it, but acknowledged that he held under the plaintiffs. The certificate, referred to in the bill- of exceptions as having been offered in evidence by the defendant, was a first class headright certificate, issued in March, 1838; the survey thereupon was made in- April of the same\" year. The defendant gave in evidence a patent for the land issued on the 29tb day of October, 1845, to the defendant, McKim-, as assignee of Ryan. He also proved that Polly Ryan went to live upon the land, in 1843, but removed therefrom in about a year;. that her son, James Ryan, moved there- with her in 1843 ; that he died in about a year thereafter, and that Kitty Ryan-was bis widow; that the defendant McKim \u201c got JamesMcKim to go there,.\u201d and that Kitty .Ryan has lived there ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The defendant\u2019s attorney asked of the Court several instructions, among which were the following, which were refused :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1lc\">\u201c If the purchase money was not paid in three, four and five \u201c years, the land was forfeited upon the failure of either pay- \u201c ment by the time required.\u201d \u201c The payment and receipt of \u201c the money after the time it was due, could not save the title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">\u201cA purchaser under decree 16 of Coahuila and Texas, had \u201c no authority to sell until he had proved his title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Defendants ask the Court \u201c to give the jury in charge Ar- \u201c tides 24, 27, 28, and 22 of decree 16, or Colonization Law \u201c of 24th March, 1825.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs, and the defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The objections to the judgment, urged on behalf of the appellants, relate, 1st. To the jurisdiction of the Court. 2nd. The admissibility of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of title, and its legal effect. 3d. The rejection of evidence offered by the defendants. And 4th. The refusal of instructions asked by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">The plea to the jurisdiction of the Court was rightly rejected. It was pleaded after the defendants had answered fully to the merits, and had thereby submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court in the county of Polk. It was then too late to plead to the jurisdiction, matters merely in abatement of the suit. Moreover, the statute authorizes the plaintiff to bring suit in the county \u201c where the land or a part thereof is situated.\u201d (Hart. Dig. Art. 667.) The plea did not controvert the fact that the land, for the recovery of which the suit was brought, or a part thereof, was situated in that county. It did not negative the existence of the facts necessary to give the Court jurisdiction; and must have been held insufficient, though it had been pleaded in time. But, it appeared upon the trial, that a part of the land was situated in the county in which the suit was brought, and there was, therefore, in point of fact, no well founded objection to the jurisdiction of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The objections now urged to the admissibility of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of title, do not appear to have been taken, nor do the defendants appear to have made known the grounds of their objection to the evidence at the trial. And nothing is better settled, than that a judgment will not be reversed upon objections of the character of the present, .first taken in the appellate Court. A party objecting to written evidence, for any cause not going to its relevancy or competency, but only to the manner of its authentication or proof, must specially assign the grounds of his objection at the trial: for, the party, offering the evidence, might then have it in his power to meet and obviate the objections, by other evidence; and, moreover, the Court, as has been said, in deciding upon questions arising at the trial, is not bound to do more than respond to the questions raised, in the terms in which they are propounded. (5 Tex. R. 467; 8 Id. 58, 162; 9 Id. 97 ; 10 Id. 520.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The defendants objected generally to all the plaintiffs\u2019 written evidence. The objection was of that indiscriminate and sweeping character, which subjects it to the observation and ruling of this Court in the case of Houston v. Perry and Williams, (5 Tex. R.,) and it is unnecessary to notice the several objections, now first urged to the admissibility of the evidence introduced by the plaintiffs, which do not bring in question its relevancy or competency, but only the manner of its authentication. It is a sufficient answer to these objections, that they were not taken at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The objections, urged to the effect given to the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, or to the validity of his title, require notice. And it is objected, that the power of attorney from Garza to Blancliet, evidences a sale, which the former could not make until after he had obtained the final title.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">If it be conceded that the power of attorney in question is evidence of a sale, it seems to be sanctioned by the 27th Article of the law, which declares that \u201c those who have acquir- \u201c ed lands by purchase, can alienate the same at any time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>\u201c provided the successor obligates himself to cultivate the \u201c same within the same term as was obligatory on the original \u201c proprietor.\u201d We are aware of no provision of law, which forbade the grantee, who acquired by purchase under the 24th Article of the law of the 24th of March, 1825, to sell so soon as he had obtained his concession, and before the final title was issued. It is a right which would appertain to the grantee on general principles. The right of property in the concession includes the power of disposition, subject only to such-restrictions and qualifications as may be- imposed by law. Where the law imposes no restriction, the power is absolute. And there does not appear to have been any restriction upon-the power of alienation imposed by the law in this case, except that contained in the 27th Article, that the purchaser should be obliged to perform the condition of cultivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The objection to the title on account of the non-performance of the conditions annexed to it, is answered by the opinion of the Court in cases heretofore decided, and will not require further notice than a reference to those decisions. (Hancock v. McKinney, 7 Tex. R.; Murchison v. Hall, 10 Id. 461; Swift v. Herrera, 9 Id. 263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">It is suggested that the land in question did not lie within the municipality of Liberty, and consequently that it was not within the jurisdiction of the Alcalde who extended the title. But this suggestion is not supported by the record. It does not appear by any evidence in the record or by any law to which we-have been referred, that the municipality of Liberty was comprised within the same boundaries as the county of Liberty ; or that the land in question was not within the limits of that municipality. And if the Alcalde had exceeded his jurisdiction, it devolved on the defendants to show it. The presumption is that the officer, in issuing the title, acted' upon a subject within his jurisdiction, until the contrary appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The certificate and survey thereupon, offered in evidence by the defendants, were rightly rejected, for the reason that the certificate was not accompanied by evidence of its having been* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>recommended as genuine. Ifc did not appear that the patent introduced in evidence, was issued upon this certificate; and there was no evidence of its genuineness. The object of the introduction of the evidence, was to establish color of title in the defendants, in support of their plea of the statute of limitations. But if the evidence had been admitted, there was not such possession as was necessary to make good the defence of limitation. The title, or color of title was averred to be in \" the defendant McKim. He was not in possession <em>\u00a1 </em>and the defendants failed to prove that his co-defendant, who was the only person in possession a sufficient time to complete the statutory bar, held the possession under him or in his right. If, therefore, the evidence had been admitted, it could not have changed the result. But there was no error in its rejection, for the reason before stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Nor was there error in refusing to give in charge to the jury, the several Articles of the Colonization Law, referred to by their numbers, in the instruction asked. Apart from the statute, which directs in what manner instructions may be asked, (Hart. Dig. Art. 754,) and does not sanction the mode proposed, the manner of asking the instructions, in this instance, was novel and unprecedented; and was calculated to create the apprehension that counsel desired rather to bewilder and mislead, than to enlighten the jury as to their duty. With equal propriety might counsel have asked of the Court to give in charge to the jury the entire law, or volume of laws, in which the provisions, referred to, were contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">It only remains to notice one other objection to the judgment, that is, that the plaintiffs failed to deraign their title to twenty acres of the land for which they had judgment. And it is true, that in the conveyance by Blanchet, of the league of land in controversy, there was a reservation, in the deed, of twenty acres ; yet, by the judgment, the plaintiffs recovered the entire league. This, doubtless, was an oversight; the attention of the Court not having been called to the fact of the reservation. It will require that the judgment be so reformed as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>conform to the evidence ; and such judgment will be here rendered as the Court ought to have rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Judgment re-formed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
