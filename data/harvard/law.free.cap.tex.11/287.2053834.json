Suit on promissory notes, by the defendants in error against the plaintiff' in error. It appeared by the original petition, that both parties were non-residents of the State; and it did not appear that the defendant had any property in the State. The suit was brought to the Fall Term, 1848 ; and the citation was returned not found. On the 7th of April, 1849, the following agreement was filed : \u201c In the above cause, it is agreed, by the attorneys of the \u201c parties, that publication in order to cite the defendant, shall \u201c not be made, to avoid expense; and the defendant by his 64 attorney, hereby waives the said publication, and accepts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u201c service of process in this case, waiving copy of petition, \u201c and appears to the said case ; the said appearance to have \u201c the same effect, as if due and legal service by publication \u201c had been regularly made, to the April Term, 1849, of this \u201c Court. This agreement is now drawn up in pursuance of \u201c an understanding had at the last Term of the District Court \u201cof this county, between said counsel; Trobridge Ward, \u201c agent of Samuel Ward, being present and consenting to the \u201csame. Matagorda, February 14th, 1849. (Signed.) Jas. \u201c Denison, attorney for defendant; Jones, Butler and Ballin- \u201c ger, attorneys for plaintiffs.\u201d Defendant answered by general demurrer, and a general denial. Demurrer overruled and verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs. Motion for new trial overruled. Writ of error, and the judgment reversed and cause remanded. (See 4 Tex. R. 180.) Supplemental petition, alleging \u201c that the said Samuel Ward had no pro- \u201c perty within the knowledge of your petitioners, elsewhere \u201c than within the State of Texas, from or out of which your \u201c petitioners could collect the moneys due them by said Ward, \u201c as set forth in the original petition to which this is a sup- \u201c plement.\u201d They further allege \u201c that the said Ward is the \u201c true and legal owner of property within the State of Texas, \u201cand of claims and sums of money within said State; that \u201c he is and has long been endeavoring to secrete the same, so \u201c that the claim of your petitioners may be defeated,\u201d &amp;c. Prayer for an attachment against the property of the defendant and \u201cthat the said Ward maybe cited as the law directs, \u201c to answer this supplemental petition, and that he be adjudged,\u201d &amp;c. Affidavit and bond. Writ of attachment returned levied, &amp;c. October 9th, 1850, \u201c Order of publication for the absent defendant and the cause continued.\u201d March 16th, 1852, \u201c this day came the parties by their attorneys and announced themselves ready for trial, and thereupon,\u201d &amp;c. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs. Writ of error. The following \u201c agreement \u201d was attached to the transcript of the record. (Style of the case and number in the Supreme Court.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>\u201c It is hereby agreed and stipulated by the parties, that when \u201c this case was called for trial, at the Spring Term, 1852, of \u201c the District Court of Matagorda, the said Ward was not \u201c personally present in Court; that said Ward was not repre- \u201c sen ted by himself or any attorney, in conducting the trial; \u201c and that so much of the judgment of the Court below, as \u201c recites that said Ward announced himself ready for trial at \u201csaid Term of said Court, is a clerical error: and it is fur- \u201c ther agreed that the Supreme Court shall, in adjudicating \u201c this case, have reference to the facts above stated, as though \u201cthe same appeared in the record.

This suit was commenced in 1848, was tried and a judgment was rendered for plaintiff. Upon a writ of error, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment, on the ground that the Court below had no jurisdiction, i. e. the Court below had no jurisdiction of the parties, and had not acquired jurisdiction, by the use of the necessary process.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">U. All the proceedings below, previous to the remanding, were <em>coram non </em>judice, and a nullity. The agreement to waive citation, made by an attorney in a case where the Court has no jurisdiction, cannot bind the party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai1\">III. If in the second prosecution, after the cause was remanded, the amended petition be considered as giving jurisdiction then the previous proceedings being without jurisdiction and void, it was necessary, in order to acquire jurisdiction over the defendant, that the ordinary process should be resorted to, i. e. a citation should be issued, to be served personally or by publication. No citation was issued, and the record, as amended by the stipulation filed, does not show any appearance of defendant, after the case was remanded.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-9\"><em>tTones &lt;&amp; </em>Ballinger, for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A38\">The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>question, here presented, is, whether the Court had jurisdiction of the defendant below. There is no question, that the subject matter of the suit is within the jurisdiction of the Court; and there can be as little question, that the appearance and answer of the defendant gave the Court jurisdiction of him. Jurisdiction of the person is acquired by the service of process, or something equivalent to such service. That the appearance and answer of the defendant made him a party to the suit, and gave jurisdiction over him, and that such appearance 'and answer cured all defects in the service, and waived even the issuance of process, see 5 Comyn\u2019s Dig.

The judgment was reversed and the cause remanded, because there was not sufficient matter, appearing upon the face of the petition, to give the Court jurisdiction. It appeared that both plaintiffs and defendant were non-residents of the State ; and there was no averment that the defendant had property or effects within the State. There could be no intendment to that effect, in the absence of an averment. There appearing, therefore, by the petition, neither person nor property within the State, to give the Court jurisdiction, we held that the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>below erred in overruling the demurrer to the petition. The cause having been remanded to the District Court, the plaintiffs there amended their petition, averring that the defendant had no property, within their knowledge, elsewhere than in this State, subject to their demand ; but that he had property and monies due him, within the State; and they pray an attachment and writs of garnishment, which, upon the proper affidavit, were issued. The attachment was levied on certain lots in the town of Matagorda ; and, at the Spring Term of the Court, 1852, the plaintiffs recovered judgment for their debt, and a decree, for the sale of the property levied on, for its satisfaction : and the defendant has again brought up the case by writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">By remanding the cause, when formerly before the Court, it was, in effect, determined, that the plaintiff might so amend his petition, as to bring his case within the jurisdiction of the Court; and the cause was remanded for no other purpose, than to afford him that opportunity. The amended petition avers the existence of property of the defendant, within the State; which, it was considered would have been sufficient, had it so appeared in the original petition, when the case was previously before the Court; and which, has since been held, in other cases, sufficient, where, as in this case, the proceeding was <em>in </em>rem, to give the Court jurisdiction. (Campbell v. Wilson, 6 Tex. R. 379.) The amendment obviated the objection to the original petition, by supplying its omission to state a fact necessary to render it apparent, that the Court could rightfully take jurisdiction in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">It is objected that a citation was not issued,- upon the amended petition. This objection assumes that the amended petition was the commencement of a new suit; and not, what it manifestly was, a continuation of the former one. The amendment merely supplies the omission in the original petition, of a material averment. It is to be taken and considered with the original petition, both together constituting one pleading, and relating to the same case, originally, though defectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>stated. The defendant, having been brought into Court, by-process issued upon the original petition, and the amendment having been made by leave of the Court, he was bound to take notice of it, without the service of process anew. The present was the common case of correcting or perfecting a defective and insufficient statement of the plaintiff\u2019s case ; and in such a case, it has never been held to be necessary to issue a citation anew; if that be ever necessary upon the amendment of a petition, where the defendant has been regularly served with process. It is unnecessary to inquire whether the amendment was of such a character as to have let in any defence which might have arisen at the date of the amendment, as no such defence was interposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We are of opinion that there is no error in the judgment: and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
