Welsh was indicted jointly with one Denman for knowingly and wilfully catting down and carrying away, trees upon the land of William Taylor, without first having the consent of William Taylor, contrary to the form of the statute, &amp;c. Only one witness was examined; being introduced by the State, he testified that he was present when timber was cut by the defendant Mark Welsh, and James Shannon, on land which they, at the time, said was the land of Wm. Taylor, and they showed him the line; did not see Denman cut any timber; it was in 1852; in Walker county; on cross-examination: Welsh did not say, the land was claimed by Taylor, but in fact belonged to him, Welsh; had bought from Taylor a part of the land claimed by him, but not the part upon which the timber was cut; Denman said he cut the timber to try the validity of Taylor\u2019s claim to the land, in a civil suit; defendant said the land was Taylor\u2019s. There was a bill of exceptions, which stated, that when the witness was asked what he heard the defendants say, at the time the timber was cut, about the land belonging to Wm. Taylor, the defendants, by their counsel, objected, and the objection was overruled, to which, &amp;c. The following instructions were asked by the defendants, and refused by the Court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-12\">\u201c That before they can find the defendants guilty, the testi66 mony must show to the satisfaction of the jury, that the \u201c trees were cut down without the consent of Wm. Taylor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-13\">\u201c That parol evidence is ^inadmissible to prove the owner- \u201c ship of land in a proceeding of this character, where there is \u201c written evidence of the ownership.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-14\">\u201c That they have a right, from the manner and position of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201c a witness, giving in testimony before them, to attach what- \u201c ever credit they may think proper, to his statements.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-5\">\u201c After which the Court instructed the jury, that the terms \u201c \u2018 knowingly\u2019 and \u2018wilfully\u2019 are, in law, synonymous terms.\u201d The Court also charged the jury, as follows: \u201c If you believe \u201c from the evidence, that the defendants or either of them, \u201c knowingly cut down trees upon the land of Wm. Taylor, \u201c in Walker county, within twelve months previous to the find- \u201c ing of the bill of indictment, without the consent of the \u201c owner, it is your duty to find him or them, so offending, \u201c guilty; otherwise, not guilty. The indictment charges the \u201c defendants with both cutting down and carrying away trees \u201c from the land in question; but proof of either cutting down \u201c or carrying away is sufficient, under the law, as either is an \u201c offence. The State is not bound to prove that the de~ \u201c fendants did not have the consent of Taylor; it is matter of. \u201c defence, to show that such consent was given by Wm. Tay- \u201c lor ; and to avoid a conviction upon such grounds, the de- \u201c fondant must prove that such consent was given. The ex- \u201c hibition of title deeds, to prove the ownership of the land in \u201c controversy, in a proceeding of this kind, is not required by \u201c law: parol evidence of ownership is sufficient.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-7\">There was a verdict against Welsh and in favor of Denman. Welsh moved for a new trial, the grounds of which will be found in the opinion. The surprise alleged, was at the testimony of the witness for the prosecution, that Welsh said the land belonged to Taylor; the defendant swearing he could prove by three witnesses, who were present, including Den-man, his co-defendant, that his remark was that the land was claimed by Taylor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-8\">The errors assigned were: 1st. In refusing to give the charges asked ; in the charges given; overruling motion for a new trial; in admitting the testimony \u201c spoken of in the bill of exceptions.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-9\"><em>W.

(See Bacon\u2019s Abridgment, 9 Vol. p. 623 and the authority there referred to.) The interest, infirmity, bias, partial, perverted views of facts, veracity and turpitude of witnesses, all pass in review before the Court, on a motion for new trial.

The appellant\u2019s first position is so entirely at war with established principle, that I should not have deemed it worthy of a moment\u2019s consideration, but for the authority cited by appellant in support of it. Upon looking into that authority, however, the difficulty is solved. We are referred to 9 Bacon\u2019s Abridgment, p. 623, Title Trial, American Additions, under the head of Surprise, where we find appellant\u2019s citation, in so many words, referring for its support, to Miller v. Field, 3 Marsh. (A. K. Marshall,) 109 and 110 ;xwhem\u00a1we come to this fountain head, we have a common case of new trial granted on the affidavits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>party, of newly discovered evidence, and of the newly discovered witnesses. The editor of the edition of Bacon referred to, asserts a false doctrine, by stopping just before these words: \u201c When the affidavits of the newly discovered wit- \u201c nesses are porduced, and show beyond the possibility of a \u201c doubt, that the statements of the witnesses can be contra- \u201c dieted,\u201d &amp;e. In the same Title of Bacon, will be found abundant authority against this dictum, and especially a reference to 3 Haywood, 145, for the doctrine that an application for a new trial on the ground of surprise, should be supported by \u201c indifferent testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-5\">II. The admission of parol evidence that the land on which, &amp;e., was Wm. Taylor\u2019s. What writing could prove, that the land was not defendant\u2019s \u201cown?\u201d the fact to be established on this point. To prove property in arson and burglary\u2014 which, in this particular, resemble this offence more than any other\u2014proof of possession is usually the mode employed; and no one ever heard of a resort to paper evidence of title for such purpose. Ho evidence of this fact could be more certain, than the offender\u2019s admission, at least <em>prima facie. </em>The position contended for by appellant would convert a prosecution for this offence, into an action of trespass to try title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-6\">HI. \u201cThat the Court erred in saying that the words \u2018knowingly\u2019 and \u2018 wilfully,\u2019 as used in this statute, are synony- \u201c mous terms.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-7\">This is, at most, a mere matter of verbal criticism\u2014a mere abstraction\u2014which could by no possibility have influenced the jury, in coming to their conclusion on the testimony in this case; for nothing is clearer, than that the admission of Welsh, that he \u201c was cutting timber on Taylor\u2019s land\u201d evidenced that he \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwilfully\u201d cut timber on land \u201cnot his own.\u201d The admission, being made at the time he was doing the act, shows his knowledge and will in the sense of the statute. Mr. Bouvier defines \u201cwilfully\u201d to be \u201cintentionally,\u201d that is, in the exercise of the will, not inadvertently, in ignorance of what the actor is doing, or by mistake. How, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>as a matter of criticism, is the Judge right or wrong in saying that a man who wilfully cuts timber on land of another must know that he is cutting timber on land \u201cnot his own?\u201d or that the man who knowingly cuts timber on land \u201c not his own \u201d must will or intend to do so, if he be in his senses ? In other words, his Honor meant that either of these words performed the office of both, in reference to the proof under this statute, i. e. repelled the idea of ignorance of what the party was doing, of accident, or mistake; cutting timber being the act in question. And was he wrong, or if so, did, or could the error do any harm to appellant under the proof in this cause ? This charge was doubtless called out by defendant\u2019s erroneously insisting below, as he does here, that \u201c wilfully\u201d is equivalent to \u201c maliciously,\u201d for which he refers to 3 Whart. 427; and it does not sustain his citation. He finds this reference in Bouvier\u2019s Law Die. title \u201c Wilfully,\u201d where it will be found simply to announce the proposition that \u201cmaliciously\u201d being the more comprehensive term, includes \u201c wilfully,\u201d but not <em>vice versa.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b381-6\">Lipscomb, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABT\">The defendant in the Court below, who is the appellant in this Court, was indicted, with another, for wilfully and knowingly cutting down and carrying away trees, upon the land of Wm. Taylor, not being the land of them, the said Denman and Welsh, without having the consent of William Taylor, contrary to the form of the statute. This indictment was framed under the statute of 20th March, 1848. (Hart. Dig. Art. 493, 494.) The appellant was convicted, and his-co-defendant Denman acquitted, and judgment rendered against him, and a motion for a new trial overruled. The defendant appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The first ground of error assigned and brought to our consideration, is the overruling the motion for a new trial. The ground upon which the motion for a new trial was rested, is surprise at the evidence of the witness for the prosecution, being altogether different from what it was believed it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>possibly be. It is supported by the single affidavit of the appellant, that the facts, sworn to by the witness, are not true, and that their untruth can be proven by three witnesses residing in the county of Walker. The affidavits of these persons, referred to, were not submitted, showing that they would testify \u25a0to those facts being different from what the witness for the prosecution had testified to ; nor is there any reason why such affidavits were not produced. The affidavit shows that the persons referred to lived in the county, and one of them was the co-defendant who had been acquitted, in this case. The rule is well established in this Court, and believed generally to prevail in all Courts, that on a motion for a new trial, upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, the motion should be supported by the affidavit of the persons referred to as witnesses, by whom the facts relied on can be proven, or good reason should be shown why it was out of the power of the applicant to procure their affidavits. For the reason that this was not done, the motion was very properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Whether the criticism on the language of the Judge, in saying in his charge, that the words \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d are in law synonymous, be just as a question of philology, is of no sort of consequence in this case, because the indictment follows the precise words of the statute, and that is entirely sufficient. (State v. West, 10 Tex. R. 554.) The case just cited was an indictment for cutting and removing a land-mark under Art. 386, Hart. Dig.; the indictment pursued the words of the statute; and on motion it was quashed, because it did not allege that the stake or corner tree, was marked as a corner tree or boundary line, or that the defendant knew them or either of them to be such 'corner or boundary lines. The judgment of the Court was reversed, on an appeal; and we say that it is a general rule, that it is sufficient that indictments follow the language of the statute: we rule too, \u201cthat such land- \u201c marks are supposed to be alike open to the observation and \u201c knowledge of all men, and if a man destroys them, it must \u201c be presumed to have been done knowingly and intentionally. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>a If it was not so done, but was through inadvertence, ac- \u201c cident or mistake, that would be matter of defence, that \u201c must come from the defendant, and need not be anticipated \u201c or stated in the indictment.\u201d If then, the defendant had the consent of the own&amp;r, or had inadvertently cut the trees on the land of Taylor, it was a matter of defence. The statement of facts shows that it was proven on the trial, that the appellant admitted he was cutting timber from the land of Taylor, without his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">It was not necessary for the State to prove Taylor\u2019s title to the land; because it was admitted by the appellant. The objection, that the Court below refused to charge the jury, that they had a right, from the manner and position of a witness giving testimony before them, to attach whatever credit they might think proper to his statements, is too vague and uncertain, and was therefore properly overruled. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
