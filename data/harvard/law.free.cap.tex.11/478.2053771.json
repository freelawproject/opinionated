This was a suit by the appellee, for the recovery of certain negroes. The petition alleges that the plaintiff purchased the negroes at Sheriff\u2019s sale, as the property of Benjamin H. Halstead, in the State of Alabama, in November, 1842 ; that on the \"12th of June, 1844, he made a conditional sale of the negroes to Halstead, in the county of Montgomery, in this State, which sale was to be completed only in the event of the compliance, by the latter, with certain conditions stipulated to be performed by him, in the contract ; among which conditions were the following: that Hal-stead should pay, in annual instalments, the several sums of money, specified in the contract, according to its terms and stipulations; and in the mean time, that he should not sell or remove the property out of the county of Montgomery; and that, in case he did so, the plaintiff or his agents should take possession of the property, the contract of sale should be dissolved, and the petitioner be allowed to resume the actual possession of the negroes. The petition further alleges that he left the property in the possesion of Halstead, the bettor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>enable him to comply with the terms of the contract, and make the stipulated payments; that Halstead, in violation of the terms of said contract, had made a pretended sale of the property, and had delivered the possession thereof to the other defendants, who, well knowing the terms of the contract, and in violation thereof, had clandestinely removed the negroes from the said county of Montgomery, or secreted them therein, with the intent to defraud the plaintiff. The petition further alleges, that the plaintiff is advised that, if, contrary to his intention, the contract should be construed to be a mortgage, or lien to secure the payment of the sum of money therein specified, the said sale and transfer of the possession of the negroes was a fraud upon the rights of petitioner; and he prays for the recovery of the negroes, with damages for their detention, and for general relief.

They aver that the said bill of sale of the slaves made in Alabama, and the alleged conditional sale made in Texas are fraudulent and void and confer no rights on the plaintiff; but if the last named instrument is of any validity, it can only be so as a mortgage: for that it was made and intended to secure the payment of certain sums of money therein specified. The defendants further allege that by reason of their purchase from Halstead, they became and were legally possessed of the negroes in controversy, and that the plaintiff, after the commencement of this suit, and on the 30th day of May, 1847, wrongfully and forcibly dispossessed them thereof, and detaines them ; and that their hire during their detention has been of the value of two hundred dollars ,each; and they ask that in case the before mentioned instrument shall be held to be a mortgage,, the hire of the negroes be deducted from the amount found to be due thereon; but if nothing be due, which they aver, that they have judgment therefor. The amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>answer containing these latter averments was filed on the 28th day of May, 1849. The answer contains a detailed history of the transactions between the plaintiff\" and Halstead, commencing in Alabama, before the Sheriff\u2019s sale, under which the plaintiff claimed to have acquired the title to the negroes, and ending with the alleged conditional sale. The defendants further pleaded in reconventien, damages for an alleged trespass committed by the plaintiff by wrongfully and forcibly dispossessing them of the negroes in controversy, on the 1st day of June, 1847. This plea was filed in November, 1849. There were other matters pleaded which it is not necessary to notice. The plaintiff excepted to the answer, as insufficient, in so far as it sought to impeach the plaintiff\u2019s title, on the ground that it was made and procured to defraud the creditors of Halstead; and also in so far as it sought to recover in reconvention, damages for the alleged trespass, for that the alleged trespass was barred before filing the plea in reconvention, and further that there was a former action pending between the parties, for the same alleged trespass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-5\">It appears from a bill of exceptions in the record, that the Court sustained the exceptions and adjudged that \u201c all and \u201c every part of the original and amended answers of the said \u201c Fowler and Clepper, which charge fraud and collusion, by \u201c and between the plaintiff and the defendant Halstead, for \u201c the purpose of delaying, hindering, or defrauding the credi- \u201c tors of said Halstead, whether done in the state of Alabama, \u201c or in Texas; and all and every part of amended answer of \u201c the defendants, Fowler and Clepper, filed on the 28th of \u201c May, 1848, which avers a trespass on the part of the plain- \u201c tiff, in taking the negroes in controversy, be stricken out, \u201cand disallowed,\u201d\u2014leaving, as the Judge certifies, only the defences of \u201c the general denial, and the plea that the plain- \u201c tiff\u2019s claim is only a mortgage, and as such, asking an \u201c account for hire since the negroes went into the plaintiff\u2019s \u201c possession.\u201d On these issues the case was submitted to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The plaintiff gave in evidence, first, the agreement or contract of sale between the plaintiff and Halstead, dated June 12th, 1844, and recorded the same day in the county of Montgomery.

They offered in evidence a statement of accounts between Stoneum and Halstead, purporting to have been made on the 12th of June, 1844, showing items of indebtedness charged by the latter to the former, beginning anterior to the bill of sale in Alabama, and extending down to a period shortly before the making of this instrument of the 12th of June, 1844; and showing an indebtedness at that date, on the part of Halstead, of $5,585 18-100, and a final settlement, by a receipt in full. This evidence was rejected, on the ground that it was irrelevant. The defendants asked the Court to instruct the jury that the contract sued on, (of the 12th of June, 1844,) was, on its face, and in its legal import, a mortgage; which instruction the Court refused.

That deeds and conveyances, to hinder, delay and defraud creditors, are void, admits of no question; they are so expressly declared by the statutes of Elizabeth, which have been in substance re-enacted in all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>States of the Union. \u201c And the principles and the rules of \u201c the Common Law, as now universally known and under- \u201c stood, are so strong against fraud in every shape,\u201d says Lord Mansfield, (1 Cowper, 434,) \u201c that the Common Law was calculated to attain every end proposed by the statutes.\u201d \u201c The \u201cgenius of the Common Law of England opposes itself to \u201c every species of fraud, so that nothing can have legal validity which has apparent fraud in its composition,\u201d and \u201c All \u201c statutes against fraud are simply declaratory of the Common \u201c Law.\u201d (Roberts on Fraudulent Con., 1, 13, 15, 16.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-5\">Though the Common Law abhorred fraud, and punished those guilty, it was found insufficient to prevent its perpetration, in consequence of the great cunning and new devices of modern times, to effect which the Acts of Elizabeth were passed. (Rob. 520.) These Acts of Elizabeth are substantially re-enacted in the statute of frauds of Alabama and of this State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-6\">Before the passage of the Acts of Elizabeth, there was some diversity of opinion as to the effect of a fraudulent deed, upon the rights of a subsequent purchaser or creditor; and the earliest decisions of the Courts, upon these statutes, favored voluntary conveyances, against creditors whose claims arose upon subsequent contracts; but a regard to the true intent of the statutes has led to a different construction. \u201cIt is not the \u201c accomplishment of the deceit that constitutes the fraud, but \u201c the deceitful intention manifested by his proceeding to the \u201c second conveyance. Though the purchaser be not deceived, \u201c a voluntary conveyance may still be fraudulent. And if so, \u201c it is consequently void as against him, if he completes his \u201cpurchase.\u201d \u201cBy this avoidance of the first conveyance, \u201c besides the protection of the purchaser, the statute has sec- \u201c ondarily in view the punishment of the deceit.\u201d (Rob. 37.) \u201c By thus considering the avoidance under the Statute 27 \u201cEliz., both as protective and suppliciary, and by regarding \u201c the fraud as perfected in its essence, though unexecuted in \u201c its object, by the voluntary conveyance made with intent to&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u201c deceive, of which fraudulent intent the subsequent contract \u201c is the proper evidence, we see the reason of the unimport- \u201c anee of notice to the subsequent purchaser, who, if he has \u201c knowledge of the conveyance, sees the fraudulent intent dis- \u201c closed in the very treaty of sale, and has only to complete \u201c his purchase, that by virtue of the valuable consideration, \u201c he may become qualified under the statute to treat that as \u201c void which he before perceived to be fraudulent.\u201d (Id. 39.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-5\">\u201c A voluntary conveyance is good, considered by itself, and \u201c good against all but one who purchased for a consideration \u201c of value; but when a purchaser of that description appears, \u201c the first conveyance, coupled with the subsequent attempt \u201c to sell for value, make up a compounded evidence of fraud- \u201c ulent intention. The absurdity of making that fraud by <em>ex '\u25a0'\u2022post facto </em>circumstances, cannot with reason be objected. \u201c Such objection is answered by the difference between making \u201c and proving, for though an act which must be considered as \u201c innocent, when committed, for want of evidence to the contrary, cannot be made criminal by subsequent events, yet evidence and presumption may well arise from subsequent events, \u201c to annex a construction of guilt to that which stood free from \u201c imputation at first.\u201d (Rob. 33.) \u201c In looking a little more \u201c inquisitively into the nature of this presumption of fraud, \u201c or intent to deceive, as it arises upon these statutes, we are \u201c led to observe that the fraud does not consist in the actual \u201c deception of the purchaser or creditor, but in making a conveyance with a view to deceive or defraud them, which in- \u201c tent to deceive or defraud cannot be manifest and determin- \u201c ed until a purchaser or creditor arises: the whole then is \u201c regarded as one transaction by relation, and the fraud in the \u201c contemplation of the statutes, is then complete. This intent \u201c to deceive is evident by a voluntary conveyance,, coupled \u201cwith a subsequent agreement to sell the subject of that vol\u201cuntary conveyance; and the fraud being complete in this \u201c stage of the transaction, the purchaser may execute his bar- \u201c gain notwithstanding he has notice of the former voluntary \u201c conveyance.\u201d (Id. 35.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Let us apply the reasoning of this learned author to the case at bar. Here was a voluntary conveyance, to defraud creditors ; \u201c for if it matters not, in this case, that it had assumed \u201c the shape of a judgment of Court and an execution and pub- \u201c lie sale. If the bond be voluntary, the judgment confessed \u201c upon it, will likewise be voluntary.\u201d (Rob. on Fraudulent Con. 489.) The law will not permit its forms to be used to sanction illegal acts; that the stolen garb shall effectually conceal and protect the fraud sought to be covered up by it. Stoneum was a party to that fraud. To punish him and to effectually suppress such frauds in future, the conveyance is declared to be absolutely void. The appellants, knowing the conveyance to be fraudulent, by purchasing for a valuable consideration, acquired the right to treat it as void. Though they were not deceived, yet the sale was made with the view of deceiving and defrauding; it is that which it is the object of the law to prevent; it is the intention which renders the deed void. (Rob. 34, note 0, 52, 59.) \u201cActual fraud may be \u201c shown by a creditor, although his debt accrued subsequent \u201c to the conveyance sought to be avoided, even if it be a mere \u201c right of action.\u201d (Rob. on Fraud. 49, note.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-5\">This is the doctrine of American Courts. \u201c Actual fraud \u201c may be shown by a subsequent creditor.\u201d (3 Wendell, 411; 2 Bailey, 324; 3 Dev. 12; 4 Id. 197; 4 Yerger, 164; 1 State R.

In the case of Ried v. Livingston (3 Johns. Ch.

It is agreed that the property shall remain in the possession of Halstead during the time specified; provided he shall make the payments punctually as they become due, and shall not remove the property from the county of Montgomery ; but should he fail to make any of the payments, then Stoneum, or bis agent, is authorized to sell, at public or private sale, so much of the property as shall be sufficient do meet said payment. And should he attempt to remove the property, then Stoneum, or his agent, is authorised to take it into possession, and the title is to remain absolute in said Stoneum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-12\">It is the intention of modern Courts to construe instruments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>to be mortgages, in all doubtful cases; and to prevent undue advantage being taken of the necessities of a debtor, instruments have been held to be mortgages, though the parties intended differently.

The <em>onus probandi </em>is- on the de- \u201c fendant. If it is doubtful, then it must be construed to be \u201c a mortgage ;\u201d (Flagg v.

This, in no part of the instrument, is said to be the consideration of the conveyance, or the price of the negroes. This sum Hal-stead covenants to pay in annual instalments, and in default of any payment, sufficient of the property is to be sold to make it. Whose property is to be sold ? If, as the appellee contends, this is a conditional sale, then the title of the property would vest in Stoneum. On failure to perform the conditions, Stoneum\u2019s property is to be sold to pay Halstead\u2019s debts. If the property is all sold to meet the first payment, the remain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>der of the debt still survives against Halstead : if the property dies, or is destroyed, the loss is Halstead\u2019s, though Stoneum is the owner. \u201cIt is a true test, by which to determine \u201c whether or not an instrument is a mortgage, to ascertain \u201c whether there is a subsisting debt between the parties, capa- \u201c ble of being enforced in any way, <em>in rem </em>or <em>in </em>personami.\u201d (1 P. Will. R. 270, 271; 2 Id. 360; 1 Vesey, 406; 2 Atk. 496 ; 2 Bull &amp; Beat. 278 ; 7 Cranch, 237.) In this case, from the very terms of the instrument, there is a debt subsisting against Halstead, which could be enforced <em>in rem </em>or <em>in personam ; </em>and the debt still survives, though all of the property be destroyed. By the terms of that instrument Stoneum, as the second payment fell due,\u00bb could sue and obtain judgment against Halstead for the amount, although all of the property had been previously sold to make the first payment. And further, should Halstead remove the property from the county in which it was situated, Stoneum was authorized to resume possession immediately. The conditions were annulled, but the debt against Halstead still subsists. Will the Court of equity enforce such a hard and unconcionable agreement as this\u2014an agreement so entirely one-sided ? Suppose Halstead has faithfully complied with all the conditions on his part\u2014has punctually made the payments as they became due\u2014what means does he possess to compel Stoneum to re-convey said property ? None whatever; for this instrument is not signed by Stoneum. Stoneum is not bound by it to do anything. Do not all of these facts\u2014the acknowledgment of a debt, the agreement to pay it, the stipulation that the property shall be sold in case of default, that the debt survives the loss or destruction of the property, and that Halstead alone is bound by the contract\u2014conclusively show that this instrument is a mortgage, so intended by the parties ? \u201c Courts of equity do not \u201c regard the form of an instrument, but look to the intent, \u201c and give to the acts of the parties that construction which \u201c is consistent with the intent and equity.\u201d (2 Sumner, 533.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-5\">A reference to the facts of the case will remove all doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>from the minds of the most skeptical, as to the character of this contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-5\">As before stated there was a settlement.

In the petition for sequestration, the value of the negroes is sworn to be $6,218 55, being the principal of the debt with interest up to the date of filing the bill. \u201c Bring- \u201c ing the action as on a mortgage, is an evidence that such \u201c was the original contract.\u201d (10 Pick. 303.)'

Do not all of these facts show some secret trust, or understanding, that Halstead was to have his property again, when circumstances became more prosperous 2 The fact of Halstead acknowledging the Sheriff\u2019s bill of sale to be what'it purports to be, and what the law says it must be, if the transactions were fair and honest, raises, of itself, a violent presumption, that during all this time, there was some secret <em>trust </em>and understanding between the parties, as expressed in this instrument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-9\">The stipulation in this contract taking away the right of redemption in any event, is wholly void.

But the view we entertain of the principal questions in the case, which involve the merits of the controversy, and on which its ultimate decision must depend, will dispense with the necessity of considering all these various rulings, which relate to questions of practice and the admissibility of evidence, and will become immaterial, by our judgment on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The rulings of the Court, which it is deemed material to consider, are 1st. The striking out of certain portions of the defendants\u2019 answer; 2nd. The rejection of evidence offered by the defendants; and 3rd. The refusal of instructions asked by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">1. The propriety of the ruling on the sufficiency of the answer, depends upon the inquiry, whether it was competent for the defendants, being, as appears by their answer, purchasers with notice of the alleged fraudulent conveyance from Hal-stead to Stoneum, to avoid that conveyance on the ground that it was made to defraud creditors. This involves an inquiry as to the true construction of the second Section of the Act to preventfrauds and fraudulent conveyances. (Hart. Dig. Art. 1452.) This statute embraces the substance of the 2nd Section of the statute of 13 Eliz. ch. 5 and 27 Eliz. ch. 4. It is proper, therefore, to consult the decisions of the English and American Courts, upon the construction of those statutes, in determining upon the construction to be given to our statute upon the same subject. By the statute of 13th Elizabeth, gifts of goods and chattels, made to defraud creditors, were rendered void as against the persons defrauded thereby. The statute of 27th Elizabeth was made to prevent fraudulent conveyances of lands, to defeat subsequent purchasers. (Rob. on Fraudulent Conveyances, Ch. 1, Sec. 1, n. a, b; 2 Kent, Com. 440.) Our statute embraces both objects. It declares that \u201c Every gift, grant or \u201c conveyance of lands, slaves, tenements, hereditaments, goods \u201c or chattels,\u201d &amp;c., made \u201c to delay, hinder and defraud creditors of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts,\u201d &lt;fcc., \u201c or to defraud or to deceive those who shall purchase the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u201c lands, slaves,\u201d &amp;e., \u201c shall he deemed and taken only as \u201c against the person or persons,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c whose debts, suits, de\u201cmands, estates, interests,\u201d shall or may be thereby \u201cdis- \u201c turbed, hindered, delayed or defrauded, to be clearly and ut- \u201c terly void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Agj\">The statute thus protects the rights of creditors and subsequent purchasers, as fully and effectually, and in very nearly in the same terms, as they were protected by the statutes of 13th and 27th Elizabeth ; and it extends its protection to subsequent purchasers of slaves as well as of lands. In reference to the construction of the statute of 27th Elizabeth, Judge Story says, \u201c It was for a long period of time, a much litigated \u201cquestion in England, whether the effect of the statute was \u201c to avoid all voluntary conveyances, (that is, all such as were \u201cmade merely in consideration of natural love and affection, \u201cor were mere gifts,) although made <em>bona </em>fide, in favor \u201c of all subsequent purchasers, with, or without notice: or \u201c whether it applied only to conveyances made with a fraud- \u201c ulent intent, and to purchasers without notice. After no \u201c inconsiderable diversity of judicial opinion, (he adds) the \u201c doctrine has, at length, been established in England, (whether \u201cin conformity with the language or intent of the statute is \u201c exceedingly questionable,) that all such conveyances are \u201c void, as to subsequent purchasers with, or without notice, \u201c although the original conveyance was <em>bona, </em>fide, and with- \u201c out the slightest admixture of intentional fraud ; upon the \u201c ground that the statute, in every such case, infers fraud, and \u201c will not suffer the presumption to be gainsaid. The doctrine, however, has been admitted to be full of difficulties; \u201c and it has been confirmed rather upon the pressure of au- \u201c thorities, and the vast extent, to which titles have been ae- \u201c quired and held under it, than upon any notion that it has \u201c a firm foundation in reason and a just construction of the \u201c statute. The rule, <em>stare </em>deoisis, has been applied, to give \u201c repose and security to titles fairly acquired, upon the \u201c faith of judicial decisions. In America, (he adds,) a like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>\u201c </em>diversity of judicial opinion has been exhibited. Chancel- \u201c lor Kent has held the English doctrine obligatory, as the \u201c true result of the authorities. But, at the same time, he is \u201cstrongly inclined to the opinion, that, where the purchaser \u201c has had actual (and not merely constructive) notice, it ought \u201c not to prevail.\u201d (1 Story, Eq. Sec. 426, 427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Since the case in which Chancellor Kent delivered the opinion, referred to by Judge Story, the English doctrine has not been followed to that extent in New York. It was there opposed by the opinion of Chief Justice Spencer ; the doctrine of whose opinion has since been asserted in the Supreme Court of that State. (12 Johns. R. 536, 554 to 559 ; 4 Cowen, R. 603, 604; 8 Id. 406.) The Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Cathcart v. Robinson, (5 Peters, R. 264,) declined to adopt the then received English construction of the statute. The Court (Chief Justice Marshall delivering their opinion) held, that the received construction of statutes in England at the time they were adopted and admitted to operate in this country, and up to the time of our separation from England, might very properly be considered as accompanying the statutes themselves and forming an integral part of them; but that, however they might respect subsequent decisions, the Court did not admit their absolute authority. They, therefore, adopted the construction of the statute which prevailed at the American Revolution; which, they held, went thus far, that, \u201c A subsequent sale, without notice, by a person who had made a settlement, not on a valuable consid- \u201c eration, was presumptive evidence of fraud ; which threw \u201c on the party claiming under the settlement the burden of \u201c proving, that it was made <em>bona fide.\" </em>(Id. 280, 281.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">It seems that the rigorous doctrine at that time understood to be the established construction at Westminster Hall; and as stated in the text quoted from Story, has been since relaxed by the English Courts. (2 Kent, Com. 5th Am. Edit. 241, n. c.) And it is believed that this doctrine, that a subsequent sale for a valuable consideration, by a person who had made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>a voluntary conveyance, is conclusive evidence that the former conveyance was fraudulent, and void even as to a purchaser with notice, has not been adopted generally by the American Courts ; but that the better American doctrine is, that such subsequent sale is <em>only prima facie </em>evidence, which may be rebutted by showing that the former conveyance was made in good faith, and not intentionally to defraud. (4 Kent, Comm. 464, n. d; 2 Id. 440 to 442 and notes; 1 Sm. L. Cases, 1, Am. Notes to \u201c Twyne\u2019s Case;\" 1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. </em>Ch. 7.) And this accords with the doctrines maintained by this Court in the case of Bryan v. Kelton. (1 Tex. R. 415.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In the conflict of judicial opinion, we feel free to adopt that construction which seems to us best to comport with the true intent and meaning of the statute. For, whatever force there may be in the reason assigned for adhering, in England, to their received construction of the statute, that, to depart from it, would be, to unsettle the rights of property, and disturb the repose of society, that reason has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We have not the same reason to adhere to any particular course of decisions, which has constrained the English Courts to apply to their decisions the maxim, <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">But it is unnecessary, at present, to enter upon a review of the decisions, in order to ascertain what is the better opinion upon the construction of the statute; or what should be held to be its effect upon voluntary conveyances generally, in reference to- subsequent purchasers. We are, at present, only concerned with the question, whether a conveyance, intended to defraud creditors, is to be held to be void, under the statute, as to subsequent purchasers, with actual notice of the prior fraudulent conveyance. Upon this question, the English doctrine, and that of some of the American Courts, seem to be, that such a conveyance is void as to subsequent <em>Iona fide </em>purchasers, that is, (it is said,) purchasers, strictly and properly so called, whether with or without notice. (1 Story Eq. Sec. 433, n. 2; Twyne\u2019s case, in 1 Sm. L. Cases, 1, and notes; 4 Kent Com. 463.) But this doctrine as to purchasers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>with notice, appears to be founded on the supposition, that a conveyance made intentionally to defraud, is, to all intents and purposes, absolutely void, and, consequently, a nullity. This being assumed, it follows, of course, that it is immaterial whether the subsequent purchaser had notice of it or not: for if he knew of its existence, he also knew, it may be said, that it was void; and no one is obliged to respect a thing which is, to every intent, and as to all persons, utterly and absolutely void. But this is not the case of (with) a fraudulent conveyance. It is valid and binding as between the parties and their legal representatives. \u201cAlthough,\u201d (says Story, 1 Eq, Sec. 371,) \u201cvoluntary conveyances are, or may be, void, as to \u201c existing creditors, they are perfect and effectual, as between \u201c the parties, and cannot be set aside by thegrantor, if he should \u201c become dissatisfied with the transaction. It is his own folly \u201c to have made such a conveyance. They are not only valid \u201c as to the grantor, but also as to his heirs, and all other per- \u201c sons claiming under him, in privity of estate, with notice of \u201c the fraud. A conveyance of this sort, (it has been said, \u201c with great truth and force,) is void only as against creditors ; \u201c and then only to the extent, in which it may be necessary \u201c to deal with the conveyed estate for their satisfaction. To \u201c this extent, and to this only, it is treated, as if it had not \u201c been made. To every other purpose it is good. Satisfy the \u201c creditors, and the conveyance stands.\u201d (Ib.; <em>12 </em>Vesey, 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Such a conveyance vests in the grantee a good and perfect title, defeasible only at the instance of the person, to whose prejudice it has operated. \u201c It is now the settled American \u201c doctrine, that a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for a valuable consider- \u201c ation, is protected under the statutes of 13 and 27 Eliz., as \u201c adopted in this country, whether he purchases from a frau- \u201c dulent grantor or a fraudulent grantee.\u201d (4 Kent, 464.) But if the conveyance was absolutely void, the fraudulent grantee could convey no title; for none would vest in him; and the fraudulent grantor could reclaim his property notwithstanding the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>That such a conveyance is not absolutely void, but is valid and effectual to vest a title in the grantee; and the distinction between things void and voidable only, are very clearly and forcibly illustrated by Chief Justice Spencer, in the case of Anderson v. Roberts. (18 Johns. R. 515, 527-8.) \u201c In my judgment,\u201d (he said,) \u201c the error of those who assert, that a fraudulent \u201c grantee, under the 13th of Eliz., takes no estate, because the \u201c deed is declared to be utterly void, consists in not correctly \u201c discriminating between a deed which is an absolute nullity, \u201c and one which is voidable only. No deed can be pronounc- \u201c ed, in a legal sense, utterly void, which is valid as to some \u201c persons, but may be avoided at the election of others. In \u201c Lilly\u2019s Abr. 807, and Bac. Abr. Tit. Void and Voidable, \u201c we have the true distinction. A thing is void which is done \u201c against law, at the very time of doing it, and where no per- \u201c son is bound by the act; but a thing is voidable, which is \u201c done by a person who ought not to have done it, but who, \u201c nevertheless, cannot avoid it himself, after it is done. Ba- \u201c con classes under the head of acts which are absolutely void \u201c to all purposes, the bond of a <em>feme </em>covert, an infant, and a \u201c person <em>non compos mentis </em>after an office found, and bonds \u201c given for the performance of illegal acts. He considers a \u201c fraudulent gift void as to some persons only, and says it \u201c is good as to the donor, and void as to the creditors. When- \u201c ever the act done takes effect as to some purposes, and is \u201c void as to persons who have an interest in impeaching it, \u201c the act is not a nullity, and therefore, in a legal sense, is not \u201c utterly void, but merely voidable. Another test of a void \u201c act or deed is, that every stranger may take advantage of it, \u201c but not of a voidable one. (2 Leo. 218 ; Viner., Tit. Void \u201c and Voidable, A. p. 11.) Again, a thing may be void in \u201c several degrees : 1st, void as if never done, to all purposes, \u201cso as all persons may take ad ventage thereof; 2nd, void \u201cto some purposes only ; 3rd, so void by operation of law, \u201c that he that will have the benefit \u2022 of it, may make it good. \u201c (Viner., Tit Void and Voidable, A. p. 18.) In Prigg v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u201c Adams, (2 Salk. 674,) the defendant justified as an officer, \u201c under a <em>ca. sa., </em>on a judgment in the common pleas, upon a \u201c verdict of 5s., for a cause of action arising at Bristol. The \u201c plaintiff replied the private Act of Parliament, for erect- \u201c ing the Court of Conscience in Bristol, wherein was a clause, \u201c that if any person bring such action in any of the Courts at \u201c Westminster, and it appeared upon trial to be under 40s., \u201c no judgment should be entered for the plaintiff; and that, \u201c if it be entered, it shall be void. Upon demurrer the ques- \u201c tion was, whether the judgment was so far void, that the \u201c party should take advantage of it in this collateral action. \u201c The Court held that is was not void, but voidable only by \u201c plea or writ of error. Upon authority, therefore, I insist, \u201c that the expressions in the statutes of 13th and 27th Eliz., \u201c that conveyances, in contravention of those statutes, shall be \u201c deemed utterly void, &amp;c., must necessarily be construed, as \u201c voidable by the party agrieved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">It has been, I apprehend, from not keeping in view this distinction, between a deed which is void, and one which is voidable only, that the opinion has prevailed to some extent, that a conveyance that is fraudulent, and therefore declared to be utterly void by the statute, is so even as to a subsequent purchaser with notice. It is difficult to conceive of any other principle, on which such an opinion could ever have obtained. There is nothing in the language of the statute, nor is there any general principle of law, which would seem to sanction such a doctrine. On the contrary, the language and declared object of the statute would naturally lead to the conclusion that it was intended to afford protection only to creditors and <em>Iona fide </em>purchasers, and such is the language generally, of the books. But how can one be said to be a purchaser in good faith, who purchases, knowingly and intentionally to defeat the previously acquired title of another ? In Sanger v. Eastwood, it was said by the Supreme Court of New York, that a purchaser with notice cannot claim to be a purchaser in good faith. \u201cClear (actual) notice of a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201c claim,\u201d (it was said,) \u201c is considered <em>p&amp;r se </em>evidence of <em>mala \u201c fides\u201d </em>Proof of such a fact ought rather to prejudice than advance the claims of a purchaser. (19 Wend. 515.) The general principle of law unquestionably is, that a purchaser with notice, takes the estate of his grantor, and no more. He acquires only such title as the latter had to convey; and he can stand in no better condition, in a Court of Equity. An innocent purchaser, without notice, is protected upon a different principle, from the supposed nullity of the grantor\u2019s prior conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">But the doctrine that the purchaser with notice can avoid the prior conveyance is not universally admitted. There is high authority opposed to it. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in the case of Foster v. Walton, (5 Watts, 478,) determined the contrary, on principle, and upon reasons which seem unanswerable. They decided that, although a conveyance of land may be fraudulent and void as to creditors, by virtue of the statute of 13th Elizabeth, yet, under that statute, none but creditors can avoid the deed; and that the statute of 27th Elizabeth, does not afford a protection to a purchaser with notice of such prior conveyance. That was an action of ejectment in which both parties claimed under deeds from one Register; Walton, by a subsequent conveyance, but with a knowledge of the prior deed to the plaintiff, Register; which, he sought to avoid on the ground that it was made to defraud creditors. On the construction of the statute of 27 Eliz., as to its application to such a case, the Court said : \u201c If at the \u201c time he, (the defendant,) bought the land of Register, or \u201c even before he paid his money for it, he was apprised, as \u201c the evidence would seem to show he was fully, of the previ- \u201c ous conveyance of the land by Register to the plaintiff, then, \u201c according to the construction put on this latter statute, and &gt;c the principles laid down by this Court in Lancaster v. Do\u201clan, the defendant has no claim to protection under it as a \u201c purchaser.\u201d This case was decided after a very able and full discussion of the construction which ought to be given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>this statute, and is now considered as having settled the law, on this point, in Pennsylvania. The Chief Justice, in delivering the opinion of the Court in it, shows by a course of reasoning, and by language that cannot be resisted, or easily forgotten, the injustice and iniquity that would necessarily follow from permitting a voluntary grantor to defeat his own conveyance, by making a subsequent sale of the land, because he is paid for it. He says, (1 Rawle, 246,) \u201c It is admitted that a \u25a0 \u2018 voluntary conveyance is good between the parties; and it is \u201c a common principle of equity, that an assignee with notice, \u201c must abide by the case of the assignor. But the pretended \u201c equity of a subsequent purchaser with notice, even as against \u201c a volunteer, would spring from an act, the consequence and \u201c design of which would be to enable the donor to cheat the \u201c donee. The purchase would be an act of collusion, and all <em>\u201c </em>the fraud would be on the side of the purchaser.\u201d \u201c If the \u201c defendant in the present case had notice of the plaintiff\u2019s con- \u201c veyance at the time he bought, or before he paid his money, \u201c there seems to be no circumstance which he can lay hold of, \u201c that would seem to relieve him from the imputation of fraud, \u201c which is so clearly shown here by the Chief Justice, to exist \u201c in such a case, on the side of the subsequent purchaser. It \u201c certainly cannot be considered a sufficient apology and justi- \u201c fication for him, havingfull notice, that he purchased, because \u201c the plaintiff had joined with Register in taking a conveyance \u201c from the latter for the purpose of defrauding his creditors. It \u201c is only the party who is likely to be injured by such convey- \u201c anee that can claim to have it annulled ; but if he does not \u201c choose to stir in the matter, why should any other be permit- \u201c ted to interfere <em>% </em>Surely no good can result from it. The \u201c peace and well being of the community is not affected by the \u201c act, so as to make it a public offence; and therefore, to permit \u201c a person who has no concern in the matter, to take the land \u201c from the party to whom it has been conveyed by the most \u201c solemn, wilful and deliberate act of the owner; and in effect, \u201c against the will of the grantee, to give it back in whole, or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\u201c part, again to the grantor, by paying him its full or half value, \u201c would be introducing a very extraordinary principle into our \u201cjurisprudence, for regulating and transferring the rights of in- \u201c dividuals.- If such an interference were sanctioned, it would \u201c be productive of a new source, and continual state of strife \u201c and litigation. Besides the deed from Register to the plaintiff, \u201c being admitted by the Court below, and by every one, to be \u201c perfectly good and binding, as between the parties to it, to \u201c permit the grantor, by selling the land to one with notice, to \u201c set it aside, would involve the strange anomalism of enabling \u201c him to do by indirect means what he is prohibited from effect- \u201c ing directly. It may also be remarked that to permit this to \u201c be done, would be in contradiction to every principle of \u201c public policy, which makes, the act of the fraudulent grantor \u201c binding upon him, so far as he or his representatives are con- \u201c cerned, with a view to deter from and discourage such fraudu- \u201c lent acts. But if he can sell the land to whom he pleases, he \u201c is in effect the owner of it still, and has forfeited, or lost noth- \u201c ing by his fraudulent conduct. The law, however, has no such \u201c regard for him as to enable him, either directly, or indirectly, \u201c to annul his own conveyance, though fraudulent, with a view \u201c to promote his interest; and it is only where he has afterwards \u201c sold and conveyed the land to an innocent purchaser without \u201c notice, for a valuable consideration, that the law will interpose \u201c and set the voluntary, or fraudulent conveyance aside, in order \u201c to prevent a loss from falling on such innocent purchaser. \u201c It is, therefore, out of regard to this latter, and not the gran- \u201c tor, that the law deals thus with the fraudulent conveyance.\u201d (5 Watts, 380, 381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">To this reasoning there is no answer in any authority to which we have had reference: and it seems to us, that to admit the opposite doctrine, would be to hold out a powerful motive and inducement to the practicing of those frauds which it was the object and intention of the statute to prevent; and would thus defeat the great purposes of public policy in which it had its origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>We therefore conclude that the defendants, being purchasers with actual notice of the prior conveyance, are not protected by the statute: and that the Court did not err in adjudging the answer, in so far as it sought to avoid that conveyance on the ground that it was fraudulent as to creditors, insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The question we have now been considering was decided by this Court in the case of McClenny v. Floyd. (10 Tex. R. 159.) That case, however, was decided without argument upon this point; and, at a time, when the presure of business afforded little opportunity to examine the authorities. It has been fully argued in the present case, and its importance, and the attention bestowed upon it by counsel, have seemed to -require a more critical examination; which has resulted in confirming us in our former opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In the case referred to, the conveyance from McClenny was treated as fraudulent. But it was immaterial, as to the parties then before the Court, whether it was fraudulent, or merely voluntary. In either case it was binding and effectual to pass the title as between the parties; as the authorities, to which we have referred, abundantly show.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">2. The principal question before the jury, upon the issues in the present case, was, as to the character of the instrument of the 12th of June, 1844, whether it was a mortgage or not. The Court held that it was not, -upon its face, a mortgage. If it was not a mortgage on its face, but was, in form, a conditional, or an absolute sale, it is too well settled to admit of a question, that parol evidence was admissible to show that it was, in fact, intended as a security for a subsisting indebtedness on the part of the grantor, and was, consequently, in substance, a mortgage. How, then, it can be supposed that the evidence, offered to prove such indebtedness, was irrelevant; or what good reason there could be for the exclusion of evidence, by which it was proposed to show, that at the date of the instrument, there was a settlement of accounts between the parties and an ascertained, antecedent indebtedness on the part of the maker, of the identical sum stipulated by the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>strument to be paid by him, it is not easy to perceive. This was proposing to prove the fact, which is universally admitted to be the principal test, to determine whether the instrument was a mortgage or not. (Stamper v. Johnson, 3 Tex. R. 1; Stevens v. Sherrod, 6 Id. 294, and authorities there cited.) If this testimony had been admitted, it is scarcely possible to conceive that any mind could have resisted the conclusion, that the instrument was really given and intended as a security for the payment of money ; and was, necessarily, a mortgage. It would seem, therefore, that there was error in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">But the ruling upon this question becomes unimportant, in the view we entertain of the remaining question, upon the true import and character of the instrument itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">3. It remains to inquire whether the ruling, upon instructions asked by the defendants, that the instrument of the \"12th of June, 1844, was not, on its face, and in effect, a mortgage, was correct. And, to determine this question, it is essential to ascertain what was the true character of the instrument, and, if in our legal nomenclature, it has a place and name, to ascertain what is its distinctive character and appropriate name.'</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">It may be the most convenient method of arriving at a satisfactory conclusion on this point, in the first place, to see what it is not. We may premise, that it must be either an absolute or conditional bill of sale, a contract to sell or convey, or a mortgage. Our legal vocabulary affords no other specific designation by which it may be supposed to be appropriately characterized.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">It has not been, nor can it be, pretended that it is an absolute bill of sale. Its terms, and several stipulated conditions, import the contrary. It is not a conditional sale; for it does not presently pass the title: whereas a conditional sale passes the title to the vendee, in the first instance, with the reservation to the vendor of a right, to repurchase the property, at a fixed price, and specified time. (7 Cranch, <em>218; </em>Luckett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>v. Townsend, 3 Tex. R. 119; Thompson v. Chumney, 8 Id. 389.) It is not a bill of sale, absolute or conditional from the plaintiff to Halstead ; for it does not pass, or profess to pass the title to the latter. On the contrary, it declares that the title is, and is to remain in the former. Neither is it, by its terms, or in form, a sale from Halstead to the plaintiff: for it declares that the title theretofore had been and was in the latter. Not being a conveyance in form, it cannot be made such by extrinsic evidence. Parol evidence is admissible to show that a deed, or bill of sale absolute, or conditional on its face, is a mortgage; but not <em>e converso. </em>(6 Watts, 130.) If an instrument does not contain the essential requisites of a conveyance, valid and effectual, in itself, to pass the title, it cannot be made so by extrinsic evidence. In fine, it evidently is not, in form or substance, either an absolute, or conditional sale. It does not purport to be a sale, or pass, or profess, <em>per se </em>to pass the title; and, therefore, it is not, and cannot be a conditional sale. In form it is a contract on the part of the plaintiff, to convey the property to Halstead, upon the performance of certain conditions, or stipulations, thereafter to be performed by the latter. But so regarded, being an executory contract for the sale of slaves, it would seem to be subject to the objection, that it comes within the operation of the first Section of the statute of frauds, and was not obligatory upon the plaintiff, because not signed by him. But, that this is not, really and truly, the character of the instrument, in fact and substance, will be apparent by attending to one or two of its stipulations and provisions. \u2022 It stipulates for the payment, by Halstead to Stoneum, of a sum of money, in annual instalments; and it further stipulates, that the negroes shall remain in the possession of Hal-stead during the time specified for the payment of the money ; but should he (Halstead) fail punctually to pay Stoneum, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, the several sums of money therein specified, then Stoneum, and in his absence, his agents, shall sell so much of the property, at public, or private sale, at their option, as will meet the payments accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ing to the tenor of the instrument. And it is further stipulated, that, should any of the negroes die, in the meantime, the loss shall be Halstead\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">These stipulations, it seems to us, fix the character of the instrument beyond a reasonable doubt. It is impossible to believe that any sane man would stipulate for the privilege of selling his own property to pay a debt due himself from another. It is not to be supposed that any man in his senses, (and it is not pretended that the plaintiff was insane,) would become a party to such an agreement. It admits of no rational interpretation upon any other supposition, than that the title to the property, notwithstanding the declarations in the instrument to the contrary, was,\" in fact, in Halstead, within the mutual, though private understanding and knowledge of the parties; and that the real intention of the instrument was to give a lien upon it, to secure the payment of a debt due by him to Stoneum. It is plainly inconsistent with any other supposition. If it had been a conditional sale from Stoneum to Halstead, or a contract to sell upon conditions to be performed by the latter; upon breach or failure of the conditions, the former would have been entitled to his property absolutely, discharged of the conditions; and there would have been no reason, or propriety, in his stipulating, himself to perform the condition, of which he alone could require the performance, by <em>the sale </em>of his own property. And the further stipulation, that, in case of the death of any of the negroes, the loss should be Halstead\u2019s, is inconsistent with the idea that they were the property of Stoneum. There doubtless was, for some reason, known to. the parties, but which they have not disclosed by the instrument, a secret trust and confidence subsisting between them, and a mutual understanding that the property, though really Halstead\u2019s, should be held out to the world as belonging to Stoneum ; and hence they resorted to the contrivance of this novel instrument, to avoid a disclosure of the true state of the case. But the instrument itself furnishes indisputable evidence of its real character, not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>withstanding the efforts of the parties, by their recitals and declarations, to conceal it. It evidently was, in fact and substance, a mere security ; and the law is, that where the instrument is, in substance, a security for the payment of money, no management or contrivance of the parties, no form or expression in the instrument, will avail to change its real character and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">We can entertain no doubt of the real character of the present instrument. But if it were doubtful whether the parties intended a mortgage or a conditional sale, a Court of Equity would incline to consider the transaction a mortgage, as more benign in its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Applying, therefore, to this instrument, the established rules of construction, applicable in such a case, to ascertain whether it is a mortgage or not, which have been too often considered by this Court, and are too familiar to require repetition here we conclude that it must be held, by its stipulations and provisions, to be, in effect and on its face, a mortgage; and that the Court erred in refusing so to instruct the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The petition was framed with a double aspect: asserting a title to the property absolutely, under the contract as a conditional sale discharged of its conditions ; and in the alternative, as a mortgage. The recovery was upon the former aspect of the case. This, in the view we have taken, was error. But the plaintiff was entitled to*maintain his action, in the other aspect of the case, for the foreclosure of the mortgage; and under the prayer for general relief, the appropriate relief might have been administered. But for the better presentation of the merits of his case, it may become necessary for the plaintiff to amend his petition. It contains no averment of the value of the property. And though the Court refused to entertain the demurrer, because the defendant had answered to' the merits, the omission of the averment might have become embarrassing to the plaintiff on the trial. This Court has often held, that exceptions to the legal sufficiency of the petition, in the due order of pleading, should, in general, precede the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>answer to the merits. But we have never decided, that exceptions, which go to the merits and foundation of the action, cannot be entertained after an answer to the merits. It would be idle to compel a defendant to proceed to trial, and drive him to his motion in arrest of judgment, upon a petition so defective as that, judgment could not be rendered upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The ruling of the Court upon the plea in reconvention was correct, for the reason that the matters pleaded were, at the time of pleading them, barred by the statute of limitations. Eo damages were claimed for the alleged trespass, complained of in the amended answer, filed on the 28th of May, 1849, and referred to by that date in the bill of exceptions; but hire only was claimed for the use of the property, after it came into the possession of the plaintiff; and the ruling of the Court did not deprive the defendants of the benefit of the claim for hire. The reference in the bill of exception, therefore, to this amended answer was, doubtless, a mistake. It should have been to the plea in reconvention, filed in Eovember, 1849; which, for the reason before stated, was rightly adjudged insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">There are other questions presented by the record, the consideration of which, however, may be dispensed with, as their determination <em>is not essential to the </em>present disposition and ultimate decision of the case. The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Eeversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
