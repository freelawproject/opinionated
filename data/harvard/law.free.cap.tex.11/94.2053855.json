The most material question for our consideration, arises on the refusal of the Court below, to give the third charge asked by the counsel for the defendant in the Court below; it was as follows: That \u201c the plaintiffs have no right to say that the affidavit of \u201c James E. Jenkins, their attorney, made on the 25th Janu- \u201c ary, 1851, was not good ; and that they are not thereby ex- \u201c cused from commencing suit within three months from the \u201c rejection of the claim by the administratrix.\u201d The affidavit, referred to in the charge asked and rejected by the Court, is as follows, i. e.: \u201c Personally appeared before me, James L. \u201c Farquhar, an acting Justice of the Peace in and for said \u201c county, James E. Jenkins, as agent and attorney for Mc- \u201c Willie and Moreland, the parties mentioned in annexed deed \u201c of trust, and, after being duly sworn, says that the debt and \u201c interest, mentioned in the accompanying deed of trust, is a \u201c just and subsisting claim against the estate of Josiah J. \u201c Crosby, late of said county, deceased, and that the same has \u201c never been paid or any part thereof\u2014that there are no off-sets \u201c against the claim; and he further states that no notes were \u201c taken, as mentioned in the deed of trust, at the execution \u201cof the same.\u201d Signed, \u201cJames E. Jenkins, agent and attorney of McWillie and Moreland,\u201d and attested, \u201c Sworn to and subscribed before me, this 25th January, A. D., 1851,\u201d signed \u201c James L. Farquhar, J. P. W. C.\u201d With the above authentication, the claim was presented for acknowledgment, on the 1st May, 1851, and answered, \u201c The within claim will \u201c not be paid.\u201d Signed, \u201cElizabeth M. Crosby, administratrix \u201c of J. J. Crosby.\u201d If this presentation and rejection of the claim, are such as come substantially within the requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>of the Statute, before a suit could be brought in the District Court against the administratrix, the Court below erred in refusing to give the charge, asked by the counsel for the administratrix; because the record shows that the suit was not brought within three months from the date of this rejection, as is enjoined to be done by the statute, \u201cand not thereafter.\u201d (Hart. Dig. Art. 1160.) But if the above presentation, authentication and rejection, were so far from the statutory requisition as to amount to a nullity, as they seem to have been regarded by the Court below, there is no error, as it was brought within the time, after the second presentation and refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The manner in which claims shall be presented and authenticated, is as follows, i. e.: \u201c That no executor or administra- \u201c tor shall allow any claim for money against his testator or \u201c intestate, nor shall any Chief Justice approve of any such \u201c allowance, unless such claim is accompanied by an affidavit \u201c in writing, that such claim is just and that all legal off-sets, \u201c payments and credits have been allowed,\u201d &amp;c., (see Art. 1158, Digest,) and \u201c that no holder of a claim for money \u201c against the estate of a deceased person, shall bring a suit \u201c thereon, unless such claim, properly authenticated, has been \u201c presented to the executor or administrator, and he has refus- \u201c ed to allow the said claim, for the whole or part thereof.\u201d (Art. Digest, 1159.) And \u201cIf such claim be rejected by the ex- \u201c ecutor or administrator for the whole or a part of the amount \u201c thereof, or if the allowance or any part thereof, made by the \u201c executor or the administrator, be disapproved by the Chief \u201c Justice, the holder of such claim may, within three months \u201c after the rejection by the executor or administrator, but \u201c not thereafter, bring suit against the executor or ad minis - \u201c trator for the establishment thereof,\u201d &amp;c. (Hart. Dig. Art. 1160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">It will be seen that the precise language has not been employed in the construction of the affidavit, as that used in the statute; but it is difficult to perceive in what single respect it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>fails to convey the same meaning ; and as words are used to convey and express ideas, we believe there is no difference, and that the authentication was sufficient in law. The rejection was absolute and unqualified, that the money would not be paid, and not placed on any defect in form or substance of the authentication. If it had been so made, there might have been some reason for a new authentication and presentment of the claim. The record shows that a second authentication and presentment of the claim were made on the 27th and 28th of August, 1852, about fifteen months after the first presentation and rejection of the claim. (Hansell v. Gregg, 7 Tex. R. 228.) The authentication, presentation and rejection, first noticed, are good and valid in law, and the party had three months within which time, from that rejection, \u201cto bring the suit and not thereafter.\u201d This not having been done, the claim was fully and completely barred by the limitation to this right imposed. The debt was no longer a subsisting debt against the estate; and it cannot be tolerated, that this claim should afterwards be revived by the party in default, who had, by such negligence, lost all legal right to sue. Such would be the result if he were permitted to revive his right of action, by making a new presentment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The statute of limitations was pleaded, and its policy was well explained in the opinion of this Court in the case of Danzey v. Swinney, 7 Tex. R. 631. We believe the Court erred in refusing the instructions; the judgment is therefore remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
