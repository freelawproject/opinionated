The counsel for the plaintiff, after proving partial payments and admissions of a continued indebtedness on these several demands made by the former to the latter decedent within six years prior to the commencement of the action to take it out of the operation of the statute of limitations, which was one of the pleas in the case, produced 'and tendered to the court the probate of the plaintiff\u2019s demand to the amount of eight thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight dollars and fifty-one cents, made by The Fidelity Safe Deposit and Trust Com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>pony of the State of Pennsylvania, administrator of Theophilus T.

For a \u201cdebt due to a corporation,\u201d it very properly provides that the probate shall be made by the cashier or treasurer of it; this, however, was not a debt due to this corporation within the obvious meaning and intention of the statute, and for the justice of which it requires the solemn oath or affirmation of such an officer of the corporation to be taken when it is due to such corporation in its own inherent right, but if due to any one it was due to Theophilus T. Deringer in his lifetime, and to his estate, as we express it, which is the same thing, now that he is dead.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b529-4\">\n<em>Higgins</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AsL\"><em>(Spruanee </em>with him) replied that it had been decided by the highest court in the State that this corporation is competent to maintain this action in this court as the administrator of Theophilus T. Deringer, deceased, duly appointed in the State of Pennsylvania under its act of incorporation in that State, and this being a debt due to it as such, the probate could be and had been probably made by it in such a case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\n<em>The Court,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"ALV8\">Comegys, C.

Notwithstanding the ruling, however, the counsel for the plaintiff proceeded to the jury and requesting the court to instruct them to that effect, which they did, they returned a verdict for the defendant, on which the counsel for the plaintiff gave notice that they would tender a bill of exceptions to the charge of the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
