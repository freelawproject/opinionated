J., absent. The record of the same was offered and read in evidence by the counsel for the plaintiffs, from which it appeared that at the return term of the original writ therein the defendant appeared, and the said Edward W. Houston, became special bail for him in the action. It also showed the recovery of the judgment in it as alleged, and that a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>had been issued upon it and returned <em>nulla bona </em>and <em>non sunt inventi. </em>The pleas were <em>nul tiel record, </em>no <em>ca. sa. </em>issued and returned <em>non est inventus </em>before the commencement of this action, and release and issues thereon.
