No affidavit of defense having been filed, the counsel for the plaintiff now moved for judgment on that ground, to which the counsel for the defendant objected because the abstract of the mortgage had not been filed on the same day with the affidavit of the cause of action, and appended to it as it should have been in order to establish and identify the reference of the latter to the former, and as had heretofore been uniformly done in such cases.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-8\"><em>Fisher, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-9\"><em>Massey, </em>for defendant,</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-7\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A8E\">sustained the objection and refused the motion for judgment, and <em>Comegys, C.
