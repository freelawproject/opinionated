And in no case should any member receive benefits while there was a charge pending against him, and no member applying for benefits who was three months in arrears should receive the same until six weeks after the arrearages were paid. It was further proved that the deceased was admitted a member of the lodge on the 23d day of June, 1870, and continued a member of it in good standing in all respects and of the knight\u2019s degree until his death on the 1st day of May, 1877.

During the three months preceding the 22d day of April, 1875, the lodge had paid out in benefits to six members four hundred and twenty-one dollars and ten cents, and for the want of funds it was obliged to suspend the payment of them for six months, as it had authority to do under its constitution, and which was sanctioned by a unanimous vote of the lodge. It resumed payment six months afterward, and after that the deceased was paid sixty dollars, and still later one hundred and fifty dollars was paid to his widow after his death to pay his burial expenses\u2014amounting in the whole to three</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>hundred and ninety dollars.
