A charge which omits, in a negligence action, these basic rules of guidance, does not adequately present the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The court charged the jury: \u201cSo that you have this basic fact to find when you come to deliberate upon the evidence, on which side of that road did this accident occur? If it occurred on the south side of the road, then you will find a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d This was error, since the jury were entitled to determine the case in the light of all of the facts presented. The claims of the parties could not be restricted in this fashion to this single point. The defendant was entitled to have his claim passed upon by the jury, that even though he were traveling on the south side of the highway, yet -under the circumstances the plaintiff should in the exercise of due care have turned to the south and avoided the collision, and not to have done so was contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">We commend the attempt of the trial court to compress the contested issues of the case to the nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>rowest point reasonably possible. But this must always be done without doing injustice to either party, and without narrowing the issues and restricting their presentation beyond the fair comprehension of the jury. A striking defect of some charges in negligence actions is their length, their complexity, and their failure to present the case in proper order and relation and with due simplicity. In attempting, to avoid these defects the trial judge went too far and failed to give the jury any rule of law for its guidance, or such a presentation of the facts in evidence and the claims made by the parties as to fairly present the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u201cIt is the duty of the court in every case to give to the jury sitting in that case such instructions as are applicable to the issues raised and sufficient for their guidance in coming to a verdict in the case before them.\u201d <em>Pietrycka </em>v. <em>Simolan, </em>98 Conn. 490, 499, 120 Atl. 310, 314; <em>Montambault </em>v. <em>Waterbary &amp; Milldale Tramway Co., </em>98 Conn. 584, 588, 120 Atl. 145, 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">There is error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
