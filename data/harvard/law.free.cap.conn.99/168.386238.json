Whatever the defendant means by finding a fact affirmatively, a fact found by the court is in law established affirmatively, unless the complaining party is able to secure the correction of the finding by showing that such fact was found without evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">An examination of the evidence discloses that the defendant is not seeking the addition to the finding of admitted or undisputed facts, or the omission of facts found without evidence, but is seeking the addition of facts which he claims that the weight of the evidence supports, and the omission of facts which he claims were not supported by the weight of evidence. These are not permissible grounds for correcting a finding. <em>Hine </em>v. <em>McNerney, </em>97 Conn. 308, 116 Atl. 610; <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Holmes Mfg.
