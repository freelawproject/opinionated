The remedy is by an application to this court for an order requiring him to make such finding. General Statutes, \u00a7 5824; <em>Giordano </em>v. <em>Janetto, </em>95 Conn. 690, 112 Atl. 263; <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>97 Conn. 279, 281, 116 Atl. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The only reason of appeal properly before the court is the court\u2019s refusal to set aside the verdict of the jury, and this the defendants do not pursue in their brief. Nor could they successfully, since we could not hold upon the evidence that the verdict was improperly found, it having been found upon conflicting evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>92 Conn. 657, 663, 103 Atl. 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
