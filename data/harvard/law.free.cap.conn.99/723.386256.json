That defendant failed to give plaintiff\u2019s intestate any warning of his approach by blowing a horn as he approached him; failed to slacken his speed as required by law when overtaking plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and did not seasonably turn to the left, and drove his car at an unreasonable and reckless rate of speed, in view of the width and traffic of said highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-9\"><em>\u201c4. </em>That defendant by the exercise of reasonable care could have seen plaintiff\u2019s intestate as he was walking down the highway in ample time to stop said motor-vehicle before striking him, and that he failed and neglected to keep a careful lookout so as to avoid exposing plaintiff\u2019s intestate to danger, and that plaintiff\u2019s intestate did not contribute to his injuries by any want of care upon his part. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-10\">The assignments of errors are these: \u201c1. The court erred in its entire charge in failing to present to the jury all the issues that arose in the trial of the cause, and the charge was inadequate to present all of said questions and to be a sufficient guide to the jury on all questions of law arising in the course of said case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b737-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number><em>\u201c2. </em>The court erred in charging the jury as follows:. \u2018 The other important thing which the plaintiff must establish is that his intestate at the time was in the exercise of due care, for the law is so that no matter how negligent the defendant may have been, if the plaintiff\u2019s intestate himself was negligent, thus materially contributing and concurring in bringing about this accident which resulted in his death, then the plaintiff cannot recover. So that, gentlemen, perhaps the first inquiry that you will enter upon when you go to your jury-room will be this question, Was the plaintiff\u2019s intestate himself in the exercise of due care at the time of this accident? And if you should reach the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was not in the exercise of due care at that time, and that this accident either resulted from his own failure to observe due care, or resulted from the concurring act of the defendant and the intestate, then that would end the case, and you would not have to consider the further elements in this transaction.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b737-7\">\u2022 \u201c3. The court erred in charging the jury as follows: \u2018The further allegation is that the defendant drove the car at an unreasonable and reckless rate of speed in view of the use, width and traffic of said highway. That is a statute which I suppose, gentlemen, most of you are familiar with, the statute being that \u2018No person shall operate a motor vehicle on any public highway of the state recklessly or at a rate of speed greater than is reasonable and proper having regard to the width, traffic and use of the highway. \u2019 Then the intersection of streets, weather conditions \u2014 \u2018so as to endanger the property or life or limb of any person. \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0Fy\">\u201cThere is no law in the State of Connecticut, gentlemen, which absolutely limits the speed of an automobile upon a highway. There are certain references to speed in this State which establish under certain circumstances a prima facie case, but there is nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>this particular case which requires me to call your attention to any particular portions of the statute,, for they are not applicable to the facts and circumstances in this case.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b738-6\"><em>Charles S. Hamilton, </em>with whom was <em>Morris L. Robin, </em>for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b738-7\"><em>Walter E. Monagan, </em>for the appellee (defendant).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b738-8\">Beach, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATcy\">The first assignment of error is too general to merit consideration. Our practice, following the statute, \u00a7 5837, and the common-law rule as to bills of exceptions, requires that the alleged errors be specifically assigned. Rules of the Supreme Court, \u00a7 7, Practice Book, p. 308; <em>Harper Machinery Co. </em>v. <em>Ryan-Unmack Co., </em>85 Conn. 359, 82 Atl. 1027; <em>Fagerholm </em>v. <em>Nielson, </em>93 Conn. 380, 106 Atl. 333; <em>Hine </em>v. <em>McNerney, </em>97 Conn. 308, 116 Atl. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The portion of the charge quoted in the second assignment of error states the rule as to contributory negligence correctly. . It is contended in this connection that the court erred in failing to charge as to the doctrine of last clear chance; but we find nothing in this record which necessarily calls for any charge on that point. The plaintiff\u2019s claims state some but not all of the facts essential to the application of that doctrine, and the defendant\u2019s claim was that the decedent suddenly lurched from a position of safety against the front fender of the defendant\u2019s motor-car.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Neither the plaintiff\u2019s claims, nor the defendant\u2019s claims, nor both taken together, show that the evidence presented a state of facts which required that the jury be instructed as to the law of last clear chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">The third assignment of error is well taken. The third claim of the plaintiff as set forth in the finding requires us to assume that he offered evidence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>which, the jury might, if properly instructed, have found that the defendant negligently failed to comply with the statute in not seasonably slackening his speed when overtaking the decedent, in not seasonably turning to the left, and in driving his car at an unreasonable and reckless rate of speed, in view of the width and traffic of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Under this claim the plaintiff was entitled to have the jury instructed, in effect, that any violation of these specific statutory rules of conduct by the defendant would, if found to have occurred, and to have been the proximate cause of the injury, require the jury to find the defendant negligent on that ground. The court did not so charge, but, on the contrary, instructed the jury that the statute was not applicable to the facts and circumstances in this case. This was error. As we said in <em>Pietrycka </em>v. <em>Simolan, </em>98 Conn. 490, 495, 120 Atl. 310: \u201cThe legislature, with unquestionable authority, has established an arbitrary standard for the test of conduct in operating motor-vehicles in the highways of this State. It has prescribed that certain acts, plainly stated or specifically defined, shall not be done. A violation of the statute is a violation of the duty which one person owes to another in respect of person or property, and therefore is negligence of itself, and when it is the proximate cause of injury it is actionable negligence.\u201d Citing <em>Sharkey </em>v. <em>Skilton, </em>83 Conn. 503, 508, 77 Atl. 950; <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>83 Conn. 174, 177, 76 Atl. 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">There is error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
