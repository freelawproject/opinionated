The conclusion of the trial court, therefore, must stand. <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>98 Conn. 374, 380, 119 Atl. 341. Moreover, an examination of the evidence discloses that the paragraphs of the finding to which exceptions were taken were supported by evidence. In substance, the plaintiff\u2019s contention amounts to no more than that this court should re-examine the disputed evidence and reach different conclusions of fact from those reached by the trial court upon the evidence offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">During the trial, several of' defendant\u2019s witnesses were inquired of by counsel for the plaintiffs on cross-examination, whether or not the land in question was not generally reputed to be a portion of the highway. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>These questions were properly excluded. The only reputation admissible to establish such facts as that the land was public ground and that there was a highway over it, is that of a past generation. <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>78 Conn. 96, 108, 61 Atl. 101; 3 Wigmore on Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 1582.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
