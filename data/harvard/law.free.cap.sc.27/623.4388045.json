Defendant demurred separately to the three causes of action, that they did not in themselves state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The demurrers were overruled by the Circuit Judge (Hudson) and defendant appealed. Held, that the three causes of action were sufficiently stated; but that there was really only one cause of action embracing three items. And moreover, if imperfectly stated, the proper remedy is not demurrer, but motion before trial to make the averments more definite.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
