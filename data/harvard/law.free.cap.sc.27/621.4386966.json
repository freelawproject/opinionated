The answer was a general denial. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney testified that defendant had admitted his liability on the note, both before and after suit brought, and had promised to pay it. Defendant moved for a. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>non-suit, on the ground that the assignment had not been proved. The judge (Kershaw) refused the motion and charged the jury that if defendant knew of the assignment when he promised to pay \u2014 or if the note was then exhibited to him with the assignment endorsed, and he promised to pay \u2014 or if, after summons served on him, he promised to pay \u2014 then there was an admission by the defendant of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">At the close of the evidence, defendant offered to prove that there was a failure of consideration in the note. The judge ruled that he could not do so under his general denial. Defendant then moved for leave to amend his answer. This was refused, the judge saying: \u201cIf you had made this motion at the first calling of the docket, or even this morning, stating the reason why, or indicated that you were disabled, I would have seen my way clear to have indulged it; but now, after the case has gone to the jury, it seems to me on the spur of the moment, I should have no hesitation at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">On appeal by defendant, this court approved and affirmed the above rulings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
