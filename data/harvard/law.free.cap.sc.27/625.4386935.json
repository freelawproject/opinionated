It also has original jurisdiction in certain matters \u2014 to issue writs of injunction, <em>quo warranto, habeas corpus, </em>and such other original and remedial writs as may be necessary to give the court a general supervisory control over all other courts in the State. Const., art. IV., \u00a7 4. This motion cannot be entertained under either of these powers. The Supreme Court has power to grant a writ of injunction, but it has no power to dissolve an injunction granted on Circuit. Motion refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
