The executor -was also a party defendant. The defendants interposed an oral demurrer which was overruled by the Circuit Judge (Kershaw), and he further ordered \u201cthat the defendants have twenty days after the rising of this court in which to file answers,\u201d and \u201cthat upon the expiration of the time above provided for the coming in of the answers that this cause be referred to the master, and that he take the testimony and report the same, together with his conclusions of law and fact to this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">On appeal by defendants, <em>held,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">1. That this was not an action against heirs to reach real estate descended, but against donees of a voluntary deed to set it aside for fraud, and that the complaint was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>2. \u201cWhen the judgments were recovered against the executor, it was not necessary that the wife and children of the debtor should be made parties, for they were privies in estate with the executor and bound by judgments against him as to the existence of the debts and all matters necessarily involved and therein adjudicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">3. The order of reference was premature, both because it was before the answers were filed, and because an appeal from the order overruling the oral demurrer was then pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">4. Under the demurrer, the question whether the land conveyed was the debtor\u2019s homestead, was not involved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
