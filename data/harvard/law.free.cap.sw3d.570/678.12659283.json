He contends the circuit court erred in precluding evidence of the alleged prior sexual conduct of one of the victims and in admitting hearsay testimony concerning a statement made by the other victim. For reasons explained in Memorandum provided to the parties, we find no error and affirm the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AFFIRMED. Rule 30.25(b)\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
