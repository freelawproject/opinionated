Based on the trial court's finding that an orientation instructor is a transportation worker, the trial court denied OEP Holdings, LLC's (OEP) motion to compel arbitration. We affirm the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is an employment discrimination case. Mohammed Akhondi worked for OEP, a staff leasing company. OEP provided workers, including Akhondi, to Mesilla Valley Transportation (MVT), a national over-the-road trucking company. Akhondi signed an arbitration agreement with OEP requiring that employment discrimination claims be resolved through arbitration. When OEP terminated his employment, Akhondi filed suit asserting age discrimination, along with a retaliation claim. OEP moved to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Akhondi does not dispute that he signed the agreement, or that the text of the agreement would cover a dispute such as this, nor does he raise any of the traditional affirmative defense to arbitration. Rather the narrow question below, and before us, is whether he is a transportation worker under the FAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The FAA requires the enforcement of arbitration agreement, but excepts \"contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or\n   <em>\n    any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\n   </em>\n   \" [Emphasis added].\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Trucking companies, however, employ other classes of workers to accomplish their mission, including mechanics, dispatchers, loaders, trainers, and as relevant here, orientation instructors. Does an orientation instructor, as described in this record, fall within the class of transportation workers exempted by the FAA?

At the time of his termination, he held the job title of \"orientation instructor.\" The parties evidenced his job duties through the live testimony of Luis Garcia (MVP's director of recruiting), the affidavit and live testimony of Akhondi, and the written job description for the position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The \"orientation instructor\" job description summarizes the position as developing and conducting an orientation program for new drivers and re-hires. Akhondi would develop and conduct that program by: (1) determining the training needs within MVT; (2) providing guidance to operations employees, new drivers, and re-hired drivers; (3) presenting MVT's policies and procedures; (4) selecting, developing and updating teaching aids; (5) instructing drivers on federal Department of Transportation rules and regulations; (6) updating the driver handbook as needed, and communicating those changes; (7) conducting orientation sessions for new employees, including on-the-job training, and use of specified software packages; (8) coordinating driver truck assignments; (9) testing trainees to measure progress and to evaluate effectiveness of training; (10) maintaining records of all testing for drivers and re-hires; and (11) reporting to the Operations Manager any job refusals or negative conduct among orientation attendees. While the job did not require the\n   orientation instructor to have a commercial driver's license, Akhondi did at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Akhondi's affidavit explained his orientation duties as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   As an Orientation Training Instructor for MVT, I trained drivers that transported goods throughout the country. As a trainer, I handled the trucks which were used to transport goods. On some occasions, I drove these trcuks [sic] from El Paso, TX to Arizona and New Mexico for training purposes. On one occasion, I trained a driver where goods were actually transported from El Paso, TX. As a trainer, I would supervise truck drivers that transported goods throughout the country. The trucks and trailers that I used for training were critical to MVT's operations as a trucking company. I trained drivers using the same trucks that the truck drivers used to transport goods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Akhondi testified at the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration. He explained that he took each new driver out to their assigned rig and taught them (1) how to use the unique software packages that MVT uses in its trucks, (2) how to use the standard stick shifts in MVT vehicles, and (3) how to perform a pre-trip inspection of the rig. On three or four occasions during the two and half year period that he was the orientation instructor, he went with the drivers to the ports of entry to show them how DOT inspections are done at state borders. On one occasion, and at the direction of his supervisor, he accompanied a driver from El Paso to Albuquerque to train the driver on the software and how to back the truck to a dock. MVT has a \"miles per gallon\" program to promote fuel economy; Akhondi testified that he would also teach drivers ways to improve their driving to save fuel. He admitted that his use of the word \"supervise\" in his affidavit was an error. He was, however, also a member of a three-person incident review committee that would review driver accidents, and make recommendations stemming from those accidents, including whether the driver should be terminated or otherwise disciplined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the hearing below, OEP relied on the testimony of Luis Garcia, who was the director of recruiting for MVP. He testified that Akhondi would not have any duties requiring him to be on the road with truckers, nor the actual transportation of goods. Garcia acknowledged, however, that his testimony was based on assumptions about what the orientation instructor would do, and was not based on any personal knowledge of Akhondi's actual job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    APPLICATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While the parties dispute how some of the\n   <em>\n    Lenz\n   </em>\n   factors apply, all agree that MVT is in the transportation industry (the first\n   <em>\n    Lenz\n   </em>\n   factor). The concession is significant, because \"the more related to the transportation industry an enterprise is, the less necessary it becomes for the employee to be directly transporting goods\" in order for Section 1 's exclusion to apply.\n   <em>\n    Zamora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202369769\">\n    2008 WL 2369769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6,\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Veliz v.

Unlike truck drivers who transport goods interstate, Akhondi is not personally responsible for the transport or handling of goods. The fact that he did so on one occasion would not be sufficient to turn this factor in his favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The fourth factor (supervision of employees who are themselves transportation workers) also weighs somewhat against Akhondi. He is not a supervisor in the strict sense of the word, in that he does not hire, fire, or direct the daily tasks of MVT's truck drivers. He does, however, instruct them on company policies, coordinate driver assignments, and is required to report negative information on new drivers to the operations manager. As a part of an accident review committee, he had input into disciplinary recommendations which management most of the time followed. OEP argues, and Akhondi does not contest, that the fifth factor-whether Akhondi is subject to special arbitration provisions like seamen and railroaders-is effectively neutral to our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Two of the last three\n   <em>\n    Lenz\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of Akhondi being a transportation worker.

And while Akhondi does not repair or maintain a truck as did the truck mechanic in\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , he instructs drivers on the use of unique software that MVT uses as a part of its business model. For much the same reason, there is some evidence in the record supporting the eighth factor-a nexus between the orientation instructor and the operation of the trucks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Akhondi instructs on the software used in the truck's operation, as well as routine safety checks, and DOT inspections necessary to comply with state and federal law.

Cf.\n   <em>\n    Zamora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202369769\">\n    2008 WL 2369769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8 (terminal managers occasional driving of trucks considered for one of the\n   <em>\n    Lenz\n   </em>\n   factors). His written job description specifically contemplated that Akhondi would conduct \"on-the-job training.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The seventh\n   <em>\n    Lenz\n   </em>\n   factor asks whether a strike by the class of worker at issue would disrupt commerce.\n   <em>\n    Lenz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1618078\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/431/348/#p352\">\n    431 F.3d at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties introduced no evidence below on that issue, though presumptively a trucking company could operate without interruption at least for a time because the orientation instructor focuses on new employees. We would weigh this factor somewhat in OEP's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, three of the\n   <em>\n    Lenz\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of Akhondi, and do so heavily enough to counterbalance the opposing factors. As the trial court alluded to below, a truck is of no use without a driver, and a\n   driver cannot accomplish the job without a truck. Both are essential to transporting goods. And just as the mechanic in\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   was essential in maintaining the truck, there is some evidence in the record to support the trial court's implied finding that Akhondi's position was essential in preparing the drivers to perform their job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Aside from the\n   <em>\n    Lenz\n   </em>\n   analysis, OEP places emphasis on a U.S. Department of Labor bulletin explaining that \"office personnel\" are not exempt from overtime pay rules in the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"). Without citation to authority, OEP's brief claims the exemption only applies to those \"positions [which] are deemed to have a nexus between the work required and the movement of goods within interstate commerce.\" To the contrary, the exemption is based on several factors, including the safety component of the job. Thus how the Department of Labor treats classes of transportation workers on overtime pay is not determinative of how a court treats them under the FAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Generally, the FLSA requires an employer to pay overtime to any nonexempt employees who work more than forty hours in a seven-day work week.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The overtime pay rules in the FSLA, however, \"shall not apply with respect to ... any employee with respect to whom the Secretary of Transportation has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,502].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). In turn, the Secretary of Transportation has the power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service for employees who (1) are employed by carriers whose transportation of passengers or property by motor vehicle is subject to the Secretary's jurisdiction under the Motor Carrier Act; and (2) engage in activities of a character directly affecting the safety of operation of motor vehicles in the transportation on the public highways of passengers or property in interstate or foreign commerce within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20782.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 782.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    Baez v.

Accordingly, the denial of an FSLA exemption could have as much to do a job lacking the necessary safety component as its relation to the transportation of goods. By contrast, the exemption in Section 1 of the FAA is not determined by the safety aspect of the job, but by whether the class of employees are actually engaged in the movement of goods in interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    Circuit City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300786\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/105/#p112\">\n    532 U.S. at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300786\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/105/#p112\">\n    121 S.Ct. at 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we fail to see how the lack of an FSLA exemption for orientation instructors determines whether Akhondi is a transportation worker for the purposes of the FAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding Akhondi to be a transportation worker for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and consequently, that the arbitration agreement is exempted from enforcement under the FAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   OEP's single point of error is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.Civ.Prac.&amp;Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 171.098(a)(1) (West 2011)(allowing interlocutory appeal of denial of motion to compel arbitration).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pilot Travel Centers, LLC v.

According to OEP, because Akhondi did not have a truck, he must lose on this factor. However, the\n    <em>\n     Lenz\n    </em>\n    factors are just that-factors-that were non-exclusive and gleaned from several earlier published opinions.

Moreover, the Department of Labor memo addresses \"office personnel\" and does not explicitly mention orientation instructors. OEP claimed that Akhondi was an office worker who could do all of his instruction in a simulator unit at the office. Akhondi testified that he taught the drivers in their trucks, and at times on the road. Some evidence supports the trial court's implied finding that Akhondi was more than just an office worker.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Several courts have held that the Section 1 exemption in the FAA does not render the arbitration agreement void, it merely precludes the FAA as the enforcement tool.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Valdes v.
