Gibson, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal involves the right of redemption after a tax sale. After the tax sale occurred, the original property owners purportedly conveyed their right of redemption to a third party through a contract of sale and quitclaim deed. The third party filed a motion to redeem the property. The trial court denied the motion to redeem, concluding that the third party did not meet the relevant statutory definition of a person entitled to redeem the property. For the following reasons, we affirm and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Eric and Regina Sills owned a home in Jackson, Tennessee. At a delinquent tax sale on March 10, 2016, the property was purchased by H &amp; W Development for $150,000, subject to the right of redemption. The tax sale was confirmed by decree of the court on March 31, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 22, 2016, Mr. and Mrs. Sills entered into a contract of sale with Thomas Hyde. The contract stated that Mr. and Mrs. Sills were the former owners of the property sold at the tax sale and that they desired to sell to Mr. Hyde for the sum of $48,500,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   any and all rights, if any, maintained by the Seller in and to the Property or any rights arising out of or relating to the aforementioned delinquent county tax sale of the Property, including but not limited to the right to redeem (ie. repurchase the property upon payment of back taxes, penalties, costs and interest) via Tenn. Code Annotated 67-5-2701 et seq [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In connection with the transaction, Mr. and Mrs. Sills executed a quitclaim deed to Mr. Hyde, which stated, \"It is the intent of the Grantor by this instrument to convey any and all rights that the Grantor may have arising from T.C.A. 67-5-2701 et seq. to the Grantee[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Hyde immediately filed a motion for redemption of the parcel and tendered the sum of $19,437.11 to the court, representing the taxes, interest, and other sums due and owing. Mr. Hyde asserted that he was entitled to redeem the property due to the fact that he had purchased the right of redemption after the tax sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a hearing, the trial court denied Mr. Hyde's motion to redeem the property based on Tennessee Code Annotated section 67-5-2701(a)(3)(C), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Person entitled to redeem\" means, with respect to a parcel, any interested person, as defined in this chapter, as of the date of the sale and the date the motion to redeem is filed[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The statutory scheme defines an interested person as one who owns an interest in a parcel.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-5-2502\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 67-5-2502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court found that Mr. Hyde was not an interested person as of the date of the sale. Considering the plain language of the statute, the trial court interpreted it to mean that a person\n   entitled to redeem must have owned an interest in the property on both dates. Accordingly, the court found that Mr. Hyde was not a \"person entitled to redeem\" within the meaning of the redemption statute. Mr. Hyde filed a motion to alter or amend, which the trial court denied, reiterating its prior conclusion that Mr. Hyde cannot exercise the statutory right to redeem the property because he did not possess an interest in the property on the date of the sale and therefore did not qualify as a person entitled to redeem the property. Mr. Hyde timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   First Tennessee Bank National Association subsequently filed a separate motion to redeem the property as the holder of a deed of trust secured by the property. The trial court declined to rule on First Tennessee's motion to redeem due to the pendency of this appeal. First Tennessee submitted and was permitted to file a brief on appeal as appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ISSUES PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Hyde argues that the trial court erred in concluding that Tennessee Code Annotated section 67-5-2701 requires one seeking to redeem property to qualify as an interested person on both the date of the tax sale and the date of the motion to redeem. First Tennessee argues that the trial court correctly interpreted the statute. For the following reasons, we affirm and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In other words, the person must have owned an interest in the parcel as of both dates, as the chancellor held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Hyde notes that the redemption statute was substantially amended and rewritten in recent years. He claims that, under the previous version of the statute, Tennessee courts held that the right of redemption is freely transferable by the delinquent taxpayer to third parties. Mr. Hyde suggests that the legislature had no intention of altering that practice when it amended and rewrote the redemption statute. He claims that the current version of the statute uses \"somewhat awkward and imprecise language\" to define a person entitled to redeem. However, according to Mr. Hyde, the statutory definition could reasonably be construed to include interested persons as of the date of the tax sale and also interested persons as of the date the motion to redeem, even if the person did not own an interest on both dates. Also, Mr. Hyde claims that a 2017 amendment to the redemption statute (not in effect at the time of the tax sale or the proceedings below) suggests that the right of redemption is still freely transferable and that the legislature \"did not understand its prior revisions to effectuate such a radical change in the alienability of the equity of redemption.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We do not deem it necessary or appropriate to delve into these sources cited by Mr. Hyde on appeal because we find the statutory language clear and unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Judicial construction of a statute will more likely hew to the General Assembly's expressed intent if the court approaches the statutory text believing that the General Assembly chose its words deliberately, and that the General Assembly meant what it said.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

According to the Tennessee Supreme Court, \"when the statutory language is unclear, we may consider, among other things, the broader statutory scheme, the history and purpose of the legislation, public policy, historical facts preceding or contemporaneous with the enactment of the statute, earlier versions of the statute, the caption of the act, and the legislative history of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Pickard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6953721\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/424/511/#p518\">\n    424 S.W.3d at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court acknowledged that \"a 'person entitled to redeem property' includes 'any interested person ... as of the date of the sale and the date the motion to redeem is filed.' \"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *2 (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-5-2701\">\n     Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 67-5-2701\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(3)(C) ). The Court found that the original owner was an interested person as of the date of the sale but \"lost this status\" by the time the motion to redeem was filed.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-5-2701\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-5-2701\">\n     at *3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Still, the Court found that the post-tax sale purchasers were persons entitled to redeem. Citing Tennessee cases predating the current version of the redemption statute, the Court concluded that a debtor has an absolute right to sell and dispose of the statutory right of redemption. So, the Court held that the original owner's conveyance was effective to transfer the right of redemption to the purchaser. We respectfully disagree with the reasoning in that case given that the Court relied on caselaw that predated the current statutory definition of a person entitled to redeem property.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-5-2701\">\n     Tenn.
