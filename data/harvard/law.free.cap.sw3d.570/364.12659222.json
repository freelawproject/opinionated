We deny Appellant's motion for rehearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a traditional summary judgment case arising from alleged non-payment of a credit card account. Appellant Robert G. Houle appeals the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Appellee, Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. (\"Capital One\"). We affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Houle entered into a credit card account agreement with Capital One in 1998. In 2014, Capital One filed its original petition in Justice Court, Precinct 3, Place 1 of El Paso County, and therein asserted causes of action against Houle for breach of contract and account stated. Capital One sought to recover $4007.72 from Houle on his account, which Capital One identified in its petition as \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\" Capital One also noted in its petition that Houle's account number had been redacted pursuant to Rule 21c(a)(2) and 508.2(a)(1)(B) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. TEX.R.CIV.P. 21c(a)(2) (Privacy Protection for Filed Documents), 508.2(a)(1)(B)(Debt Claim Cases, Petition, Contents, Credit Accounts). On July 31, 2015, the Justice Court entered final judgment in favor of Capital One and awarded it the principal sum of $4,007.72, without interest, and costs of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Houle appealed the Justice Court's judgment to County Court at Law Number 5 (the trial court), and Capital One filed a motion for summary judgment accompanied by a supporting brief. In support of its motion for summary judgment, Capital One presented evidence in the form of an affidavit executed by Diane Trittipoe, who averred that she is an employee of Capital One Services, LLC, an agent and affiliate of Plaintiff Capital One Bank that provides services to Capital One in relation to its credit card and banking practices. Trittipoe's responsibilities as a Litigation Support Representative provide her access to relevant Capital One systems and documents necessary for validation of the information and statements made in her affidavit. In her affidavit, Trittipoe states she has personal knowledge of the manner and method by which Capital One creates and maintains certain business books and records, including computer records of customer accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Trittipoe attached 183 pages of records to her affidavit as evidence of the applicable terms, conditions, and activity related to the credit card account \"ending in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX issued to [Robert G. Houle] by [Capital One.]\" Trittipoe does not represent that all records on the account are attached to her affidavit nor represents that the records she has produced include all records for a particular period of time. Although the account number on the statements has been redacted, Trittipoe states that the records are originals or are exact duplicates of the originals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The records include some, but not all, credit card account statements due in and between the months of February 2008 and June 2013. The records show that the annual percentage rate assessed on the account balance varied each month from a low of 13.43% to a high of 25.15%. The rate often changed from month to month, and rarely remained constant for more than two or more consecutive months. After Houle's account became delinquent, the annual percentage rate of 29.40% was applied to the account balance. The last account\n   statement for the period of May 11, 2013 to June 10, 2013, shows a previous balance of $3,832.72, payment and credits of $0.00, fees and interest charged in the sum of $175.00, and a new balance of $4,007.72, the sum which Capital One sought to recover in its suit. That statement also includes contact information for Capital One, a statement that Houle's account has been \"charged off,\" which is described as a status change from \"past due,\" as well as a notification that although Houle would remain responsible for paying the balance on the account, Capital One would no longer charge Houle past due, over limit, or membership fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response, Houle asserted that Capital One's motion for summary judgment should be denied because a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding \"the amount claimed by [Capital One],\" in part because the records attached to Trittipoe's affidavit did not contain a statement for the month of July 2010, and the interest rate on the account in June 2010 was shown to be 13.47% but had increased to 29.40% in August 2010. Houle also complained of Trittipoe's alleged lack of personal knowledge to support the affidavit as well as the state of the records attached to the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court granted final summary judgment in favor of Capital One. Houle appeals the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his sole issue on appeal, Houle contends the trial court erred in granting Appellee's motion for summary judgment. This contention is based on Houle's assertions that Capital One failed to properly authenticate its business records through Trittipoe, that the records were incomplete and contained conflicting inconsistencies, and that genuine issues of material fact exist in relation to the interest rate assessed and changes thereto as well as the amount owed on his Capital One account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review a summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valence Operating Company v.

Unlike his appellate complaint, in his response to Capital One's motion for summary judgment, Houle did not globally complain that the business records contain \"conflicting inconsistencies.\" To the extent that Houle's \"conflicting inconsistencies\" complaint may be deemed to stand independently of the complaints set out under the \"Inconsistent Records\" portion of his brief, we find it is not preserved for our consideration.

She is an employee of another company and simply claims to have 'personal knowledge of the manner and method by which Capital One created and maintains certain business book and record, including computer records of customer accounts.' She does not advise the court as to how she comes by that 'personal knowledge.' The Court should be suspicious of her affidavit because she claims: 'The attached records are the originals or exact duplicates of the originals.' She identifies the account as consisting of 16 'Xs.' According to the Defendant's Affidavit, his account number did not consist of 16 'Xs' but contained a series of arabic numerals. It is apparent from examining the documents attached as Plaintiff's Exhibit A-1 that information has been redacted from the original document and that these copies are not 'exact duplicates' which is the express language of Rule 902 (10), Texas Rules of Evidence for authentication by affidavit. The information set forth in the paragraph above has already noted that the records are not complete, and now there are not the originals or exact duplicates.

The essence of his complaint is that there is some reason to doubt whether Trittipoe's testimony regarding Capital One's record-keeping procedures was based on her personal knowledge because she is employed by a Capital One agent and affiliate rather than Capital One itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Trittipoe adequately demonstrates her competence to give the testimony she provided. She testified that her responsibilities as a Litigation Support Representative provide her access to all relevant systems and documents needed to validate the information she has supplied. Trittipoe also explained that her personal knowledge of the manner and method by which Capital One creates and maintains certain books and records, including computer records of customer accounts, arises from the scope of her responsibilities as a Litigation Support Representative. In that role, Trittipoe also declared that records of Houle's credit card account ending in \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\" were kept in the regular course of its business and that the account is the subject of this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The records are comprised of over 180 pages of documents that Trittipoe identifies as related to Houle's account with Capital One. Trittipoe identified the records as originals or exact duplicates of the originals and established them to be Capital One's business records containing statements of activity on Houle's account. The records reflect extensions of credit requested by Houle and extended by Capital One, payments made by Houle and other credits, fees and interest assessed on the account, installments due and owing,\n   and account balances owed. Trittipoe explained that the records contain the terms and conditions applicable to Houle's account, and also include the application Houle signed as well as copies of Houle's payments on the account. Trittipoe concludes her affidavit by stating, \"As of the date of this affidavit, the amount due and owing on the account is $4,007.72.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Contrary to Houle's suggestion, the rules of evidence do not require that the qualified witness who lays the predicate for the admission of business records be their creator or have personal knowledge of the contents of the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.R.EVID. 803(6), 902(10)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridges v.

Houle acknowledged that although he had disputes with Capital One regarding charges and credits to his account, Capital One later credited payment and refunded a late penalty. Houle also complained that Capital One had increased its interest rate in an arbitrary manner, specifically in July 2010 when he made a payment and Capital One purportedly doubled the \"interest rate,\" and without specifying, he asserted in a conclusory manner that the account is not true and correct and that he does not owe the amount Capital One claims is due. There is no evidence in the record from Houle or Capital One regarding payments made in July 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The evidence showed that Capital One and Houle entered into a credit card agreement, that Capital One issued a credit card to Houle, that Houle used the credit card to make purchases, and that Houle made payments on the account. Evidence of the card-member agreement was presented to the trial court through Trittipoe's affidavit. The agreement provides that Capital One would allow Houle to purchase goods and services with credit in exchange for payment. According to the terms of the agreement, Capital One would assess interest charges based on the application of the annual percentage rate, which varies as the index for the rate increases or decreases, and in the event of two late payments, the variable annual percentage rate would increase to an unspecified \"penalty annual percentage rate.\" The June 2010 statement having a July 2010 due date shows an annual percentage rate of 13.52%. Further, the record showed that Houle's account was past due for six consecutive months, from January 2013-June 2013, with an annual percentage rate of 29.40%, incurred past due and over limit fees, and was thereafter \"charged off,\" with a final balance of $4007.72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Based on the card-member agreement, Capital One's extension of credit on Houle's account, Houle's usage of the credit card and failure to pay on the account in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and Capital One's resulting damages, we conclude that Capital One satisfied each element of its breach of contract cause of action and, if necessary for the account-stated cause of action, conclude or reasonably infer that Houle agreed to pay a fixed amount equal to the purchases and cash advances he made, plus interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dulong,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8213151\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/261/890/#p893\">\n    261 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   894 ;\n   <em>\n    McFarland,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300826\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/293/759/#p762\">\n    293 S.W.3d at 763-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cases holding creditor could collect debt on account stated where, based on series of transactions reflected on account statements, creditor established that card holder agreed to full amount shown on statements and impliedly promised to pay indebtedness).

Taking Houle's affidavit as true, and indulging every reasonable inference and resolving any doubts in his favor, we conclude that Houle failed to satisfy his\n   burden of presenting evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9975564\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/690/546/#p548\">\n    690 S.W.2d at 548-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, with limited exceptions, Rule 21c requires that unless the inclusion of sensitive data is required by statute, court rule, or administrative regulation, a document containing sensitive data, including credit card numbers, may not be filed with the court unless that data is redacted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.R.CIV.P. 21c(a)(2), (b).

The redaction of Houle's credit cards account data from the records attached to Trittipoe's affidavit in compliance with Rule 21c does not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to any element of Capital One's breach of contract and account stated claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Capital One. Houle's sole issue on appeal is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Rule 902(10)(b) sets out a form affidavit to be used when introducing business records under Rule 803(6).
