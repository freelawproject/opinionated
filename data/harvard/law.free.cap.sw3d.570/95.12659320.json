Shortly thereafter, Hill filed a petition for declaratory judgment, seeking a declaration that \u00a7\u00a7 558.019 and 556.061 did not require him to serve a mandatory minimum term of 85% of his life sentences for first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer and requesting that the court order DOC to remove the 85% requirement from his sentences. Hill argued (1) that, at the time he committed his crimes, first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer did not constitute a \"dangerous felony\" subject to a requirement that the offender serve a mandatory minimum of 85% before becoming parole eligible and (2) that DOC could not apply a 2003 amendment to \u00a7 556.061, which specifically added \"assault of a law enforcement officer in the first degree\" to the definition of \"dangerous felony.\" In 2017, Hill filed an amended petition, reasserting his declaratory judgment request and arguing, in the alternative, for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that \"his trial counsel and the sentencing court, at the time of the pretrial plea offer and at the time of sentencing, believed that assault of a law enforcement officer in the first degree was not an eighty-five percent crime.\" After filing an answer to the amended petition, DOC moved for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court granted the request for judgment on the pleadings as it pertained to the declaratory judgment action and denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

First, he argues that the trial court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of DOC because he should not be required to serve 85% of his sentence for first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer. Second, he argues that the court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of DOC because applying this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Mann v. McSwain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407546\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/287/\">\n    526 S.W.3d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. 2017) (rejecting the very claim raised in Hill's first point on appeal) violates the doctrine of fundamental fairness in Hill's situation. And, finally, Hill argues that DOC was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law because there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Hill was misinformed about his parole eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Hill is required to serve at least 85% of his sentences.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hill committed his crimes in 2000. At that time, \u00a7 558.019.3, RSMo. Supp. 1998, provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [A]ny offender who has pleaded guilty to or has been found guilty of a dangerous felony as defined in section 556.061, RSMo., and is committed to the department of corrections shall be required to serve a minimum prison term of eighty-five percent of the sentence imposed by the court or until the offender attains seventy years of age, and has served at least forty percent of the sentence imposed, whichever occurs first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 556.061(8), RSMo. Supp. 1999, defined \"dangerous felony\" as \"the felonies of arson in the first degree,\n   <em>\n    assault in the first degree\n   </em>\n   , forcible rape, forcible sodomy, kidnapping, murder in the second degree and robbery in the first degree.\" (Emphasis added.) Hill was convicted on December 20, 2001, and he was sentenced on February 11, 2002. The legislature amended the definition of \"dangerous felony\" in 2003 to expressly include, among other crimes, \"assault of a law enforcement officer in the first degree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his first point, Hill argues that, because the definition of \"dangerous felony\" in \u00a7 556.061(8), RSMo. Supp. 1999, did not expressly include first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer, the provision of \u00a7 558.019.3, RSMo. 1998, requiring offenders convicted of \"dangerous felon[ies]\" to serve a minimum of 85% of their sentence before becoming parole eligible, cannot be applied to him. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We addressed this exact issue just last year in\n   <em>\n    Mann v. McSwain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407546\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/287/\">\n    526 S.W.3d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. 2017). In\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was convicted of first-degree assault on a law enforcement officer in 2002.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407546\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/287/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407546\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/287/\">\n    at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Board of Probation and Parole, after initially granting the defendant parole, rescinded its order before his release upon determining that first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer constituted a \"dangerous felony,\" requiring the defendant to serve 85% of his sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407546\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/287/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The defendant petitioned for a writ of mandamus in the circuit court, seeking to compel the Board to reinstate his parole release date; when the circuit court denied\n   the petition, the defendant appealed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407546\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/287/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This court determined that, contrary to the defendant's argument, \"assault of a law enforcement officer in the first degree constitutes a type of 'assault in the first degree,' and therefore [fell] within the statutory definition of 'dangerous felony' \" in the 1999 version of the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407546\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/287/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407546\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/287/\">\n    at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, under the holding in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   , Hill's claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Recognizing the negative implications of\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   on his claim, Hill argues that we should either reconsider\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   or find it distinguishable. We decline both invitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hill first argues that\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   was incorrectly decided insofar as it unnecessarily employed statutory interpretation where the plain language was clear. But the only application of statutory interpretation in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   was in the argument made by the defendant, when he argued that the 2003 amendment adding first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer\n   <em>\n    implied\n   </em>\n   that the offense was not previously included in the definition of \"dangerous felony.\" This court's analysis was merely responsive to that argument. This court rejected the defendant's argument, holding that (1) because first-degree assault was a lesser-included offense of first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer, a conviction for first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer necessarily included a determination of guilt of first-degree assault; (2) the legislative history of \u00a7 556.061 's definition of \"dangerous felony\" reflected the definition's application to\n   <em>\n    categories\n   </em>\n   of offenses rather than specifically designated offenses; and (3) the interpretation proposed by the defendant would lead to an absurd result wherein a person convicted of a more serious offense (first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer) would have no restrictions on parole eligibility while a person convicted of a less serious offense (first-degree assault) would be required to serve at least 85% of the sentence imposed. The reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   remains sound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Hill further argues that\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   failed to account for limiting language in the 2003 statutory amendments. Specifically, he argues that \"the 2003 amendments to Sections 556.061 and 558.019 require an 85% minimum term for sentences for assault of a law enforcement officer in the first degree '\n   <em>\n    occurring on or after August 28, 2003.\n   </em>\n   ' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the court in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   was not applying the current definition of \"dangerous felony\" retroactively; rather, the court in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   was relying on the definition in force at the time of the defendant's offenses, and it concluded that the defendant's offenses fell within that definition.\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407546\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/287/\">\n    526 S.W.3d at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292 n.5 (noting that \"[t]he Board has not argued on appeal that the 2003 amendment to \u00a7 556.061(8) applies to Mann, and we therefore need not address the issue\"). As such, \u00a7 558.019.9's limitation on the applicable scope of that section was irrelevant to the analysis. Thus, it is not surprising that the court in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   did not consider it. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   , we need not consider whether the current definition of \"dangerous felony\" may be applied to Hill's sentences, as Hill's offenses fall within the definition of \"dangerous felony\" applicable at the time\n   of their commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, Hill seeks to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   by arguing that, in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   , there was some awareness by those involved that the 85% rule would apply to the sentences at issue, while here, the record suggests that no one anticipated that Hill would be required to serve at least 85%. Assuming the truth of Hill's claim that no one involved in his criminal proceedings anticipated application of the 85% rule to his sentences, this fact is not determinative. Though, in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   , we referenced the prosecutor's assertion that the defendant would be subject to the 85% rule, we did not rely on that fact to reach our holding, and the awareness-or lack thereof-by those involved regarding application of the 85% rule does not change the outcome here. The sole question before this court is whether Hill's convictions for first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer fall within the definition of \"dangerous felony\" provided in \u00a7 556.061(8), RSMo. Supp. 1999. Our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   dictates that the answer to that question is yes. And whether anyone involved in Hill's criminal proceeding was aware of this fact is simply irrelevant to the question at hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because Hill's convictions for first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer fall within the applicable definition of \"dangerous felony,\" as we held in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   , DOC has properly determined that he is subject to the 85% rule, and the trial court did not err in granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of DOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Point I is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

But there are two flaws in Hill's argument. First and foremost,\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   did not change the law. Hill has not pointed to a single case interpreting the definition of \"dangerous felony,\" as it existed at the time of Hill's offenses, in a manner different from the interpretation applied in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

And the absence of such pre-existing and conflicting case law raises the second flaw in Hill's claim-he cannot demonstrate the reliance necessary to establish fundamental unfairness based on case law that does not exist. At best, Hill might be able to establish that individuals involved in his criminal matter relied on their\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   interpretation of \u00a7 556.061(8) that ultimately conflicted with this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   , but that is not the kind of reliance necessitating application of the fundamental fairness exception. Furthermore, that kind of reliance is not relevant to Hill's declaratory judgment action, wherein the sole question before the court was whether Hill's offenses properly subjected him to the 85% rule in \u00a7 558.019.3, RSMo. Supp. 1998.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, Point II is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

DOC argues that this claim is not cognizable in this appeal because it is a collateral attack on the validity of Hill's convictions and sentences and, therefore, a matter for the habeas action.
