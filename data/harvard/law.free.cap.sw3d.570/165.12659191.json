Ellis contends the motion court clearly erred in rejecting the claim that his plea counsel was ineffective for failing to inform him of the 85% minimum term on the second-degree murder charge. Upon review of the briefs and the record, we find no error and affirm the judgment. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided the parties with a Memorandum explaining the reasons for our decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AFFIRMED. Rule 84.16(b)\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
