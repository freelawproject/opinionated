WOMACK, Associate Justice <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"465\" href=\"#p465\" id=\"p465\">*465</a>A jury convicted Terrell Antonio Harrell of second-degree battery, aggravated robbery, kidnapping, theft of property, fraudulent use of a credit or debit card, and residential burglary. He was sentenced to an aggregate 360 months' imprisonment in the Arkansas Department of Correction. The Arkansas Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Harrell v.

Harrell now brings this <em>pro se</em> petition to reinvest jurisdiction in the trial court to consider a petition for writ of error coram nobis. He contends there was \"no recognition of petitioner at the time of this incident\"; that his fingerprints were not authenticated through the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS); that there were <em>Brady v.

State</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20Ark.%20145\">2018 Ark. 145</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656210\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/544/49/\">544 S.W.3d 49</extracted-citation>. A writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinarily rare remedy. <em>State v. Larimore</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1257798\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/341/397/#p406\">341 Ark. 397</extracted-citation>, 406, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1257798\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/341/397/#p406\">17 S.W.3d 87</extracted-citation>, 92 (2000). Coram nobis proceedings are attended by a strong presumption that the judgment of conviction is valid. <em>Green v.

The function of the writ is to secure relief from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact that would have prevented its rendition if it had been known to the circuit court and, through no negligence or fault of the defendant, was not brought forward before rendition of the judgment. <em>Carner v. State</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409374\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/535/634/\">2018 Ark. 20</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409374\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/535/634/\">535 S.W.3d 634</extracted-citation>. The petitioner has the burden of demonstrating a fundamental error of fact extrinsic to the record. <em>Roberts v.

State</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091207\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/403/38/\">2012 Ark. 177</extracted-citation>, at 5, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091207\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/403/38/\">403 S.W.3d 38</extracted-citation>, 43. A court is not required to accept the allegations in a petition for writ of error coram nobis at face value. <em>Jackson v. State</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381857\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/520/242/\">2017 Ark. 195</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381857\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/520/242/\">520 S.W.3d 242</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-8\">The majority of Harrell's coram nobis petition is made up of claims that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to prove to his guilt. Specifically, Harrell contends his fingerprints were not authenticated through AFIS as his own; the time period given for the offenses were \"very, very strange\"; the Walmart <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"466\" href=\"#p466\" id=\"p466\">*466</a>loss-prevention officer testified about a car instead of a truck; that the video was blurry; hearsay evidence was admitted; and the DNA from a cigarette butt alone could not be the only corroborating evidence. Challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence constitute a direct attack on the judgment and are not cognizable in a coram nobis proceeding. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381857\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/520/242/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Moreover, none of these claims are based on errors of fact extrinsic to the record. <em>See</em> <em>Howard</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091207\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/403/38/\">2012 Ark. 177</extracted-citation>, at 4, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091207\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/403/38/\">403 S.W.3d at 42</extracted-citation> (For the writ to issue following affirmance of a conviction and sentence, the petitioner must show a fundamental error of fact extrinsic to the record.).</p><p id=\"p-9\">Harrell alleges one cognizable coram nobis claim, arguing a <em>Brady</em> violation in which he claims there was \"concealment [and] destroying of evidence that was favorable to the defense.\" There are three elements of a <em>Brady</em> violation: (1) the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory or because it is impeaching; (2) the evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; (3) prejudice must have ensued. <em>Jackson v. State</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20Ark.%20227\">2018 Ark. 227</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656751\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/549/356/\">549 S.W.3d 356</extracted-citation>. When determining whether a <em>Brady</em> violation has occurred, the petitioner must first establish that the material was available to the State prior to trial and that the defense did not have it. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656751\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/549/356/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Harrell's claim of a <em>Brady</em> violation is made without any factual support and cannot be a ground for the writ. <em>Carner</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409374\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/535/634/\">2018 Ark. 20</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12409374\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/535/634/\">535 S.W.3d 634</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-10\">Petition denied.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
