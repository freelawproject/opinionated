In his sole point on appeal, Shores claims the trial court erred in admitting evidence that he had raped another person. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
