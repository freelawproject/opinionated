Fischer, Chief Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   General Credit Acceptance Company, LLC, (GCAC) filed a petition for a writ of prohibition barring the circuit court from taking any further action other than vacating the order granting class certification in whole or in part. The circuit court abused its discretion by certifying an overly broad class. The circuit court is directed to withdraw its certification of the class as presently defined because it includes large numbers of individual claims precluded by final deficiency judgments or estopped by their failure to disclose the claims in bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Further, the named plaintiff is not typical of the class because she voluntarily surrendered her vehicle and because GCAC has no deficiency judgment against her. Each class and subclass must have a representative whose claims are typical of the claims of members of that class and subclass. Either the class must be redefined to include only those for whom the named class representative is typical or a new or additional class representative must be named so each class or subclass has a representative whose claims are typical of the claims of the class. The preliminary writ is made permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Helena Weatherspoon defaulted on payments owed to Car Credit Acceptance Company pursuant to a consumer credit contract requiring her to make installment payments. Car Credit sent Weatherspoon notices informing her of the default and how to cure it. Weatherspoon did not cure the default. Car Credit assigned Weatherspoon's credit contract to GCAC. GCAC repossessed the vehicle, but Weatherspoon regained possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Weatherspoon defaulted again, and GCAC again notified her of the default and how to cure it. Weatherspoon did not cure the default and voluntarily surrendered her vehicle to GCAC. GCAC mailed a presale notice informing Weatherspoon her vehicle would be sold in compliance with the Missouri Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). GCAC sold the vehicle and mailed Weatherspoon a post-sale notice of her deficiency balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Weatherspoon filed the underlying class action \"on behalf of all other similarly situated Missouri consumers\" alleging GCAC, and its predecessors or successors, violated statutory notice requirements relating to the repossession and disposition of collateral and collected unlawful interest following default and repossession of the collateral.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weatherspoon alleged the\n   deficient notices caused her and all class members to suffer harm to their credit, character, and general reputation. Weatherspoon requested \"damages equal to the amount of any judgment wrongfully obtained by GCAC\" and \"a mandatory injunction compelling GCAC to return any money collected for deficiency judgments, time price differential, delinquency and collection charges from Plaintiff and the classes.\" She also requested statutory damages, an injunction preventing GCAC from collecting deficiency judgments from the class, and a declaration that GCAC's form right to cure, presale, and post-sale notices violate Missouri law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   GCAC introduced evidence of statistical sampling showing approximately 87 percent of potential class members' claims against GCAC were resolved by final deficiency judgments or were extinguished in bankruptcy. GCAC argued this evidence showed the proposed class was overbroad because the vast majority of potential class members' claims were resolved in prior judicial proceedings. GCAC has no deficiency judgment against Weatherspoon, and she did not declare bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The circuit court certified two classes and designated Weatherspoon as the sole class representative. The first class included \"all persons who are named as borrowers or buyers with a Missouri address on a loan or financing agreement with GCAC, assigned to GCAC or owned by GCAC; whose loan or financing agreement was secured by collateral; and who had the possession of their collateral taken by GCAC, voluntarily or involuntarily, from May 12, 2008 to present.\" The second class included \"all persons from Class 1 who had the possession of their collateral taken by GCAC involuntarily.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   GCAC filed a petition for permission to appeal the certification order pursuant to Rule 84.035. The court of appeals denied the petition. GCAC filed the underlying petition for a writ of prohibition asserting the circuit court abused its discretion by certifying the class. This Court issued a preliminary writ of prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction to issue original remedial writs.

The circuit court determined Weatherspoon's putative class satisfied Rule 52.08(b)(3), which provides certification is proper if \"the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   GCAC asserts the circuit court abused its discretion in certifying the class because individual issues predominate. As to liability, however, the class claims are based on an interpretation of the form UCC notices regarding the right to cure the default and rights to presale and post-sale notice of disposition of the collateral. A central aspect of Weatherspoon's putative class action is a determination of whether GCAC violated any statutory provisions governing its form UCC notices. Claims involving the interpretation of form contracts often present a \"classic case for treatment as a class action.\"\n   <em>\n    McKeage v.

The second class consists of individuals \"who had the possession of their collateral taken by GCAC involuntarily.\" Weatherspoon testified she voluntarily surrendered her vehicle to GCAC. Further, as the class representative, Weatherspoon requested \"damages equal to the amount of any judgment wrongfully obtained by GCAC\" and \"a mandatory injunction compelling GCAC to return any money collected for deficiency judgments, time price differential, delinquency and collection charges from Plaintiff and the classes.\" GCAC did not obtain a deficiency judgment against Weatherspoon. Weatherspoon's claim is not typical of the class because she was not injured by an involuntary repossession or by a deficiency judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The circuit court abused its discretion by certifying a class with Weatherspoon as the sole class representative because her claims are not typical of the class and she is not a member of the subclass. The circuit court is prohibited from certifying the class and subclass as presently defined. The court is not prohibited from considering whether Weatherspoon is typical of a redefined class, if a new class definition is proposed and meets the criteria set out in the rule and explained in this opinion, nor is it prohibited from appointing a new or additional class representative should one be proposed with claims typical of the class and who otherwise satisfies the criteria set out in the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The circuit court abused its discretion by certifying an overly broad class with a class representative whose claims are not typical of the class.
