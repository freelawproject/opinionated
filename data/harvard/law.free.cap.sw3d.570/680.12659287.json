We find no clear error because Daugherty failed to plead facts not refuted by the record warranting relief. Thus, no evidentiary hearing was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   An extended opinion would have no precedential value. The parties have been furnished with a memorandum for their information only, setting forth the reasons for this order pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
