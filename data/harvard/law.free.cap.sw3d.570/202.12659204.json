Gill raises one point on appeal, arguing the trial court erred in considering Exhibit KSM-18 and accompanying testimony in assessing damages, because they exceeded the scope of the pleadings and the prayer for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find that the trial court did not err. An extended opinion would have no precedential value. We have, however, provided a memorandum opinion only for use of the parties setting forth the reasons for the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Finding no error, we affirm the judgment pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    All references are to Missouri Supreme Court Rules (2018) unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
