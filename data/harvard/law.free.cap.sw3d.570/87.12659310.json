(\"Lobel\") appeals from a judgment confirming an arbitration award which found that Lobel could not elect to arbitrate its claim for a deficiency judgment once it chose to pursue that claim in court, and which referred Lobel's deficiency claim and Dan Bothel's (\"Bothel\") related counterclaim back to the trial court for disposition. Lobel argues that the trial court erred in confirming the arbitration award because the arbitrator exceeded her powers. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 10, 2014, Bothel purchased a car from Car Barn in Columbia, Missouri. On the same day, Bothel signed a Retail Installment Contract and Security Agreement (\"RICSA\") reflecting agreed upon terms to finance Bothel's purchase. The RICSA contained an arbitration provision. On the same date, Car Barn executed a provision on the last page of the RICSA assigning its rights to \"Lobel Financial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lobel repossessed Bothel's vehicle after Bothel allegedly breached the RICSA by failing to make required payments. Lobel thereafter sold Bothel's vehicle at a private sale, and received proceeds that were less than the amount Bothel owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 23, 2016, Lobel filed a petition\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against Bothel in the Saline County Circuit Court to collect the deficiency. On July 7, 2016, Bothel filed a motion to dismiss the petition, arguing that Lobel's failure to strictly comply with requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\") defeated Lobel's right to recover a deficiency as a matter of law. On the same day, Bothel also filed an answer and counterclaim which defended Lobel's claim for a deficiency judgment on the same basis raised in the motion to dismiss, and which asserted an affirmative claim for the recovery of statutory damages, attorney's fees, and punitive damages for Lobel's alleged violations of the UCC and of a statute addressing the calculation of interest. A few days later, Bothel filed an amended answer and counterclaim alleging individual and class complaints seeking damages, injunctive relief, and a declaratory judgment for Lobel's alleged violations of the UCC and of a statute addressing the calculation of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 26, 2016, Lobel filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings (\"Motion to Compel\") relying on the arbitration provision in the RICSA. In the Motion to Compel, Lobel asked the trial court \"to enforce the arbitration agreement between the parties,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     to compel arbitration of all pending claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and to stay\n   all proceedings in this action, including [Bothel's motion to dismiss], pending resolution of arbitration.\" (Emphasis added.) Lobel's Motion to Compel alleged \"this Court is not an appropriate forum for the resolution of [Lobel's] and [Bothel's] claims. This Court should stay this case and compel [Bothel] to arbitrate his claims and [Lobel's] deficiency claim per the Federal Arbitration Act and Section 435.355.1 RSMo.\" The trial court entered a judgment on December 31, 2016, granting Lobel's Motion to Compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Arbitration proceeded pursuant to the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). Lobel filed a Request for Arbitration Clause Construction, to which Bothel filed a response, and both parties filed replies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lobel alleged in its reply that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Lobel seeks to arbitrate ALL pending claims. As discussed above, it is undisputed and, in fact, admitted by Bothel that Lobel must plead compliance with the same UCC pre-sale notice statute that is the primary focus of Bothel's claims in order to recover on Lobel's deficiency claim. Contrary to Bothel's argument, his claims are not entirely independent of Lobel's claims and require reference to the contract. Clearly, these claims are related and are not independent of the contract, particularly when the existence and sufficiency of the pre-sale notice is a common and critical question of law in both claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lobel's reply further argued \"[h]ere, pending before the arbitrator are two interdependent and inextricably intertwined claims, Lobel's deficiency claim under the UCC and Bothel's claims for violation of the statutes, both of which depend upon whether the UCC pre-sale notice was sufficient.\" In addressing whether a moratorium imposed by the AAA on debt collection arbitration programs should be applied, Lobel argued that \"[a]pplication of the moratorium would result in an inefficient and bifurcated litigation of this matter, with Lobel's claim for deficiency balance being heard in the Saline County case, and Bothel's Counterclaim being heard in this proceeding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Among other things, Bothel argued in its responsive pleadings to Lobel's Request for Arbitration Clause Construction that Lobel was not entitled to choose arbitration after electing to file a court action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 3, 2017, the arbitrator conducted a telephonic hearing. On October 6, 2017, the arbitrator issued Order #2 which stated that the purpose for the October 3, 2017 hearing had been to allow the parties to orally present their positions on Lobel's Request for Arbitration Clause Construction. The arbitrator's order summarized the pleadings submitted by the parties for the arbitrator's consideration. The arbitrator ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"history\" id=\"p-19\">\n   Having reviewed and considered the RICSA, the filings submitted by the parties and the arguments made during the hearing, the Arbitrator finds that Lobel had the right to elect arbitration in connection with its deficiency claim against Bothel but chose instead to pursue that claim in court by filing suit in the Saline County, Missouri Associate Circuit Court. Under the terms of the RICSA, once Lobel chose to pursue its deficiency claim in court, Lobel no longer had the right to pursue the claim in arbitration.\n   <strong>\n    See\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Triarch Industries, Inc. v.

Lobel objected, and filed a competing motion to vacate the arbitration order. On January 22, 2018, the trial court entered its judgment (\"Judgment\") denying Lobel's motion to vacate the arbitration order, and granting Bothel's motion to lift its stay and to confirm the arbitration order. Specifically, the trial court ruled that \"the award of Arbitrator ..., Order #2 dated October 6, 2017, is\n   <strong>\n    CONFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   in all respects and that judgment be and is hereby entered in conformity therewith.\" The Judgment placed the disputes framed by Lobel's petition and Bothel's amended answer and counterclaim \"back on the Court's regular docket for further proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Lobel filed its notice of appeal on February 1, 2018. The trial court thereafter stayed further proceedings pending the disposition of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"An appeal may be taken from ...

Specifically, Lobel argues that the arbitrator exceeded her powers because the award \"did not draw its essence from the parties' arbitration agreement, did not enforce or apply the agreement including the class-action waiver, and did not construe or interpret the agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We address the latter contention first. It is uncontested that the arbitrator was charged with construing the parties' arbitration agreement. The arbitration agreement expressly provides that \"the validity, scope, and interpretation of the arbitration provision are to be decided by neutral, binding arbitration,\" and that \"[t]he arbitrator will decide any dispute regarding the arbitrability of a [c]laim.\" Consistent with these unambiguous provisions of the arbitration agreement, Lobel filed a request asking the arbitrator to construe the arbitration agreement. The arbitrator's award expressly did so, after the arbitrator heard arguments and considered the parties' written submissions. It is disingenuous for Lobel to argue that the arbitrator's award \"did not construe or interpret the [arbitration] agreement.\" Plainly, it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lobel nonetheless argues that the arbitrator exceeded her powers because in ruling on Lobel's Request for Arbitration Clause Construction, she ignored unambiguous provisions of the arbitration agreement which permitted Lobel \"to elect arbitration of Bothel's claims,\" [Appellant's Brief, p. 19], and which waived class-action relief for arbitrated claims. [Appellant's Brief, p. 27] Lobel argues that even though vacation of an arbitration award is not proper where an arbitrator even arguably construes an arbitration agreement, an arbitrator cannot be said to have construed an arbitration agreement if the arbitrator exceeds her powers by ignoring unambiguous provisions of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

This determination is consistent with the unambiguous language of the arbitration agreement. Lobel plainly had the right to \"elect to resolve [its deficiency claim] by neutral, binding arbitration and not by a court action.\" However, Lobel did not, in the first instance, elect arbitration to resolve its deficiency claim. It elected a court action. There is no provision in the arbitration agreement that permits Lobel to change its initial election.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    In fact, and to the contrary, although the arbitration agreement says the arbitration provision survives \"any legal proceeding by you or us to collect a debt owed by the other,\" it also unambiguously provides that an election to seek judicial relief will not be viewed as \"giving up the right to require arbitration\" in only two scenarios, neither of which apply to this case: where remedy is sought in small claims court, or where judicial provisional remedies are sought. And the arbitration agreement unambiguously provides that\"[i]f a party does not exercise the right to elect arbitration in connection with any particular Claim, that party still can require arbitration in connection with any\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      other\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    Claim.\" (Emphasis added.) The arbitrator did not exceed her powers by concluding, based on the unambiguous language of the arbitration agreement, that \"[u]nder the terms of the RICSA, once Lobel chose to pursue its deficiency claim in court, Lobel no longer had the right to pursue the deficiency claim in arbitration.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Lobel tacitly concedes this point. In the argument portion of its Brief, Lobel does not argue that it had the right to seek arbitration of its deficiency claim after electing to file that claim in a court. Instead, Lobel argues that it had the right to require Bothel to arbitrate his counterclaim and that the arbitrator's award disregarded this right. Of course, Lobel never sought to compel arbitration of only Bothel's counterclaim. Lobel's Motion to Compel asked the trial court to \"enforce the arbitration agreement between the parties, [and]\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      to compel arbitration of all pending claims\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\" and argued that the trial court \"is not an appropriate forum for the resolution of [Lobel's] and [Bothel's] claims,\" such that the trial court \"should stay this case and compel [Bothel] to arbitrate his claims and [Lobel's] deficiency claim.\" (Emphasis added.) The trial court afforded Lobel precisely the relief Lobel requested. In the arbitration proceedings, Lobel's written submissions to the arbitrator continued to demand arbitration of \"ALL pending claims.\" Lobel cannot complain that the arbitrator's award deprived it of the right to insist only on the arbitration of Bothel's counterclaim when Lobel never sought to enforce that alleged right.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In any event, Lobel's argument presumes that Lobel would have been entitled to compel arbitration of only Bothel's counterclaim. Though the arbitration agreement does provide that a decision\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      not\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    to elect arbitration of a claim will not foreclose a party from insisting on arbitration of \"any\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      other\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    Claim,\" Lobel urged the\n    arbitrator to construe Lobel's claim for deficiency and Bothel's counterclaim as \"not entirely independent,\" and as \"two interdependent and inextricably intertwined claims,\" the separation of which would result in \"inefficient and bifurcated litigation of this matter.\" In entering Order #2, the arbitrator obviously agreed with Lobel, as once the arbitrator determined that Lobel had waived its right to elect to arbitrate its deficiency claim, she referred the entire matter, including Bothel's \"interdependent and inextricably intertwined\" counterclaim, back to the trial court for disposition. The arbitration agreement describes a \"Claim\" as \"any claim, dispute or controversy between you and us ... arising from or relating to ... this Contract ... includ[ing] any Claim based on common ... law, contract, tort, statute, regulation, or other ground.\" As Lobel argued before the arbitrator, Lobel's right to recover a deficiency under the RICSA depended on its compliance with statutes Bothel argued had been violated, affording Bothel a right of recovery. The arbitrator did not exceed her powers by treating Lobel's claim and Bothel's counterclaim as a single integrated \"Claim\" as that term is defined by the arbitration agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Undeterred, Lobel attempts on appeal to differentiate between its claim to recover a deficiency and Bothel's counterclaim. It is true that once Lobel filed its deficiency claim in a court, the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure required Bothel to assert any corollary right to recover from Lobel in a separate compulsory counterclaim. However, the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure are of no relevance to construction of the arbitration agreement, as the arbitration agreement expressly provides that it is \"governed by the FAA to the exclusion of any different or inconsistent state or local law.\" The definition of \"Claim\" in the arbitration agreement includes no reference to differentiating claims based on whether they were required to be pled separately in a court action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The arbitrator did not exceed her powers in referring Lobel's claim and Bothel's counterclaim back to the trial court for disposition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Point denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The trial court's Judgment confirming the arbitrator's award, and denying Lobel's motion to vacate the award, is affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    All concur\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-70\">\n     After reaching this conclusion, the arbitrator's award cited to the Missouri Supreme Court's decision in\n     <em>\n      Triarch Industries, Inc. v. Crabtree\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9019916\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/158/772/\">\n      158 S.W.3d 772\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (Mo. banc 2005). Lobel argues that the arbitrator's reliance on\n     <em>\n      Triarch\n     </em>\n     was erroneous. We disagree. In\n     <em>\n      Triarch\n     </em>\n     , our Supreme Court noted the difference between the right to arbitrate as a matter of contract construction and waiver of the right to arbitrate based on principles of estoppel.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9019916\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/158/772/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9019916\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/158/772/\">\n      at 776-77\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (holding that judicially determined waiver of the right to arbitrate where a party knows of the right to arbitrate, and acts inconsistently with that right to the prejudice of the other party, is to be distinguished from whether an arbitration contract affords the right to compel arbitration in the first place). Here, the trial court's initial judgment compelling arbitration found that Lobel had not judicially waived its right to compel arbitration, even though it knew of the right and acted inconsistently with it, because Bothel was not prejudiced by Lobel's filing of a court action. The arbitrator's citation to\n     <em>\n      Triarch\n     </em>\n     after finding that Lobel did not have the contractual right to elect to arbitrate its deficiency claim signposted the arbitrator's recognition that her finding that Lobel no longer had the right to elect to arbitrate its deficiency claim based on the plain language of the RICSA was distinguishable from the trial court's determination that Lobel had not judicially waived the right to compel arbitration by first filing a court action.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
