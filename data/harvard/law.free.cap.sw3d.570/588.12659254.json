(\"K&amp;M\"), and CSMA BLT, LLC (\"CSMA\"). U.S. Bank cross-appeals the denial of its request for attorneys' fees. This appeal involves the validity of a real estate foreclosure sale. It involves similar facts and most of the same legal issues as those presented and decided in\n   <em>\n    Wesley v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. WD81408\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12659120\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/569/436/\">\n    569 S.W.3d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205913113\">\n    2018 WL 5913113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. Nov. 13, 2018). The analysis and result of that case controls the disposition of this one. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, the parties have been provided a memorandum. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
