In his sole point on appeal, Baldwin claims the trial court plainly erred in sentencing him as a class B felon when he was charged and convicted of a class C felony. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
