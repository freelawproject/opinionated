Because the charge against Seymour was filed more than three years after the discovery of his offense, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 3, 2014, the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Division of Workers' Compensation, Fraud and Noncompliance Unit (the \"Fraud and Noncompliance Unit\") received a referral, and began investigating Cale Seymour Construction, LLC (\"Company\") to determine whether it had failed to insure workers' compensation liability in violation of section 287.128.7. The Company was in the construction business. By law, it was required to maintain workers' compensation insurance at any time it had at least one employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Through database searches conducted on February 3, 2014, a Fraud and Noncompliance Unit investigator discovered that Seymour was the organizer of the Company; that the Company was formed on December 30, 2005; that the Company had workers' compensation insurance nearly continuously from the time it was formed until August 3, 2011; that the Company did not appear to have workers' compensation insurance from August 3, 2011 through October 3, 2013; that the Company did have workers' compensation insurance after October 3, 2013; and that between August 3, 2011 through October 3, 2013, the Company reported having one or more employees in some quarters, and no employees in other quarters though wage reports stated that wages were paid by the Company in all quarters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Fraud and Noncompliance Unit investigator did not undertake any other investigation until mid-May, 2014, when the investigator began attempting to reach Seymour by telephone. The investigator successfully contacted Seymour on May 19, 2014. During the recorded telephone call, Seymour admitted that he employed one or more employees during all quarters between August 3, 2011 and October 3, 2013, and that he knew the Company did not have workers' compensation insurance as required during that time frame. In the days that followed the May 19, 2014 telephone call with Seymour, the investigator unsuccessfully attempted to gather information from Seymour's insurance agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In mid-June, 2014, the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit prepared a probable cause statement and referred Seymour's alleged offense to the Attorney General's Office for prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 17, 2017, the State charged Seymour with failure to insure workers' compensation liability in violation of section 287.128.7. At a bench trial on February 27, 2018, the State presented the testimony of the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit investigator. The investigator described how investigations of this nature are undertaken; the steps taken during the investigation of Seymour; how his investigation of Seymour modeled the steps ordinarily taken in investigations of this nature; and the decision to refer the case to the Attorney General. On cross-examination, the investigator offered no explanation for the time that elapsed between the February 3, 2014 database searches and the attempts that began in mid-May, 2014 to contact Seymour, and acknowledged that no other steps were taken to investigate Seymour during the interim three month period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the close of the State's evidence, Seymour moved for a judgment of acquittal based upon the three-year statute of limitations set forth in section 287.128.11. Seymour argued that his offense was discovered as of February 3, 2014, and that the filing of charges more than three years later on May 17, 2017 was time-barred. The State argued that Seymour's offense was not discovered until May 19, 2014, and that the filing of charges on May 17, 2017 was not time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court granted Seymour's motion for judgment of acquittal, and dismissed the proceedings. In a written judgment dated February 28, 2018 (\"Judgment\"), the trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [A]fter considering the credibility of the testimony and evidence presented, [the Court] finds the discovery date of [Seymour's] alleged criminal conduct was February 3, 2014, that more than three (3) years elapsed before the filing of the State of Missouri's initial information and that in accordance with Section 287.128.11, this proceeding is now time barred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that [Seymour's] Motion for Judgment of Acquittal at the Close of the State of Missouri's Case is hereby granted.

Because section\n   287.128.7 requires a \"knowing\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   failure to insure workers' compensation liability, the State argues that Seymour's admissions were facts necessary to discover a referable offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Both parties' arguments presume that the definition of \"discovery of the offense\" announced in\n   <em>\n    Frese\n   </em>\n   contemplates the subjective, hindsight dissection of an investigation to pinpoint the precise moment when facts sufficient to refer a matter were first discovered.\n   <em>\n    Frese\n   </em>\n   cannot be fairly read in this manner.\n   <em>\n    Frese\n   </em>\n   explained that \" '[t]he primary rule of statutory interpretation is to effectuate legislative intent through reference to the plain and ordinary meaning of the statutory language.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801983\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/487/71/#p75\">\n    487 S.W.3d at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, the definition of \"discovery of the offense\" announced in\n   <em>\n    Frese\n   </em>\n   must be construed and applied in a manner that can be harmonized with the other provisions in Chapter 287.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Section 287.128.10 establishes the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit and renders it \"responsible for investigating incidences of fraud and failure to comply with the provisions of [Chapter 287].\" Section 287.128.8 provides that the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall investigate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   all complaints and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     present any finding of fraud or noncompliance\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to the director, who may refer the file to the attorney general.\" These provisions require the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit to conduct an investigation, but leave the scope and extent of the investigation to the Unit's discretion. And these provisions contemplate that at the conclusion of the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit's investigation, a determination will be made as to whether there is a finding of fraud or noncompliance that could be presented to the Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It would be inconsistent with the intent of these provisions to require a subjective, hindsight analysis of a Fraud and Noncompliance Unit investigation to determine the precise moment when sufficient facts were first discovered to permit referral to the Attorney General, or when (as is argued here), an investigation stopped yielding information not already known or suspected by the investigator. Construing\n   <em>\n    Frese's\n   </em>\n   definition of \"discovery of the offense\" in the subjective, hindsight manner argued by the parties would encourage incomplete investigations, and the premature referral of matters for prosecution, based solely on an investigator's concern that a tribunal might later conclude that the investigator learned enough to permit referral of an offense midway through an otherwise objectively reasonable investigation. In other words, a subjective, hindsight critique of an investigation would usurp the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit's statutory authority and directive to conduct an investigation sufficient to permit it to conclude whether there is a finding of fraud or noncompliance that should be referred to the Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Instead, to be harmonized with sections 287.128.8 and .10, the definition of \"discovery of the offense\" set forth in\n   <em>\n    Frese\n   </em>\n   necessarily refers to the entirety of an objectively\n   reasonable investigation conducted by the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit. So long as the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit has engaged in an investigation that is objectively reasonable in scope and time frame, then we are bound to conclude that it is engaging in the investigation it is required to undertake by law. And so long as an investigation is objectively reasonable, it cannot be said that the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit has discovered all the facts necessary for it to determine whether there is a finding of fraud or noncompliance that may be referred to the Attorney General for prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"The interpretation of a statute is a pure question of law, and [ ] we give the trial court's interpretation no deference.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. W.D. 2013). Here, the trial court found that the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit discovered Seymour's offense as of February 3, 2014. We do not know, however, whether the trial court did so based on the erroneous belief that the definition of \"discovery of the offense\" announced in\n   <em>\n    Frese\n   </em>\n   requires a subjective, hindsight analysis of when the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit first discovered facts that could have permitted a referral to the Attorney General.

There is no evidence to suggest, and Seymour does not contend, that the investigative steps taken after February 3, 2014 were not objectively reasonable. However, there was a period of over three months between the investigator's database searches on February 3, 2014, and the investigator's first attempt to contact Seymour in mid-May, 2014 when nothing whatsoever was done to further investigate Seymour. The investigator offered no explanation for this delay. The trial court could have concluded that even though the investigative efforts undertaken by the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit were objectively reasonable in scope, the time taken to complete the investigation was not objectively reasonable. As a result, the trial court could have concluded that the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit's objectively reasonable investigation ended after the February 3, 2014 data bank searches, and that as a result, the accrual period set forth in section 287.128.11 was triggered on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A similar conclusion was reached under analogous circumstances in\n   <em>\n    State v. Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6708777\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/2/155/\">\n    2 Ohio App.3d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20N.E.2d%201379\">\n    440 N.E.2d 1379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981). There, the court held that \"discovery of the offense\" of knowingly making a false statement in connection with securing state benefits occurred at the \"absolute latest within a reasonable period\" after the State's administrative agency began an investigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20N.E.2d%201379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20N.E.2d%201379\">\n    at 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court applied an objective standard to assess the scope and time frame of an investigation to determine when the agency should be deemed to have discovered an offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20N.E.2d%201379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court noted that particularly with respect to the time taken to conduct an investigation, the use of an objective standard prevents investigators from \"procrastinat[ing] with impunity when they\n   ha[ve] in their possession information or material which indicate[s]\" an offense may have been committed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20N.E.2d%201379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court found that a five month investigation that began with a database search was not objectively reasonable, and that charges later filed as a result of the investigation were time-barred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20N.E.2d%201379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in granting Seymour's motion for judgment of acquittal based on the statute of limitations in section 287.128.11. Although the scope of the Fraud and Noncompliance Unit's investigation was objectively reasonable in so far as the steps taken to investigate Seymour, the time taken to complete the investigation was not objectively reasonable given a delay of over three months when no investigative efforts were being pursued, despite a strong indication after the database searches on February 3, 2014 that a referable offense may have occurred. The Fraud and Noncompliance Unit's objectively reasonable investigation therefore ended on February 3, 2014. Since Seymour was charged with violating section 287.128.7 on May 17, 2017, prosecution of the charge was time-barred by section 287.128.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Point denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The trial court's Judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   All concur\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    All statutory references are to RSMo 2000, as supplemented through the offending period of August 2011 through October 2013, unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Employers required to carry workers' compensation insurance include any person or limited liability company with one or more employees in the construction industry who \"erect[s], demolish[es], alter[s], or repair[s] improvements.\" Section 287.030.1(1), (3).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    All rule references are to\n    <em>\n     Missouri Court Rules, Volume I-State, 2018\n    </em>\n    unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Both the United States Constitution and the Missouri Constitution provide individuals with protection from double jeopardy.
