Van Vacter argues that the judgment should be reversed because: the circuit court failed to make findings of fact she requested; the judgment is against the weight of evidence; the circuit court erroneously refused to reopen the evidence following the evidentiary hearing on her petition; the circuit court erroneously ordered Van Vacter to pay the fees of the Guardian\n   <em>\n    ad Litem\n   </em>\n   ; and the trial court erroneously disregarded the presumption that, as a natural parent, she is her daughter's proper custodian. We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided the parties an unpublished memorandum setting forth the reasons for this order. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
