Clark, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We granted review of this interlocutory appeal arising from a defamation action to address whether the Court of Appeals correctly determined that (1) a showing of malice cannot defeat the fair report privilege and (2) an assertion of the fair report privilege exempts the defendants from part of the protections of Tennessee Code Annotated section 24-1-208, Tennessee's news media shield law. With respect to the first issue, we conclude that neither actual nor express malice defeats the privilege; the only limitations on the fair report privilege are that a report of an official action or proceeding must be fair and accurate. With respect to the second issue, we conclude that the fair report privilege is a defense based upon a source of information that renders the source of the statements the plaintiff alleges to be defamatory unprotected by Tennessee's shield law. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on the separate grounds stated in this opinion and remand this case to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Not unlike a Faberg\u00e9 egg, this appeal presents a case within a case within this case. In 2014, the Office of the District Attorney General for the 20th Judicial District brought criminal charges against Nashville developer David Chase. On June 5, 2015, while the criminal charges were pending, Mr. Chase filed a complaint in federal court in which he alleged that members of Nashville law enforcement had violated his civil rights. District Attorney General Glenn Funk, the plaintiff in this appeal, ultimately decided to dismiss the criminal charges against Mr. Chase but conditioned the dismissal of the charges on Mr. Chase\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   dismissing his federal lawsuit. Mr. Chase complied with this condition. The criminal charges against him were then dismissed on July 1, 2015. However, on August 12, 2015, Mr. Chase filed a complaint in state court in which he alleged, among other claims, that members of Nashville law enforcement conspired to subject him to malicious prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his state court lawsuit, Mr. Chase did not bring any claims against Glenn Funk. However, on October 22, 2015, the defendants in Mr. Chase's state court lawsuit did file a sealed motion to compel Glenn Funk to testify about the deal he made with Mr. Chase before dismissing the criminal charges. The motion also discussed a $2,000,000 payment that public relations consultant Bill Fletcher requested\n   of Mr. Chase's father on behalf of an undisclosed source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 3, 2016, NewsChannel 5, a subsidiary of Scripps Media, Inc., broadcast a report about Mr. Chase's state court lawsuit that referred to the plaintiff's deal with Mr. Chase and the request from an undisclosed source for a $2,000,000 payment. On February 4, 2016, the plaintiff filed a complaint against Scripps Media, Inc. and NewsChannel 5's chief investigative reporter, Phil Williams, (collectively \"defendants\"), alleging that, in the February 3 news report, the defendants claimed the plaintiff solicited a $2,000,000 bribe and blackmailed Mr. Chase into dismissing his federal court lawsuit. The plaintiff accused the defendants of publishing libelous statements about him, structuring statements to create a defamatory implication, portraying him in a false light, and conspiring to commit these acts. That same evening, NewsChannel 5 broadcast a second news report about Mr. Chase's state court lawsuit. This second report expanded on the information discussed in the first news report and included portions of an interview with Mr. Chase. Three weeks later, on February 26, 2016, the plaintiff amended his complaint to include allegations of libel, defamation by implication, and portrayal in a false light about both the first and second news reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 14, 2016, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants claimed that the first news report fell entirely under the fair report privilege because the report was about pleadings and depositions filed in a judicial proceeding. The defendants argued that the allegedly defamatory sections of the second news report were either true or protected by United States Supreme Court precedent concerning the use of the word \"blackmail.\" They further proposed that the plaintiff \"would also not be able to prove any of the other elements of his libel and false light-invasion of privacy claims as to [the news reports], including a false and defamatory statement concerning Plaintiff, actual malice or damages to reputation, but those elements are not the basis of this Motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition to the motion for summary judgment, the defendants also filed a motion for a protective order on March 24, 2016, which they amended on April 8, 2016. In their motion, they asked the trial court to stay discovery until after it had decided the motion for summary judgment. They argued that the plaintiff did not need to receive the discovery he requested in order to respond to their motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff did not respond to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, but he did object to the motion for a protective order, arguing that the discovery was necessary because it would allow him to show that the defendants maliciously published the two news reports, which would defeat the fair report privilege. After hearing arguments, the trial court denied the defendants' motion for a protective order. Upon receiving the plaintiff's next set of interrogatories and requests for production, the defendants responded to a number of the discovery requests, but Scripps Media, Inc. objected to Interrogatories Nos. 4-5, 7-8, 10-14, 17-20, and 24 and Requests for Production Nos. 6, 8-16, 20, 22-25, and 33, and Mr. Williams objected to Interrogatories Nos. 4-5, 7-8, 10-14, 17-20, and 27 and Requests for Production\n   Nos. 4, 6, 7-14, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 31. Both objected on the grounds that the information is protected by Tennessee Code Annotated section 24-1-208(a), Tennessee's news media shield law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 14, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion to compel the defendants to respond to all of the discovery requests to which the defendants objected on the basis of the shield law. The plaintiff argued that the defendants are not protected by the shield law because, by relying upon the fair report privilege, they are asserting a defense based upon the source of their information, thereby triggering a statutory exception to the shield law's protections. The defendants responded that they are not asserting a defense based upon a source of information. The trial court postponed ruling on this motion to compel until the attorney who represented the defendants in Mr. Chase's state court case was deposed due to the possibility that the information uncovered during this deposition would render the motion moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 3, 2017, the plaintiff filed a supplemental motion to compel in which he argued that the attorney's testimony had not rendered his motion moot and reasserted that he needed the discovery to show the defendants' malice because malice would defeat the fair report privilege and because, regardless of the privilege, his status as a public official required him to show evidence of malice. The plaintiff also argued that the discovery he sought was relevant to determining whether the documents were \"public at the time of broadcast.\" Because the two news reports described depositions and pleadings that the parties in Mr. Chase's state court lawsuit had agreed were supposed to be filed under seal, the plaintiff claimed that it was unclear whether the fair report privilege even applies to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   There are some inconsistencies in the plaintiff's motion to compel regarding the type of information he believed would be sufficient to show malice and defeat the fair report privilege. The plaintiff stated that the requested discovery would aid him in showing that the defendants knew the two news reports were based upon false information. But to support this argument, he cited multiple cases indicating that a defamatory publication made with a desire to cause harm cannot be protected by the fair report privilege. As a result, it is unclear whether the plaintiff sought to discover that the defendants knew the news stories contained false allegations or that the defendants harbored a desire to harm him. The defendants responded that the desired discovery was not relevant because malice does not defeat the fair report privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 13, 2017, the trial court heard argument on the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery and held that, because a showing of malice can defeat the fair report privilege, the plaintiff should be allowed to discover information relating to malice. It also held that, because the fair report privilege was a defense based upon a source of information, the exception to the shield law applied. However, rather than holding that the shield law no longer protected the defendants, the trial court found that the exception only provided the plaintiff with the ability to compel responses to Interrogatories Nos. 7 and 8, which asked that the defendants describe all investigation they conducted regarding the two news reports, and to the corresponding Requests for Production.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court ordered the defendants to answer these interrogatories and disclose all of the\n   sources and documents that the defendants considered when investigating the two news reports. On February 13, 2017, the trial court incorporated its findings of fact and conclusions of law in a written order granting the plaintiff's motion to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants then applied for permission to bring an interlocutory appeal regarding the trial court's interpretation of the fair report privilege and also filed an appeal as of right from the trial court's interpretation of the shield law pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 24-1-208(c)(3). The plaintiff argued against the direct appeal and emphasized that the statutory provision for an appeal as of right did not apply in the defendants' circumstances. On March 13, 2017, the trial court found that the defendants were entitled to an appeal as of right under the shield law and that, regardless, the defendants were entitled to an interlocutory appeal on both issues. Thus, the trial court granted the defendants' interlocutory appeal \"upon the issue of whether malice is an element of the fair report privilege and upon the issue of whether the shield law requires disclosure of the Defendants['] source.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court of Appeals also granted the defendants' interlocutory appeal, consolidated the appeal with the defendants' direct appeal, and ultimately reversed the trial court's order granting the plaintiff's motion to compel. The Court of Appeals held (1) that the fair report privilege cannot be defeated by a showing of malice and (2) that, while an assertion of the fair report privilege triggers the statutory exception to the shield law, the defendants are only required to disclose the sources they identify as the basis for the reports. We granted the plaintiff's application for permission to appeal in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Protecting the first commodity are defamation lawsuits, which enable aggrieved individuals to seek redress from false statements of fact that impugn their reputations. In the 1966 case\n   <em>\n    Rosenblatt v. Baer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167317\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/75/#p92\">\n    383 U.S. 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 92,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167317\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/75/#p92\">\n    86 S.Ct. 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167317\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/75/#p92\">\n    15 L.Ed.2d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966) (Stewart, J., concurring), former United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart emphasized the importance of protecting individuals from reputational harm, noting that: \"The right of a man to the protection of his own reputation from unjustified invasion and wrongful hurt reflects no more than our basic concept of the essential dignity and worth of every human being-a concept at the root of any decent system of ordered liberty.\" The danger posed by defamation lawsuits is that, if unrestrained, these lawsuits may obstruct access to the second commodity, information. For this reason, courts have developed a variety of privileges that provide defenses to defamation claims even when the accused actually defamed the accuser.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 583 - 612 (1977). One of these privileges is at issue in this appeal, the fair report privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    1. The History of the Fair Report Privilege\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Common law has long provided that a person who repeats the defamatory statements made by another is also liable for defamation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   VI Matthew Bacon with Henry G.

In the context of defamation law, this desire to harm another has been referred to by a number of terms that courts have used interchangeably. These terms include malice, express malice, common law malice, and malice in fact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Novecon Ltd. v. Bulgarian-Am. Enter.

The defendants argue we should conclude that neither actual nor express malice defeats the privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We will consider first whether actual malice can defeat the fair report privilege.

The actual malice standard provides a carefully crafted restriction on defamation claims brought by public officials that takes into account a public official's interest in preventing the spread of defamatory statements and the argument that such officials merit reduced protections because they have assumed positions that expose them to public scrutiny. But the fair report privilege has long protected reports of judicial proceedings even if the report includes defamatory statements made in judicial proceedings and even when those reporting on the judicial proceedings knew the statements were false.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7 611 cmt. a (\"This privilege differs from the usual conditional privilege in that it affords protection even though the defamatory statement reported is known to be false.\"); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 611 cmt. a (same). This is because, when a statement is made in a judicial proceeding, the statement is worthy of public notice, not only as a result of the contents of the statement, but also because of the context in which the statement was made. If we were to now hold that a reporter's knowledge of a statement's falsity could defeat the fair report privilege, it would undermine the purposes of the privilege. It would lessen the public's opportunities to be \"apprised of what takes place in the proceedings without having been present,\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

For these reasons, we hold that a showing of actual malice cannot defeat the fair report privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We consider next the plaintiff's argument that we should adhere to the traditional approach to the fair report privilege and continue to apply the express malice limitation. As acknowledged, all of our prior decisions follow this approach. However, in light of the modern approach, we choose to reconsider the usefulness of the express malice limitation. The Court of Appeals has addressed this matter but, like its treatment of actual malice, has reached inconsistent conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burke v.

This argument resembles the reason that New Hampshire has provided for not adopting the modern approach: \"Allowing plaintiffs to try to establish common law malice, where appropriate, will guard\n   against abuse of the privilege and ensure that the privilege continues to be used as a shield, not a sword.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=929%20A.2d%20993\">\n    929 A.2d at 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree that the scenarios the plaintiff describes would be cause for concern. But, in such unusual circumstances, it is unlikely that the fair report privilege would apply. As explained in the Restatement (Second) of Torts section 611 comment c,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A person cannot confer this privilege upon himself by making the original defamatory publication himself and then reporting to other people what he had stated. This is true whether the original publication was privileged or not. Nor may he confer the privilege upon a third person, even a member of the communications media, by making the original statement under a collusive arrangement with that person for the purpose of conferring the privilege upon him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This provision prevents journalists from using the privilege as a sword rather than a shield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The plaintiff further argues that the express malice limitation is necessary to deter reporters from injuring others with fair and accurate reports of official actions or proceedings \"in this age of 'fake news' and increasing politically motivated news stories.\" Yet, in application, an express malice limitation on the privilege would do little to prevent the publication of defamatory statements made in an official proceeding. Consider the following hypothetical. Two reporters fairly and accurately report on a judicial proceeding and include defamatory statements made during the proceeding in their reports. One of the reporters happens to dislike the person about whom the defamatory statements were made and privately hopes that the republication of the defamatory statements will cause that person harm. Under the traditional approach to the fair report privilege, one of the reporters would be able to rely on the fair report privilege to defend against a defamation action but the other reporter would not. This result would neither advance the purposes of the fair report privilege nor protect the individuals about whom defamatory statements were made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Having weighed the arguments for and against the traditional and modern approach, we are persuaded that the modern approach better serves the purposes of the fair report privilege. Therefore, in keeping with our earlier decisions concerning defamation law, we adopt the approach of the Restatement (Second) of Torts section 611.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6943292\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/426/50/#p56\">\n    426 S.W.3d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 56 (Tenn. 2013) (adopting Restatement (Second) of Torts section 591 as governing the executive and administrative officers' privilege);\n   <em>\n    Simpson Strong-Tie Co. v.

We hold that neither express malice nor actual malice can defeat the fair report privilege. The privilege can only be defeated by showing that a report about an official action or proceeding was unfair or inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At this stage in the litigation, it is unclear whether the two news reports qualify as reports of an official action or proceeding for the purposes of the fair report privilege. According to the plaintiff, the defendants' news reports about the depositions and other pieces of discovery in Mr. Chase's state court lawsuit do not fall under the protections of the fair report privilege\n   because, at the time the reports were broadcast in February of 2016, the parties in Mr. Chase's state court lawsuit had signed a protective order agreeing that this information would be filed under seal. The plaintiff's assertion is muddied by the fact that, when the reports were broadcast, the court had not yet ruled on this protective order. At oral argument, the defendants asserted that the first report and part of the second do fall under the fair report privilege because the information contained in the relevant sections of the news reports had already been disclosed in the motion to compel the examination of Glenn Funk that was filed in Mr. Chase's state court lawsuit on October 22, 2015. However, the motion to compel states that the \"Motion and its Exhibits are filed under seal pending the Court's ruling on Non-Parties' assorted motions asserting confidentiality over certain materials and testimony cited herein.\" Thus, on remand, in addition to determining whether the reports were fair and accurate, the trial court will still have to determine whether the news reports concerned information that was obtained from an official action or proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

As with so many other legal rules, this rule is not universally applicable. In 1973, the Tennessee General Assembly enacted Tennessee Code Annotated section 24-1-208, Tennessee's news media shield law, to protect \"person[s] engaged in gathering information for publication or broadcast\" from being compelled to disclose \"before the general assembly or any Tennessee court, grand jury, agency, department, or commission any information or the source of any information procured for publication or broadcast.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in two statutorily specified circumstances, a party may still obtain such information or the source of such information. One of those circumstances occurs when the party has demonstrated \"by clear and convincing evidence that\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (A) There is probable cause to believe that the person from whom the information is sought has information which is clearly relevant to a specific probable violation of law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (B) The person has demonstrated that the information sought cannot reasonably be obtained by alternative means; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (C) The person has demonstrated a compelling and overriding public interest of the people of the state of Tennessee in the information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024-1-208\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 24-1-208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (2017). The other of those circumstances occurs when a \"defendant in a civil action for defamation asserts a defense based upon the source of [the allegedly defamatory] information.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024-1-208\">\n    Tenn.

No. 16-23 (June 21, 2016) (noting that the showing requirement of section 208(c) does\n   not apply to section 208(b) ). The questions presented to us concerning the shield law involve the latter of the two circumstances. Plaintiff asks whether the fair report privilege is a defense based upon the source of the allegedly defamatory information such that its assertion triggers the exception to the shield law provided in Tennessee Code Annotated section 24-1-208(b) and, if so, what does the exception entitle the plaintiff to discover. These are both issues of first impression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   According to the trial court's order granting permission for an interlocutory appeal, the plaintiff primarily seeks to discover evidence of malice in order to defeat the fair report privilege. As a result of our holding that neither actual nor express malice can defeat the fair report privilege, this discovery is not relevant to the plaintiff's defamation claims regarding any part of the first or second news report that is protected by the fair report privilege. However, the plaintiff asserts that, even if actual malice does not defeat the fair report privilege, he is still entitled to the requested discovery because, as a public official, at some point in this case, he must prove actual malice to prevail on his claims. The defendants argue that the defamation and false light claims for which actual malice is relevant are not at issue at this stage of the litigation. We are constrained to disagree with the defendants. Because the trial court has not yet ruled on the defendants' motion for summary judgment, this issue remains unresolved. In the absence of any ruling by the trial court, we find that, due to the plaintiff's status as a public official, actual malice remains relevant to this case, and the plaintiff's request for discovery of information regarding actual malice is an issue ripe for resolution in this appeal. Therefore, we will consider the substance of the questions presented concerning the exception to the shield law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   When answering these questions, we are bound by familiar principles of statutory interpretation.

By asserting the fair report privilege, the defendants are claiming that the allegedly defamatory information they published is privileged because the source of that information is an official action or proceeding. Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, we hold that the fair report privilege is a defense based upon the source of the allegedly defamatory information, and as such, the assertion of this defense triggers the exception to the shield law in Tennessee Code Annotated section 24-1-208(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The final issue for us to resolve is the scope of the exception. The plaintiff claims that the exception allows him to discover the source of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   information, regardless of whether the information was procured for publication or broadcast, and that this discovery includes \"documents or data\" in the defendants' possession. We do not interpret the exception so broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The exception provides that, when a source-based defense is asserted, the shield law does not apply \"with respect to the source of [such] allegedly defamatory information.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024-1-208\">\n    Tenn.

This language from section 208(b) limits the scope of the exception in the following ways: (1) the exception applies only to defamation cases; (2) the exception applies only if the defendant asserts a defense based on the source of information;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (3) the exception only allows the compelled disclosure of sources and not information; and (4) the exception specifies that the source that must be disclosed is only the source of the allegedly defamatory information-it does not apply to all of the sources of all of the information that a media defendant may have researched when preparing a news report. Thus, contrary to the plaintiff's assertions, the scope of the exception is far narrower than the scope of the shield law's protection.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024-1-208\">\n    Tenn.

For example, a source may be a person the reporter interviewed or a document the reporter read. But information is what the reporter learned from the interview or the document. Thus, the exception to the shield law allows a court to compel disclosure of the source of a media defendant's information-\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   media defendants know something; it does not authorize a court to compel media defendants to disclose the information the source provided.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024-1-208\">\n    Tenn.

A plaintiff may only obtain compelled disclosure of the \"information\" the media defendant acquired from the source by making the previously discussed three-part showing set out in another section of the shield law, Tennessee Code Annotated section 208(c)(2)(A)-(C). This portion of the statute provides that a plaintiff must demonstrate that the information is \"clearly relevant,\" that the information is not reasonably available from sources other than the media defendant, and that the people of Tennessee have a \"compelling and overriding public interest\" in learning the information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henderson v.
