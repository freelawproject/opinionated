Pendleton appeals a Buchanan County Circuit Court judgment dismissing a Rule 24.035 motion following his guilty plea to a class B felony charge of driving while intoxicated. He contends that the court failed to make sufficient findings and conclusions about alleged exceptions to the motion's untimely filing. We reverse and remand for the motion court to make specific findings of fact as to the circumstances beyond Mr. Pendleton's control allegedly resulting in an untimely filed Rule 24.035 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After Mr. Pendleton pleaded guilty in 2015 to the class B felony of driving while intoxicated, the Buchanan County Circuit Court sentenced him to five years' imprisonment. He was delivered to the Department of Corrections on October 5, 2015, which meant, in the absence of an appeal,\n   that his post-conviction motion was due no later than April 4, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Pendleton's Rule 24.035 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct the judgment or sentence was notarized on March 30, 2016, and he testified by deposition that he deposited the motion with sufficient first-class postage in a prison mailbox that day. The court clerk date stamped the motion as filed on April 6, 2016. Appointed counsel timely filed an amended motion under Rule 24.035, raising, among other matters, the claim that Mr. Pendleton's late filing of the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion fell within a recognized exception under\n   <em>\n    Dorris v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315872\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/360/260/\">\n    360 S.W.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2012), i.e., the late filing was caused by circumstances beyond Mr. Pendleton's control, the court misfiled the motion, or it should be deemed timely filed under the \"mailbox rule\" which had not yet been adopted in Missouri.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The motion court conducted an evidentiary hearing that mainly involved a substantive issue raised in the amended motion, but also included the testimony of Mr. Pendleton's wife about notes she had taken regarding the date on which he had purportedly mailed the motion. While the motion court kept the record open to receive additional evidence, it entered a judgment of dismissal before that evidence was presented, dismissing the Rule 24.035 motion as untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that judgment, the motion court recited the relevant dates, set forth the Rule 24.035 requirement, and concluded, \"As Movant filed the instant motion 182 days after such initial delivery it is untimely, and therefore must be dismisssed, this 11th day of July, 2017.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Pendleton filed an amended motion to reconsider dismissal or in the alternative a motion for amended judgment on July 19, 2017. This motion reiterated his arguments about the timeliness of a Rule 24.035 motion and its exceptions, with reference to the circumstances of his case, and further sought, under Rule 78.07(c), an amendment to the July 11, 2017, judgment to include additional findings of fact and conclusions of law on the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion's timeliness. According to the motion, because the \"judgment makes no findings on Movant's claim tha[t] exceptions apply, the Court of Appeals would necessarily be required to supply findings and conclusions by implication, which would constitute an improper\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   review.\" Mr. Pendleton's deposition transcript was attached to the motion. After setting aside the July 11, 2017, judgment, the motion court heard additional testimony on the Rule 24.035 amended motion during an August 11, 2017, hearing at which Mr. Pendleton's deposition was formally admitted into evidence. The motion court entered a judgment of dismissal on August 22, 2017, again with minimal findings and conclusions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Pendleton filed a motion to amend this judgment seeking specific findings\n   under Rule 78.07(c) on the applicability of the second and third\n   <em>\n    Dorris\n   </em>\n   exceptions and presenting arguments similar to those raised in the alternative motion filed in July 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion court did not rule on this motion, so it was deemed overruled ninety days later. Rule 78.06. Mr. Pendleton appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the sole point relied on, Mr. Pendleton argues that the motion court failed to make adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law with the degree of specificity required for meaningful appellate review under Rule 24.035(j).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Mr. Pendleton, the motion court simply found that the post-conviction motion was filed two days late and did not make any findings relating to his claim that the motion was late due to circumstances beyond his control or to misfiling by the court. The State argues, in part, that Mr. Pendleton waived this claim by failing to file a motion to amend the judgment under Rule 78.07(c). We disagree. As stated above, Mr. Pendleton filed a motion to amend under Rule 78.07(c) as to both the July 11 and August 22, 2017, judgments. Accordingly, we will address the point on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Our review of a motion court's disposition of a Rule 24.035 motion is circumscribed. Rule 24.035(k).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellate review of a motion court's dismissal of a post-conviction relief motion is limited to determining whether the findings and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous.

Because Mr. Pendleton did not file an appeal from the judgment or sentence that he sought to vacate, set aside, or correct, his motion was required to be filed within 180\n   days of the date he was delivered to Department of Corrections' custody. Rule 24.035(b). His motion was date stamped by the court clerk two days outside that period; thus his claim was subject to complete waiver unless he could prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his motion fell within a recognized exception to the time limits or that the court misfiled the motion.\n   <em>\n    Dorris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315872\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/360/260/\">\n    360 S.W.3d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its ruling on Mr. Pendleton's motion, the motion court did not make any findings of fact, other than setting forth the relevant dates, and simply concluded that the motion was \"untimely.\" The State contends, on the merits, that the motion court, by finding the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion untimely, rejected Mr. Pendleton's claim that it was untimely due to circumstances beyond his control. We disagree. \"[T]he rule that findings will be implied as consistent with the judgment has no application in post-conviction cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Haskett v.

App. W.D. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Here, the motion court did not address Mr. Pendleton's deposition testimony which alleged that he deposited the motion on the day it was notarized-March 30, 2016-with sufficient first-class postage, into a locked box on his floor where mail was collected and then taken to the prison mail room for delivery. Because the prison was located in the same city as the courthouse, he believed it would be delivered by the April 4, 2016, deadline. He did, however, acknowledge that the five days included a weekend and that he had experienced delays in the delivery and receipt of his mail due to staffing problems in the mail room. While he claimed in his amended Rule 24.035 motion that the court clerk may have misfiled the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion, Mr. Pendleton testified that he did not know what process was followed in the clerk's office. The amended motion also indicated that Mr. Pendleton would call the court clerk to testify \"that it is standard practice to scan and e-file the envelope containing a postconviction movant's Form 40.\" A scanned envelope is not included in the case file, and Mr. Pendleton has argued that this missing evidence could be proof of the court misfiling his motion. The court clerk did not testify during Mr. Pendleton's post-conviction relief hearing. The only other evidence about the date the motion was sent to the courthouse was presented through the post-conviction evidentiary hearing testimony of Mr. Pendleton's wife. The motion court also did not address this testimony. Mr. Pendleton's wife testified that she recorded in a notebook concerning Mr. Pendleton's case that he had mailed the motion on March 30, 2016. The State objected to the evidence as inadmissible hearsay, but the motion court overruled the objection. The notation was based on what Mr. Pendleton told her, and the document about which she testified during the hearing was a photocopy on which the month had apparently been cut off. Her testimony was not compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Yet, \" Rule 24.035 requires the motion court to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on all issues presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657346\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/464/#p468\">\n    554 S.W.3d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"While there is no precise formula to which findings of fact and conclusions of law must conform, they must address all of the issues raised and be sufficiently specific to allow for meaningful appellate review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657346\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/464/#p468\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657346\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/464/#p468\">\n    at 469-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App. W.D. 2010) (citations omitted). We believe that, under this definition, Mr. Pendleton's deposition testimony presented substantial evidence on the question of whether circumstances beyond his control were responsible for the late filing of his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Rule 24.035 motion. If true, the evidence has probative force on whether circumstances beyond Mr. Pendleton's control prevented him from timely filing his post-conviction relief motion. While the motion court may not have believed his testimony or may have found it insufficient in the absence of additional witnesses who could have been called to testify about staffing in the prison mail room or about the mail handling and filing practices in the courthouse, because the court issued no findings, we would have to speculate as to whether its ruling reflected a credibility or sufficiency determination, which has implications for the level of scrutiny we apply to its ruling. Because we are unable to determine whether the trial court's findings are clearly erroneous, given the lack of any findings on the exceptions to the timely filing rule, we grant this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Pendleton submitted substantial evidence relating to the alleged circumstances beyond his control that he contends delayed the filing of his Rule 24.035 motion. Accordingly, the motion court, because it\n   was requested to do so by means of a Rule 78.07(c) motion, was required to make specific findings of fact on this issue. Because it did not do so, we reverse and remand for the court to amend its judgment and make specific findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Cynthia Martin, P.J., and Victor Howard, J. concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The 180-day limitation period actually ended on April 2, 2016, but that was a Saturday.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Mr. Pendleton has not urged this Court on appeal to adopt and apply the \"mailbox rule\" in his case.
