Phillip argues the trial court erred in imposing the constructive trust because some of the trial court's factual findings were not supported by substantial evidence. Finding no prejudicial error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1996, Michael bought a home located at 1208 Ward Parkway in Blue Springs (\"Ward Parkway property\"). Michael bought the home so his brother, Phillip, would have a place to live. In 1999, Michael encountered legal problems, and conveyed the Ward Parkway property to other family members, with the expectation that they would hold title on his behalf. In 2001, those family members conveyed the Ward Parkway property to Phillip. In 2004, Phillip sold the Ward Parkway property for $77,854.46. Michael claimed the proceeds of the sale of the Ward Parkway property were being held by Phillip for Michael's benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2005, Michael decided to buy another home so Phillip would have a place to live. At an auction in April of 2005, Michael was the high bidder for a home located at 1003 NW B Street in Blue Springs (\"NW B Street property\"), for which he agreed to pay $108,000. Michael paid a $3,000 down-payment on the day of the auction. Between the date of the auction and closing, Michael amended the purchase contract to add Phillip as an additional buyer. At closing, the $77,854.46 sale proceeds from the Ward Parkway property were applied against the purchase price for the NW B Street property. In addition, $20,000 was paid from a joint account owned by Michael and Phillip. Phillip contributed the remaining balance of the purchase price. Title to the NW B Street property was conveyed to Michael and Phillip as joint tenants with rights of survivorship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Phillip lived at the NW B Street property. Phillip was responsible for maintaining homeowners' insurance for the property, and for paying real estate taxes on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unbeknownst to Michael, Phillip executed a quitclaim deed in 2012 transferring title to the NW B Street property to ASTI Corporation (\"ASTI\"). Phillip signed a quitclaim deed for himself and for Michael as Michael's purported power of attorney. In 2013, ASTI executed a quitclaim deed transferring title to the property back to Phillip. As a result, Michael's name was no longer on the title to the NW B Street Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early August 2016, Phillip borrowed $12,887.43 from Lyle Odo (\"Odo\") to pay back-due real estate taxes on the NW B Street property. In exchange, Odo recorded a deed of trust against the NW B Street property. As a result of this loan, a tax sale for the property was averted. Odo later learned that homeowners' insurance premiums were due and unpaid. Odo advanced $1,642 pursuant to the terms of the deed of trust to ensure that the NW B Street property remained insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2016, Phillip executed a beneficiary deed naming his girlfriend, Jennifer Gaulter (\"Gaulter\") the beneficiary grantee of the NW B Street property on Phillip's death. Gaulter was living with Phillip in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 1, 2016, Michael filed a petition seeking to quiet title in the NW B Street property or in the alternative, awarding him a first lien on the property to the extent of his interest in the property. Michael's lawsuit named Odo and Gaulter as additional defendants. Odo filed counterclaims and crossclaims asserting his right to collect the amounts loaned to Phillip, along with interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Two days before trial, a fire destroyed the home on the NW B Street property. The homeowners' insurer issued two checks in the total amount of $140,000. The\n   first, a check in the amount of $107,271.75, was made payable to Phillip and Odo. The second, a check in the amount of $32,728.25, was made payable to the City of Blue Springs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Michael secured an order requiring the check payable to Phillip and Odo to be deposited into the court registry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Michael thereafter filed an amended petition. The amended petition again sought to quiet title in the NW B Street property, but also asserted a right to share in the homeowners' insurance proceeds issued as a result of the fire loss, and sought to partition the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The dispute was set for trial to the court on January 10, 2018. Prior to trial, Gaulter was dismissed as a defendant, having disclaimed any interest in the NW B Street property. In addition, Odo dismissed his counterclaims and crossclaims, and was dismissed as a defendant, based on a settlement wherein he was paid $22,500 from the funds held in the court registry in exchange for release of his deed of trust. As a result of this settlement, $84,771.75 remained on deposit in the court registry, and $32,728.25 remained held by the City of Blue Springs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial, Phillip stipulated that the conveyance of the NW B Street Property to ASTI was void, and agreed Michael should be restored to title in the property as a joint tenant with right of survivorship. Other evidence was presented, and the case was taken under advisement. On March 2, 2018, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Michael and against Phillip (\"Judgment\"). The Judgment imposed a constructive trust in favor of Michael in the amount of 50% of the remaining homeowners' insurance proceeds, and ordered that the homeowners' insurance proceeds on deposit in the court registry and held by the City of Blue Springs be paid in equal shares to Michael and Phillip. The trial court ordered Michael's name restored to title for the NW B Street property; declared that no other person or entity had an interest in the property; and ordered a partition sale of the property with the net proceeds of sale to be divided equally between Michael and Phillip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Phillip timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"On review of a court-tried case, an appellate court will affirm the circuit court's judgment unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, it is against the weight of evidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Ivie v.

[FOF 13] The Judgment found that Phillip admitted that the NW B Street property should be sold by partition, with the proceeds divided between Michael and Phillip. [FOF 37] And the Judgment found that but for the fire which destroyed the home on the NW B Street property, the value of the property sold by partition would have been increased by the value of the home. [FOF 36] In addition to these express findings, we are required to consider issues as to which no specific findings were made to have been found in accordance with the result reached. Rule 73.01(c). Here, the Judgment acknowledged that Phillip disputed Michael's contention that Phillip was holding the proceeds of the sale of the Ward Parkway property for Michael's benefit. [FOF 7] The Judgment did not expressly resolve this dispute, though it noted those proceeds were applied to the purchase of the NW B Street property. In accordance with Rule 73.01(c), we assume that the trial court found that the proceeds of the sale of the Ward Parkway property should be attributed\n   to Michael, as that would be consistent with the result reached by the Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Phillip has not challenged any of these factual findings on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, these unchallenged factual findings constitute substantial evidence supporting the imposition of a constructive trust in favor of Michael awarding him 50% of the remaining homeowners' insurance proceeds on deposit in the court registry and held by the City of Blue Springs (a total of $58,749.65 as of the time of the Judgment). The evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that it would be unjust and unfair to permit Phillip to retain all of the homeowners' insurance proceeds where the majority of the funds used to acquire the NW B Street property came from the sale of a property Michael had paid for; where the NW B Street property was jointly titled in the name of Michael and Phillip at the time it was purchased; and where Phillip admitted that the NW B Street property, which original included the home destroyed by fire, should be sold by partition with the proceeds of sale evenly divided between Phillip and Michael.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It is thus immaterial whether the factual findings in paragraphs 10, 12 and 23 of the Judgment are \"completely unsupported by the evidence and the record.\" Though the Judgment's imposition of a constructive trust is furthered by the findings in paragraphs 10 and 12 of the Judgment, which attribute $3,000 and $10,000 of the purchase price for the NW B Street property to Michael, these findings are not essential to the Judgment's imposition of a constructive trust for the reasons explained, above. In addition, even if the trial court erroneously found in paragraph 23 of the Judgment that Michael's name was on the homeowners' policy at the time the NW B Street property was purchased, a constructive trust may be imposed on insurance proceeds following the destruction of co-owned property even though both owners are not designated as loss payees on the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Automobile and Casualty Underwriters v.

However, Phillip's point relied on does not identify paragraph 11, or the implication reasonably drawn from paragraph 11, as challenged factual findings on appeal.
