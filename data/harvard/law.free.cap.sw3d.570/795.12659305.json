The judicial power provides a check on the abuse of authority by other governmental branches. If the courts are to provide that check, they cannot be subservient to the other branches of government but must ferociously shield their ability to judge independently and fairly. This is the essence of our very existence; we owe the people of Texas no less than our unflinching insistence on a true tripartite government. It is the responsibility of this court to preserve this constitutional framework.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n    .... The judiciary may often be denominated as the \"third\" branch of government, but that does not mean it is third in importance; it is in reality one of three equal branches.

Further, article 102.011(a)(3) and (b) are not facially unconstitutional because of the information contained on the Office of Court Administration's website. Instead, as explained above, in order to pass muster under the Separation of Powers clause of the Texas Constitution, article 102.011(a)(3) and (b), or an interconnected statute, must direct that the funds collected from criminal defendants for the \"Summoning Witness/Mileage\" fee be expended for something that constitutes a legitimate criminal justice purpose. Here, the statute simply does not do that; it does not state where the funds collected for the \"Summoning Witness/Mileage\" fee are to be directed. Accordingly, the funds collected pursuant to article 102.011(a)(3) and (b) are deposited in the county's general fund or the State's general fund to be used for any legal purpose.\n    <em>\n     This\n    </em>\n    is what renders the statute unconstitutional.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    It may be helpful to look at the necessary inquiry that we must make in this case as a two-step process.
