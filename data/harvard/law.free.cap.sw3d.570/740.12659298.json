We conclude that it did not. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court and\n   render judgment dismissing the suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 31, 2012, Gloria Lozano underwent a TAH/BSO procedure address several uterine fibroids.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Ghulam Murtaza performed the surgery and he was assisted Dr. Rafael Arcone. Both are alleged to be employees or agents of Texas Tech. The surgery was performed at University Medical Center of El Paso. The record does not reflect the affiliation between the hospital and Texas Tech, nor the affiliation of all the persons who were in the surgical suite that day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lozano encountered persistent nerve pain following the procedure. Contending that the pain resulted from the misuse of surgical equipment, she served Texas Tech on March 20, 2013 with a formal notice of claim. She later filed suit alleging that during the surgery, employees or agents of Texas Tech caused nerve damage using a retractor or other surgical instruments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Texas Tech responded by filing a plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss, asserting that Lozano failed to serve her notice of claim letter within the six-month notice deadline under Texas law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lozano responded with an amended petition alleging that Texas Tech had actual notice of the claim which satisfies the statutory notice requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As proof of actual knowledge, Lozano relied on several entries in her medical records made during follow-up visits at a Texas Tech clinic. Because both sides agree that Texas Tech was not given timely formal written notice of the incident, we focus only on whether Lozano's medical records as maintained by Texas Tech provided \"actual notice\" of her claim within six-months from May 30, 2012. We describe those records in some detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lozano followed up in the Texas Tech OB/GYN clinic on June 14, 2012, two weeks after the surgery. A note in that medical record states that she was complaining of pain to the incision site. The physician at that time noted that it was \"normal post op discomfort.\" On June 28, 2012, almost a month post-surgery, Lozano again complained of pain at the incision site and in the inner-upper thigh area. The examining doctor, William Scragg, advised Lozano to wait another four weeks for the swelling to go down and suggested the pain might be due to \"positioning on [the] exam bed during surgery.\" Almost a month later, on July 23, 2012, Ms. Lozano continued to complain of pain over the\n   incision site that was intermittent and had a burning-like quality. On August 31, 2012, she saw Dr. Rafael Arcone in the clinic, the resident doctor who assisted in the surgery. We reproduce the \"History of Present Illness\" note from that visit with its several typographical errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   50 year old G6 P6, s/p supracervical hyst, cervical myomectomy, bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy and seprafilm placement on 5/31/12.

On that visit, Drs. Arcone and Scragg ordered a CT scan that showed no abnormalities at the incision site. The six-month deadline for notice ran on November 30, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 101.101(a) (West 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In a March 4, 2013 chart entry, Lozano asked for a copy of her medical record so that she could seek care elsewhere; she also mentioned a possible lawsuit. On that visit, the treating physician advised that the pain was most likely due to a nerve injury during the procedure, \"which is part of the risks of surgery for which she was consented for. [sic]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Texas Tech's plea to the jurisdiction contains the affidavit of its associate general counsel who states that after a thorough record search, and after inquiries to the appropriate offices, in the six-month period following the surgery Texas Tech found \"no notice, either actual or written, that Gloria Lozano was claiming [Texas Tech], or its employees were negligent as result of the surgery performed on May 31, 2012.\" In response to Texas Tech's plea to the jurisdiction, Lozano filed a copy of her medical records. She also filed her own affidavit, stating that in the first six-month period following the surgery, and during follow-up visits, Texas Tech physicians told her that the pain was from \"a nerve injury caused during the surgery on May 31, 2012.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court denied Texas Tech's plea and this interlocutory appeal follows.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.014(a)(8) (West Supp. 2017)(allowing interlocutory appeals from the granting or denial of plea to jurisdiction by a governmental entity)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    CONTROLLING LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Texas Tech and the state actors who work for it are generally immune from suit, other than for those few claims for which the Legislature waives immunity.\n   <em>\n    Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Dept. v.

To excuse lack of formal written notice, a claimant must establish that a governmental unit had actual notice of: \"(1) a death, injury, or property damage; (2) the governmental unit's alleged fault producing or contributing to the death, injury, or property damage; and (3) the identity of the parties involved.\"\n   <em>\n    Cathey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008337\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/900/339/#p341\">\n    900 S.W.2d at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That includes subjective awareness of its fault, as ultimately alleged by the claimant, in producing or contributing to the claimed injury. ... If a governmental unit is not subjectively aware of its fault, it does not have the same incentive to gather information that the statute is designed to provide, even when it would not be unreasonable to believe that the governmental unit was at fault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Texas Dept. of Crim.

By example, the police department in\n   <em>\n    City of Dallas v.

The first contends that the trial court erred in denying Texas Tech's plea based a lack of timely formal written notice. Lozano concedes that point, and we sustain the issue, but that only turns us to the contested issue of actual notice. In its second issue, Texas Tech contends Lozano failed to establish that it had actual notice of her claim. Even were it aware that Lozano had continuing complaints of pain, and even if that the pain could be from a nerve injury arising during the surgery, Texas Tech contends that it had no notice that any of its agents or employees committed any error contributing to the nerve injury. It alternatively contends that if any employee was aware of such error, Lozano has failed to show that the employee was in a position to report the incident or initiate an investigation. Conversely, Lozano contends the written entries into the medical record\n   amply demonstrate that responsible Texas Tech employees were aware that a surgical error resulted in her injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    SUBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF FAULT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Texas Tech first urges that Lozano has failed to show that Texas Tech was aware of an error resulting in a bad result, as distinct from just a bad result. The August and November medical records contain a note stating that Lucero had a possible nerve injury from the procedure. But the records do not state that the nerve injury arose from the misuse of surgical instrument by a Texas Tech agent or employee, or even that it was caused by an error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As a part of its argument, Texas Tech contends that nerve injuries are a recognized complication of the TAH/BSO procedure. For proof of that proposition, it cites us to the informed consent documents that Lozano signed. Those consent forms are in Spanish and neither party produced a translation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.R.EVID. 1009 (setting out procedure for admitting translation of document in a foreign language). It is not our duty to translate documents for litigants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sartor v. Bolinger,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2173042\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tex/59/411/#p413\">\n    59 Tex. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413 (1883) ;\n   <em>\n    Lacoma v.

We think this maxim particularly true of technical documents, such as a medical informed consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But even setting aside the informed consent documents, we find nothing in the medical record showing that the nerve injury resulted from an error by a Texas Tech agent or employee. That proof is necessary to put Texas Tech on notice of its fault, as distinct from a bad outcome. A chart entry by Dr. Scragg on June 28, 2012, suggested that the pain might be due to \"positioning on [the] exam bed during surgery.\" Yet the procedure was performed at University Medical Center, and any positioning error could just as easily have been attributable to a non-Texas Tech employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston v. Cheatham\n   </em>\n   , 14-14-00628-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203878111\">\n    2015 WL 3878111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] June 23, 2015, no pet.)(mem. op.) (medical record showing needle left in patient failed to prove actual notice when the nurses for a non-governmental hospital could have equally been at fault).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Otherwise, the Texas Tech medical records only state that Lozano had a nerve injury that occurred during the surgery. Without an indication of why the injury occurred, Texas Tech was not subjectively aware of a possible claim. We contrast our record with the facts from the Texas Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Arancibia.\n   </em>\n   Arancibia underwent a hernia surgery, performed by two resident doctors, under the supervision of an attending physician, Dr. Watson.\n   <em>\n    Arancibia\n   </em>\n   , 324 S.W.3d at 549. Two days later, she presented at the Emergency Room with abdominal pain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 546. An emergency surgery at that time showed that her bowel was perforated, leading to peritonitis, and her eventual death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The day after her death, Dr. Watson emailed his immediate supervisor to give him a \"heads up on a terrible outcome\" with a patient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 549. Watson surmised that the bowel perforation resulted from a retraction injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He specifically stated, \"I have already spoken with risk [management].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Chair of Department was notified the same day, who acknowledged that he had \"heard about\" the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although Dr. Watson claimed the error did not violate the standard of care, he conceded that \"[a] technical error occurred during the original hernia operation resulting in a through-and-through small bowel injury\" and that \"[c]linical management contributed to\" the patient's death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The\n   court found the record demonstrated the governmental entity's actual awareness of fault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 549.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Conversely, where the medical record only reflects a bad result, no inference of fault arises.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McQueen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6944089\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/431/750/#p754\">\n    431 S.W.3d at 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (notation in record of \"bowel injury during hysterectomy\" was insufficient to prove notice when no physician spoke with or notified risk management, any supervisor or department chair);\n   <em>\n    Univ. of N.

(\"Nonetheless, neither UNT Health's medical records nor the appellate record as a whole demonstrates that a perforated esophagus necessarily-or even most likely-must result from medical error.\"). We similarly conclude that the medical record here only demonstrates a bad result, and not proof of any fault by Texas Tech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Lozano counters that\n   <em>\n    Arancibia\n   </em>\n   also stands for the proposition that a governmental unit is on actual notice when there is a bad result and the governmental entity is the sole instrumentality of potential harm.\n   <em>\n    Arancibia\n   </em>\n   , 324 S.W.3d at 550. That conclusion was clear in\n   <em>\n    Arancibia\n   </em>\n   because the record showed the patient's bowel was perforated, and the only persons operating on the patient were the government surgeons. As we noted above, the record in\n   <em>\n    Arancibia\n   </em>\n   also included several other potential acknowledgments of fault by the entities' representatives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 549 (notice to risk management, acknowledgment of technical and clinical management errors).
