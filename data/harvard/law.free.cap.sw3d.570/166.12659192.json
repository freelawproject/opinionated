In its sole point on appeal, Harley-Davidson argues that the Commission erred in its award because Barnett presented insufficient competent evidence to support a finding that an occupational exposure was the prevailing factor in causing his medical condition and disability. Because there was sufficient competent evidence in the record as a whole to support the Commission's finding of medical causation, we affirm the Commission's award. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
