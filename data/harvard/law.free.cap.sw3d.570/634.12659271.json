In his sole point on appeal, he claims the trial court erred in admitting DNA test results into evidence. Mostafa asserts that DNA results were fruit of the poisonous tree. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
