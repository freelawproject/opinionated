The question before us is whether the homeowner presented some evidence supporting one or more of his asserted affirmative defenses. We conclude that he did not, and we affirm the judgment below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant facts, all derived from the summary judgment record, are easily stated. On April 6, 2006, Patrick King Mulvey, Jr. (Mulvey) borrowed $126,400.00 from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo) through a Texas home equity loan. Mulvey promised to repay the note in monthly installments. In conjunction with the note, Mulvey executed a Texas Home Equity Security Instrument (\"deed of trust\") that granted a security interest in the real property located at 11260 Signal Ridge Drive in El Paso, Texas. The note and deed of trust were assigned to Appellee U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee for SASCO Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-WF2 (hereinafter \"U.S. Bank\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At some point, Mulvey fell behind on payments, and on November 21, 2008, Wells Fargo entered into a Loan Modification Agreement with Mulvey. That modification agreement adjusted the monthly payments and set a new payment schedule. The modification agreement also capitalized $9,983.47 of interest into the loan, making the new principal balance $132,413.36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2009, Mulvey again fell behind on his monthly payments. Wells Fargo, acting as the mortgage servicer, hired a law firm to initiate foreclosure proceedings on behalf of U.S. Bank. In a notice letter dated October 20, 2010, the law firm gave Mulvey written notice of a default and intent to accelerate. On November 22, 2010, the law firm sent Mulvey a notice of acceleration. Under the bank's records, Mulvey did not make the July 1, 2009 payment, nor any payment thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   U.S. Bank filed suit in November 2014 seeking title, possession, and foreclosure of the property under the deed of trust. U.S. Bank claimed that right as the mortgagee, and holder of the note and deed of trust on the property. It did not seek any amount due under the note. Mulvey responded to the suit by filing a general denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In June 2015, U.S. Bank filed a traditional motion for summary judgment. It attached the note, the deed of trust, the 2011 notice of default/intent to accelerate and the notice of acceleration, as well as various payment ledgers which purport to show the unpaid installments. The motion was also supported by the affidavit of Rodney Young, Vice President for Loan Documentation at Well Fargo, who attested to the authenticity of the attached loan documents, notices, and records. He also swore to default and the amount due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response, Mulvey filed an \"Amended Answer\" to the summary judgment. Germane\n   to this appeal, it contains Mulvey's affidavit which in relevant part claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2006 I obtained a home equity loan through Wells Fargo. In December 2008 I entered into a modification agreement with Wells Fargo concerning my home equity loan. Wells Fargo advanced additional monies to me with the modification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I made several payments to Wells Fargo after the loan modification. I tried to make a payment at the Wells Fargo Bank around July or August, 2009 but they refused the payment stating, 'I was in Active Foreclosure' and that I had to contact the servicing department at Wells Fargo. When I did contact them I was informed that I no longer qualified for the mortgage and that was all I was told. Any delinquency on my part was due to Wells Fargo not accepting the payments and\\or telling me what to do next except that I needed to complete additional paper work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   After several years of trying to work with Wells Fargo, I was told they had me sign an Illegal Document with Illegal terms associated with that document in the State of Texas, at the time. This Illegal document is why I 'did not qualify' for the loan modification. On many occasions while talking with the various Wells Fargo's personnel, they requested that I complete a form for another Loan Modification. I did not complete the forms knowing that they were Illegal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court granted U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment. The court's judgment orders that Mulvey pay the entire sum owed under the note within thirty days, or failing that, the property is to be sold and the proceeds, less the fee for conducting the sale, is to be applied to the balance owed on the note. Mulvey was not responsible, however, for any deficiency following the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mulvey filed a motion for new trial that re-urged two of his affirmative defenses: (1) he was not in default because Wells Fargo refused to accept his monthly payments; and (2) Wells Fargo insisted on Mulvey entering into an illegal agreement. U.S. Bank filed a response to the motion for new trial, that attached a new affidavit from Ashely Dellinger, Vice President of Loan Documentation for Wells Fargo. She recounts all the same facts as Rodney Young's earlier affidavit. Her affidavit also adds, however, additional history of the loan, including that another \"Notice of Default and Intent to Accelerate\" was sent around June 7, 2009, as well as a Notice of Acceleration dated July 27, 2009. Her affidavit references some seventeen attachments, none of which are included in the appellate record. The motion for new trial was overruled by operation of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This appeal follows. In a single issue, Mulvey contends that he raised some evidence in support of several affirmative defenses to any default under the note, and U.S. Bank did not conclusively disprove those defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We review a trial court's decision to grant summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Travelers Ins.

At several junctures in the briefing, both parties state that the non-movant carries the burden to conclusively prove an affirmative defense.

He appears to have combined into a single pleading an \"amended answer\" and response to the motion for summary judgment, a practice we neither condone nor encourage. But even assuming that Mulvey did not amend his answer to assert affirmative defenses, U.S. Bank had two options: it could object that the affirmative defenses had not been properly pled, or it could respond on the merits and try the issue by consent.\n   <em>\n    Via Net v.

The substance of his argument is that he asserted and presented some evidence of at least one affirmative defense that raises a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment. His affirmative defenses alleged that: (1) U.S. Bank's suit was barred by limitations; (2) Wells Fargo insisted on Mulvey signing \"illegal\" paperwork, which appears to mean that Wells Fargo improperly advanced additional money when it modified the loan; and (3) any default was based on Wells Fargo refusing to accept tendered payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Limitations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The sale of real property under a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust that creates a real property lien must be made not later than four years after the day the cause of action accrues.

However, it is not for a lay witness to decide illegality, and we are not required to simply accept the assertion of such in Mulvey's affidavit.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Keller v.

Because this was a home equity loan involving homestead property, the loan must have conformed to the requirements for such loans as set out in the Texas Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.Const. art. XVI, \u00a7 50. Section 50(c) provides that no mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the homestead shall ever be valid unless it secures a debt \"described by this section.\" Tex.Const. art. XVI, \u00a7 50 (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The loan modification here actually increased the principle due under the note because it capitalized $9,983.47 of interest into the loan, and thus raised the loan's principal balance from $126,400.00 to $132,413.36. Mulvey essentially claims that capitalizing past due interest into the principal of the loan constitutes a new extension of credit, which would then require the loan modification to meet the technical qualifications for home equity loans under section 50 of Article XVI of the Texas Constitution. However, the Texas Supreme Court rejected a similar claim in\n   <em>\n    Sims v. Carrington Mortg.

The court then further defined what was not an additional extension of credit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [T]he restructuring of a home equity loan that, as in the context from which the question arises, involves capitalization of past-due amounts owed under the terms of the initial loan and a lowering of the interest rate and the amount of installment payments, but does not involve the satisfaction or replacement of the original note, an advancement of new funds, or an increase in the obligations created by the original note, is not a new extension of credit that must meet the requirements of Section 50.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914444\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/10/#p15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914444\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/10/#p15\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, the loan modification agreement specifically stated that the original note and mortgage would \"remain unchanged\" and bound both parties except as specifically amended. Mulvey's response to the summary judgment complained only that the interest was capitalized into the loan modification agreement. He asserts no other reason why the loan modification constitutes an additional extension of credit. But\n   the\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   court characterized recapitalization of interest as a \"mechanism for deferring payment of obligations already owed in a way that allows the borrower to retain his home.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914444\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/10/#p15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914444\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/10/#p15\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based solely on the only argument that Mulvey raised, his summary judgment proofs did not raise an illegality defense under the Texas Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mulvey accordingly failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on his illegality defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Denial of Tender\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Mulvey's response to the summary judgment alleged that he \"was not past due on his payments.\" His response alleged that he attempted to \"make payments to Wells Fargo for a number of months in 2009\" but Wells Fargo \"refused the payments.\" He also alleged that Wells Fargo failed to notify him that payments were to be made to another entity and that the account became delinquent because of Wells Fargo's acts. His pleading then incorporates his affidavit, in which he swears that \"around July or August of 2009\" Mulvey tried to make a payment at a Wells Fargo Bank but it was refused. The stated basis for the refusal was that he was in active foreclosure and no longer qualified for the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Mulvey's brief refers to this a \"confession and avoidance\" defense. Confession and avoidance is \"a plea in which a defendant admits allegations but pleads additional facts that deprive the admitted facts of an adverse legal effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Zorrilla v.

What Mulvey really alleges is a breach of the agreement by U.S. Bank's agent, Wells Fargo. Assuming proper tender, Wells Fargo could not refuse payment, and then declare the note in default. In several contexts, court have recognized wrongful refusal of a proper tender as a potential defensive issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guaranty Bank v.

First, it notes that the statute of frauds precludes any of the oral statements referenced in Mulvey's affidavit from varying the terms of the note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Modifications to mortgages that exceed $50,000 are subject to the statute of frauds.

To the extent that Mulvey claims Wells Fargo orally lead him to believe that he did not need to make his payments, those alleged statement are barred by the statute of frauds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   U.S. Bank also responds that Mulvey failed to show that he made a proper tender. We agree. A tender is an unconditional offer by a debtor or obligor to pay another, in current coin of the realm, a sum not less in amount than that due on a specified debt or obligation.\n   <em>\n    Baucum v.

The note required payments be made on the first day of each month at \"P.O. BOX 17339, BALTIMORE, MD 21297-4339 or at a different place if required by the Note Holder.\" Mulvey swore that sometime in July or August of 2009 he tried to tender \"a payment at the Wells Fargo Bank[.]\" He never established that the physical bank location was allowed or required by note holder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Second, Mulvey swore that he tried to make\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   monthly payment around July or August of 2009 (though the payment was due on the 1st of July). He does not claim to have made tender of any additional monthly payments, nor does his response or briefing explain how a refusal to accept that single payment excused his performance for all the subsequent payments. U.S. Bank's summary judgment was premised on a default of all the payments from July 1, 2009 through November 22, 2010 when the note was accelerated. Mulvey does not show that the improper refusal of a single payment excused all the subsequent payments not made under the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In summary, we overrule Mulvey's single issue and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    We do note that the monthly payment under the modification agreement differed from that in the original note ($1,176.32 verse $1,104.59). It was impossible to tell from Mulvey's affidavit or his summary judgment proofs if the increased monthly obligation was based only on the modification agreement or from some other reason. The original note allowed that the monthly payment might fluctuate because the interest rate was adjustable. And in\n    <em>\n     Sims\n    </em>\n    , the court noted that the required payment schedule under a home-equity loan \"is not one that, when initially set, can never be altered.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 16.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The note contains in all caps and bolded the following provision:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    13.
