After her employment was terminated, Patrick sued Altria and a supervisor at Altria, alleging employment-related claims under the Missouri Human Rights Act, \u00a7 213.010, RSMo\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The defendants moved to compel arbitration and stay the civil action. The circuit court denied the defendants' motion, and they appeal. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Patrick was hired by Altria in November 2007 as a Territory Sales Manager. At the time she began her employment, Patrick agreed to a dispute resolution program which included an arbitration provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2012, Altria distributed to employees a revised dispute resolution agreement, which superseded the earlier agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Patrick executed the revised agreement on February 10, 2012. The agreement established a dispute resolution program which provided various options for addressing workplace disputes. The program describes four dispute resolution options: The Open Door Policy, The Company Ombudsperson, Mediation, and Arbitration. The first three dispute resolution mechanisms were optional and non-binding. By contrast, under the agreement all workplace disputes were subject to mandatory and binding arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The agreement defined a covered \"dispute\" to mean\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   any legal or equitable claim, demand, dispute or controversy, whether based in tort, in contract, under statute, by common law, or alleging a violation of any legal obligation, by and between the Parties, that arises out of or relates in any way to the employment relationship between [Patrick] and [Altria] ... including claims which relate to, arise from, concern or involve in any way:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. separation from employment of an Employee, whether involuntary, voluntary or \"constructive\", the terms and conditions of employment, the cessation of employment, wages alleged to be owed which are required to be paid pursuant to state or federal statute, and benefits (including any modification, amendment or termination of a benefit plan) or incidents of employment with [Altria];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4. any other matter arising out of or related in any way to the employment relationship between [Patrick] and [Altria] including, by way of example and without limitation, allegations of: discrimination or harassment based on race, sex, religion, age, marital status, pregnancy, national original or disability or other bases; unpaid wages or expenses; harassment prohibited by state or federal statute or the common law; retaliation or whistleblower claims, including workers' compensation retaliation; defamation; infliction of emotional distress; and violation(s) of any federal, state, local or other governmental constitution, statute, ordinance, regulation or common law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The agreement excluded from the definition of a \"dispute\" (1) issues relating to the formation, interpretation or enforceability of the agreement; (2) any claim that the class action waiver in the agreement is void or voidable; and (3) any claim for workers' compensation benefits, state disability insurance benefits, or unemployment compensation benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The agreement provided that, \"[i]n the event you and [Altria] are unable to resolve, or choose not to resolve, any such legal dispute through any of the other dispute resolution options, you and [Altria] agree to arbitrate any such legal dispute under the terms of the Program rather than pursue a lawsuit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The agreement gave Altria the power to unilaterally amend or terminate the dispute resolution program. The agreement defined a \"Material Amendment\" as \"a change or modification of the Program that significantly changes a substantive provision relating to arbitration under the Program, such as a change in the allocation of fees and costs, the Disputes covered, or the limitations on remedies.\" A \"Non-Material Amendment\" was defined as \"any change to the Program which is not a Material Amendment.\" The agreement provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1. [Altria] may make a Non-Material Amendment at any time with or without notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2.

Patrick filed an administrative complaint against Altria and supervisor John Hartnett with the Missouri Human Rights Commission. Following receipt of a right to sue letter from the Commission, Patrick filed suit against Altria and Hartnett in the Circuit Court of Jackson County on July 21, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She asserted claims under the Missouri Human Rights Act for gender discrimination, sexual harassment/hostile work environment, and retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Altria filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Action. The motion alleged that a valid and binding arbitration agreement existed between Patrick and Altria, which required Patrick to pursue her claims in arbitration. Patrick opposed the motion. She argued, among other things, that the dispute resolution agreement was not enforceable because it was not supported by adequate consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The circuit court denied Altria's motion to compel arbitration. It concluded that because Altria was given the right to unilaterally modify or terminate the dispute resolution agreement, the agreement was not supported by mutual consideration, and was therefore \"invalid and unenforceable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Altria appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Altria argues that the circuit court erred in denying its Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Action because the parties were bound by a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement that was supported by adequate consideration. In response, Patrick argues, among other things, that Altria's promises in the dispute resolution agreement were illusory and do not constitute bargained for consideration, because Altria retained the unilateral right to modify or terminate its obligations under the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The issue of \"[w]hether the trial court should have granted a motion to compel arbitration is a question of law decided\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Ellis v.

The Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The fact that Bristol must give prior written notice of an amendment to the arbitration agreement does not preclude Bristol from giving Baker prior written notice that, effective in thirty days, Bristol retroactively is disclaiming a promise made in the arbitration agreement.

While the dissent concludes summarily that no court would adopt a construction of the agreement allowing Bristol to disclaim or modify its arbitration promises unilaterally at any time for its own benefit, the fact remains that the language of the agreement would permit Bristol to do just that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   ....

Instead, the agreement only prohibits material amendments from affecting \"a Dispute previously submitted to arbitration under the Program\"-which means that a material amendment\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   apply to claims which have accrued, and of which Altria has notice, but which have not yet been submitted to arbitration. (Such \"accrued-but-unasserted\" claims would include claims in which an employee had invoked the voluntary and non-binding dispute resolution mechanisms specified in the agreement.) In addition, the agreement does not require that Altria provide\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     advance\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   notice of material amendments to its employees: the agreement provides that material amendments become effective upon the publication of notice to employees, meaning that employees are given\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     contemporaneous\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   -but not\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     advance\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   -notice of material amendments to the dispute resolution agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thus, under Altria's dispute resolution agreement, if an employee had complained to the company about alleged employment discrimination, but had not yet commenced arbitration proceedings, Altria would have the ability to modify the dispute resolution agreement to eliminate discrimination claims from the scope of arbitrable disputes, and the employee would have no ability to invoke arbitration before that modification became effective. Given Altria's ability to materially modify the dispute resolution agreement with respect to accrued claims, and without prior notice to employees, its promise to arbitrate is illusory, and cannot constitute adequate consideration to support the dispute resolution agreement's enforceability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although we are not aware of any reported Missouri decisions addressing this precise issue, numerous courts in other jurisdictions have held that a party's promise to arbitrate is illusory where it retains the unilateral right to modify the arbitration agreement with respect to claims which have accrued, but are not yet in arbitration. In some of these cases, the courts have held that the application of unilateral contract modifications to accrued-but-unasserted claims renders an arbitration agreement illusory,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     even if\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   the other party is provided with advance notice\n   of the contract modifications. As the California Court of Appeal explained in a case in which an employer could alter an arbitration agreement on 30 days' notice, applicable to any claims for which arbitration had not yet been initiated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   We do not suggest the Agreement is unenforceable solely because it exempts\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   claims from contract changes. Rather, the Agreement fails because it exempts\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   filed claims-it does not go far enough. The Agreement should also exempt claims that have accrued or are known to the employer that are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   filed within 30 days. Otherwise, Neiman Marcus would have the unfettered unilateral right to modify the arbitration process or terminate the Agreement as to those claims. It would retain the ability to pick and choose the claims it wants to arbitrate, making the company's performance optional and thus illusory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The vice of the modification provision in this case is that it allows the employer to manipulate the arbitration process, tailoring it to fit specific cases, either by making the process more difficult or more expensive for the employee, or by revoking the Agreement in the belief that a judicial forum is preferable. Accordingly, if a claim has accrued or if the employer knows about a claim, all parties to the Agreement should be bound by the version in effect at that time;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     no changes should apply after the point of accrual or knowledge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Peleg v.

As the Texas Court of Appeals explained, without advance notice of contract modifications,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   once a claim arises, the forum in which that claim will be decided hinges not on mutually binding promises, but on a race between employer and employee, with the party who acts first controlling the outcome.

In this case, Altria's dispute resolution agreement fails under either standard: it plainly allows Altria to make unilateral, material modifications to the agreement which apply to accrued-but-unasserted claims; but the agreement also provides that those amendments become effective without any advance notice to employees. Thus, under either of the approaches discussed above, Altria's modification power renders its promise to arbitrate illusory, and the dispute resolution agreement therefore fails for lack of consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Altria makes two additional arguments in defense of the agreement. First, it argues that concerns over its power to unilaterally modify the dispute resolution agreement are \"purely hypothetical,\" because Altria has not in fact exercised its right to modify the dispute resolution program since it was adopted in 2012.
