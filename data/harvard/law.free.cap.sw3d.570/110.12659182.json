In its sole point on appeal, the Fund argues that the Commission erred in awarding benefits to Moss because the statutory requirements of \u00a7 287.190.6(2) were not met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Moss's medical expert demonstrated and certified that Moss is permanently and totally disabled, as required by \u00a7 287.190.6(2), we affirm the Commission's award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 11, 2012, Moss, a corrections officer, injured his right shoulder at work. Moss, who is right-hand dominant, was carrying a 150-pound footlocker up a flight of stairs with a coworker when the coworker dropped his end of the locker and it yanked Moss's right arm, causing immediate pain in his arm and neck. Six months later, Dr. C. Craig Satterlee performed arthroscopic surgery on Moss's right shoulder. Although his symptoms initially decreased, his shoulder pain eventually returned. When subsequent treatments proved ineffective, Dr. Satterlee performed a right-shoulder replacement, but Moss continued to experience ongoing pain and difficulty lifting even light objects. Dr. Satterlee released Moss at maximum medical improvement on September 4, 2014, with a 30% permanent partial impairment rating for Moss's right shoulder and a lifting restriction of ten pounds with his right upper extremity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As early as 1992, Moss began experiencing trouble with his hands, which led to surgery on his right wrist. Thereafter, he had ongoing trouble with his grip strength, which affected his daily activities. He also suffered a work-related injury to his right elbow in 2000 that required surgery and affected his ability to lift heavy objects. In late 2010 or early 2011, he injured his low back at work, resulting in lumbar surgery, after which he had difficulty standing or sitting for more than thirty minutes at a time and had to shift or change positions frequently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Moss retained Dr. William Hopkins, an orthopedic surgeon, to assess Moss's medical condition. Dr. Hopkins rated the primary injury to the shoulder (35% permanent partial disability), the pre-existing injuries to the elbow (16.5% permanent partial disability), and the low back/body as a whole (25% permanent partial disability). Dr. Hopkins opined that Moss's pre-existing low back and right elbow injuries combined with the April 2012 shoulder injury to create an overall greater disability, and he determined that an enhancement factor of 10% was appropriate to account for the combination of Moss's prior and primary injuries. Dr. Hopkins concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Moss has very limited work capabilities. His ability to work would be limited to a sedentary occupation that requires mostly sitting, with the ability to change positions as needed. He will not be capable of repetitive right upper extremity work. His weight capability should be no more than 10 pounds from waist to shoulder using both hands. He\n   is not capable of above shoulder work with his right arm. He is not capable of repetitive bending from the waist more than on an occasional basis, from his previous lumbar spine injury.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dr. Hopkins's report stated, \"I certify this report is pursuant to Missouri Law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Moss was then evaluated by Kristine Skahan, a vocational consultant. She began by noting that Moss's \"previous work was at the unskilled to skilled level consisting of work mainly at the light to very heavy level.\" Then, she considered the restrictions outlined by Dr. Hopkins and opined that Moss \"would be unable to perform at the sedentary level\" due to both his inability to use his right-dominant arm for repetitive work and his need to change positions frequently. She concluded that Moss \"would be unable to perform the usual duties of any job for which he is qualified ..., and would not be hired by [an] employer in the open competitive labor market in the normal course of business.\" \"When considering all of the physical restrictions, as well as Mr. Moss'[s] worker profile,\" Skahan opined \"that he has a total loss to the open competitive labor market,\" which she attributed to \"a combination of the back injury in 2011 and the shoulder injury that occurred on 4/11/12 ... as well as his previous injuries to his upper right[-]dominant extremity and low back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the request of his employer, Moss was evaluated by certified rehabilitation counselor Terry Cordray, who determined that Moss was \"totally precluded from all jobs in the labor market\" because he required sedentary work that would allow him to change positions frequently but not require him to perform repetitive motions with his right upper extremity (dominant hand). According to Cordray, \"At sedentary work, Mr. Moss would be limited to approximately 4% of the jobs in the labor market[, and] sedentary jobs require one to use the upper extremities.\" Cordray concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   At 61, with a high school education, a lack of sedentary skills, and a history of work[-]related injury, it is my opinion that Mr. Moss would not be \"placeable\" in the labor market, given the combination of his sedentary work restrictions, ..., as well as his age, education, and lack of transferrable skill level. ... [I]t is my opinion that Mr. Moss is totally vocationally disabled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Fund did not present any contrary expert medical or vocational evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) awarded Moss $370.19 per week in permanent total disability benefits to be paid by the Fund. The ALJ concluded that \"the combination of [Moss's] April 11, 2012 injury and [his] preexisting permanent partial low back and right elbow disability that existed at the time he sustained his April 11, 2012 injury resulted in [his] permanent total disability.\" The ALJ noted that permanent total disability is not exclusively a medical question; rather, it is a question of \"whether any employer in the usual course of business would be reasonably expected to hire the employee in [his] present physical condition, reasonably expecting the employee to perform the work for which he ... is hired.\" The ALJ rejected the very argument the Fund raises on appeal-that Moss is not entitled to permanent total disability benefits because no physician certified his status pursuant to \u00a7 287.190.6(2)-citing\n   <em>\n    Treasurer of the State of Missouri v.

App. W.D. 2016), where this court\n   affirmed the Commission's decision to grant permanent total disability benefits even though no physician had determined that the employee was permanently and totally disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its Final Award Allowing Compensation, the Commission affirmed the ALJ's award in a supplemental opinion. In responding to the very issue the Fund now raises, the Commission concluded that \u00a7 287.190.6(2) \"does not imply or mandate any requirement that a medical expert ... specifically address or attempt to resolve the question whether the test for permanent total disability under Chapter 287 has been satisfied.\" The Commission further explained that analysis of the extent of disability involves evaluating issues such as job requirements and availability, transferrable skills, and retraining prospects; it also noted, \"[i]n many (and perhaps most) cases, physicians do not possess the training, experience, or access to information necessary to render competent opinions regarding an injured worker's prospects for returning to any employment.\" The Commission then did \"as [they] have always done: consider the actual substance of the opinions from the testifying experts, weigh the persuasive value of those opinions, and then fulfill [its] fact-finding duty to determine the nature and extent of [the] employee's disability.\" After doing so, the Commission concluded that \u00a7 287.190.6(2)'s requirement to demonstrate and certify was satisfied.

Thus, we conclude, as we did in\n    <em>\n     Majors\n    </em>\n    , that, in determining if the claimant is permanently and totally disabled, the Commission may rely on both evidence provided by a physician demonstrating and certifying the claimant's medical condition and functional abilities and evidence provided by other non-medical experts assessing whether, in light of his medical condition and functional ability, the claimant is employable.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    We reject the Fund's contention that a finding of permanent and total disability can be made in only cases where the employee presents an opinion from a physician specifically stating that the employee is unable to perform any work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    We also reject the Fund's contention that\n    <em>\n     Majors\n    </em>\n    is distinguishable because here, unlike in\n    <em>\n     Majors\n    </em>\n    , the physician opined that the claimant could do sedentary work. After providing permanent partial disability ratings for Moss's primary injury and his pre-existing injuries, and concluding that the combination of injuries created an overall greater disability, Dr. Hopkins addressed Moss's ability to work in the future. The doctor advised that Moss would require a sedentary job where he could change positions as needed and would not have to lift more than ten pounds, raise his right arm above his shoulder, or bend repetitively at the waist, ultimately concluding that Moss has \"very limited work capabilities.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    In other\n    words, Dr. Hopkins identified a very narrow type of work that would be compatible with Moss's medical condition and physical limitations-sedentary work with the ability to change positions often but no requirement to perform repetitive motions with his dominant hand. This does not suggest, however, that the doctor concluded that Moss was, in fact, employable and, therefore not permanently and totally disabled. Rather, this evidence simply reflects the type of work restrictions applicable to Moss after his injuries, if he were employable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    In exercising its expertise to determine the technical question of employability, the Commission credited not only the medical opinion of Dr. Hopkins but also the testimony of two vocational experts, both of whom concluded that Moss's inability to perform repetitive motions with his right (dominant) hand and his need to change positions frequently combined to preclude him from competing in the open labor market. Specifically, Cordray stated,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    At 61, with a high school education, a lack of sedentary skills, and a history of work[-]related injury, it is my opinion that Mr. Moss would not be \"placeable\" in the labor market, given the combination of his sedentary work restrictions, ..., as well as his age, education, and lack of transferrable skill level. ... [I]t is my opinion that Mr. Moss is totally vocationally disabled.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The record reflects that the Commission properly applied the test for determining permanent total disability and considered Moss's employability. Specifically, the Commission was convinced both by Dr. Hopkins's testimony that Moss's combined shoulder, elbow, and low back conditions were serious enough to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to employment for the purposes of \u00a7 287.190.6(2) and by the testimony of two vocational experts who found Moss to be permanently and totally disabled.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Point I is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Because the requirement in \u00a7 287.190.6(2) that a physician demonstrate and certify permanent total disability was met and there was sufficient competent evidence in the record to support the Commission's finding, the Commission did not err in awarding Moss permanent and total disability benefits. Therefore, we affirm the Commission's award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Victor C.
