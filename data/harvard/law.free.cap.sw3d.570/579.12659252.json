Parson previously served as Missouri's Lieutenant Governor, an office he held until the resignation of Governor Eric Greitens. Governor Parson then succeeded Greitens to the office of Governor, leaving the office of Lieutenant Governor vacant. Governor Parson appointed Mike Kehoe to be the Lieutenant Governor. The day of Kehoe's appointment, Cope and the MDP filed a petition seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against Governor Parson and Kehoe in the circuit court of Cole County. The petition alleged Governor Parson lacked legal authority, per \u00a7 105.030, to appoint a Lieutenant Governor and that the office must remain vacant until the next general election in 2020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Governor Parson and Kehoe filed a motion to dismiss the petition claiming a private litigant does not have the authority to remove the Lieutenant Governor from office, that Cope and the MDP lacked standing to assert their claims, and that the Governor has the authority to appoint a Lieutenant Governor under article IV, \u00a7 4 of the Missouri Constitution. The circuit court held a hearing on Governor Parson\n   and Kehoe's motion to dismiss. During the hearing, Cope and the MDP withdrew their request for injunctive relief, leaving only a request for declaratory relief regarding the validity of Governor Parson's appointment of Kehoe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The circuit court sustained the State's motion to dismiss, concluding Cope and the MDP did not have associational or taxpayer standing to challenge Governor Parson's appointment of Kehoe.

He challenges the authority of Governor Parson to appoint Kehoe to the office of Lieutenant Governor, contending such an appointment was outside the scope of the Governor's constitutional and statutory authority to fill vacancies in public offices. He alleges taxpayer standing to challenge Governor Parson's authority to appoint Kehoe as Lieutenant Governor \"because such appointment will require the expenditure of revenue collected by taxpayers to fund the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.\" This is an allegation of a direct expenditure of funds generated through taxation. In 2018, the non-appointment of a Lieutenant Governor would have saved the Missouri taxpayers, at a minimum, the salary of the Lieutenant Governor. Thus, these allegations are sufficient to give Cope standing to proceed with his declaratory judgment action as a taxpayer of the state of Missouri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The MDP alleges it has associational standing \"because Governor Parson's purported appointment of a Lieutenant Governor will create an electoral disadvantage for the Party and its members, Democratic voters in the State of Missouri.\" The injury alleged is that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   Kehoe decides to run as an incumbent in the next election, it\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   result in an electoral disadvantage.

More so, this Court has held the Governor's express article IV, \u00a7 4 power to appoint cannot be abrogated by mere implication, as \"[t]he uninterrupted functioning of the government has been recognized as a vital end ... construing article IV, section 4....\"\n   <em>\n    Bank of Washington v.

By excepting the offices of Lieutenant Governor, state senator or representative, sheriff and the St. Louis city recorder of deeds from \u00a7 105.030, the legislature merely kept those offices outside the scope of this statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Further, the constitution is clear, the Governor may fill\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   vacancies in public offices unless the law provides an alternative method. Mo. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 4. Cope does not dispute there is no alternative method. Therefore, article IV, \u00a7 4 controls the authority of the Governor to appoint a Lieutenant Governor, and Governor Parson was within his constitutional authority when he appointed Kehoe to the office of Lieutenant Governor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Advisory Opinion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Lastly, the State argues that because Cope withdrew his request for injunctive relief, the remaining relief requested in the petition was nothing more\n   than a thinly-veiled request for an unauthorized advisory opinion. The State contends a declaratory judgment in this case would have no binding effect on Governor Parson or Kehoe, thus constituting a \"quintessential advisory opinion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This Court is not authorized to issue advisory opinions.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

As established above, Cope has sufficiently alleged taxpayer standing and therefore has a legally protectable interest at stake in the litigation. His petition further establishes the requisite controversy between the Governor and himself as he, a taxpayer, is alleging the unconstitutional nature of the Governor's appointment of a Lieutenant Governor. Lastly, the controversy is ripe. \"A ripe controversy exists if the parties' dispute is developed sufficiently to allow the court to make an accurate determination of the facts, to resolve a conflict that is presently existing, and to grant specific relief of a conclusive character.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11900842\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/953/617/#p620\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11900842\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/953/617/#p620\">\n    at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the time of the petition's filing, Kehoe actively occupied the office of Lieutenant Governor as a result of Governor Parson's challenged appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because this action presents a justiciable controversy, this opinion is not of an advisory nature in spite of the State's contention that a judgment would have no binding effect on Kehoe or the Governor.

The resolution of this case requires this Court to construe what the phrase \"unless otherwise provided by law\" means when the Governor's power to appoint is expressly provided by the Constitution and a subsequently enacted statute does not provide how or whether a vacancy is filled.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The State alleges at oral argument on the motion to dismiss Cope \"conceded that Governor Parson and Lieutenant Governor Kehoe would be free to disregard any judicial opinion in their favor and remain in office, even if they were to prevail on the merits.\" No transcript exists of the hearing, however whether this occurred is not consequential because a party cannot concede a question of law.\n    <em>\n     State v.

Draper III, Judge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   I concur in the principal opinion's holding regarding the standing of the parties\n   in this case as well as its conclusion this is not an advisory opinion. I respectfully dissent from the principal opinion's interpretation of Missouri's constitution to permit the governor to fill the vacancy of the office of the lieutenant governor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Missouri Constitution states, \"The governor shall fill all vacancies in public offices unless otherwise provided by law, and his [or her] appointees shall serve until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.\" Mo. Const. art. IV, sec. 4. The legislature has \"otherwise provided\" by enacting section 105.030.1, RSMo Supp. 2016, which states when the governor is not authorized to fill a public office vacancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Section 105.030.1 provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Whenever any vacancy, caused in any manner or by any means whatsoever, occurs or exists in any state or county office originally filled by election of the people,\n   <em>\n    other than in the office[ ] of lieutenant governor\n   </em>\n   , ... the vacancy shall be filled by appointment by the governor....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (Emphasis added). Section 105.030.1 prohibits the governor from making an appointment to fill the office of lieutenant governor. While the legislature provided the governor shall not make an appointment to the office of lieutenant governor, it did not provide for an alternative means to fill that office when it becomes vacant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The principal opinion concludes the governor may make the appointment to the office of lieutenant governor because article IV, section 4 allows the governor to fill all vacancies in public office \"unless the law provides an alternative method.\"\n   <em>\n    Op.\n   </em>\n   at 585. Yet, to reach this conclusion, the principal opinion does not analyze the actual language in the constitution but, instead, grafts language into the constitution that does not exist. There is no language stating the governor shall fill public vacancies unless otherwise provided by law\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   an alternative method is provided. While the legislature may not have provided an alternative method of appointment, there is an alternative available to fill the vacancy - the position merely remains vacant until the next general election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Words \"used in constitutional provisions are interpreted to give effect to their plain, ordinary, and natural meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314583\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/368/154/#p156\">\n    368 S.W.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 156 (Mo. banc 2012). This Court has held for over a century that the phrase \"otherwise provided by law\" means unless otherwise provided by statute.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. St. Joseph Lead Co. v.

DePaul Health Ctr. v. Mummert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10017345\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/870/820/#p822\">\n    870 S.W.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 822 (Mo. banc 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Article IV, section 4 provides the governor may not make an appointment if it is \"otherwise provided by law.\" This language in the constitution does not limit the authority of the legislature to provide an alternative statutory means to fill a public office vacancy; it also permits the legislature to provide by statute that the governor is prohibited from filling any vacancy. Section 105.030.1 clearly states the governor may not fill a vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor. Neither the constitution nor statutes indicate, mandate, state, or require there\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be an alternative means to fill a public office vacancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   I would give the words in the constitution their plain and ordinary meaning. There is no inferred requirement \"otherwise provided by law\" means there must be a provision prohibiting the governor from filling the vacancy\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   delineating the method to fill that vacancy. The legislature has \"otherwise provided by law\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   that the governor cannot fill the vacancy of the office of the lieutenant governor. Accordingly, because section 105.030.1 states the governor cannot fill the vacancy of the office of the lieutenant governor, I believe the governor is not authorized to appoint anyone to the office and the office should remain vacant until the next lieutenant governor is elected.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
