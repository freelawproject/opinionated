PEN. CODE \u00a7 33.021(b) -was held to be facially unconstitutional in\n     <em>\n      Ex parte Lo,\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951634\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/424/10/\">\n      424 S.W.3d 10\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). Applicant was charged by indictment for the offense of online solicitation of a minor. Specifically, the indictment stated that Applicant sent sexually explicit electronic messages to a minor with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desires of any person. Applicant pled guilty to the offense of online solicitation of a minor in 2010. He was sentenced to confinement in prison for a period of five years and he did not appeal his conviction. Applicant has discharged his sentence, but he claims that he is suffering collateral consequences, namely that the conviction is \"preventing an accurate determination of [Applicant's] criminal history\" in a federal prosecution of Applicant for online enticement of a minor and travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor.\n     <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202422\">\n      18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (b) &amp;\n     <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n      18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (b).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-7\">\n     I dissent to the Court's order granting Applicant post-conviction relief in this case for the reasons stated in my dissenting opinions in\n     <em>\n      Ex parte Fournier\n     </em>\n     and\n     <em>\n      Ex parte Mitcham\n     </em>\n     .\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Ex parte Fournier\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839235\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/473/789/#p800\">\n      473 S.W.3d 789\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 800-05 (Tex.
