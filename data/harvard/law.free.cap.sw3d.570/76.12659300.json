(\"K&amp;M\"), and Jessica Westhoff. U.S. Bank cross-appeals the denial of its request for attorney's fees. This appeal involves the validity of a real estate foreclosure sale. It involves similar facts and the same legal issues as those presented and decided in\n   <em>\n    Wesley v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. WD81408,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12659120\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/569/436/\">\n    569 S.W.3d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205913113\">\n    2018 WL 5913113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo.
