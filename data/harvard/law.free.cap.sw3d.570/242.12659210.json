After the dismissal of a defendant\n   doctor in the underlying suit, the plaintiffs filed the present case asserting that the defendants prevented the doctor from being served with process in the healthcare liability action. The defendants moved for summary judgment. The trial court, among other rulings, granted the motion for summary judgment, and the plaintiffs appealed the trial court's various rulings. In an opinion filed on April 28, 2017, we affirmed the denial of the plaintiffs' motions for default judgment, to dismiss their own complaint as moot, and for additional time to conduct discovery; however, we vacated the order granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment and remanded the case for entry of an order that complied with Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 56.04. On remand, the trial court again granted summary judgment explaining that its decision was based on its conclusion that no duty of care was owed by the defendants to the plaintiffs. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The present case arises out of an underlying healthcare liability action originally filed in 2008. The plaintiffs-appellants in the current negligence case, Paul and Jolene Koczera (\"Plaintiffs\"), were also the plaintiffs in the medical malpractice case. Because this is the third appeal of Plaintiffs' negligence case, we incorporate the following relevant facts from our Opinion in the prior appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Paul and Jolene Koczera are a married couple who previously filed a healthcare liability action against Dr. Laurence O'Connor and other defendants, including Oak Ridge Urology Associates (\"the O'Connor suit\"). Christi Steele, the office manager for Oak Ridge Urology Associates, was served with Dr. O'Connor's process and gave the complaint and summons to another doctor (\"Dr. Pearson\"), who gave them to Dr. O'Connor. Dr. O'Connor filed an answer in the suit, in which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , he asserted the defense of insufficiency of service of process, contending that Ms. Steele was not authorized to accept service of process on his behalf; on the basis of that defense, Dr. O'Connor was dismissed as a defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs then filed the lawsuit that led to this appeal on September 10, 2010, against Ms. Steele, Dr. Pearson, Oak Ridge Urology Associates, Tennessee Urology Associates, PLLC, and Tennessee Urology Associates, PLLC d/b/a Oak Ridge Urology Associates, alleging that the negligence and negligent misrepresentation of those parties prevented Dr. O'Connor from being properly served and resulted in his dismissal from the suit; they sought $1.5 million in damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants filed their answer on October 13 denying liability, asserting that Plaintiffs failed to serve process on Tennessee Urology Associates, PLLC, and pleading the defenses of comparative fault, intervening cause, and \"res judicata and/or collateral estoppel.\" Contemporaneously with the answer, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that they owed no duty to Plaintiffs, they did not act unreasonably, they did not cause any damage or injury to Plaintiffs, that Plaintiffs suffered no damages, and that Plaintiffs' counsel was negligent in failing to secure service of process on Dr. O'Connor. Defendants supported the motion with a statement of undisputed facts supported by ten exhibits: the return filed by the sheriff's deputy who served Dr. O'Connor's copy of the complaint; the deposition of Ms. Steele taken in the O'Connor suit; the affidavit of Dr. Pearson; the answer filed by Dr. O'Connor and Oak Ridge Urology Associates\n   in the O'Connor suit; the order dismissing Dr. O'Connor from the O'Connor suit; the affidavit of Plaintiffs' counsel's paralegal; an order entered by the Court of Appeals in the O'Connor suit denying application for interlocutory appeal; one page from the transcript of a May 21, 2010 hearing in the O'Connor suit; and two records from the Board of Professional Responsibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 3, 2010, the Circuit Judge entered an order recusing himself and designating a judge to hear the case by interchange. On December 14, Plaintiffs filed a response to the motion for summary judgment, requesting that the hearing on the motion be postponed for several reasons, including Defendants' attorney's failure to provide dates for requested depositions and the fact that no discovery had taken place. Plaintiffs argued that \"[b]ecause of the lack of discovery ... a response on the merits to the Motion for Summary Judgment is impossible at this time.\" On December 28, Plaintiffs filed a document styled \"Motion To Dismiss, As Moot,\" asking that the action be dismissed due to the settlement of the underlying healthcare liability action. Defendants opposed the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 14, 2011, Plaintiffs filed a response to Defendants' statement of undisputed material facts, specifically disputing three of the statements, and responding to several of the statements in this manner:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs agree that this fact is undisputed for purposes of ruling on the motion for summary judgment only. (Plaintiffs may dispute this fact later, because [the deputy, Ms. Steele, Dr. Pearson, and Dr. O'Connor] ha[ve] not yet been deposed.... Plaintiffs will not know whether or not this fact will be disputed [...] until discovery depositions of those people are taken.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs also asserted additional statements of undisputed fact. In their response to Defendants' statement as well as in support of their statements of undisputed fact, Plaintiffs relied on the pleadings and the deposition of Ms. Steele taken in the O'Connor suit and the complaint in the present suit. Plaintiffs also filed a memorandum opposing summary judgment, again raising the lack of discovery and arguing that the case should be dismissed as moot \"because a settlement was reached in the underlying medical malpractice case, so that, as of today, Plaintiffs are willing to forego the pursuit of the remaining damages.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 23, a hearing was held on the Defendants' motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss, and Plaintiffs' request that the motion for summary judgment be delayed until discovery could be completed. The court denied Plaintiffs' request for a continuance to conduct additional discovery as well as their motion to dismiss; the court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court's oral rulings were incorporated into a written order, entered on June 29.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Before the oral ruling was memorialized in an order, Plaintiffs moved for a default judgment against Oak Ridge Urology Associates on the basis that it never filed an answer to the complaint. Defendants filed a response, asserting that the Answer \"made clear that the Answer was filed on behalf of the urology practice and that the naming of Oak Ridge Urology Associates as a stand-alone party was incorrect. By making these denials and averments, the Answer was filed on behalf of Oak Ridge Urology Associates....\" The trial court did not rule on this motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   After entry of the June 29 order, Plaintiffs appealed; this Court dismissed the appeal due to lack of a final judgment on September 15, 2011, due to the pending motion for default judgment. On October 26, 2015, Plaintiffs gave notice of a hearing on the motion for default judgment. After a hearing, the trial court entered an order denying the motion for default judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Koczera v.

Thereafter, the trial court again ordered that Plaintiffs' negligence suit be dismissed, finding as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Based on this record, a sufficient relationship does not exist between the parties such that the community would impose a legal obligation upon the Defendants in this case for the benefit of the Plaintiffs. As a matter of law, the Plaintiffs are not entitled to legal protection at the hands of these Defendants. In other words, the Defendants owe no duty of ordinary care to the Plaintiffs, whose attorneys failed to verify proper service on Dr. O'Connor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Again, Plaintiffs appeal.

R. Civ. P. 56.04.

When a motion for summary judgment is properly supported, the nonmoving party, in order to survive summary judgment, may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleading but must respond, and by affidavits or one of the other means provided in Rule 56, set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766483\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/477/235/#p264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766483\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/477/235/#p264\">\n    at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The nonmoving party must demonstrate the existence of specific facts in the record which could lead a rational trier of fact to find in favor of the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766483\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/477/235/#p264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"[S]ummary judgment should be granted if the nonmoving party's evidence\n   <em>\n    at the summary judgment stage\n   </em>\n   is insufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766483\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/477/235/#p264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   Tenn.

Plaintiffs characterize this as a \"duty to disclose\" or a \"duty not to interfere.\" Still, the crux of Plaintiffs' argument is that Defendants had a duty to take some action to correct the officer's error in serving process on one not authorized to accept it.

Doing so necessarily favors imposing a duty of reasonable care where a defendant's conduct poses an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to persons or property. When conducting this analysis, the courts have considered, among other factors: (1) the foreseeable probability of the harm or injury occurring; (2) the possible magnitude of the potential harm or injury; (3) the importance or social value of the activity engaged in by the defendant; (4) the usefulness of the conduct to the defendant; (5) the feasibility of alternative conduct that is safer; (6) the relative costs and burdens associated with that safer conduct; (7) the relative usefulness of the safer conduct; and (8) the relative safety of alternative conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Satterfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8202882\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/347/#p355\">\n    266 S.W.3d at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

In\n   <em>\n    Draper\n   </em>\n   , a radiologist reviewed a child's medical records as part of a child abuse investigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994326\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/181/283/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994326\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/181/283/\">\n    at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The mother of the child, who later died from injuries inflicted by her father, filed suit against the radiologist claiming that he had a duty to report his suspicions of abuse to investigators.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994326\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/181/283/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994326\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/181/283/\">\n    at 286-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tennessee Supreme Court agreed, emphasizing that \" '[o]ne who assumes to act, even though gratuitously, may thereby become subject to the duty of acting carefully.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994326\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/181/283/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994326\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/181/283/\">\n    at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). The Court held that \"[b]y reviewing [the child's] medical records as part of a child abuse investigation, [the radiologist] voluntarily undertook a duty on behalf of [the child] to use reasonable care in reviewing the medical records and reporting his findings and conclusions to the investigators.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994326\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/181/283/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, \"[e]ven if [Ms.] Steele did not originally have a duty to act,\" she \"undertook to render services ... by accepting service of process for Dr. O'Connor.\" However, this case is easily distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Draper\n   </em>\n   . Unlike the radiologist in\n   <em>\n    Draper\n   </em>\n   , Defendants did not voluntarily offer their services. The radiologist in that case was asked to assist investigators in reviewing medical records, and he voluntarily did so and reported his findings. In contrast, Ms. Steele's and Dr. Pearson's passive acceptance of unidentified documents delivered to the office's front desk is not enough to conclude Defendants assumed a duty of reasonable care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We also address Plaintiffs' argument that Defendant Tennessee Urology Associates \"had a duty to have, implement, and enforce adequate policies, procedures, and/or guidelines to prevent [Defendant] Ms. Steele from wrongfully accepting service of process for Dr. O'Connor without being authorized to do so\" and a duty to \"ensure that she and/or [Defendant] Dr. Pearson properly followed up after the fact so that\n   <em>\n    the Deputy's error\n   </em>\n   could be promptly corrected\" (emphasis added). This argument is also without merit. It is yet another attempt by Plaintiffs to shift the responsibility of perfecting service of process on another party. The law, however, simply does not impose a duty on individuals or on organizations to assist plaintiffs in their quest to serve process on another. Nor does it impose a duty to assist a plaintiff in correcting its admitted error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Therefore, because we agree that Defendants did not owe Plaintiffs a duty of care, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, the decision of the circuit court is hereby affirmed and remanded for further proceedings. Costs of this appeal are taxed to the appellants, Paul Koczera and Jolene Koczera, for which execution may issue if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    For a more comprehensive discussion of the history of Tennessee courts' adherence to the \"no duty to act rule,\" see\n    <em>\n     Satterfield\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8202882\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/347/#p355\">\n     266 S.W.3d at 357-59\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
