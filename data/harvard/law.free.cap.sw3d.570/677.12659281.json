Way contends the motion court clearly erred in rejecting his claim that his sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law following the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    State v. Bazell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/\">\n    497 S.W.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2016). Upon review of the briefs and the record, we find no error and affirm the judgment.
