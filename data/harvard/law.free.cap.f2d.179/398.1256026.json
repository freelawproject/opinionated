The district court, having ordered the hearing to be on written affidavits, held that the case, as presented, did not justify the issuance of a preliminary injunction, and in so doing we think there was no abuse of discretion. Therefore, the order appealed from is affirmed. <em>Ex parte Tucker, </em>110 Tex. 335, 220 S.W. 75; Gibralter Savings &amp; Building Ass\u2019n et al. v.
