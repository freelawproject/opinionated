While hearings before an examiner were under way appellant discovered, it contends, that the examiner was not appointed and qualified in compliance with sections 5 and 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1004, 1010, 60 Stat. 239, 244. Appellant thereupon objected to the pending hearing and petitioned the Commission for a hearing before an examiner so appointed. The Commission denied the petition on the ground that sections 5, 7, and 8 of the Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1004, 1006, 1007, did not apply to the proceeding. After the Commission declined to reconsider this order, appellant applied to the District Court for a declaratory judgment and an injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>requiring the Commission to give appellant an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with sections 5, <em>7, </em>and 8 of the Act. The court granted the Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The question chiefly argued on this appeal was whether the Commission was right in ruling that the cited sections of the Administrative Procedure Act are inapplicable to the pending proceeding before the Commission. Cf. Bersoff v. Donaldson, 84 U.S.App.D.C. 226, 174 F.2d 494. But we do not reach that question, for we think appellant\u2019s application for court 'help was premature. Courts are not authorized to interfere by injunction or declaratory judgment with the conduct of pending administrative proceedings. Macauley v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 327 U.S. 540, 545, 66 S.Ct. 712, 90 L.Ed. 839; Federal Power Commission v. Arkansas Power <em>&amp; </em>Light Co., 330 U.S. 802, 67 S.Ct. 963, 91 L.Ed. 1261; Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. Otis <em>&amp; Co., </em>338 U.S. 843, 70 S.Ct. 89, rehearing denied, 338 U.S. 888, 70 S.Ct. 187. Different implications, if any, in United States ex rel. Kansas City Southern R. R. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 252 U.S. 178, 40 S.Ct. 187, 64 L.Ed. 517, or Work v. Louisiana, 269 U.S. 250, 46 S.Ct. 92, 70 L.Ed. 259, on which the appellant relies, must be disregarded in the light of later cases. \u201cThe so-called order here complained of is one which does not command the carrier to do, or to refrain from doing, any thing; which does not grant or withhold any authority, privilege, or license; which does not extend or abridge any power or facility; which does not subject the carrier to any liability, civil or criminal; which does not change the carrier\u2019s existing or future status or condition ; which does not determine any right or obligation.\u201d United States v. Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake R. R., 273 U.S. 299, 309-310, 47 S.Ct. 413, 414, 71 L.Ed. 651; John J. Casale, Inc., v. United States, D.C., 52 F.Supp. 1005. We think the complaint should have been dismissed. The case is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">WILBUR K.
