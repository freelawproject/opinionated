McComb, Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department of Labor, filed a motion to remand in view of the new factual elements and questions of law of vital importance presented by the 1949 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-20\">On November 22, 1949, the appellee, Factory Stores Company of Cleveland, joined in the motion of the appellant to remand the cause to the United States District Court for further procedure;</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">And it appearing that the joint motions are well grounded, it is ordered that the cause be remanded to the United States District Court for further proceedings and consideration under the 1949 amendments of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 81 F.Supp. 403.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
