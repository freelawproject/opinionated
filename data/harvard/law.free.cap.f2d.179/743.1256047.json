Brander, of the United States Army Air Corps in driving an army truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-26\">The pertinent provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act are: \u201c* * * the district court * * * shall- have * * * jurisdiction to * * * render judgment * * * against the United States * * on account of personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable * * * in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 931(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Am3\">\u201c(b) \u2018Employee of the Government\u2019. includes officers or employees of any Federal agency, members of the military or naval forces of the United States. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">\u201c(c) \u2018Acting within the scope of his office or employment\u2019, in the case of a member of the military or naval forces of the United States, means acting in line of duty.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 941 (1946 Edition).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">It is not questioned that the negligence claimed, if proved, would make the sergeant liable in California where the death occurred. The questions before us are, Was there such negligence and, if so, was the sergeant then acting within the scope of his employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The entire evidence is in two depositions of witnesses taken by the United States and hence warrants our own consideration of its probative value, with due respect to the findings of the court below. Equitable Life Assurance Soc. v. Irelan, 9 Cir., 1941, 123 F.2d 462, 464; Smith v. Royal Insurance Co., 9 Cir., 1942, 125 F.2d 222, 224, certiorari denied 316 U.S. 695, 62 S.Ct. 1291, 86 L.Ed. 1765; Stork Restaurant, Inc., v. Sahati, 9 Cir., 1948, 166 F.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Sergeant Brander was one of about twenty air corps soldiers encamped about three miles from the town of Klamath in the northern part of the state of California. In order to keep up the morale of these encamped men, a truck was provided for nightly visits to Klamath for their \u201centertainment, movies, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">On the night of Mrs. Murphey\u2019s death there was an Indian ceremonial, called a Shaker meeting, in a barn which Brander testified, in the government\u2019s deposition, was \u201cin the town of Klamath.\u201d We accept this testimony of this government witness and consider the statement of Lieutenant Simon\u2019s deposition that the meeting was about \u201ctwo or three blocks\u201d from the town of Klamath as meaning from the center of town, he having testified that his .camp was three miles and \u201ctwo or three blocks\u201d from. the \u201ccenter\u201d of the town. Leaving camp about 9 o\u2019clock in the evening, Brander drove into the town. He parked the truck at some unnamed place. With another sergeant, not produced by the government, he visited a saloon and then started in the truck for the entertainment of-the Indian ceremonial in the barn in the town. On the way they met two ladies, friends of the other sergeant, who entered the car to go to the Shaker meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">The street on which they were driving led to a bridge beyond which, at a distance of about fifty yards, was the barn in which the Indian ceremonial had been conducted. The bridge was ten feet wide. It had no guard rails. There were two lines of planks for automobile wheels so placed that the truck would travel in the bridge\u2019s center. The truck was 6 feet 2 inches wide, thus leaving a clearance on each side of less than two feet to the unguarded sides of the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">As the truck approached the bridge, Brander saw several people entering the bridge. Instead of waiting until they had passed and without dimming his lights, he drove onto the two lines of planking. After traveling some distance, he turned to the right off the planking and drove by the approaching people and on to the place of the ceremonial. Mrs. Murphey was in the group of people crossing the unguarded bridge and fell off and was killed by the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">We think Sergeant Brander was negligent in crossing the bridge with his headlights shining in the eyes of persons seeing less than two feet clearance on each side of the truck, and that Mrs. Murphey fell off the bridge in attempting to avoid the negligently driven car.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-16\">The district court found that Mrs. Murphey was forced off the bridge by the negligence of Sergeant Brander, but found that Brander \u201cwas not acting in the line of duty and was not acting within the scope of his office or employment with the United States of America,\u201d and that \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>said, members of the said Army Air Corp were authorized and directed to park the said vehicle to the side of a building in the said town where the said vehicle was required to remain until the evening\u2019s entertainment was over, at which time it was to be used to reconvey the men to the said radar station. <em>Special permission was required to use the vehicle for the pleasure of the men to go to any place other than Klamath, </em>and that neither the said Paul W. Brander nor any other member of said Army Air Corp, was authorized to operate the motor vehicle for his or their personal uses, or for any other uses, than that hereinbefore set forth.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)'</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Apparently the district court thought that the Indian ceremonial was in \u201ca place other than Klamath\u201d but, as seen, the deposition taken by the government places the barn \u201cin the town of Klamath\u201d as we have found. When the negligence occurred the truck was being driven in the town and was to be parked at the barn, a building in the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">It is not questioned that it was within Sergeant Brander\u2019s line of duty to seek recreation in the town of Klamath. He was authorized by his commanding officer to drive the truck for \u201cpleasure\u201d under \u201cinstruction.\u201d That officer testified Brander had authority to drive it that night to Klamath for the purpose of transporting \u201cthe rest of the boys stationed there into town for entertainment, movies, etc.\u201d He also testified that it was \u201csupposed\u201d that the \u201ctruck would be parked alongside a [unnamed] building in the town and left there until it was ready to come back,\u201d and that Brander was not \u201cfree\u201d to use it during the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">On the other hand, there is testimony that permission to use the truck for recreation included going to places short distances outside Klamath, which was -done with the knowledge of Brander\u2019s superior officers, and that no permission was needed to drive it to the Indian ceremonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The government brief concedes that Brander was acting within the scope of his employment .in driving himself and other soldiers into the town of Klamath for their recreation, but contends that such recreational employment of the truck by the sergeant alone could not be a military employment. We do not agree. Improvement of morale of a single soldier is as much military in character as of several. The Judge Advocate General\u2019s opinions state that engaging in allowed athletic exercise is within a soldier\u2019s- line of duty. Howland Opinion of the Attorney General, 1912 p. 686. See also Howland, 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">In a analogous case of seamen held to the monotony of the ship, as these soldiers were to that of their mountain camp, this court in this same division of judges has held that, in seeking allowed recreation, the seaman was in the course of his employment when at a shallow swimming pool he was injured in a dive. Ellis v. American Hawaiian S. S. Co., 9 Cir., 165 F.2d 999, 1001. In that case we relied upon Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 318 U.S. 724, 63 S.Ct. 930, 87 L.Ed. 1107, in which the court stated: \u201cThe assumption is hardly sound that the normal uses and purposes of shore leave are \u2018exclusively personal\u2019 and have no relation to the vessel\u2019s business. Men cannot live for long cooped up aboard ship without substantial impairment of their efficiency, if not also serious danger to discipline. Relaxation beyond the confines of the ship is necessary if the work is to go on, more so that it may move smoothly. No master would take a crew to sea if he could not grant shore leave, and no crew would be taken if it could never obtain it. Even more for the seaman than for the landsman, therefore \u2018the superfluous is the necessary * * * to make life livable\u2019 and to get work done. In short, shore leave is an elemental necessity in the sailing of ships, a part of the business as old as the art, not merely a personal diversion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">In the Aguilar case the Supreme Court disapproves of our narrow interpretation of the seaman\u2019s employment in Meyer v. Dollar S. S. Lines, 9 Cir., 49 F.2d 1002, 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">This case concerns specifically allowed amusements,- here \u201cmovies, etc.\u201d in the town of Klamath. We are not holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>in any case where the soldier is on a frolic of his own he can make the government liable simply because he there found entertainment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">We think the overriding purpose in Brander\u2019s employment in the use of the truck in the town of Klamath is the improvement of the morale of the soldiers in seeking \u201centertainment.\u201d The \u201cmovies, etc.\u201d certainly would include the Indian ceremonial. The government being liable as a private person in California, it is liable where the truck was in use for the broad purpose for which it was employed by Brander, even though he had instruction that he was not \u201cfree\u201d to use it in a particular manner accomplishing that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">This is the converse of the cases of United States v. Eleazer, 4 Cir., 177 F.2d 914, 918 and Rutherford v. United States, D.C.E.D.Tenn., 73 F.Supp. 867, affirmed, 6 Cir., 168 F.2d 70, where the officers were driving their own cars to or from their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The California law as stated in Loper v. Morrison, 23 Cal.2d 600, 605, 606, 145 P.2d 1, 4, is that in determining whether a claimed employee acts within the scope of his employment, among the factors to be considered are \u201cthe intent of the employee, the nature, time, and place of his conduct, his actual and implied authority, the work he was hired to do, <em>the incidental acts that the employer should reasonably have expected would be done, </em>and the amount of freedom allowed the employee in performing his duties.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Among the authorities cited by the California court is the Restatement of Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 228-237, of which \u00a7 230 states, \u201cAn act, although forbidden or done in a forbidden manner, may be within the scope of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Here the uncontradicted ' testimony is that the employing government, through Brander\u2019s superior officers, knew that \u201cas incidental acts\u201d the truck was employed to reach places of entertainment even short distances outside Klamath.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">In another California case, Ryan v. Farrell, 208 Cal. 200, 204, 280 P. 945, 946, the law is stated to be: \u201cIt is.the established rule in this jurisdiction that where the servant is combining his own business with that of his master, or attending to both at substantially the same time, no nice inquiry will be made as to which business the servant was actually engaged in when a third person was injured; but the master will be held responsible, unless it clearly appears that the servant could not have been directly or indirectly serving his master.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Here Brander was seeking the specified entertainment which would improve his military morale. That he was \u201cdirectly or indirectly serving his master\u201d in so doing is none the less within the scope of that employment, because he was serving his own desire and that of the other Sergeant seeking recreation in taking the latter\u2019s two lady friends to the ceremonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court to determine the damages, if any, suffered by each of the appellants and to render judgment for each' for such amounts.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-10\">. 1948 Revised Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b796-17\">. 1948 Revised Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2671.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b798-12\">BONE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AWO\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">I cannot agree with the conclusion reached by my associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">Since the government concedes negligence the only question before us is whether or not the driver of th.e army truck was, at the time the accident occurred, acting within the line of his duties or the scope of his office or employment so as to create liability on the part of the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. That Act , establishes liability only \u201cunder circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable.\u201d Clearly Congress did not intend for the United States, as an employer, to be singled out as standing iii some \u201cpeculiar relationship\u201d to its employees so as to subject the sovereign to greater liability than that imposed upon an ordinary private employer under the \u201claw of the place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-15\">The Fifth Circuit has held that, as used in the Act, \u201cline of duty\u201d is equivalent to \u201cscope of employment\u201d and is to be determined by the doctrine of respondeat superior in the same manner and to the same extent \u00bfs the liability of private persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>under that doctrine is measured in the various states. United States v. Campbell, 5 Cir., 172 F.2d 500, certiorari denied 337 U.S. 957, 69 S.Ct. 1532.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See also Hubsch v. United States, 5 Cir., 174 F.2d 7. I think that these two cases correctly state the proper rule of law, are in point, and (under California law) should control our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The majority opinion states, \u201cIt is not questioned that it was within Sergeant Brander\u2019s line of duty to seek recreation in the town of Klamath.\u201d I disagree with that conclusion. It avoids the question before us. Perhaps Brander was given \u201cpermission\u201d to use the army truck but the majority has apparently confused \u201cline of duty\u201d or \u201cscope of employment\u201d with \u201cpermission\u201d or \u201cauthority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The officer in charge testified that the only \u201cpermission\u201d given was to use the truck for the purpose of transporting the men to town; it was then supposed to be parked alongside a building there. Evidence that this rule had not been strictly enforced might perhaps be sufficient to suggest implied authority to use it for personal purposes. However, it is immaterial whether or not the driver had \u201cpermission\u201d or \u201cauthority\u201d to drive the truck from the center of town to the dance because in so doing he was merely using the truck for his own personal pleasure and not in any manner fulfilling his duties of employment. Even if he had <em>express permission </em>to use the truck for that purpose his employer would not be liable under recognized uniform respondeat superior rules. On this point see 22 A.L.R. 1400, 45 A.L.R. 480, 68 A.L.R. 1053, 80 A.L.R. 727, 122 A.L.R. 858, Restatement of Agency \u00a7 238(b). The California decisions are in accord. Kish v. California State Auto. Ass\u2019n, 190 Cal. 249, 212 P. 27; Kadow v. City of Los Angeles, 31 Cal.App.2d 324, 87 P.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">In the Kadow case it was held that a policeman, who, out of courtesy, was transporting his superior officer from a policemen\u2019s barbecue in Elysian Park to the police station in a city-owned vehicle, was not acting within the scope of his employment. In the Kish case the servant had express authority to use his master\u2019s truck to drive to and from meals and the meals were paid for by the master. The purpose of this permitted use was to allow the employees more time to devote to their work. The accident occurred while the driver was on his way downtown to get his evening meal. Judgment of nonsuit in favor of the employer was sustained. In view of the \u201crecreation-morale\u201d theory adopted in the instant case, it is interesting to note that the California court in the Kish case said [190 Cal. 249, 212 P. 29], \u201cWe cannot assent, to the reasoning of plaintiff that because it was necessary for employees to eat and sleep in order to perform the labor for which they are employed, that these acts are incidental to their employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Section 402 of the California Vehicle Code imposes liability on owners of motor vehicles for acts of drivers who are driving the vehicles with the permission of the owners, without regard to the question of scope of employment. As the trial court correctly pointed out in its opinion, D.C., 79 F.Supp. 925, 928, that statute has no application here because, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, the sovereign surrendered its immunity to suit <em>only </em>where the act in. question is performed within the scope of (here army) employment. I take it that the majority, despite its discussion concerning the Sergeant\u2019s \u201cauthority\u201d to drive the vehicle, does not impose liability on the basis of this California imputed liability' statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The decision of the court appears to rest solely on the ground that recreation and pursuit of pleasure are, as a matter of law, a part of a soldier\u2019s duty and within the scope of his army employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">This is a novel doctrine and one which places upon the government (contrary to the plain terms of the Act) a higher degree of responsibility than rests upon private employers. It opens a vast area of gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>ernmental liability whose boundaries, if any there be, will only be limited by the ingenuity and resourcefulness of our sailors and soldiers in their energetic search for entertainment and diversion. To be sure, soldiers and sailors are permitted to seek and find recreation and enjoyment wholly aside from official duties doubtless with the thought that such \u201coutside\u201d activities will help their morale. A realistic appraisal of such diversions must lead to the conclusion that in general they represent nothing but an expenditure of energies in a restless search for pleasure. To give them the legal status of \u201cduties\u201d incident to the \u201cscope of employment\u201d, of our fighting men will invite, a veritable Niagara of suits based on causes of action which I believe to be entirely .outside the orbit of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The cases relied upon by the majority which concern seamen\u2019s suits for maintenance and cure are not in point. They were based on the long established policy of \u201cencouraging marine commerce and assuring the well-being of seamen.\u201d See Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 318 U.S. 724, 727, 63 S.Ct. at page 932. Legislation in favor of seamen has always been accorded liberal construction by the courts. A recent restatement of that policy is found in Cosmopolitan Shipping Co. v. McAllister, 337 U.S. 783, 790, 69 S.Ct. 1317, 1321, \u201cThe Jones Act [46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688] was welfare legislation that created new rights in seamen for damages arising from maritime torts. As welfare legislation, this statute is entitled to a liberal construction to accomplish its beneficent purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In support of their position the majority finds an analogy in our Ellis v. American Hawaiian S. S. Co., 9 Cir., 165 F.2d 999. But our holding in that case is not authority for our decision in the instant case. In the Ellis case we see exemplified the traditional spirit of liberality displayed (and required) in dealing with a seaman\u2019s claim against his employer for wages, maintenance, care, cure and repatriation to his port of shipment. Our decision was but a reflection of a historic policy which is part of general maritime law\u2014a policy so clearly described by Professor James Henry Willock. 46 U.S.C.A. The claim of Ellis under maritime law for the relief he sought from his employer is in no wise analogous to a situation where Ellis might, have \u25a0 committed an <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> independent tort against a civilian (of the character shown in the instant case) and then an effort be made to impress legal liability on the employer for this wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">For similar policy reasons an opinion of the Attorney General concerning allowance of pensions or other disability benefits seems inapposite! So much may also be said concerning the opinion of a Judge Advocate General who was of the view that engaging in \u201cathletic exercises\u201d is within a soldier\u2019s line of duty. Even so, this is a far. cry from imposing liability on the government for the torts of a soldier merely because he is permitted to \u201cexercise\u201d to aid his morale. Killing a private citizen with an army truck being driven for pleasure purposes is not the equivalent of indulging in bodily exercise for health and morale purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The Federal Tort Claims Act is not in any sense \u201cwelfare legislation\u201d and I see no policy reason for the so-called \u201cliberal construction\u201d we have applied to it. To all of the foregoing may be added the further observation that statutes which relinquish the immunity of the sovereign must be strictly interpreted. United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 590, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">I think that the majority is here assuming that the government somehow stands in loco parentis so far as regards its relationship to members of the armed services. Even if that be true, I take it to be the well established common law rule that parents are not responsible for the torts of their children. Hudson v. Von Hamm, 85 Cal.App. 323, 259 P. 374. Perhaps the instant decision rests, by analogy, upon the \u201cfamily car doctrine\u201d which imposes liability upon the parent for torts committed by children in the course of their driving the family automobile. See Crittenden v. Murphy, 36 Cal.App. 803, 173 P. 595. But if Congress had intended to create broad liability of that character it would have done so in plain terms and only a tortured con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>struction. will expand the Act. to include such a principle of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Sergeant Brander was, at the time of the accident, engaged in the pursuit of his own personal recreation and pleasure, and even though such pursuit would indirectly tend to contribute to the efficient performance of his duties by aiding his \u201cmorale,\u201d (and to that end was encouraged and authorized by his superior officer) such use of the army truck was not incidental to his employment and not within the scope of his employment within the permissible limits of the respondeat superior doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The judgment of the lower court should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-11\">.
