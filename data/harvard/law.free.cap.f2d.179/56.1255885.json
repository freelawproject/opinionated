The Board, in affirming the assessment, held: (1) that the building was not primarily and regularly used for religious worship and study, and therefore was not exempt; and (2) that there was no evidence upon which to base any apportionment of valuation under section 2 of said Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-19\">We agree with the conclusions of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-20\">Although respondent raises a question as to whether an apportionment could, in any event, be made in view of the first conclusion of the Board, as this question need not now be decided we express no opinion concerning it. The decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
