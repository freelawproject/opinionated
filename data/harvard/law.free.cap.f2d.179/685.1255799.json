The part sought to be reversed holds that there was a deficiency of $44,166.54 in respect of petitioner\u2019s excess profits tax<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for tire year ended January 31, 1943. Petitioner contends that, instead of a deficiency of $44,-166.54, there was an overpayment of $91,-637.06. The question presented is whether petitioner\u2019s excess profits tax for the year ended January 31, 1943, was correctly computed by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-26\">In computing that tax, it was necessary to compute petitioner\u2019s adjusted excess profits net income for the year ended January 31, 1943.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In computing that income, it was necessary to compute petitioner\u2019s excess profits credit for each of the years ended January 31, 1941, January 31, 1942, and January 31, 1943.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In computing that credit, it was necessary to compute petitioner\u2019s equity invested capital for each of the years ended January 31, 1941, January 31, 1942, and January 31, 1943.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In computing that capital, &gt;it was necessary to compute petitioner\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits as of the beginning of each of the years ended January 31, 1941, January 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>1942, and January 31, 1943<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2014years which began February 1, 1940, February 1, 1941, and February 1, 1942, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Petitioner, a California corporation, incorporated June 10, 1898, was at all pertinent times engaged in the business of selling personal property on the installment plan. It derived profits from such sales. Such profits were income.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For income tax purposes, it computed such profits on the \u00a1basis provided by 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7 44(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, it was entitled to elect, and did elect, in its return for the year ended January 31, 1943, for the purposes of the excess profits tax, to compute such profits on the basis provided by 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 736(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">On February 1, 1940 (the beginning of the year ended January 31, 1941), on February 1, 1941 (the beginning of the year ended January 31, 1942), and on February 1, 1942 (the beginning of the year ended January 31, 1943), profits from installment sales had accrued to petitioner, but remained uncollected. Such accrued profits were as follows: February 1, 1940, $590,-950.06; February 1, 1941, $693,289.38; February 1, 1942, $817,324.02. These amounts were excluded by the Tax Court in computing petitioner\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits as of February 1,1940, February 1, 1941, and February 1, 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">Petitioner contends that the $590,950.06 should have been included in computing its accumulated earnings and profits as of February 1, 1940; that the $693,289.38 should have been included in computing its accumulated earnings and profits as of February 1, 1941; and that the $817,324.02 should have been included in computing its accumulated earnings and profits as of February 1, 1942, These contentions are based on \u00a7 736(a) and petitioner\u2019s election thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-15\">The $590,950.06 consisted of profits from installment sales made in a taxable year or years beginning before January 1, 1940. Petitioner\u2019s election under \u00a7 736(a) did not and could not apply to such profits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore they were properly excluded in computing petitioner\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits as of February 1, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-16\">The $693,289.38 consisted partly, if not wholly, of profits from installment sales made in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939. Petitioner\u2019s election under \u00a7 736(a) applied to such profits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore they should have been included in computing petitioner\u2019s accumulated earn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ings and profits as of February 1, 1941.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">The Tax Court did not determine, nor can we determine from the record here, whether the whole or only a part of the $693,289.38 consisted of profits from installment sales made in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939, or if only a part, what part of the $693,289.38 consisted of such profits. These determinations should be made 'by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The $817,324.02 consisted partly, if not wholly, of profits from installment sales made in a taxable year or years beginning after December 31, 1939. Petitioner\u2019s election under \u00a7 736(a) applied to such profits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore they should have been included in computing petitioner\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits as of February I, 1942.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The Tax 'Court did not determine, nor can we determine from the record here, whether the whole or only a part of the $817,324.02 consisted of profits from installment sales made in a taxable year or years beginning after December 31, 1939, or, if only a part, what part of the $817,324.02 consisted of such profits. These determinations should be made by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Respondent contends that no part of the $693,289.38 was includible in computing petitioner\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits as of February 1, 1941, and that no part of the $817,324.02 was includible in computing petitioner\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits as of February 1, 1942. In support of these contentions, respondent cites Commissioner v. South Texas Lumber Co., 333 U.S. 496, 68 S.Ct. 695, 92 L.Ed. 831, and certain provisions of \u00a7 29.115-3 of Treasury Regulations 111 and \u00a7\u00a7 35.718-2 and 35.736(a)~2 of Treasury Regulations 112.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-18\">Section 736(a) was not involved in the South Texas Lumber Co. case. Hence that case is not in point here. If and in so far as they support respondent\u2019s contentions, the cited provisions of \u00a7 29.115-3 of Treasury Regulations 111 and \u00a7\u00a7 35.718-2 and 35.736(a)-2 of Treasury Regulations 112 are inconsistent with \u00a7 736(a) and hence are invalid.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-19\">Because of the exclusion of profits which should have been included, the Tax Court\u2019s computation of petitioner\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits as of February 1, 1941, and its computation of petitioner\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits as of February 1, 1942, were incorrect. Consequently its computation of petitioner\u2019s excess profits tax for the year ended January 31, 1943, was also incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-20\">That part of the decision which holds that there was a deficiency of $44,166.54 in respect of petitioner\u2019s excess profits tax for the year ended January 31, 1943, is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-16\">.
