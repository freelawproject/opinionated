The appellants, husband and wife, filed a complaint claiming damages resulting from personal injuries received by appellant-wife as a result of a fall upon the terrazzo floor of a hallway within the Municipal Center Building, Washington, D. C., as the result of defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ant permitting water or other liquid or substance to remain on said floor to such an extent to cause the floor to become dangerous and unfit for the use of persons walking upon it, of which condition the defendant knew or, by the exercise of reasonable care, should have known. This allegation as to the defective condition complained of was amplified by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel upon argument of the motion for summary judgment to the effect that the wet condition of the floor was caused by drippings from raincoats, umbrellas and other apparel of persons entering the Municipal Center on a rainy day. The Municipal Center Building was owned by the District and was occupied as the District City Hall. The plaintiffs had entered said building for the purpose of visiting a branch of the Metropolitan Police Department located therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The facts were not in dispute. The motion, supported by affidavits, showed that the new Municipal Center was completed in 1941; that due to the existing National Emergency of World War II, the District of Columbia Commissioners had been informed previously that they were expected to cooperate with the War Program of the Federal Government, and just prior to the opening of the Municipal Center Building, the Commissioners were notified specifically that the Federal Public Buildings Administration desired a portion of the new building to temporarily house part of the War Department. On April 28, 1941, such an arrangement was consummated by written agreement providing that the District would operate and maintain the building, and the United States Government would transfer funds to the credit of the District in an amount sufficient to reimburse the District for costs of operation and maintenance in the proportion which the number of square feet of office space occupied by the War Department bore to the total number of square feet of office space in the building, plus some adjustments for costs of additional telephone facilities and temporary alterations of wall partitions occasioned by the War Department occupancy. This allocation of maintenance expenses was computed to be $.6215 per square foot per an-num. By July 1, 1942, this computation was found to be too low, and the figure of $1.00 per square foot was substituted. Such figure was approximately one-third of the rental paid on the open market for comparable space in Washington office buildings, and was approximately one-half of the rental paid by the Federal Public Buildings Administration for rental of office space in privately owned office buildings in the District. There was also located in the building a cafeteria, operated by a private corporation for the convenience of employees in the building, which was occupied rent-free. There was also a lunch stand located in a corridor alcove of the building, operated by the Washington Society for the Blind free of rent. The War Department occupied 70,197 square feet out of the total 278,332 square feet of the building. Such War Department occupancy was temporary during the War Emergency and has since ceased. The building is now solely occupied by District municipal departments and the said cafeteria and lunch stand. At the time plaintiff-wife received the injuries complained of, during May, 1946, in addition .to the aforesaid temporary War Department occupancy, the following District governmental departments occupied the balance of the available office space in said building:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">Alcoholic Beverage Control Board</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACF\">Barber Board</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ay-dedup-0\">Boxing Commission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">City Refuse Division</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A18\"><em>Cosmetology </em>Board</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aq-dedup-0\">District of Columbia National Guard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApW\">Fire Department</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">Health Department</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azc\">Department of Insurance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC_\">License Bureau</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aom\">Mental Health Commission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9J\">Minimum Wage Board</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"an-dedup-0\">Metropolitan Police Department</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aij\">Parole Board</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhU\">Board of Public Welfare</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ab-dedup-0\">Special Finance Unit of the Office of the Tax Assessor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">Superintendent of District Buildings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP9\">Department of Vehicles and Traffic</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABT\">Department of Weights and Measures</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">It is plaintiffs\u2019 position that, because at the time of the accident a portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>of the available space in this building had been temporarily occupied by the War Department under an arrangement whereby part of its appropriation .was allocated to the District to defray a pro rata share of costs of maintenance, the District was engaging in a proprietary function, renting office space, rather than in a governmental function, which deprived the District temporarily of the governmental immunity which it would normally have against suits brought by residents of the District for injuries allegedly received in the building while such residents were participating in District governmental functions. It is conceded that the War Department was solely engaged in governmental functions in the space it occupied. No very strenuous contention is made that the operation of the cafeteria and lunch room rent-free changes the legal significance to any great extent. That such incidental use does not preclude application of the governmental immunity defense, see: Hartness v. Allegheny County, 349 Pa. 248, 37 A.2d 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">In granting judgment for the defendant, the trial court very succinctly disposed of the issues in a memorandum reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">\u201cThe rental by the District government of part of the Municipal Building on Indiana Avenue to certain agencies of the United States government on a non-profit basis, as is the case here, does not create a proprietary function. The maintenance of the building is a governmental function and the District of Columbia therefore is not liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">\u201cNor can the condition of the lobby on the day the accident happened be held a nuisance. The floor was wet and slippery due to weather conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The appellants\u2019 brief admits, in effect, that there is a great divergence of .opinion among the courts of the various states as to just what activities engaged in by municipalities are held to be within or without the line of demarcation between governmental and proprietary functions. The District\u2019s main reliance is placed upon Loube v. District of Columbia, 1937, 67 App.D.C. 322, 92 F.2d 473, which reviews a number of cases prior thereto and reaches the conclusion that, if the municipality is engaged in rendering a service rather than selling a commodity, and if that service be governmental, it does not become proprietary because a charge is made for it. Applying that principle to the facts as shown by this record, in acceding to the United States Government\u2019s demands that a portion of this building should be allocated for temporary use of the Government\u2019s War Department during a War Emergency, under an arrangement whereby a part of an appropriation for housing the War Department was allocated to cover the War Department\u2019s pro rata share of building operating expenses, the District was rendering a public service in aid of the war effort and not stepping out of its role of performing governmental functions so as to be deemed to be engaging in the business of renting office space. The trial court properly held that during May, 1946, the District was engaged in a governmental function in operating this building.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Appellants also seek to avoid the impact of the general governmental immunity doctrine by contending that the condition of the floor at the time of the accident might be considered a nuisance. The trial court very aptly disposed of this argument by stating, \u201cNor can the condition of the lobby on the day the 'accident happened be held a nuisance. The floor was wet and slippery due to weather conditions.\u201d A good analysis of the legal philosophy relating to a municipality\u2019s liability for nuisance is contained in Pearson v. Kansas City, 1932, 331 Mo. 885, 55 S.W.2d 485, 488, 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">The concluding paragraphs of appellants\u2019 brief, pointing out that the question of. a municipal corporation\u2019s liability in tort is in a confused state of authority, and suggesting that this court change the law of this District to make it conform to the Congressional intent as to the general Federal Government\u2019s liability for torts free from the defense of governmental immunity, as expressed in the Federal Tort Claims Act of August 2, 1946, ch. 753, 60 Stat. 842, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671 et seq. should be addressed to the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>rather than to this court. As stated by Professor Smith in \u201cMunicipal Tort Liability,\u201d 48 Mich.L.Rev. 41, 56, \u201cAdequate reformation can be achieved only by legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
