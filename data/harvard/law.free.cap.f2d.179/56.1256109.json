Failure to sue or obtain such decree was also alleged, wherefore appellant prayed for specific performance of the agreement and $300 damages, or for $1200 \u201cif specific performance is not granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The court dismissed the action, holding in effect that under the agreement appellant\u2019s only remedy was by way of a civil action in the Municipal Court for $2000, with tender of a reconveyance deed. We agree with this holding. As a money claim for less than $3000 falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Municipal Court (Title 11, \u00a7 755(a), D.C.Code (1940), Supplement VI), the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
