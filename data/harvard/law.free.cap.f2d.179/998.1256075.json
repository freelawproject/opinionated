The polymer is in the form of a suspension which may be \u201cthe emulsions frequently formed in the production of the polymerized product.\u201d The emulsion may be concentrated by evaporation or by adding powered product, \u201cor its viscosity may be increased by some other colloido-chemical process so that it becomes fit to form the desired layer.\u201d It is stated in the specification that in the process of the patent \u201cthe polymerization product is brought into the form of a homogeneous aqueous suspension adapted to be spread in a uniform layer.\u201d When such layer has been produced, the liquid in the paste, generally water, is evaporated and the temperature raised above the softening point of the polymerization product, which results in the coalescence of the polymerization material by the aforesaid heating and subjecting it to high pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">The patent to Haux relates to a method for plasticizing a synthetic resin, forming it into a transparent sheet, usable, among other purposes, as the interlayer in safety glass. The patent discloses a method of forming such sheets in which an aqueous suspension of polyvinyl acetal or polyvinyl chloride acetate is deposited on a screen as a layer. The layer, which is dried by pressing and heating, forms the transparent sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>The Henderson patent relates to a mixture of polymerized materials and discloses a method of forming a composition comprising a mixture of polyvinyl chloride with a butadiene-acrylic nitrile copolymer. The polyvinyl chloride may be commingled by milling it with the copolymer until a homogeneous mass is obtained. The mixture is tough, strong, resilient, and resistant, forming a clear homogeneous film when stretched. The product is brought into final shape by extruding, molding, calendering and the like, and subsequently vulcanized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Both of the tribunals of the Patent Office rejected all of the claims except those drawn to the nonelected species on the Haux or the British patent in view of the patent of Henderson, so that if one or.the other rejection should be deemed proper by us, the decision of the board must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">It may be noted that the process steps set out in claim 1 are as follows: the; casting of a material on a support; drying the film on the support; heating the film to from about 275\u00b0 to about 350\u00b0F.; cooling the film; and stripping it from the support. It is clear that the British patent discloses the casting of a material on a support; drying the film on the support; and heating the film at a temperature of 80\u00b0 to 150\u00b0 C., which is the equivalent of 176\u00b0 to 302\u00b0F. The temperatures recited in the patent, therefore, overlap the range defined by claim 1, thus satisfying the temperature requirement of the claim. The steps of cooling and stripping the film are certainly implied in the process of the patent because the material there is heated to a temperature above the softening point, and obviously could not be stripped from the support until it had cooled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">We find nothing in the appealed claims which would preclude the use of the pressing limitation disclosed in the process of the British patent. Those claims contain the broad statement that the process \u201ccomprises\u201d the steps, and therefore may not be held to exclude the use of additional steps to those set out in the claims. In re Horvitz, 168 F.2d 522, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1239, 1244; In re Lincoln et al., 150 F.2d 576, 32 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1213, 1216; In re Cone, 121 F.2d 470, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">In view of what we have hereinbefore stated, it is clear that the rejected claims distinguish from the process of the British patent only in the specific material that is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">It is stated in the decision of the board that counsel for. appellant did not seriously contend that the patent to Henderson does not anticipate the compositions set out in the involved claims. Apparently, as appears in that decision, counsel for appellant argued that the milling together of the components in the Henderson patent will not produce a clear homogeneous transparent film.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">In their brief and oral argument before us, it is contended by counsel for appellant that the essence of the alleged invention resides in the form of the starting material, which is of mixed latices of specifically defined components, thus differing from the material of the Henderson patent. Counsel argue that neither the Haux nor Henderson patent discloses or suggests a process using a latex in any form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">With respect to the Henderson patent, counsel for appellant contend that the disclosure therein is merely for a mill mixing of solid vinyl chloride resin with solid butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, whereby those materials are fully blended so as to be adapted for vulcanized insulation or the like. It is vigorously urged that it was novel to discover that such components could be brought into the form of mixed latices, the property of which produces novel results.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">It is conceded in the brief for appellant that in the Henderson patent may be found the suggestion that the powdered components set out therein will form a \u201cclear homogeneous film when stretched,\u201d but it is argued that nowhere in the patent is it stated that the film is transparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-13\">It is stated in appellant\u2019s brief that the invention of the British patent comprises suspending the powered resin in water, and, as so suspended, to spread it on a polished metal plate for water evaporation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>Counsel then point out that in the British patent it is necessary to use pressure on the material to form a transparent film, and that such pressing stage is essential, but that by the use of appellant\u2019s mixed latices, the pressing step is eliminated. We have already disposed of the contention of appellant concerning the step of pressing, and therefore it is unnecessary to discuss it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">With respect to the statement in the Henderson patent that suspension may be derived . from the emulsion frequently formed by the production of the polymerized product, counsel for appellant argue that from the context of the patent it is clear that the word \u201cemulsions\u201d is used synonymously with the word \u201csuspensions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">As has already been observed, the board stated that counsel for appellent did not seriously contend that the Henderson patent does not anticipate the composition set out in the involved claims, and that statement has neither been challenged nor assigned as error in appellant\u2019s reasons of appeal. The principal contention of counsel for appellant here is that the references do not suggest the use of the starting materials in the form of latex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">For the reason that we must consider that the Henderson patent anticipates the composition recited in the involved claims, there remains for consideration the question as to whether or not the process of the British patent teaches or suggests the use of a latex or its equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">Appellant uses the terms to signify artificial or synthetic preparations. It certainly follows that whatever meaning appellant had in mind when he used the word, since it does not correspond to the definition of natural latex, such meaning should have been set out in his application. There is nothing there to indicate, as stated in the brief of appellant, that the latices of the application are \u201ccolloidal dispersions with extremely minute particles of vinyl chloride resin or butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer rubber as the case may be of the order of less than one micron in diameter or ultra microscopic in size.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">That there are definitions of the term \u201clatex,\u201d which include artificial preparations, is conceded by the solicitor. Appellant has called to our attention the following publications: <em>Concise Chemical and, Technical Dictionary, </em>Chemical Publishing Co. (1947); <em>Van Nostrand\u2019s Scientific Encyclopedia, </em>2d Ed., Van Nostrand Co. (1947) ; <em>The Condensed Chemical Dictionary, </em>3d Ed., Reinhold Publishing Co. (1942); and <em>The Chemistry of Synthetic Resins, </em>Carleton Ellis, Vol. II, Reirihold Publishing Co. (1935). In those publications and others which we have had occasion to consult, including <em>Modern Rubber Chemistry </em>by Barron, published by D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., we do not find any definition limiting the term to any particular degree of fineness, and therefore we conclude that the bare use of the term \u201clatex\u201d is not limited to a stable dispersion or to one of any particular degree of fineness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-12\">Counsel for appellant vigorously contend that the sentence appearing in the decision of the board, \u201cA \u2018latex\u2019 is\u00bb described as colloidal dispersion of the components in an aqueous medium, and simulating the latex of natural rubber\u201d, was an \u201cunequivocal finding by the Board, doubtless based upon appellant\u2019s disclosure and perhaps upon other scientific definitions of the word or data with which the Board was familiar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-13\">Clearly appellant\u2019s disclosure contains no basis for such an alleged unequivocal finding. The board did not point out where the description was found nor whether it was considered accurate. In the reply memorandum of the solicitor filed in answer to a reply memorandum by counsel for appellant, our attention was directed to the fact that the description of the latex appears in a footnote to a brief filed on behalf of appellant and appearing in the record hereof. Seemingly the board quoted in effect that definition. That in our opinion does not constitute the unequivocal finding alleged by counsel for appellant. Even had the board made such express holding, if it were contrary to fact it would not be controlling here. In re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>Lewenstein, 165 F.2d 458, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">It is stated in appellant\u2019s specification that the latices \u201cmay be any stable dispersions of vinyl resins.\u201d It seems to us that such dispersions, whether colloidal or not, are contemplated as coming within the scope of the invention, and it also would indicate that the term \u201clatex\u201d is broad enough to include unstable dispersions. Otherwise stable dispersions would not be mentioned, unless in the opinion of appellant there were such preparations which were not stable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">It may be here pointed out that according to the British patent the suspensions used may consist of emulsions produced in the making of the polymerized product. \u201cEmulsion\u201d is defined in <em>Hackh\u2019s Chemical Dictionary, </em>Third Edition, as consisting of \u201ca microscopically heterogeneous mixture of two phases.\u201d Therefore, according to that definition, the particles would be of fine size. We think that the Primary Examiner was correct in stating that the suspensions mentioned in the British patent \u201cmay be formed by the polymerization of an emulsion of the monomer and thus may be a \u2018latex\u2019 wherein the polymer particles are of colloidal dimensions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">We cannot not agree that there is a vital distinction between the \u201chomogeneous aqueous suspensions\u201d of the British patent and the \u201cstable 'dispersions\u201d mentioned in the involved application, as contended by counsel for appellant. Hackh defines \u201csuspension\u201d as being the same as \u201csuspensoid.\u201d The latter term is defined as \u201cA mixture of finely divided, colloidal particles in a liquid\u2014the particles are so small that they do not settle but are kept in motion by 'the motion molecules of the liquid (Brownian motion).\u201d Therefore, it appears to us that the material set out in the British patent may be in the form of \u201cLatex.\u201d In any event, the term as used by appellant has not been clearly enough defined to present a patentable distinction between the form of his material and that of the British reference. It is our opinion that invention would not be involved in using the material of the Henderson patent in the British process, and that such use would entirely fill the requirements of the claims on appeal, arid be obvious to one skilled in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">Several affidavits made by employees of The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, assignee of the involved application, were filed herein, and we agree with the statement of the solicitor in' his brief that those affidavits set out opinions as to what the references disclose and the reports of experiments'said to show that the disclosure of those patents produce inoperative or unsatisfactory results. \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">We do not deem it necessary, to discuss the matters set but in the affidavits. The opinion portions thereof are inadmissible. In re Voit, 152 F.2d 987, 990, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 737, 742; In re Pierce, 35 F.2d 781, 17 C.C.P.A., Patents, 626; In re Garrett, 27 App.D.C. 19. As to the experiments, it is sufficient to state that the comparative superiority of appellant\u2019s \u2022process over the references considered alone can not be controlling. It may further be observed, but in no way reflecting on the good faith of the makers of the affidavits that \u201c * * * the failures of experimenters who have no interest in succeeding should not be accorded great weight,\u201d as was stated in the case of In re Michalek, 162 F.2d 229, 232, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1124. Therefore, we do not think that the affidavits herein should be considered as having much weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">For the reason hereinbefore set out, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">By reason of illness, HATFIELD, Judge, was not present at the argument of this case and did not participate in the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
