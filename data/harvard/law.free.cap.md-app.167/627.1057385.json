Uhl\u2019s estate, there are haunting echoes of <em>Jamdyce and Jarndyce.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Ironically, what is now before us, even nine years down the track, is not yet an appeal from a decision boasting finality, but only the third attempt to have this Court intervene in a work still painfully in progress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The allusion to <em>Jarndyce and, Jarndyce </em>is no mere literary flourish. This case, as will become clear, could literally end up the same way. A seventy-seven-year old widow left an uncomplicated estate, worth approximately $262,000 according to the Sixth and Final Administration Account of April 22, 2005, to her two sisters-in-law. One of them only outlived the testatrix by seven years and, therefore, collected nothing. The other, when the dust finally settles and all bills are in, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>could end up with little more than enough to buy a cup of coffee. Such a shocking result, should it come to pass, could bring down the glare of intense public scrutiny on the question of how such a travesty could be permitted to come about. We will not get to address that issue, however, because of an insurmountable preliminary hurdle. Our focus will be exclusively on the threshold issue of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">A Long, Long Trail Awinding</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">As well befits a case that has lingered long in \u201cchancery,\u201d its procedural trail is, or is rapidly becoming, labyrinthine. Viola M. Uhl died in Baltimore County on September 4, 1996. It has ultimately been established that she left a Last Will and Testament, signed by her on February 26, 1969, that was supplemented by a Codicil, signed by her on June 24, 1995.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dorothy Uhl Banashak and Margaret Uhl Thelen were the sisters-in-law of the testatrix and were initially the exclusive legatees under that Will and Codicil.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The estate itself, represented by Gerard William Wittstadt, Sr., as its successor personal representative, is the formal appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Complicating matters from the outset was an ostensible subsequent Last Will and Testament, allegedly executed by Viola Uhl on July 1, 1996. Unfortunately for the procedural history of this case, the ostensible Last Will and Testament of July 1, 1996 won the race to the courthouse door, and thereby hangs the tale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Phase 1: September 20, 1996-April 13, 2000</p>\n<p id=\"AoX\">Tenure of Charles Kresslein, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">As Personal Representative/ Special Administrator</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">On September 18, 1996, two weeks after Viola Uhl\u2019s death, Charles H. Kresslein, Jr., Esq., filed a Petition for Probate with the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore County, seeking the administrative probate of the July 1, 1996 Will. An order was signed by the Register of Wills on September 20, admitting the July 1, 1996 Will to probate and appointing Charles Kresslein, Jr. as personal representative of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The provisions of the ostensible Will of July 1,1996, differed dramatically from those that had been made by Viola Uhl in her Will of 1969, supplemented by the Codicil of 1995. Whereas in her earlier Will, Viola Uhl had left her entire estate to her two sisters-in-law, the ostensible Will of July 1, 1996, left her home, along with its contents, \u201cto my friend Opal Bowling.\u201d Of the remainder of the estate, 10% was left to each of the two sisters-in-law. Fifty percent was left to Marlene E. Higgins and her husband, James W. Higgins. Fifteen percent of the remainder of the estate was left to \u201cmy dear friend and attorney Charles H. Kresslein, Jr.\u201d In addition to being a legatee, Mr. Kresslein had 1) prepared the Will, 2) been one of the two witnesses to the Will, and 3) was appointed in the Will as personal representative. The remaining 15% was bequeathed to \u201cmy dear friend and financial advisor John R. Cameron,\u201d who was also the other witness to the ostensible signing of the Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Charles Kresslein, Jr. had, five weeks earlier, also prepared a Will, which Viola Uhl ostensibly signed on May 28, 1996. The only difference between the two 1996 Wills was that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>July 1 version included the devise of the real property to Opal Bowling, which the May 28 version had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">On March 17, 1997, the appellants filed with the Orphans\u2019 Court a Petition to Caveat the Last Will and Testament of July 1; 1996. In the nine-page petition, they alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>1) the existence of the 1969 Will and 1995 Codicil; 2) that Viola Uhl was not, as of the time of the ostensible July 1, 1996 Will, of sound and disposing mind and lacked the testamentary capacity to execute a valid will; 3) that Viola Uhl had been subjected to undue influence by the new legatees who had been in a relationship of trust and confidence with her, especially Charles Kresslein, Jr.; and 4) that the ostensible July 1, 1996 Will had not actually been signed by Viola Uhl nor by any other person on her behalf and by her direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The petition also specifically requested that Charles Kres-slein, Jr. be removed as Personal Representative and that an independent special administrator be appointed. On March 18, an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court directed Mr. Kresslein to answer the Petition to Caveat within 20 days. It also informed him 1) that, pursuant to Maryland Code, Estates and Trusts Article, \u00a7 5-207(b) and \u00a7 6-307, the administrative probate was now a judicial probate and 2) that his official status vis-a-vis the estate was changed from that of Personal Representative to that of Special Administrator. See <em>Carrick v. Henley, </em>44 Md.App. 124, 407 A.2d 765 (1979). On April 4, Mr. Kresslein filed his Answer to the Petition to Caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Charles Kresslein, Jr. hired the law firm of his son, Charles J. Kresslein, Esq., to defend the caveat. On September 18, 1997, Charles Kresslein, Jr. filed with the Orphans\u2019 Court a Petition for Attorneys\u2019 Fees in the amount of $5,355.93. The appellants filed an exception to that petition on September 26 and requested that a hearing be held. A little over six months later, on April 7, 1998, a hearing was held on the pending fee petition. As a result of that hearing, the Orphans\u2019 Court, on April 9, issued an Order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">\n<em>The Personal Representative failed to establish that he is defending the Caveat in good faith and with just cause.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The Court finds that <em>the Personal Representative has a, conflict of interest. He drafted the will, witnessed, the will, named himself Personal Representative and also included a 15% specific bequest to himself.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">It is therefore Ordered on this 9th day of April, 1998, the Orphans\u2019 Court shall defer all attorney fees requested by Charles H. Kresslein, Jr., Esq. until the conclusion of the Caveat litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">All attorney fees shall be returned to the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">Mr. <em>Charles H. Kresslein, Jr., Esq. shall voluntarily resign </em>until the conclusion of the Caveat proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">If the will dated July 1, 1996 prevails, the named Personal Representative shall be reinstated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">The Court order dated September 26, 1997 is hereby rescinded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">That fee petition for the payment of $5,355.93 to the former law firm of Charles J. Kresslein is not one of the petitions still before the Orphans\u2019 Court for resolution and forming the basis for this appeal. Although on September 26, 1997, the Orphans\u2019 Court ordered that the requested fee be paid to the law firm, that order was later rescinded as part of the decision on April 9, 1998. The successor firm to that law firm advised the Orphans\u2019 Court on January 28, 2005, that it was making no claim against the estate for legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">On October 21, 1997, Mr. Kresslein switched legal representation from his son\u2019s law firm to the law office of Edward B. Rybczynski, Esq. Mr. Rybczynski was the attorney of record for the estate at the hearing of April 7, 1998. On May 7, Mr. Rybczynski appealed the Orphans\u2019 Court decision of April 9 to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, asking for a trial <em>de novo </em>pursuant to Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-502. On July 27, 1998, the Circuit Court dismissed that <em>de novo </em>appeal for reason that the appeal was premature in that it was not from a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>In the meantime, Mr. Kresslein had disputed the statement made by the Orphans\u2019 Court that he had, apparently in chambers, agreed voluntarily to resign as personal representative/special administrator.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When he refused to resign, the appellants, on June 17, petitioned the Orphans\u2019 Court to remove him as Personal Representative (actually as Special Administrator). The appellants followed up, on July 10, with a Motion to Specifically Enforce Agreement Regarding Resignation of Charles H. Kresslein, Jr., as \u201cPersonal Representative.\u201d On July 31, the Orphans\u2019 Court, without holding a full evidentiary hearing, ordered Mr. Kresslein to resign.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">1. ORDERED that the Motion to Specifically Enforce the Agreement of Charles H. Kresslein, Jr. to resign as Personal Representative of the Estate of Viola M. Uhl is hereby <em>GRANTED: </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">2. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that <em>Charles H. Kres-slein, Jr., is hereby directed to resign as Personal Representative </em>of the Estate of Viola M. Uhl until the conclusion of the caveat proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">There followed the first appeal to this Court. Our decision of December 20, 1999, reversed the July 31, 1998 order of the Orphans\u2019 Court because Mr. Kresslein had requested the right to call witnesses and had erroneously been denied the right to \u201ca plenary hearing on the question of his removal as personal representative.\u201d Although this Court remanded the case so that a full evidentiary hearing could be conducted on the question of Mr. Kresslein\u2019s removal, such a hearing never came to pass. On March 22, 2000, Charles Kresslein, Jr., submitted a written letter of resignation as Personal Representative, to be effective 20 days later.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>One has to wonder why, after spending four years and thousands of dollars to defend his incumbency, Mr. Kresslein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>would suddenly throw in the towel. A gargantuan effort had produced nothing. What, then, was the purpose and what was the motive for conducting such a \u201cscorched-earth\u201d defense in the first place? <em>Carrick v. Henley, </em>44 Md.App. 124, 126-31, 407 A.2d 765 (1979), confirms the legal right of a personal representative acting as a special administrator to defend his incumbency, but it does not answer the question of why he should choose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The appellants petitioned for the appointment of an independent Special Administrator. On April 13, 2000, the Orphans\u2019 Court officially accepted the resignation, as of that date, of Charles H. Kresslein, Jr., as \u201cPersonal Representative.\u201d With that termination of the tenure of Charles Kres-slein, Jr. as Personal Representative/Special Administrator, the first distinct phase of this litigation came to an end. That phase had lasted for three and one-half years \u2014 from September 18, 1996 through April 13, 2000. For two and one-half of those years, Mr. Kresslein had retained the legal services for the estate of Edward B. Rybczynski and Kenneth A. Bogan, whose joint Petition for Allowance of Counsel Fees is one of the two petitions that are still in litigation and are the subject matter of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The great bulk, although not necessarily all, of the legal work done during that period consisted of defending against the appellants\u2019 efforts to have Mr. Kresslein removed as the \u201cPersonal Representative\u201d of the estate. The more prominent adjudicative events in the course of that defense were 1) the Orphans\u2019 Court hearing of April 7, 1998; 2) the abortive attempt to appeal the results of that hearing to the circuit court; 3) the hearing before the Orphans\u2019 Court of July 29, 1998, leading to the removal of Mr. Kresslein as \u201cPersonal Representative\u201d on July 31, 1998; and 4) the first appeal to this Court resulting in our reversal of that dismissal order on December 20,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Phase II: April 13, 2000-January 5, 2005</p>\n<p id=\"AG3\">Tenure of Thomas Renner as Special Administrator</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">In that same proceeding on April 13, 2000, the Orphans\u2019 Court appointed Thomas James Renner, Esq., as Special Administrator of the estate. The tenure of Thomas Renner in that capacity continued for almost five additional years, from April 13, 2000 through January 5, 2005. Whereas the first phase of the overall litigation had involved largely the ultimately unsuccessful defense of Charles Kresslein, Jr., against the efforts to have him removed as Personal Representative/Special Administrator, the second phase, during the tenure of Thomas Renner, involved essentially the basic merits of the caveat. On April 21, 2000, Marlene and James Higgins, two of the legatees under the purported Will of July 1, 1996, moved for leave to intervene in the case and to file their own answers to the petition to caveat. Permission was granted and the Higginses participated in all subsequent caveat proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Other than the flurry of petitions for attorneys\u2019 fees, amended petitions for attorneys\u2019 fees, and prompt exceptions to every such petition, the next step forward in the progress of the case took place on October 10, 2001, when the Orphans\u2019 Court, after a petition, an amended petition, a second amended petition, the filing of legal memoranda by both caveators and caveatees, and a hearing, framed seven issues for fact-finding by a circuit court jury pursuant to Maryland Rule 6-434. See <em>Hill v. Lewis, </em>21 Md.App. 121, 125-32, 318 A.2d 850 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Almost three years went by, however, before those jury findings were forthcoming because of yet another appellate interruption. The appellants, aggrieved at the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court not to frame an additional issue, appealed that decision to this Court. The appellants wanted the jury specifically to determine whether Charles Kresslein, Jr., as both the preparer of the July 1, 1996 Will and a legatee under the Will, was guilty of a violation of Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>A lawyer shall not prepare an instrument giving the lawyer </em>or a person related to the lawyer as parent, child, sibling or spouse <em>any substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, </em>except where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">(1) the client is related to the donee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">(2) the client is represented by independent counsel in connection with the gift.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Ruling that the \u201csame evidence that would be admissible to prove a violation of the Rule would be admissible to establish either fraud or undue influence,\u201d we held that the question was unnecessary and affirmed the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court not to transmit it. <em>Banashak v. Renner, </em>No.1936, September Term, 2001, 148 Md.App. 714 (filed December 9, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">We would like to have been able to ask, could we have been transported back to October 10, 2001, both caveators and caveatees alike, \u201cEven if you win, in terms of one issue more or less will it have been worth three years?\u201d \u201cAnd thousands of dollars?\u201d The question, of course, cuts both ways. \u201cIs it worth pushing?\u201d \u201cIs it worth opposing?\u201d Perhaps this is good reason why Orphans\u2019 Court judges need to be able to look over the shoulders of special administrators, if not of others. Perhaps some neutral referee should be able to make the overriding judgment that the dance is sometimes not worth the candle.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Following the remand from this Court, the remaining issues were sent to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on May 22, 2003. A six day jury trial commenced on June 16, 2004 (eleven months later), and on June 24 the jury returned the following answers to the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">1. <em>Were the last Will and Testament </em>of Viola M. Uhl dated February 26, 1969 <em>and the First Codicil </em>to said Will dated June 24, 1995 <em>revoked </em>after the making thereof and before July 1, 1996, including by any other paper writing purporting to be her Last Will and Testament?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-11\">X Yes No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>2. Was <em>the paper writing </em>dated July 1, 1996, purporting to be the Last Will and Testament of Viola M. Uhl, <em>signed by her or by some other person for her in her presence </em>and by her express direction, and attested and subscribed in her presence by two or more credible witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">X Yes No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">3. <em>Were the contents </em>of the paper writing dated July 1, 1996, purporting to be the Last Will and Testament of Viola M. Uhl, <em>read to or by her, or known to her at </em>or before the time of the alleged execution thereof?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">X Yes No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">4. <em>Was the paper writing </em>dated July 1, 1996, purporting to be the Last Will and Testament <em>of </em>Viola M. Uhl, <em>executed by her when she was legally competent </em>to make a valid Will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">X Yes No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-13\">5. Was <em>the paper writing </em>dated July 1, 1996, purporting to be the Last Will and Testament of Viola M. Uhl, <em>procured by undue influence </em>exercised and practiced upon her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-14\">X Yes No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-16\">6. <em>Is the paper writing </em>bearing the date of July 1, 1996, <em>the Last Will and Testament [oj] Viola M. Uhl?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-17\">X Yes No</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-19\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-20\">After those jury findings were reported back to the Orphans\u2019 Court, that court, on October 25, 2004, entered an Order declaring that the purported Will of July 1, 1996 was not the valid Last Will and Testament of Viola M. Uhl, and declared that July 1,1996 document to be \u201cNULL and VOID.\u201d In the meantime, Gerard William Wittstadt, Sr., on October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>21, 2004, offered for judicial probate the February 26, 1969 Last Will and Testament and June 24, 1995 Codicil of Viola Uhl.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Not yet down for the count, however, both Mr. Renner and the Higginses urged on the Orphans\u2019 Court the proposition that the jury findings of June 24, 2004 had only found the July 1, 1996 document to be null and void and had made no such finding with respect to the purported Will of May 28, 1996. That argument was made notwithstanding the fact that the May 28, 1996 document had been introduced into evidence at the jury trial as a joint exhibit and had been the subject of extensive testimony during the trial. The jury finding, moreover, that the 1969 Will and 1995 Codicil had not been revoked \u201cby any other paper writing purporting to be her Last Will and Testament\u201d would appear to have been equally fatal to both 1996 documents alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The Orphans\u2019 Court nevertheless conducted yet another plenary hearing on December 8, 2004, at which extensive portions of the circuit court record, including papers contained in the court file, exhibits offered into evidence, and transcripts of much of the testimony before the jury were presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Eight and one-half years after it began, the caveat phase of this litigation officially ground to an apparent halt on January 5, 2005, when the Orphans\u2019 Court issued a four-page Memorandum Opinion and Order. That Order ruled that the May 28, 1996 document was invalid, just as the July 1, 1996 document had been invalid. Mr. Renner\u2019s tenure as Special Administrator, which had lasted almost five years, was over. The caveators had won, but had they won anything more than a Pyrrhic victory? When all the wreckage has been cleared away, will there be anything, other than wounded pride, worth salvaging?</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Phase III: January 5, 2005-Present</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Tenure of Gerard Wittstadt as Personal Representative</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">That same Memorandum Opinion and Order admitted to judicial probate Viola Uhl\u2019s February 26, 1969 Last Will and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Testament along with her June 24, 1995 Codicil. Former Judge Gerard W. Wittstadt, Sr., who had prepared both the 1969 Will before going on the bench and the 1995 Codicil after retiring from the bench, was appointed as the Personal Representative of the estate. That probate, in its own right, would appear to be moving toward a quick and uncontroversial conclusion. That conclusion, however, must abide the disposition of two still unresolved sequelae of the eight and one-half year caveat proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Two Fee Petitions</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Although the merits of the caveat had at long last been resolved, the brooding question of fees for legal work done during the course of that caveat had not. This straggler issue promises to be more problematic than the caveat itself. The Order of the Orphans\u2019 Court of April 9, 1998, had deferred all questions of attorney fees \u201cuntil the conclusion of the caveat litigation.\u201d See <em>National Wildlife Federation v. Foster, </em>83 Md.App. 484, 495-500, 575 A.2d 776 (1990). Two petitions for attorneys\u2019 fees were still before the Orphans\u2019 Court when it scheduled a hearing for February 16, 2005, to consider the Fee Petitions and the Exceptions thereto that had been filed by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The first of the two petitions was the joint petition filed by. Edward B. Rybczynski and Kenneth A. Bogdan on January 16, 2001. Exceptions were filed by the appellants. The amount of the fee ultimately requested is $29,886. That fee petition described the essential nature of the legal work done during those years:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">a. Defense of the Caveat Proceeding instituted by Banas-hak and Thelen;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">b. Defense and Appeal of the Objection [to] Counsel Fees filed by Banashak and Thelen;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">c. Defense and Appeal of the attempts by Banashak and Thelen improperly to remove the Personal Representative; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">d. Administration of the estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>The series of petitions for fees submitted by Thomas J. Renner, the Special Administrator of the Estate between April 13, 2000, and January 5, 2005, is a bit more blurred, because they combine claims for 1) legal fees and 2) commissions due to Mr. Renner in his capacity as Special Administrator.

Implicit in the discussion in <em>Wolfe v. Turner, </em>267 Md. at 657-58, 299 A.2d 106, is the need for the Orphans\u2019 Court to be able to look at a total figure, so that it can assess that total in its relation to value of the estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0P\">[T]he commissions allowed a personal representative and the fee allowed his counsel should be considered together by the orphans\u2019 court. Had he disclosed this in this petition, <em>the revelation that total expenses of administering a $h3,000.00 estate would amount to $9,700.00 could well have been regarded as unreasonable or unfair.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">With respect to attorneys\u2019 fees, Mr. Renner is an attorney and he, as Special Administrator, employed his own legal services, as well as those of three other attorneys, all associated with the law firm of Nolan, Plumhoff &amp; Williams, Chartered. To every succeeding petition for payment, the appellants countered with timely exceptions. The ultimate amount being requested is $89,260.50 in counsel fees and $4,516.86 for the recovery of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The most recent statement of the value of the estate (as of April 22, 2005) puts its value at $261,970.58. The combined fee petitions currently pending request legal fees and costs amounting to $123,395.40. That cost is for the fees incurred by the caveatees. The caveators have yet to be heard from.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Any fees that may ultimately be owing to Gerard Wittstadt for his less hectic tenure as successor Personal Representative have not yet been factored into the bottom-line figure.

On January 27, 2005, the appellants had sent a letter to the Orphans\u2019 Court, suggesting that \u201cthere appears to be a fundamental, threshold issue of law that will need to be heard and decided before the other fee related issues are reached.\u201d The letter posed the legal question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">As a matter of Maryland law, <em>does </em>a Personal Representative, acting with only the powers of a Special Administrator, or <em>a Special Administrator </em>appointed by the Court, <em>have the legal authority to engage in litigation </em>involving the Estate and to incur attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, <em>payable by </em>or from <em>the Estate, </em>without first filing an appropriate petition with the Court under ET \u00a7 6-403 and <em>without first obtaining an order of court authorizing those activities?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The appellants followed up that letter with an oral motion to dismiss the two petitions for counsel fees. At the conclusion of the February 16 hearing, the Orphans\u2019 Court denied that motion to dismiss. The court gave the following opinion from the bench.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">This court finds that <em>Section 7-603 applies to the situation of a personal representative acting with the powers of a special administrator or a special administrator. While it is an accepted practice for </em>a personal representative acting with the powers of a special administrator or <em>a special administrator to file a petition </em>with the Orphans\u2019 Court <em>for authority to retain counsel to defend against the caveat, </em>the court holds that <em>it is not a requirement </em>and unnecessary in light of Section 7-603.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">Ultimately the interests of an interested person in an estate are protected by application of Section 7-602, which requires the filing of a petition for counsel fees with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>court prior to the payment of any counsel fees out of estate assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\"><em>The court has the responsibility of determining whether the personal representative, </em>who in all cases involving a caveat would be limited to the powers of a special administrator, or a special administrator, <em>acted in good faith and with just cause in defending the mil in light of the totality of the circumstances.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">Furthermore, <em>to the extent that this court signed, the order </em>dated October 10th, 2001, transmitting issues to the Circuit Court, <em>which specifically designated Mr. Renner </em>as special administrator <em>as defendant, </em>this court holds that <em>it implicitly granted Mr. Renner the authority to retain counsel for the defense of the caveat proceedings.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">Consequently, this court shall deny the oral motion made by Mr. Barnes on behalf of his clients to dismiss the petitions for counsel fees filed by Mr. Renner and Mr. Rybczynski respectively on the grounds that the personal representatives then acting with the powers of a special administrator failed to file a petition for authority to retain counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">The court then scheduled a further hearing on the merits of the fee petitions for March 11, 2005. On March 2, however, the appellants filed a Petition For the Transmission of [12] Issues of Fact to the Circuit Court. The motion recited the pendency of the \u201cpetition for the award and allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with or related to the caveat proceedings\u201d and further represented that \u201ccertain issues of fact will need to be determined for this Court to enter a proper order under applicable law.\u201d On April 6, 2005, the Orphans\u2019 Court denied that Petition for the Transmission of Issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">On May 3, the appellants filed this appeal from both 1) the April 6, 2005 order, denying the Petition to Transmit Issues; and 2) the February 16, 2005 order, denying the motion to dismiss the fee petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The Contentions Before Us</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">For convenience in handling, we are reshaping the appellants\u2019 three contentions into two. As reshaped, they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">1. The Orphans\u2019 Court erroneously, on February 16, 2005, denied the appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss the two fee petitions because the respective special administrators had not obtained authorization from the Orphans\u2019 Court to engage in litigation as required by Estates and Trusts Article, \u00a7 6-403.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">2. The Orphans\u2019 Court erroneously, on April 6, 2005, denied the appellants\u2019 request to transmit proposed issues to a circuit court jury for fact-finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Reluctantly, because of the time and expense involved, we must dismiss the appeal, in both of its aspects, as not properly before us. The appeal from the February 16, 2005 order is not properly before us because it is premature. The appeal from the April 6, 2005, order is not properly before us because it attempts to challenge a non-appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">I. The Appealability of the February 16 Order</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">In assessing threshold appealability, we will look first at the contention based on the February 16, 2005 order in a vacuum. If we find that it is not immediately appealable in its own right, we will then turn to the question of whether it acquires some enhanced eligibility for immediate appeal because of its appellate traveling companion.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">A. A Plausible Argument, When Ripe</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Even as we are putting on hold the merits of the February 16 order denying the appellants\u2019 motion to have the two fee petitions dismissed, we are not suggesting for a moment that the appellants have not raised a very plausible argument. It is apparently one of first impression in Maryland and is deserving of serious appellate consideration. The argument is based on the statutory distinction in the Estates and Trusts Article between a personal representative and a special administrator. Although the linguistic distinction is frequently hon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>ored more in the breach than in the observance (and this case is a glaring example of such laxity), it may nonetheless be a distinction of critical importance in terms of the respective powers and authorities of the two functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Title 6 deals with the position of a personal representative, generally and Title 7 spells out the duties and the authority of a personal representative. Subtitle 4 of Title 6 deals expressly with the closely related, but by no means identical, position of a special administrator. \u00a7 6-401(a) provides for the appointment of a special administrator.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">Upon the filing of a petition by an interested party, a creditor, or the register, <em>or </em>upon the motion of the court, <em>a special administrator may be appointed by the court </em>whenever it is necessary to protect property prior to the appointment and qualification of a personal representative or <em>upon the termination of appointment of a personal representative </em>and prior to the appointment of a successor personal representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Section 6-307 provides that, upon a request for judicial probate, the status and authority of a previously appointed personal representative is scaled back to the more limited one of a special administrator. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">(a) <em>General. </em>\u2014 (1) <em>The appointment of a personal representative </em>who has been appointed by administrative probate <em>is terminated by a timely request for judicial probate.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">(2) The validity of an act performed by the person as personal representative is not affected by this termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-11\">(b) <em>Interim powers. </em>\u2014 Subject to an order in the proceeding for judicial probate, <em>a personal representative appointed previously has the powers and duties of a special administrator </em>until the appointment of a personal representative in the judicial probate proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">(Emphasis supplied). And see <em>Garrick v. Henley, </em>44 Md.App. 124, 125-26, 407 A.2d 765 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>The reason for the diminution of the agent\u2019s authority is self-evident. In the controversy-free environment of administrative probate, the personal representative and the heirs are presumptively one happy family, working toward a common goal. Governmental (judicial) supervision of the process can be relatively minimal, simply requiring that some basic rules be followed and that appropriate costs be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">When the process downshifts into the more combatic mode of judicial probate, however, the supervisory reins are pulled far tighter. A caveat may pit one group of expectant beneficiaries against another, and the fear frequently arises that the administrator of the estate may be favoring one group against the other or even favoring his own interests against them both. In an atmosphere thus rife with confrontation and the possibly hair-trigger outbreak of conflict, the Orphans\u2019 Court understandably circumscribes the administrator\u2019s discretionary authority and intervenes more actively. An erstwhile personal representative will be constrained to act with the more limited authority of a special administrator, or he may simply be replaced by a court-appointed special administrator. <em>Carrick v. Henley, </em>44 Md.App. 124, 131, 407 A.2d 765 (1979) (\u201c[T]he request for judicial probate automatically terminated the administrative probate previously granted and no grounds for his removal were necessary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The legislative scheme of Titles 6 and 7 in combination makes very clear the difference between the powers of a personal representative and those of a special administrator. Title 7, as we have mentioned, catalogues the duties and the powers of a personal representative. By contrast, \u00a7 6-403 confines the duties and powers of a special administrator to some, but not to all, of those entrusted to a personal representative. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">A special administrator shall collect, manage, and preserve property and account to the personal representative upon his appointment. <em>A special administrator shall assume all duties </em>unperformed by a personal representative <em>imposed under Subtitles 2, 3, and 5 of Title 7, </em>and has all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>powers necessary to collect, manage, and preserve property. <em>In addition, a special administrator has the other powers designated from time to time by court order.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Significantly for the argument advanced by the appellants on February 16, the conferring of duties and powers on the special administrator is confined to those spelled out in Subtitles 2, 3, and 5 of Title 7 and does not include those conferred by Subtitle 4. The deliberate legislative omission of Subtitle 4 from the list of duties and powers conferred on a special administrator cannot be blithely ignored. It is only by virtue of Subtitle 4, specifically by \u00a7 7-401(y), that a personal representative is expressly authorized to engage in litigation and implicitly to incur legal fees to that end.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">(y) <em>Prosecute or defend, litigation. </em>\u2014 He may prosecute, defend, or submit to arbitration actions, claims, or proceedings in any appropriate jurisdiction for the protection or benefit of the estate, including the commencement of a personal action which the decedent might have commenced or prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Not having been granted any such inherent power, a special administrator would presumably have to rely on the granting of \u201cother powers designated from time to time by court order\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 6-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The thrust of the appellants\u2019 argument is that Charles Kresslein, Jr., when he incurred legal fees for the defense of his incumbency as special administrator \u2014 at the April 7, 1998 hearing before the Orphans\u2019 Court; in the abortive appeal of May 7, 1998 to the circuit court; and in the first appeal to this Court \u2014 was only empowered to act as Special Administrator and not as full-fledged Personal Representative. The other application of the argument is that Thomas Renner, when he incurred legal fees in defending the ostensible Will of July 1, 1996 against the caveat, was only Special Administrator and not Personal Representative. The argument is that neither Charles Kresslein, Jr. nor Thomas Renner possessed the inherent authority under \u00a7 7-401(y) to \u201cprosecute or defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>litigation\u201d and that neither of them sought such authority from the Orphans\u2019 Court pursuant to \u00a7 6-403.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">B. What Is a Final Judgment From an Orphans\u2019 Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">We are not suggesting that this is not a very cogent argument. Advance review by the Orphans\u2019 Court of the decisions might have prevented the expenditure of excessive time and money on ancillary questions of little merit and with small chance of success. When, however, the Orphans\u2019 Court on February 16, 2005 denied the motion to dismiss that was based upon this argument, that denial of the motion was quintessential^ in the nature of an interlocutory order and not a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-501 (a) squarely provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\"><em>A party may appeal </em>to the Court of Special Appeals <em>from a final judgment </em>of an orphans\u2019 court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">In <em>Hall v. Coates, </em>62 Md.App. 252, 255-56, 489 A.2d 41 (1985), Judge William Adkins thoroughly traced the legislative history of \u00a7 12-501 back to the 1973 code revision made by Ch. 2, Acts of 1973 (1st special session).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He further pointed out, with respect to the section\u2019s earlier pedigree, that \u201cthe only changes [that were] made [were] in style,\u201d and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>new section \u201cwas not intended to alter prior substantive law in this area.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">That language has been interpreted as providing \u201cthat the appeals shall be taken only from <em>final </em>orders or decisions [of orphans\u2019 courts], those actually settling the rights of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">62 Md.App. at 255, 489 A.2d 41 (emphasis and brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In looking at the overall organizational framework of Title 12, dealing with \u201cAppeals, Certiorari, and Certification of Questions,\u201d Subtitle 1, consisting only of \u00a7 12-101, provides a list of five not always helpful definitions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Subtitle 3 covers the \u201cReview of Decisions of Trial Courts of General Jurisdiction.\u201d Section 12-301 deals with the right to appeal from final judgments generally, \u00a7 12-302 deals with certain exceptions thereto, and \u00a7 12-303 permits appeals from a limited list of \u201ccertain interlocutory orders.\u201d Subtitle 5 deals distinctly with the \u201cReview of Decisions of Orphans\u2019 Courts.\u201d Section 12-501 covers an \u201cAppeal to Court of Special Appeals\u201d from a \u201cfinal judgment of an orphans\u2019 court,\u201d and \u00a7 12-502 covers an \u201cAppeal to circuit court\u201d from a \u201cfinal judgment of an orphans\u2019 court.\u201d Subtitle 5 does not even mention the subject of interlocutory orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Just as Subtitle 3 and Subtitle 5 provide distinct requirements for appealability from decisions of 1) a court of general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>jurisdiction and 2) an orphans\u2019 court, their respective bodies of supporting caselaw provide radically different definitions of what is an appealable \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d The drawing of any analogy, therefore, between \u00a7 12-301 and \u00a7 12-501 is treacherous in the extreme, as is the citing of caselaw from the one body of law in the context of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In <em>Hegmon v. Novak, </em>130 Md.App. 703, 747 A.2d 772 (2000), Judge Sally Adkins referred to what has become \u00a7 12-501\u2019s treatment of a final judgment as \u201cthis unusual definition of a \u2018final judgment,\u2019 \u201d 130 Md.App. at 709, 747 A.2d 772. She there highlighted the critical distinction between radically different definitions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">We would agree with appellant\u2019s argument <em>if the entena for a final judgment in the context of an appeal </em>from an order transmitting issues <em>from an orphans\u2019 court were the same as that for other orders. </em>The Court of Appeals has made clear, however, that <em>it is not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\"><em>\u201cFinality\u201d for purposes of an appeal from an orphans\u2019 court </em>transmittal of issues <em>assumes a different meaning than any other final judgement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">130 Md.App. at 708-09, 747 A.2d 772 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">On the one hand, the definitive statement as to what is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in a court of general jurisdiction is that articulated by Judge Wilner (specially assigned) in <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">If a ruling of the court is <em>to constitute a final judgment it must have at least three attributes: </em>(1) <em>it must be intended by the court as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy, </em>(2) unless the court properly acts pursuant to Md. Rule 2-602(b), <em>it must adjudicate or complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties, </em>and (3) the clerk must make a proper record of it in accordance with Md. Rule 2-601.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-10\">With exceptions not relevant here, a ruling of a circuit court is not appealable unless it constitutes a final judgment. To have the attribute of finality, <em>the ruling must be so final as either to detennine and conclude the rights </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>involved or to deny the appellant the means of further prosecuting or defending his or her rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">By contrast, the standard definition of what is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d from an orphans\u2019 court is taken from <em>Schlossberg v. Schlossberg, </em>275 Md. 600, 612, 343 A.2d 234 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">[T]he \u201cfinal judgment\u201d of an Orphans\u2019 Court are those judgments, orders, decisions, etc. which, in caveat proceedings, finally determine the proper parties, the issues to be tried and the sending of those issues to a court of law.<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKh\">An earlier definition from <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v.

It has been held that an appeal may be taken from an order appointing an administrator ad litem, from an order revoking the probate of a will, from an order revoking letters, from an order refusing to revoke letters, from an order dismissing a petition asking that the Court refuse to grant letters testamentary or of administration on the ground of the decedent\u2019s non residence, from an order granting or refusing to grant issues, from the ratification of a separate administration account on an appeal by a co-executor and a distributee, from an order relating to the allowance of counsel fees, and from an order directing the mode of distribution of a decedent\u2019s estate among his creditors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">As is apparent at a glance, the two definitions of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d are not even in the same ballpark, and the careful practitioner should scrupulously confine each to its own unique arena. Upon reflection, moreover, the distinction between the two makes eminently good sense. The litigation that produces a judgment in a court of general jurisdiction is, in its deepest ontological essence, adjudicative by its very nature. The final judgment of a court is the thing being sought from the outset of the action. It is the purpose of the litigants that the suit proceed to final judgment, and it is appropriate to let the appeal abide the final outcome of that litigation, so that all loose ends can be tied up in a single omnibus appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The administration of an estate, by contrast, is a very different phenomenon. Ideally, as in administrative probate, there may be nothing that a judge need ever adjudicate. Even when the endeavor turns to judicial probate, moreover, the need for judicial adjudicative intervention is frequently intermittent and only on a very <em>ad hoc </em>basis. For much of its course, the process is allowed to go its own way outside the courtroom. Adjudication is sometimes an incident of the process, but it is by no means its generative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Because adjudicative decisions as to bits and pieces of the larger enterprise may be the only court judgments ever rendered, however, there is not the same expectation of an apocalyptic last judgment. Appeals from some, though not from all, of the adjudicative decisions taken along the way may be necessary in this fundamentally different legal environment. The two arenas are simply not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Even by the more latitudinarian definition in the lexicon of probate law, however, it is clear that the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s decision to deny the appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss the fee petitions was not a final judgment. Its effect was quintessentially interlocutory. But for this appeal, the Orphans\u2019 Court would have proceeded forthwith to conduct a hearing on the merits of the fee petitions. Once awards are made, or denied, those awards will, in the fullness of time, be appealed to us as proper final judgments. The argument the appellants now make on the merits of the fee petitions may be made at that time and will not in any way be compromised by intervening events.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">C. There Are Still Other Arrows in the Appellants\u2019 Quiver</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The Orphans\u2019 Court decision of February 16, 2005, moreover, was not fatal to the appellants\u2019 challenge to the fee petitions. That decision warded off only a single arrow in the enfilade of arguments the appellants will certainly be aiming at the fee petitions. Above and beyond any claim that the decisions of two successive special administrators to hire attorneys, without prior Orphans\u2019 Court approval, were <em>ultra vires, </em>an attack on a fee petition is routinely two-tiered in two other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">One may, of course, challenge a requested fee purely by the norms and standards of the legal workplace \u2014 the charge per billable hour, the number of billable hours, the quality of the work produced. This is the standard charge that the fee is excessive in amount. The attack in such a case is focused more on the lawyer than on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>On the other hand, or in addition, there may be a challenge of a very different nature. It is a challenge that focuses on the client rather than on the lawyer. It may challenge both the judgment of the client and the motive of the client \u2014 particularly when the client is a personal representative or special administrator \u2014 in engaging a lawyer in the first place for certain litigational purposes. It is settled law that, although the decision to award a fee and the amount of the fee are in the discretion of the Orphans\u2019 Court, an appeal may be taken from an abuse of that discretion. <em>Wright v.

The Question Is Not So Much What Shall Be Paid, But Who Shall Pay?</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">The consistent and unmistakable thrust of the appellants\u2019 challenges to fees in this case has not been aimed primarily at the work product, quantitative or qualitative, produced by the respective law offices. The attack, at times vigorous, has been upon 1) the decision of Special Administrator Charles Kres-slein, Jr., to engage counsel to defend his incumbency in that position; and 2) the decision of Special Administrator Thomas Renner to engage counsel to defend the purported Will of July 1, 1996 against caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On the other hand, the appellants do take serious exception to the legal bill of $81,000 for the defense against the caveat. That fee petition asked for an amount that represented almost one-third of the total value of the estate for the unsuccessful defense against caveat of the purported Will of July 1, 1996, that was ultimately declared to be \u201cnull and void.\u201d As was stated by <em>Wolfe v. Turner, </em>267 Md. at 658-59, 299 A.2d 106, \u201c[Tlhe appropriateness of a counsel fee cannot be determined by simple arithmetic. This is an area where adherence to standards, and not reliance on mere numbers, must be the controlling factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The primary thrust of the appellants\u2019 argument, however, is not that the two law firms are not entitled to be paid, but that they are not entitled to be paid by the estate. This question of who shall pay was the issue raised in <em>Wright v. Nuttle, </em>267 Md. 698, 699, 298 A.2d 389 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">[N]either the reasonableness of the hourly rate nor the amount of the charge is directly questioned. Rather, <em>the question is, shall the charge be paid entirely by the estate </em>or partly or wholly by the residuary legatee?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">In <em>Riddleberger v. Goeller, </em>263 Md. at 58, 282 A.2d 101, the Court of Appeals explained that the appellee in that case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atp\"><em>confuses the difference between the fee which may be allowable from an estate with the total compensation which may well be due counsel for his services </em>rendered, since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>allowance of a fee in an estate in no way precludes counsel from charging a fee to the personal representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Wolfe v. Turner, </em>267 Md. at 658, 299 A.2d 106; <em>American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee v. Eisenberg, </em>194 Md. at 202, 70 A.2d 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">When this question of the fee petitions is finally before the Orphans\u2019 Court for consideration, that court will be facing a multi-layered bundle of intertwined and overlapping issues. There are two distinct petitions for the payment of legal fees to two different law firms. The first petition was submitted by the lawyers themselves, pursuant to Estates and Trusts Article, \u00a7 7-602. The second petition was submitted by the Special Administrator of the estate, also pursuant to \u00a7 7-602. The first petition is for legal services that were engaged by Charles Kresslein Jr., who was also a legatee under the Will that he had prepared and submitted for probate. The second petition is for legal services that were engaged by Thomas Renner, who was an independent appointee of the Orphans\u2019 Court. The first petition is for legal services, rendered in defending the incumbency of Mr. Kresslein as Special Administrator. The second petition is significantly, but not entirely, for legal services rendered in defending the purported July 1, 1996 Will against caveat. Mr. Renner had been directed to defend against the caveat by the Orphans\u2019 Court. The sets of circumstances are both sufficiently distinct and sufficiently complex to preclude any simplistic resolution of the exceptions to the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Because the attack in both cases will, <em>inter alia, </em>be upon the judgments and/or the motives of the Special Administrators in engaging counsel 1) to defend the Kresslein incumbency and 2) to defend the purported Will of July 1, 1996 against caveat, \u00a7 7-603 may become involved. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">When a personal representative or person nominated as personal representative defends or prosecutes a proceeding <em>in good faith and with just cause, </em>he shall be entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>receive his necessary expenses and disbursements from the estate regardless of the outcome of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Battle may be joined, of course, over both 1) good faith and 2) just cause. At such hearing, all interested parties will be permitted the full opportunity to argue and to offer evidence on the reasonableness of the fee petitions. <em>Geesey v. Geesey, </em>94 Md. 371, 374, 51 A. 36 (1902); <em>Miller v. Gehr, </em>91 Md. 709, 715, 47 A. 1032 (1900).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Heavily involved in any resolution on the merits will be a close examination of <em>Piper Rudnick LLP v. Hartz, </em>386 Md. 201, 872 A.2d 58 (2005); <em>Fields v. Mersack, </em>83 Md.App. 649, 577 A.2d 376 (1990); and <em>National Wildlife Federation v. Foster, </em>83 Md.App. 484, 575 A.2d 776 (1990). In <em>National Wildlife Federation v. Foster, </em>this Court was, to be sure, considering the reasonableness of a personal representative\u2019s request for <em>interim </em>attorney\u2019s fees, a subject slightly different, at least in terms of tense, from that now before us. The opinion nonetheless offers guidance as to how to measure the \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201cjust cause\u201d required of a personal representative by \u00a7 7-603. When it comes to the question of whether the representative of an estate acted with \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201cjust cause\u201d in undertaking to prosecute or defend a particular action, the likelihood of success will have a significant bearing on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Whether <em>actually looking forward[ </em>as in the <em>National Wildlife </em>case, or <em>hypothetically looking forward, </em>as in the case at hand, the Orphans\u2019 Court must attempt to assess the likelihood that a legal action will succeed, because that tactical assessment is strong evidence of the representative\u2019s good faith and just cause in pursuing the action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">The first, and most important, factor is <em>whether there is prima facie evidence that the personal representative will succeed on the merits and thus is defending or prosecuting the underlying action in good faith and with just cause. </em>Like the judge in an interlocutory injunction hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>orphans\u2019 court must attempt to predict the outcome of the trial on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">88 Md.App. at 497, 575 A.2d 776 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Judge Alpert\u2019s opinion went on to explain why pursuing litigation with little chance of success is evidence, albeit not <em>per se </em>conclusive evidence, of bad faith and the absence of just cause.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">[W]e are mindful of the harm that could result if a personal representative is permitted to use the estate\u2019s assets to defend or prosecute a claim in bad faith and without just cause. <em>Not only might the estate be dissipated and the legatees unable to recover the money paid in attorneys\u2019 fees from the personal representative </em>at the conclusion of the underlying litigation, but <em>such meritless litigation also causes an unnecessary drain on the judicial system.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">83 Md.App. at 498, 575 A.2d 776 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">There are echoes of the present case in <em>Fields v. Mersack, supra, </em>83 Md.App. 649, 577 A.2d 376, a case that considered whether a personal representative who hired an attorney to defend a caveat had acted, pursuant to \u00a7 7-603, in good faith and with just cause. The wife of the deceased in that case was both the personal representative and the sole beneficiary under a will. The will was successfully caveated by the personal representative\u2019s step-daughter. A jury found that the will had been procured by undue influence. The personal representative subsequently filed a petition for counsel fees incurred in defending against the caveat. The step-daughter successfully excepted to the payment of such a fee, and the personal representative appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Writing for this Court, Judge Bell (now chief Judge of the Court of Appeals) quoted \u00a7 7-603 and then set out the opinion\u2019s major premise.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">The plain language of the statute makes clear, and the parties agree, that <em>a personal representative may not receive \u201cnecessary expenses </em>and disbursements <em>from the es</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>tate\u201d unless he </em>or she <em>\u201cdefends </em>or prosecutes <em>a proceeding in good faith and with just cause.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">83 Md.App. at 654, 577 A.2d 376 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">After concluding that the personal representative had, indeed, been the wielder of the undue influence, this Court had to consider the impact of the undue influence finding on the issue of good faith and just cause.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">Implicit in appellant\u2019s position is that a jury finding of undue influence does not preclude, as a matter of law, payment of a personal representative\u2019s expenses out of the estate. Appellee\u2019s position is explicit in its assertion that such a finding does preclude, as a matter of law, payment of such expenses from the estate. No Maryland court has had an occasion to address this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">83 Md.App. at 656, 577 A.2d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Surveying the caselaw from around the country, Judge Bell found that two basic approaches are employed. The discretionary approach permits an orphans\u2019 court to find such a connection on a case-by-case basis. The <em>per se </em>approach concludes that such a connection exists as a matter of law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">We opted for the discretionary rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-11\">The fundamental difference between these lines of cases is that, in the latter, a <em>per se </em>rule is enunciated, while in the former a discretionary rule is explicated. <em>We are persuaded that the discretionary rule is the better ruis.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">83 Md.App. at 658, 577 A.2d 376 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">Although the present case is not on all fours with <em>Fields v. Mersack, </em>the import of that opinion is that the Orphans\u2019 Court, when determining whether Mr. Kresslein acted in good faith and with just cause in engaging counsel to defend his incumbency as special administrator, may consider, as part of \u201cthe totality of circumstances,\u201d such things as its own findings of April 9, 1998, and the findings of the circuit court jury of June 24, 2004.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-14\"><em>[A] trial judge </em>presented with a petition for costs and attorney\u2019s fees filed by a personal representative, whom a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>jury has found has exerted undue influence on the decedent, <em>must determine, </em>nevertheless, <em>whether the personal representative acted in good faith and with just cause in defending the will. That determination must be made in light of the totality of the circumstances, including the jury\u2019s finding, and by weighing all the evidence. </em>The trial judge may not import bad faith from the jury\u2019s finding alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">83 Md.App. at 659-60, 577 A.2d 376 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">E. Section 7-602 and \u00a7 7-603 Distinguished</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The scholarly and painstakingly thorough opinion of Judge Raker in <em>Piper Rudnick v. Hartz </em>draws a careful line between \u00a7 7-602 and \u00a7 7-603. Section 7-602 requires that the legal services, to be reimbursable from the estate, shall have been rendered \u201cfor the protection or benefit of the estate,\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> whereas \u00a7 7-603 \u201crequires only that the personal representative acted \u2018in good faith and with just cause.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> 386 Md. at 217, 872 A.2d 58. In tracing at length the legislative histories of the two sections, the opinion makes it clear that \u00a7 7-602 focuses primarily on the attorney and the legal fees, whereas \u00a7 7-603 \u201ccovers a personal representative\u2019s expenses in defending or prosecuting a proceeding.\u201d 386 Md. at 223, 872 A.2d 58. There is a decided overlap, but the respective centers of gravity are not the same. The two fee petitions in this case were submitted pursuant to \u00a7 7-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Judge Raker\u2019s opinion then carefully pointed out that its analysis was only with respect to \u00a7 7-603 and not with respect to \u00a7 7-602.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">As the courts below ruled based on \u00a7 7-603, we first consider whether Goldman met the requirements of \u00a7 7-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>603. Since we conclude that Goldman is entitled to receive his expenses and disbursements from the estate, <em>we need not consider whether Piper Rudnick should have been reimbursed under \u00a7 7-602.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">386 Md. at 217 n. 7, 872 A.2d 58 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In <em>Piper Rudnick, </em>a personal representative who successfully defended against an attempt to have him removed from that office was entitled, under \u00a7 7-603, to be reimbursed for legal fees expended in that successful effort.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Although doing so only in the context of distinguishing \u00a7 7-603 from \u00a7 7-602, Judge Raker, 386 Md. at <em>224-28, 872 A.2d </em>58, thoroughly traced the history, beginning in the early 1900\u2019s, of the \u201cbenefit to the estates\u201d requirement. Although not a part of \u00a7 7-603, the \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d requirement is firmly embedded in \u00a7 7-602.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\"><em>This conception that a \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d was required </em>from the statutory use of \u201clegal services rendered\u201d <em>endured </em>through the 1969 revision of Article 93 <em>in \u00a7 7-602 </em>\u2014 but <em>not in \u00a7 7-603. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\"><em>Contrary to \u00a7 7-602, </em>\u00a7 7-603 does not contain a \u201clegal service rendered ... to an estate\u201d clause, and <em>no decision of this Court has held that the \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d rule was carried over to \u00a7 7-603.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">386 Md. at 227-28, 872 A.2d 58 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">The <em>Piper Rudnick </em>opinion also spelled out several procedural and evidentiary incidents that, we conclude, would apply to the consideration of the \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d requirement under \u00a7 7-602 as surely as <em>Piper Rudnick </em>held them to apply to the \u201cgood faith and just cause\u201d requirement under \u00a7 7-603. One of them allocates the burden of proof.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>It is the personal representative\u2019s burden to establish good faith and just cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">386 Md. at 229, 872 A.2d 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Another points out that these are factual questions affecting the award of attorneys\u2019 fees that are to be determined by the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">The existence of good faith and just cause is <em>a question of fact to be determined by the orphans\u2019 court </em>based upon all of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">386 Md. at 229-30, 872 A.2d 58 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">The third is that the legal outcome of the proceeding that led to the incurring of the legal fees is not <em>per se </em>dispositive of the antecedent question of \u201cgood faith,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>in incurring the fee, but is nonetheless relevant evidence on that antecedent issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">If the orphans\u2019 court concludes that the personal representative acted in good faith and with just cause, then the personal representative is entitled to his necessary expenses and disbursements \u201cregardless of the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>The orphans\u2019 court, </em>however, <em>may consider the outcome of the proceeding in its review of all the evidence to determine whether the personal representative acted in good faith and with just cause.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">386 Md. at 230, 872 A.2d 58 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">A final pertinent point made by <em>Piper Rudnick </em>is that the \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d requirement, albeit not an element of \u00a7 7-603, is a relevant factor in resolving a \u00a7 7-603 question. Judge Raker, 386 Md. at 231, 872 A.2d 58, posed the question.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-13\">While we hold that \u00a7 7-603 does not contain an independent \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d requirement, we consider whether \u201cbenefit .to the estate\u201d is a relevant factor for an orphans\u2019 court\u2019s determination of good faith and just cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">After quoting at length and with approval the Arizona intermediate appellate decision of <em>In re Estate of Gordon, </em>207 Ariz. 401, 87 P.3d 89, 94 (2004), Judge Raker concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>We agree and conclude that <em>while \u00a7 7-603 does not contain an independent \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d requirement, that concept is a, factor to be considered, in the objective inquiry into whether the personal representative acted in good faith and with just cause.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\">A personal representative whose expenses are incurred in pursuit of his personal interest, rather than a substantial estate interest, is not acting to benefit the estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Because the fee petitions in this case are pursuant to \u00a7 7-602, and because \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d is, therefore, a factor, a pertinent inquiry on the first fee petition may well be, \u201cOf what benefit to the estate was the defense of Mr. Kresslein\u2019s incumbency as special administrator?\u201d A pertinent inquiry on the second fee petition may well be, \u201cOf what benefit to the estate was the unsuccessful defense against caveat of the purported Will of July 1, 1996?\u201d A pertinent answer to the second question, of course, may be, \u201cMr. Renner made no decision in that regard. He simply did what he was directed to do by the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In any event, it is clear that the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s decision of February 16, 2005, which the appellants are now attempting to appeal, is but a small part of the total package that will have to be considered when the fee petitions finally come before the Orphans\u2019 Court on their merits. When final judgement is entered on those fee petitions, the current issue, no doubt along with others, will be ripe for appellate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">II. May a Non-Appealable Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Piggyback on an Appealable Issue?</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Both the appellants and the appellees chose to concentrate fire on the immediate appealability of the April 6, 2005 decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court to deny the appellants\u2019 request to transmit issues to the circuit court for fact-finding by a jury. Both parties neglected the distinct question of whether the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court of February 16, 2005, denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss the petition for counsel fees, was itself immediately appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The failure of the appellees to have raised an individualized challenge to the immediate appealability of the February 16, 2005 decision, however, is of no consequence. In <em>Canterbury Riding Condominium v. Chesapeake Investors, Inc., </em>66 Md.App. 635, 654, 505 A.2d 858 (1986), we dealt with this very question.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">Despite the fact that neither side has questioned the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain this appeal, <em>we must, on our own motion, recognize our lack of jurisdiction. </em>Since, furthermore, jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon the Court by consent of the parties, we must dismiss the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU8\">(Emphasis supplied). See <em>Potter v. Bethesda Fire Dept., Inc., </em>302 Md. 281, 487 A.2d 288 (1985); <em>Diener Enterprises v. Miller, </em>266 Md. 551, 295 A.2d 470 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"A_TZ\">In its own right, the decision of February 16, 2005, as we have now thoroughly analyzed, was clearly not immediately appealable. If that were all that was before us, the appeal would now be dismissed as premature without further discussion. That, however, is not all that is before us. The appellants are appealing two decisions. Assuming, purely <em>arguendo, </em>that the decision of April 6, concerning the transmission of issues, were immediately appealable, would that be of any avail to the appellants\u2019 companion effort to appeal the decision of February 16? May the one issue piggyback on the other all the way to Annapolis? We hold that it may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">There is scant authority on the question of appellate piggybacking, and the issue never squarely arose in Maryland until 1973. In <em>Williams v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 110, 299 A.2d 878 (1973), the denial of the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was immediately appealable, but a challenge to the composition of the jury array was not. While appealing to this Court the speedy trial issue, the appellants in that case attempted to slip in through the backdoor the challenge to the jury array as well. The State moved to have the interloper dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>In granting the motion to dismiss, this Court, speaking through Judge Scanlan, held that the appealability of each separate issue must be analyzed in a vacuum and that there are no two-for-the-price-of-one bargains on the appellate docket.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\"><em>Nor can the order denying the challenge to the array he converted into an appealable order by virtue of the fact that it is joined with the appeal of am, interlocutory order which is appealable, </em>that is, the trial court\u2019s ruling denying the motion for a speedy trial. <em>The precise point appears to be one of first impression in Maryland. At least two other States, however, have repudiated, attempts to com,bine a nonappealable order with an appealable, interlocutory order. </em>To hold otherwise might presage the outbreak of a rash of spurious motions to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial filed solely for the calculated purpose of laying the ground work for an immediate appeal to which otherwise clearly nonappealable issues would be attached as companions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">Judge Close\u2019s order denying the motion challenging the petit jury array was an interlocutory, nonappealable order. Accordingly, the State\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">17 Md.App. at 115, 299 A.2d 878 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The two cases cited by <em>Williams v. State, </em>17 Md.App. at 115, 299 A.2d 878, roundly rejected the tactic of attempting to smuggle a non-appealable issue aboard by coupling it with an appealable traveling companion. In <em>Bloomfield Royalty Corp. v.

It is also a very serious accusation. It is no mere casual synonym or offhand reference to the absence of \u201cgood faith and just cause.\u201d In <em>Fidelity Trust Co. v. Barrett, </em>186 Md. 483, 488-89, 47 A.2d 72 (1946), Judge Delaplaine made it very clear that to be an issue properly transmitted to the circuit court, the issue must be one that is squarely, not allusively or inferentially,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> before the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">Only questions of fact which are properly in issue between the parties in the orphans\u2019 court should be sent to a court of law for trial upon request of either party. <em>An issue cannot be made up in any way except upon affirmative averment on one side and denial thereof on the other.

The appropriate pleadings in which to look for the charge of a breach of fiduciary duty are the exceptions filed by the appellants. Nowhere in those exceptions, and nowhere in the record, do we find the subject of a breach of fiduciary duty raised as an issue before the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In <em>Nugent v. Wright, </em>277 Md. 614, 356 A.2d 548 (1976), the personal representative of an estate appealed from a pair of issues that had been submitted to a jury at the request of a caveator. The caveator, who had raised a valid issue as to undue influence, sought, in a burst of rhetorical exuberance, to equate \u201cundue influence\u201d and \u201cfraud\u201d with the questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">\u201c(7) Was George Ainslie Nugent in a confidential relationship to Aldaee Freeman Walker?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">\u201c(8) If the answer to Issue No. 7 is \u2018yes\u2019, <em>was the paper </em>dated April 8, 1973, purported to be the Last Will and Testament of Aldaee Freeman Walker, <em>procured by fraud or undue influence </em>exercised upon him by George Ainslie Nugent?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">277 Md. at 624-25, 356 A.2d 548 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">The Court of Appeals first set out the general rule for determining whether the issue of fraud was actually an issue before the Orphans\u2019 Court and where to look for it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Issues involve questions of fact in dispute between the parties, <em>to be ascertained from the petition and answer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">277 Md. at 619, 356 A.2d 548 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In then reversing the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court to have transmitted an issue charging fraud to a circuit court jury, the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\"><em>Mr. Nugent maintains that it was error to submit any issue regarding fraud, which was nowhere referred to in Mrs. Wright\u2019s petition, although undue influence was. </em>There is a clear cut distinction between the two, and <em>an issue framed on a subject not contested must not be submitted,. </em>The court, therefore, erred in granting Issues (7) and (8) in the form submitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">277 Md. at 625, 356 A.2d 548 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">A similar overreaching occurred in <em>Hegmon v. Novak. </em>The orphans\u2019 court transmitted to the circuit court an issue inquiring into the subject of undue influence. That issue was improperly transmitted because undue influence had not theretofore been alleged.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\"><em>The petition </em>to caveat filed by appellee <em>asserted only two grounds </em>for challenging the will of Fishgrund: incapacity and improper attestation. <em>The third issue transmitted, undue influence, was not alleged in the petition. </em>Appellant contends, and we agree, that <em>the orphans\u2019 court could not transmit the third issue when there had been no allegation in the petition that undue influence had been exerted over the decedent.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">130 Md.App. at 713, 747 A.2d 772 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">We think the four issues about breach of fiduciary duty also run afoul of <em>Vickers v. Starcher, </em>175 Md. 522, 2 A.2d 678 (1938). In that case the Court of Appeals held that four issues were properly refused because they inquired into whether the executor, in four different respects, had been guilty of \u201cnegligence.\u201d The issues, however, did not define for the jury precisely what negligence consisted of. If a jury answered, \u201cYes,\u201d to the inquiries, the Court of Appeals held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>that such unadorned answers would be too vague and indefinite in their meaning to be of any help to the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGV\"><em>Issues three to six, </em>inclusive, <em>would require a determination </em>by the jury, in answering them, <em>as to whether the surviving executor was guilty of negligence </em>in paying interest upon certain claims, in paying the Francis note, counsel fees, and the note due by the estate to the First National Bank----[W]e think all these issues are improper in failing to require information upon which the Orphans\u2019 Court could act intelligently. <em>For instance, what is meant by \u201cnegligence\u201d?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">175 Md. at 530-31, 2 A.2d 678 (emphasis supplied). And see <em>Myers v. Hart, </em>248 Md. 443, 446-47, 237 A.2d 41 (1968). The four issues dealing with a breach of fiduciary duty were not proper issues for transmittal to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">And then there were four. Two of those issues inquire as to \u201cgood faith and just cause\u201d as required by \u00a7 7-603.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">1. <em>Did Charles J.

On May 3, the appellants appealed from that denial, and the propriety of that appeal is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">A. The Transmittal of Issues, Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Although it is of ancient lineage, the practice of an Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s transmitting issues to a circuit court for jury fact-finding is, by any reckoning, an odd procedure.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The measure is a child born of necessity. An orphans\u2019 court, having no jury of its own, sometimes needs to borrow one from someone else, even as it might need to borrow a bailiff or the use of a courtroom. In Maryland\u2019s four-tiered judicial system, that someone else is, by process of elimination, the circuit court, for only the circuit court possesses the jury that needs to be borrowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">The operative statutory language is now Estates and Trusts Article, \u00a7 2-105(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">(b) <em>Transfer of determination to law court. </em>\u2014 At the request of an interested person made within the time determined by the court, the issue of fact may be determined by a court of law. When the request is made before the court has determined the issue of fact, the court shall transmit the issue to a court of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">That statutory provision is supplemented by Maryland Rule 6-434 \u201cTransmitting issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>In <em>Hill v. Lewis, </em>21 Md.App. 121, 126 n. 2, 318 A.2d 850, <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 742 (1974), Chief Judge Orth traced for this Court the pedigree of what is now \u00a7 2-105. When the Orphans\u2019 Court was established by the Acts of 1777, Feb. Sess., ch. 8, the General Assembly initially \u201cempowered each orphans\u2019 court ... to call a jury of twelve freeholders of the county to assist in the determination of the issue.\u201d Within the year, however, the Acts of 1798, ch. 101, III, subchapter 15, \u00a7 17 revised the practice \u201cby requiring the orphans\u2019 court, at the election of either party to a controversy, to direct issues to be sent to any court of law that might be most convenient for the trial thereof.\u201d See <em>Forsythe v. Baker, </em>180 Md. 144, 147-48, 23 A.2d 36 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Philip L. Sykes, <em>Contest of Wills in Maryland </em>(1941), \u00a7 21, p. 29, addressed the even earlier origins of the procedure.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">The practice of framing and directing issues to be tried by a jury was borrowed from Chancery and the ecclesiastical courts of England. It was in vogue in this state prior to the passage of the act of 1798, which codified the testamentary system.... They are sent to a court of law for trial in order that the questions of fact in dispute may be determined by a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">See also <em>Myers v. Hart, </em>248 Md. 443, 446, 237 A.2d 41 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">In <em>Kao v. Hsia, </em>309 Md. 366, 373, 524 A.2d 70 (1987), Judge Adkins also discussed the early history.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">The practice of sending issues from an orphans\u2019 court to a circuit court is also of ancient lineage. In 1798 the laws relating to orphans\u2019 courts were comprehensively amended and expanded, and the power to transmit issues was expressly conferred. Ch. 101, III, ch. 15, s. 17, Acts of 1798. The practice was apparently borrowed from the early chancery and ecclesiastical courts. <em>Pegg v. Warford, 4 </em>Md. 385, 393 (1853).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">As a convenient usage, we have consistently been referring to the transmitting of issues to \u201cthe circuit court.\u201d The earlier caselaw and, indeed, the statutes from 1798 to the present refer to the transmittal as one to \u201ca court of law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>That once was a very important distinction that is no longer necessary. What is now the circuit court historically embraced both law courts and equity courts, and the equity court was just as bereft of juries as was the orphans\u2019 court itself. It had no jury to lend and was no fit destination for the transmittal of issues. The transmittal of issues, therefore, had to be very carefully directed to \u201ca court of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Indeed, equity courts would themselves sometimes send an issue to a law court for an advisory jury verdict, until Rule 517 (now Rule 2 \u2014 511(d)), adopted in 1961, did away with that \u201clittle-used practice.\u201d See <em>Kao v. Hsia, </em>309 Md. at 374 n. 8, 524 A.2d 70. In any event, for purposes of discussing the transmittal of issues to a jury, \u201ccourt of law\u201d and \u201ccircuit court\u201d may now be used interchangeably for designating the place where an available jury may be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">After issues are properly transmitted to the circuit court, what follows is a hybrid procedure. Jurisdiction over the case always remains with the Orphans\u2019 Court, even after transmittal. Just as the Orphans\u2019 Court, in effect, borrows the jury from the circuit court, it also, in effect, delegates to the circuit court judge the task of being the jury\u2019s on-site referee. The ordinarily inherent power of the circuit court judge is significantly curtailed, because the case itself still belongs to the Orphans\u2019 Court and not to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\"><em>Holland v. Enright, </em>167 Md. 604, 607-08, 175 A. 466 (1934), has given us the classic characterization of this limitation on judicial authority.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">The issues were transmitted to <em>the Circuit Court </em>for Baltimore County under the power and authority of [\u00a7 2-105], which limit its jurisdiction and direct its procedure. Apart from the statute it has no authority. <em>Its function, </em>as prescribed by the statute, <em>is neither that of an appellate nor, strictly speaking, that of a court of original jurisdiction, but rather that of a tribunal ancillary to the orphans\u2019 court, </em>whose aid is invoked for the single purpose of determining issues of fact submitted to it by the orphans\u2019 court for its guidance in dealing with some matter before it. <em>The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>court of law to which they have been transmitted has no concern whatever with anything that transpired in the orphans\u2019 court in connection with the framing of such issues.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The Court of Appeals went on to describe the limited authority of the circuit court when it is operating in that tightly constrained capacity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\"><em>It was not acting in the exercise of its ordinary powers as a court of general jurisdiction. ... </em>The power of the court and its duty was to see that a verdict, upon the issues propounded for inquiry before a jury was reached by legal steps, and competent and legal evidence. <em>It was the province of the court to decide all questions necessarily incidental to the bringing to trial and verdict; and when a verdict was obtained, to certify it to the Orphans\u2019 Court, whence the issues came.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">167 Md. at 609, 175 A. 466 (emphasis supplied).

Lewis, </em>21 Md.App. at 126, 318 A.2d 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">On the other hand, the circuit court judge, even as a mere on-site referee, enjoys considerable authority in controlling the jury trial. As early as 1881, <em>Diffenderffer v. Griffith, </em>57 Md. 81, 84 (1881), had declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\"><em>The power of the court </em>and its duty <em>was to see that a verdict, </em>upon the issues propounded for inquiry before a jury <em>was reached by legal steps, and competent and legal evidence.

Schmeizl, </em>184 Md. 584, 598-99, 42 A.2d 106 (1945), similarly declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-13\">Judgment in the plenary proceeding is entered by the Orphans\u2019 Court, but the determination of the court of law on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>issues is final and is binding on the Orphans\u2019 Court. <em>The court of law has tfte same powers, with respect to the jury and the verdict, as in an ordinary action, including \u201cpower to direct the jury and grant a new trial. </em>\u201d <em>A jury may be waived. </em>This court may reverse a determination on issues \u201cwithout a new trial\u201d and in so doing may authorize the lower court to \u201cdirect a finding of the issues in conformity with this opinion and certify such finding\u201d to the Orphans\u2019 Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\"><em>McIntyre v. Saltysiak, </em>205 Md. 415, 424, 109 A.2d 70 (1954), also made it clear that the prerogatives of the circuit court judge include that of taking an issue away from the jury if the evidence is not legally sufficient to support a finding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajv-dedup-1\"><em>Whether sufficient evidence was offered </em>to justify the submission of issues to the jury <em>is a question of law for the court If </em>there is not sufficient evidence and <em>the jury would only be left to speculation and conjecture on the issues submitted, the court should refuse to submit such issues, </em>should direct a verdict, and withdraw those issues from the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\"><em>Kao v. Hsia, </em>309 Md. at 379, 524 A.2d 70, enumerated some of the necessary powers of the circuit court judge in regulating the fact-finding process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">[T]he circuit court may, in an issues case, direct a verdict, grant a new trial, or grant summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">The limitation, of course, is that such powers only exist for the purpose of supervising the trial process before the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdT\"><em>[T]he circuit court may only \u201cdecide </em>all <em>questions necessarily incidental\u201d to the determination of \u201cthe issues propounded. </em>...\u201d It cannot decide questions of law that do not relate to those issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">Perhaps the strangest feature of this already strange enough practice of shipping issues off to another tribunal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>that, notwithstanding the fact that the Orphans\u2019 Court itself is competent to make findings of fact, a party before it may invoke \u00a7 2-105 to transmit issues to the circuit court and, once there, waive a jury trial. See <em>Kao v. Hsia, </em>309 Md. at 378, 524 A.2d 70; <em>Schmeizl v. Schmeizl, </em>184 Md. at 598, 42 A.2d 106. The practical necessity that explains resort to a circuit court jury is no rationale for this aberration. It would appear to be simply a quirk, for which the reasons are lost in the mists of history.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In <em>Kao v. Hsia, </em>309 Md. at 374, 524 A.2d 70, however, Judge Adkins suggested that an historical explanation for this apparent incongruity may be found in the concurring opinion of Chief Judge Brune in <em>Phillips v. Phillips, </em>215 Md. 28, 38-39, 136 A.2d 862 (1957). Judge Bru\u00f1e thought that one of the reasons for transferring factual issues to the law courts in 16th Century England lay not simply in the desire for a jury but in the fact that the fact-finding procedures available in chancery courts and ecclesiastical courts were notoriously ineffective and unreliable.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">One downside to outsourcing the fact-finding to a different tribunal is the shameful expenditure of time. The time consumed in this case between the farming out of issues on October 10, 2001 and the rendering of the answers on June 24, 2004 was a few months short of three years.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>In any event, the appellants successfully utilized this procedure under Rule 2-105 in caveating the purported Will of July 1, 1996. A six-day jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, from June 16 through June 24, 2004, yielded them the six answers to issues that were dispositive in their favor. Their attempt to utilize the procedure for a second time, however, is another matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">B. Immediate Appealability of a Transmittal Order, Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">A number of high-profile cases establish the indisputable principle that an order of an Orphans\u2019 Court framing an issue and then submitting that issue to the circuit court is immediately appealable. In <em>Senk v. Mork, </em>212 Md. 413, 416, 129 A.2d 675 (1957), Chief Judge Brune observed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">In the Orphans Court ... <em>an order was entered </em>on May 31, 1956, <em>directing that the issues be transmitted </em>to the Circuit Court. <em>The appeal is from that order. No question is raised as to its being am, appealable order.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">In the earlier case of <em>Little Sisters of the Poor v. </em>Cushing, 62 Md. 416, 421 (1884), the Court of Appeals had held that an appeal from the granting of issues had not been timely taken, but, in doing so, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">If [the issues] were granted improperly or improvidently, the party aggrieved has a right of appeal within thirty days after they were granted; and not subsequently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">In <em>Langhirt v. Hicks, </em>153 Md. 31, 33-34, 137 A. 482 (1927), the orphans\u2019 court had made a finding in which it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-12\"><em>[T]he caveatrix ... \u201cis entitled to have the issues </em>of fact raised by her said caveat and the answer thereto, as to the validity and genuineness of the alleged last will and testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>ment of Margaretha Langhirt, deceased, <em>sent to a court of law to be determined by a jury.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The Court of Appeals denied an immediate appeal from that finding, holding that it \u201cwas nothing more than the opinion of the court.\u201d It nonetheless speculated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">It is not from a final order, or indeed from any effective order. No doubt another order would have followed, sending issues to a court of law. <em>From such an order an appeal would lie. </em>The order passed was nothing more, in effect, than the opinion of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">153 Md. at 34, 137 A. 482 (emphasis supplied). See also <em>Safe Deposit and Trust Co. v. Hanna, </em>159 Md. 452, 455, 150 A. 870 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">After surveying a number of earlier cases, <em>Schlossberg v. Schlossberg, </em>275 Md. 600, 611, 343 A.2d 234 (1975), pronounced its judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">A distillation of the holdings in all these cases leads to the conclusion that in caveat proceedings <em>once issues have been framed by an Orphans\u2019 Court and transmitted to a couH of law for trial, such an order is \u201cfinal\u201d and appealable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdO\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\"><em>Holland v. Enright, </em>169 Md. 390, 397, 181 A. 836 (1935), similarly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\"><em>If the issues were granted improvidently or improperly, the party aggrieved has a right of appeal </em>within thirty days after the order that granted the issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">In <em>Hegmon v. Novak, </em>130 Md.App. at 709-11, 747 A.2d 772, Judge Sally Adkins thoroughly surveyed the decisions of the Court of Appeals over the decades and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-15\">Accordingly, we hold that <em>the order transmitting issues was a final judgment </em>within the meaning of C J section 12-101(f).'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">130 Md.App. at 711, 747 A.2d 772 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-17\">There is a curious common feature in every one of these cases. They all concern appeals from the affirmative order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>an Orphans\u2019 Court framing and transmitting issues to the circuit court. Not one of them touches the converse situation of an Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s having denied a petition to transmit issues. Indeed, the rationale given by <em>Holland v. Enright, </em>169 Md. at 395, 181 A. 836, to explain immediate appealability dealt with the consequences of an affirmative order of transmittal but not with a negative denial of transmittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><em>Nugent v. Wright, </em>277 Md. 614, 616, 356 A.2d 548 (1976), to be sure, said the magic words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">Preliminarily, we note that <em>an appeal, </em>pursuant to Maryland Code (1974), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-501, <em>unll lie from am, order granting or refusing to grant issues.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\"><em>Nugent, </em>however, was itself an appeal from the granting of issues, not from the denying of issues. The two cases it cited were cases dealing with the affirmative act of granting issues. There was no discussion to indicate that the bilateral phraseology \u201cgranting or refusing\u201d was anything other than inadvertent, not even so much as a conscious dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Significantly, the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court of April 6, 2005, from which the appellants are attempting to appeal is not an order transmitting issues, but a denial of a petition to transmit issues. Accordingly, at oral argument we pushed the appellants hard on the question of whether immediate appeal-ability from an issues order is only unilateral or is truly bilateral. May it lie from a denial of transmittal as well as from a grant of transmittal?</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Our deeper examination of this nuance, however, has persuaded us that the appellants were absolutely right. <em>Barroll v. Reading, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 175 (1821), is the fountainhead decision. The appellants in that case were attempting to caveat a will. They sought, initially imperfectly but ultimately effectively, a plenary hearing and the submission of an issue to a jury, which application was denied by the Orphans\u2019 Court. In reversing that order to deny the transmission of issues, Judge Buchanan held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>[T]he Court was dearly wrong in refusing to dired </em>a plenary proceeding, and <em>an issue or issues to be made up and sent to a Court of law for trial </em>on the application of the appellants, as directed by the sixteenth and seventeenth sections of the fifteenth sub-chapter of the Act of 1798, eh.. 101, which are imperative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">5 H. &amp; J. at 176 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">The Court of Appeals went on to elaborate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\"><em>The objection that an appeal will not lie in such a case a,s this, </em>and that the record is not properly before us, <em>cannot be sustained. The language of the Act of Assembly is, \u201cany person </em>who may conceive him or herself aggrieved by any judgment, decree, decision or order, of the Orphans\u2019 Court, <em>shall have the liberty of appealing,\u201d &amp; </em>c. <em>emphatically giving an appeal from any decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court; </em>and <em>it is quite clear that a refusal </em>of a prayer proffered by a party to a contest in that Court, <em>is a decision of the Court </em>upon such prayer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Citing <em>Barroll v. Reading, </em>1 Sykes, <em>Probate Law and Practice </em>(1956), \u00a7 243, p. 252, states the Maryland practice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_8\">It has been held that an appeal may be taken from an order <em>granting or refusing </em>to grant issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">A decision by an Orphans\u2019 Court to deny the transmittal of issues is a final judgment within the contemplation of Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-501, as surely as would be the affirmative grant of such an order. As such, it is immediately appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">C. Issues Affecting Attorney\u2019s Fees As Appropriate for Transmittal</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">The immediate appealability of the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court to refuse to transmit issues will be of no solace to the appellants, however, unless the issues sought to be transmitted are, in terms of their purpose, appropriate for trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>mittal in the first place. As Judge Adkins told us in <em>Kao v. Hsia, </em>309 Md. at 374, 524 A.2d 70:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">An orphans\u2019 court may not send <em>any </em>issue of fact to a circuit court for determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">All of the issues that were the subject of the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s denial of April 6, 2005, unquestionably had a bearing on the two petitions for attorneys\u2019 fees and the appellants\u2019 exceptions thereto. At that point in the proceedings, moreover, they had no other purpose. The Petition for Transmission of Issues recited the context in which and for which the request was being made.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\"><em>Pending before this Court are petitions for the award and allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees, </em>expenses and costs incurred in connection with or related to the caveat proceedings instituted by Petitioners in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">(Emphasis supplied). The appellants also averred in their appellate brief that the issues bore on the entitlement of the petitioners to legal fees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\"><em>Appellants proposed issties </em>regarding breach of fiduciary duty, conflict of interest by a fiduciary, \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201cjust cause\u201d all plainly involve disputed questions of fact, the resolution of which <em>will aid the Orphans Court in resolving the ultimate entitlement, if any, of Appellees to fees and expenses in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">In <em>Miller v. Gehr, </em>91 Md. 709, 47 A. 1032 (1900), the executors of a will petitioned the Orphans\u2019 Court for the payment of a fee to the attorneys who had represented them in an unsuccessful caveat proceeding. The successful caveat-ors filed exceptions, alleging that the fee was \u201cexcessive, oppressive and unreasonable.\u201d The court set the petition down for a hearing and the exceptants then filed another petition in which they \u201cprayed that issues be framed and transmitted to a Court of law.\u201d The Orphans\u2019 Court denied that request for the transmittal of issues. An appeal was taken. 91 Md. at 713, 47 A. 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The Court of Appeals, in affirming the Orphans\u2019 Court, pointed out that the decision of 1) whether to award a fee and 2) what is the reasonable amount of a fee was one entrusted to the discretion of the Orphans\u2019 Court and was not, therefore, an appropriate issue to be submitted to a circuit court jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY91\"><em>[W]e do not think that such issues were proper. It is for the Orphans\u2019 Court to determine, what fee shall be allowed </em>the attorneys who represented the executors, and <em>it is not a proper subject for issues. </em>The Orphans\u2019 Court is bound by the finding of a jury on issues properly framed and transmitted to a Court of law, and therefore, if the allowance of fees is a proper subject for the consideration of a jury, it, and not the Court, would determine that question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">91 Md. at 716-17, 47 A. 1032 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In <em>Maynadier v. Armstrong, </em>98 Md. 175, 56 A. 357 (1903), the primary reason relied on by the Court of Appeals for affirming a decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court not to transmit issues to a jury was that the hearing on the merits before the Orphans\u2019 Court had actually begun. The Court of Appeals also noted, however, that certain of the issues dealt with matters within the discretion of the Orphans\u2019 Court and were, therefore, not appropriate issues for transmittal in any event.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0V\">At least <em>some of them are not proper subjects for issues. </em>For example, one was, \u201cAre said administrators entitled to an allowance for the sum of $147.00 for funeral expenses paid Henry Tarring, or any part thereof, and if so, for what sum.\u201d Section 5 of Article 93 of the Code expressly provides for \u201cfuneral expenses to be allowed at the discretion of the Court according to the condition and circumstances of the deceased, not to exceed three hundred dollars.\u201d It is for the Orphans\u2019 Court and not a jury to determine whether such an allowance should be made. <em>Another issue framed was whether the administrators are entitled to an allowance </em>for the sum of $50.00 <em>for attorneys\u2019 fees paid by them, </em>or any part thereof. We decided in <em>Miller v. Gehr, </em>91 Md. at 717, 47 A. 1032, that <em>such question is not a proper subject for issues, as the Orphans\u2019 Court must determine it, </em>subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>to the right of appeal to this Court as to the reasonableness of the allowance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">98 Md. at 180, 56 A. 357 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">1 Sykes, <em>Probate Law and Practice </em>(1956), \u00a7 223, p. 236, is in complete agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\"><em>Issues </em>which relate ... to questions that are within the court\u2019s discretion, <em>such as counsel fees, </em>or funeral expenses, <em>are improper.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">(Emphasis supplied). 2 Sykes, \u00a7 893, p. 52, reiterates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\"><em>Counsel fees are not a proper subject of issues. It is the duty of the court, </em>and not of a jury, <em>to determine the reasonableness of afee.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">In their reply brief in a single passing sentence without legal citation or argument, the appellants seem to suggest that the rule of <em>Miller v. Gehr </em>and <em>Maynadier v. Armstrong </em>applies only to the dollar amount of the fees in issue and not to \u201cthe factual issues of good faith, just cause and conflict of interest\u201d on the part of the special administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">We do not agree. The discretionary decision that is entrusted to the Orphans\u2019 Court with respect to fee petitions is an indivisible, albeit two-pronged, inquiry that embraces 1) the decision of the special administrator to engage counsel as surely as it does 2) the size of the bill submitted by the attorneys. 2 Sykes, <em>Probate Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 895, p. 54, spells out the dual nature of the necessarily intertwined issue entrusted to the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-13\">The action of the Orphans\u2019 Court in allowing fees may be reviewed on appeal; <em>first, as to the authority to make such allowance </em>in the particular case; <em>second, as to the reasonableness of the fee </em>allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">In <em>National Wildlife Federation v.

Both the evidentiary hearing and the ultimate decision were within the province of the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">Based upon the test we have created today, we believe <em>an evidentiary hearing was required </em>and its denial was an abuse of discretion. <em>We thus remand to the orphans\u2019 court so that such a hearing may be held.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">83 Md.App. at 500, 575 A.2d 776 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In <em>Fields v. Mersack, </em>83 Md.App. at 658-59, 577 A.2d 376, we also remanded the case to the Montgomery County Orphans\u2019 Court so that the judge, in determining whether the attorney\u2019s fee was properly chargeable to the estate, could consider whether the \u201cpersonal representative had acted in good faith and with just cause.\u201d The question of good faith was an inextricable part of the decision with respect to the attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\"><em>[I]t is a factual question whether a personal representative has acted in good faith and with just cause in defending or prosecuting a caveat proceeding. </em>Because that issue is neither presented to nor decided by the jury in a caveat proceeding, <em>that factual determination must be made by the trial judge, to whom the issue of the source of the payment of the attorney\u2019s fees is presented.</em><footnotemark><em>[25]</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">The appellants\u2019 second contention seeks to appeal a non-appealable order. We hold that because all of the issues which the appellants, on March 2, 2005, sought to have transmitted to the circuit court for fact-finding by a jury concerned the discretionary decision of awarding attorneys\u2019 fees, a subject within the exclusive domain of the Orphans\u2019 Court, those issues were not appropriate for transmittal.

When the merits of the fee petitions in this case are ultimately considered by the Orphans' Court, the question of Charles Kresslein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Jr.'s right to continue as special administrator will inevitably arise, notwithstanding the fact that his timely resignation prevented an earlier ruling on that issue. On April 9, 1998, the Orphans\u2019 Court found that Mr. Kresslein had \"failed to establish that he [was] defending the caveat in good faith and with just cause.\u201d On July 31, 1998, the Orphans\u2019 Court ordered Mr. Kresslein \"to resign as Personal Representative\u201d (he was actually the Special Administrator).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The question will arise in connection with the issue of who is responsible for the legal costs incurred in the course of Mr. Kresslein\u2019s appeal to this Court of the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s decision to remove him. Technically, Mr. Kresslein prevailed on that appeal, but on a procedural issue rather than on the merits. The case was remanded to the Orphans' Court for a hearing on the merits, but Mr. Kresslein resigned before such a hearing could be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In view of that procedural twist, both sides will inevitably argue the applicability of the holding in <em>Sullivan v.

This rule was laid down in <em>Ex parte Young, </em>8 Gill 285, by analogy to the practice of allowing an executor to pay counsel fees for the successful defense of a will. But <em>this Court has also distinctly held that an administrator whose letters are revoked, on the ground that they were prematurely or improvidently granted, is not entitled to be allowed counsel fees out of the estate for defending his position. </em>The reason for this rule is that <em>legal services rendered by an attorney in defending letters of administration which are revoked cannot be said to be for the benefit of the estate.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Grappling with precisely the same procedural twist, counsel will also battle over the applicability of the holding in <em>Horton v.

When the Orphans\u2019 Court is finally able to consider the merits of the fee petitions in this case, it may, indeed, decide to consider the cost effectiveness of some of the fees incurred. In <em>Peterson v. Orphans\u2019 Court, </em>160 Md.App. 137, 862 A.2d 1050 (2004), the Orphans\u2019 Court, considering a fee petition pursuant to Trusts and Estates Article, \u00a7 7-602, cut a requested fee from $4,269 to $1,423.25.

By contrast, we will never know whether Mr. Kresslein\u2019s effort to defend his incumbency would or would not have been successful, for his resignation precluded a finding on the merits from ever being made.
