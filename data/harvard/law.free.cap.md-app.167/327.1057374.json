Under the contract, Phoenix was obligated to remove medical and other waste generated by JHH. In February 2003, seven years prior to the anticipated expiration of the contract, Hopkins terminated the parties\u2019 agreement. Claiming that the termination was \u201cfor cause,\u201d Hopkins refused to pay the early termination fee of approximately $5 million. Consequently, on March 14, 2003, Phoenix filed a \u201cComplaint for Declaratory Relief\u2019 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. As amended, Phoenix sought a declaration, <em>inter alia, </em>that JHH unlawfully terminated the contract. In its answer and counterclaim, JHH sought opposing declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">The circuit court held a seven-day bench trial in March 2004. In a \u201cMemorandum Opinion\u201d dated June 18, 2004, the court ruled that JHH was justified in terminating the contract. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>On July 7, 2004, the court issued its \u201cDeclaratory Judgment\u201d in favor of JHH.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">On appeal, Phoenix poses four questions, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">I. Did the circuit court err in rejecting the Certificate of the Independent Engineer and substituting its judgment for the Independent Engineer\u2019s \u201cCertified Assurance\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">II. Did the circuit court err when it inserted into the parties\u2019 contract a new and additional requirement that the Independent Engineer\u2019s Certificate be unconditional and contain no assumptions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">III. Did the circuit court err in finding that the Independent Engineer did not certify that any changes had been made by Phoenix?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">IV. Did the circuit court err when it refused to admit evidence that the plan certified by the Independent Engineer actually worked?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">JHH and other Baltimore area hospitals (the \u201cFounding Hospitals\u201d) contracted with Phoenix to create and operate a \u201cRegional System\u201d for the disposal of medical and non-medical waste. The parties\u2019 relationship is governed by a \u201cWaste Supply Agreement\u201d (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) dated November 16, 1989, and the \u201cFirst Amendment to Waste Supply Agreement\u201d (the \u201cAmendment\u201d), dated November 15, 1994 (collectively, the \u201cContract\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>In connection with the establishment of the Regional System, Phoenix constructed a facility in Baltimore City containing two large incinerators designed to dispose of both medical and non-medical waste (the \u201cFacility\u201d). Phoenix also established a \u201cTransportation System\u201d for the collection and conveyance of unsegregated medical and general waste from the Founding Hospitals to the Facility. <em>See </em>Agreement, \u00b6 3.0.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the Contract, JHH was obligated to pay for the processing of a certain guaranteed annual tonnage of waste (the \u201cGAT\u201d) for a period of twenty years. <em>See </em>Agreement, \u00b6 6.0; \u00b6 2.0. JHH produces an average of about 700,000 pounds of waste each month. At peak times, it produces 3,000 pounds of waste per hour.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Article 3 of the Agreement pertains to \u201cDisposal of Waste,\u201d while Article 4 pertains to the \u201cTransportation System.\u201d It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">4.0. <em>Transportation. </em>In accordance with the Transportation Addendum, MWA, at its sole expense, shall, commencing on the Notification Date, transport all Acceptable Waste from Waste Supplier\u2019s place of business to the Facility in compliance with Applicable Law, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement. As described in this Article, MWA shall provide certain equipment for the collection, storage and transportation of Acceptable Waste within Waste Supplier\u2019s place of business and from Waste Supplier\u2019s place of business to the Facility. The Transportation System shall be installed and operated according to the terms and conditions contained in the Transportation Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>dendum. MWA shall at all times maintain the Transportation System in good working order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">4.1. <em>Disposal Carts. </em>Subject to the provisions of the Transportation Addendum, MWA shall provide to the Waste Supplier disposal carts ... for the purpose of collecting, storing and transporting Acceptable Waste to the Facility .... The number of such carts shall be reasonably sufficient to allow the collection and removal of all Acceptable Waste from Waste Supplier\u2019s place of business.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Article 16, entitled \u201cDispute Resolution,\u201d states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">(b) When the amount of the matter in controversy exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,-000.00), such Issue shall be decided by arbitration conducted by three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, provided that the party to such arbitration shall have, for a period of six (6) months following initiation of such arbitration proceeding, all rights of discovery provided by the Maryland Rules of Civil Procedure and Practice then pertaining.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">(c) The agreement to arbitrate contained in this Section shall be specifically enforceable under the Maryland Arbitration Act as amended. <em>The award rendered by the arbitrators) shall be final, </em>and judgment may be entered upon and in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Pursuant to the \u201cRecitals\u201d portion of the Agreement, construction of the Regional System was to be financed, in part, \u201cby tax-exempt bonds issued by the Maryland Industrial Development Finance Authority (\u201cMIDFA\u201d).\u201d The Agreement served as security for the bonds; because the bonds had a term of twenty-one years, \u201clong term commitments\u201d were sought for use of the Facility. Neil Ruther, Esquire, Vice-President and General Counsel for Phoenix, explained at trial that the bond underwriters\u2019 legal counsel insisted that the Agreement contain \u201cstrict provisions that would make it next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>to impossible in all but the most extreme circumstances for the hospitals to cancel [their] agreements.\u201d Therefore, JHH was entitled to terminate the Agreement \u201cfor any reason,\u201d so long as it gave thirty days\u2019 notice <em>and </em>made a substantial payment to Phoenix in accordance with calculations specified in the Agreement. <em>See </em>Agreement, \u00b6 14.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">At the outset, JHH briefly participated in the Regional System. But, the parties agreed that Phoenix was then unable to service Hopkins adequately. JHH was not brought back into the system until 1992. Even then, JHH continued to experience problems with Phoenix\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Ruther characterized Phoenix\u2019s performance during the period of 1992 to 1994 as \u201cspotty.\u201d He acknowledged that \u201cthe system of carts ... was still problematic\u201d and the plant was \u201cin fairly severe financial difficulty.\u201d Ruther also recalled that, in the winter of 1994, Phoenix \u201cwas not able to process\u201d appellee\u2019s waste \u201cin accordance with the Contract.\u201d In February 1994, because of MWA\u2019s poor performance, JHH suspended its participation in the Regional System.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Joanne E. Poliak, Esquire, Vice-President and General Counsel of JHH, wrote to Ruther on February 18, 1994. She said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">JHH notifies MWA .. . that MWA has not met its obligations under the Agreement and is incapable of curing such failure to perform without a substantial revision and/or reorganization of MWA\u2019s operations and finances. Because the health and welfare of JHH\u2019s patients and employees have been directly affected by MWA\u2019s prior inability to perform under the Agreement, JHH cannot permit resumption of MWA service until a long-range plan of meaningful correction has been agreed to by JHH and MWA.... During the plan development period, JHH will burn its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>waste and the parties\u2019 obligations under the Agreement will be suspended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">Repeated telephone calls from representatives of JHH through the summer and fall of 1993 advised MWA of the repeated and severe breach of contract provisions. Meetings between representatives of JHH and MWA to discuss the deficiencies occurred on September 1, 1993, October 18, 1993, November 10, 1993, and December 20, 1993 ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">Despite these repeated notifications, meetings and correspondence, MWA\u2019s performance did not improve. Indeed, the consistent and persistent lack of performance culminated in a disastrous situation for JHH at the end of January [1994]. Over a period of several days, MWA did not perform and the waste accumulated at JHH causing severe health and safety hazards. The piles of trash and red-bag wastes were piled to the ceiling in the corridors in the basement of the Hospital and on the patient floors of the Hospital. Patients, visitors and professional personnel walked between walls of waste to travel from the Emergency Room to the X-Ray Department or up to the patient halls. Entranceways to elevators were blocked with stacks of waste. On many patient halls there was no room to move stretchers with patients between the piles of waste. Under any standard, MWA\u2019s performance was wholly inadequate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">In contrast to the originally envisioned regional waste concept [under the Agreement] which would avoid continual contact with medical wastes by JHH\u2019s employees, these employees have been forced over the past year, and were forced during this recent critical period, to handle red-bag wastes on a continual basis ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">On June 13, 1994, Phoenix filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As part of Phoenix\u2019s reorganization plan, Grotech Capital Group (\u201cGro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>tech\u201d), a Maryland venture capital firm,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> planned to invest over $7 million in Phoenix for various improvements. However, Grotech predicated its investment on JHH\u2019s willingness to resume supplying waste to Phoenix.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">As we discuss in more detail, <em>infra, </em>Hugh Woltzen, a CPA and managing director and partner of Grotech in 1994, and G. Daniel Shealer, Jr., Esquire, a vice president and deputy general counsel of JHH, both testified that: 1) Grotech wanted to assure Hopkins\u2019s continued participation under the Agreement and limit Hopkins\u2019s ability to arbitrarily terminate the Contract; and 2) Hopkins was willing to resume business with Phoenix only upon amendment of the Agreement to include specific standards of performance and provisions for early termination in the event that Phoenix failed to satisfy these standards. These objectives culminated in the Amendment of November 15,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Among other things, the Amendment contemplated a review of appellant\u2019s waste disposal system and Facility by an \u201cIndependent Engineer.\u201d As reflected in the Amendment, the parties agreed that R.W. Beck &amp; Associates (\u201cBeck\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would serve as the Independent Engineer. Pursuant to the \u201cRecitals\u201d section of the Amendment, Phoenix \u201cproposed to make the additions, improvements, and renovations to the Facility\u201d as set forth in Beck\u2019s report of April 20, 1994, which was attached to the Amendment as an exhibit (the \u201c1994 Beck Report\u201d). These changes were referred to as the \u201cCapital Improvement Program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>In \u00b6 13(b) of the Amendment, JHH agreed to rescind the suspension of service on the \u201cEffective Date\u201d of the Contract. Pursuant to \u00b6 13(a), the \u201cEffective Date\u201d was defined as the date on which Phoenix delivered to JHH \u201ca certificate of the Independent Engineer stating that the JHH Capital Improvement Program has been completed.\u201d In 1996, after appellant provided JHH with Beck\u2019s certification, JHH lifted the suspension and resumed supplying waste to Phoenix.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The Amendment included various exhibits outlining Phoenix\u2019s duties to JHH. Pursuant to Exhibit I, titled \u201cTransportation Addendum for The Johns Hopkins Hospital,\u201d Phoenix was required to make seven daily pickups according to a specific schedule. Moreover, it was required to arrive within sixty minutes before or after each scheduled pickup. Exhibit G, titled \u201cIntermediate Sanctions,\u201d provided for a monetary penalty if Phoenix arrived beyond the scheduled time. It also said: \u201cIn addition, if the On-Time Pickup Rate for all Founding Hospitals for a month is less than 90%, within 5 Business Days after the end of the month MWA shall, in addition to the Sanctions, deposit $5,000 into the Transportation Improvement Fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Under \u00b6 2.2 of the Amendment, the Contract was to continue until July 2, 2011. As outlined in \u00b6 13(b), the Amendment included a multi-step process to terminate the Contract for cause: (1) the occurrence of a \u201cMajor Backup\u201d and a written notice from JHH to appellant of cause for suspension (see Amendment, \u00b6\u00b6 13(b)(l)(A)-(C)); (2) JHH\u2019s issuance of a notice of suspension, if Phoenix failed to resolve the Major Backup within three hours of its receipt of the notice; (see \u00b6 13(b)(1)(D))<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (3) the failure of Phoenix to provide a Certificate of Reasonable Assurances (the \u201cCertificate\u201d) from an agreed upon Independent Engineer, within the time provided (see \u00b6 13(b)(1)(D)). In the absence of cause, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>JHH could unilaterally buy out its participation, in accordance with a formula set forth in \u00b6 14.2 of the Agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">We quote from \u00b6 13 of the Amendment, because it is central to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">(b) ... MWA recognizes that it has an obligation not again to impair the Waste Supplier\u2019s expectation of receiving performance under this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">(1) Accordingly, if at any time after the Effective Date,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">(A) MWA fails to make</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">(i) three Complete Scheduled Pickups (for purposes of this Section, a Complete Scheduled Pickup shall mean the arrival of an empty trailer with the capacity to haul 48 carts, as described on Exhibit I hereto) for which Sanctions are applicable under Exhibit G within a one week period or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">(ii) three Complete Scheduled Pickups within a day for which Sanctions are applicable under Exhibit G, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">(B) the failure causes more than 50 carts of waste to be backed up at the Waste Supplier\u2019s facilities, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-11\">(C) the Waste Supplier gives MWA a written notice of cause for suspension (which may be by facsimile) stating that, at the time of the notice, the pickups have not been made and MWA\u2019s failure to remedy the situation will result in suspension (the concurrence of events (A), (B) shall collectively constitute a \u201cMajor Backup\u201d), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-12\">(D) within three hours after receipt of the notice, MWA has not arrived at the Waste Supplier\u2019s loading facilities with sufficient tractors, trailers, equipment, and personnel to effect the prompt removal of all waste that was to have been removed by the missed or partial pickups, the Waste Supplier may, by the issuance of a notice of suspension not later than 30 hours after the Major Backup, cause the initiation of a suspension period. The suspension period shall continue until the Waste Supplier receives reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>assurances in the form of a certificate of the Independent Engineer stating that [Phoenix] <em>has made changes to the Transportation System or the Facility sufficient to prevent the recurrence of a failure to comply with the agreed upon schedule of pickups. </em>The failure of [Phoenix] to provide such certified assurance within the sooner of (i) 30 days (or such longer period not to exceed 60 days, as the Independent Engineer certifies to be needed to implement the corrective changes with due diligence) from the notice or (ii) the date agreed to by both parties shall constitute an Event of Default under the Waste Supply Agreement which, notwithstanding any other provision (including, without limitation, Section 14.1) of the Waste Supply Agreement to the contrary, shall give [JHH] the option of terminating the Waste Supply Agreement without penalty upon notice given during the suspension period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In sum, as JHH explains, under the Amendment \u201cthe requirements to <em>trigger </em>a suspension included both late pickups and a backup of waste, [but] the requirements to <em>lift </em>a suspension were focused exclusively on Phoenix\u2019s assured ability to meet the pickup schedule in the future; if Phoenix did not provide reasonable assurances that it would avoid future late deliveries, JHH was permitted to terminate\u2014 without any showing that there would be future backups.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Woltzen testified that he was \u201cvery involved all the way through\u201d the negotiations that led to execution of the Amendment. He engaged in discussions with Colene Daniel, Vice-President of Corporate Services and Community Health and Services at JHH, as well as Shealer and Plank. According to Woltzen, Grotech would not agree to invest $7 million in Phoenix as part of its reorganization unless Hopkins, appellant\u2019s \u201clargest customer,\u201d was committed to continuing its Agreement with Phoenix for the remaining term of the Contract. Woltzen explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">[0]ur opinion was, [Phoenix] was not viable without the Hopkins contract. Furthermore, in our opinion, [JHH] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>added two things, first thing was the largest amount of cash flow relative to the contract and second, Hopkins as important to us in this transaction because obviously it has a world class reputation as one of the finest hospitals in the country, in the world. They thought that would lead other people to believe this was a viable opportunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">To be sure, Woltzen acknowledged that JHH was \u201cvery concerned [about the] recurrence of performance problems.\u201d Nevertheless, he reiterated that he \u201cwasn\u2019t willing to invest [his] firm\u2019s money in the project without certification that Hopkins was going to be there,\u201d and participate \u201c[t]hrough the life of the agreement.... \u201d Woltzen\u2019s \u201creaction\u201d was, \u201cwe have got to have a contract [with JHH]. We have to know that cash flows are definitive, and you can\u2019t, based on a whim, change this contract based on anything, change this contract, it\u2019s a take or pay contract, that is [set] up to service those bonds, and we are not putting money in unless you are sure [Hopkins is] going to be there.\u201d Woltzen added: \u201cI had to have [JHH] in the facility, there are no questions about that in my mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8X\">Of import here, Woltzen insisted that, from \u201ca business standpoint,\u201d the language of \u00a7 13(b)(1)(D) regarding the Certificate made clear that the Independent Engineer\u2019s decision was binding. The following testimony is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">[COUNSEL FOR PHOENIX]: All right. Was there any discussion about the terms of [sic] conditions which Hopkins could leave the system?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">[MR. WOLTZEN]: Well, there were discussions about what happened if something goes wrong. I wasn\u2019t willing to make the investment, unless I was actually sure they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t leave the system, but there was discussion about what would happen if there was a recurrence of the problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">The substance was there was a series of events, notices, those kind of things, time, deadlines, those kind of things, <em>at the end of the day though, there was a final determination to be made that was almost like an arbitration. It was </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>basically, an engineer that comes in, looks at the facility </em>and provides, say, hey, [the] facility is adequate to service the hospital and the reasonfs] for the fear have been taken care of, and we can go forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">[COUNSEL FOR PHOENIX]: Can you tell us what conversations there were between you and Hopkins concerning how that issue would finally be resolved, <em>who would make a decision?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">[MR. WOLTZEN]: <em>The independent engineer or the engineer.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">THE COURT: And what\u2019s the decision that the engineer is making?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">[MR. WOLTZEN]: The decision, Your Honor, that the engineer is making that the plant is capable of performing as, under the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">[COUNSEL FOR PHOENIX]: And that kind of discussion would occur after what kind of event had occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">[MR. WOLTZEN]: After there had been some disruption of service, after they had gone into the process leading up to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\">[COUNSEL FOR PHOENIX]: When you left that investigation, could you tell the Court whether or not there was doubt in your mind whether there was a deal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-11\">[MR. WOLTZEN]: No, <em>it was very clear to me and even after ten years, still is, that if we had a dispute, we would bring in the engineer for better or worse.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-12\">[COUNSEL FOR PHOENIX]: You would have to live with the results?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-13\">[MR. WOLTZEN]: <em>We have to live with the results. They have to live with the results, and for better or worse would be determinative </em>whether or not they would go forward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAq\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">On cross-examination, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A79\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Okay. And if you were concerned about [the Contract] being iron-clad, you saw this language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>did you ever pick up the phone and call Dan Shealer or Colene Daniel, for instance, or anyone, and say, we need to put something in here that says the decision of the engineer is final, binding, conclusive, anything like that, did you ever do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">[WOLTZEN]: There were a lot of discussions, and <em>I made it very clear to Dan Shealer, to Colene Daniel and everybody at Hopkins that we are not going to make our investment, unless we were sure they were going to be in here, and it was iron-clad. I was very clear on that </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Mr. Woltzen, my question to you is did you ever ask anyone to put in the agreement language that said not only that there would be a certificate of an engineer, but it would be binding or conclusive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADr\">[WOLTZEN]: And the answer is yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Well, when it wasn\u2019t in there, did you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">[WOLTZEN]: I think it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Show me the language that says that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">[WOLTZEN]: It starts out in the same paragraph you said that says, suspension period shall continue until the company receives, or Hopkins receive reasonable assurances in the form of engineer certificate that it could go on period. I mean it can\u2019t be any more clear than that to me, at least on a business standpoint, it\u2019s clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">According to JHH, after the Amendment was executed \u201cPhoenix\u2019s service was as poor as its predecessor\u2019s.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On January 8, 2003, one of Phoenix\u2019s two incinerators was shut down because of a rupture in the steel of the incinerator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201cwater jacket.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Annette Fries, Senior Counsel for JHH, wrote to Michael Plank, President of Phoenix, on January 10, 2003, advising that \u201cclose to 300 carts\u201d of waste had accumulated in the hallways of JHH. She stated: \u201c[I]t is Phoenix\u2019s responsibility to remove the trash that is generated by this institution. Phoenix has consistently failed to do so. Please advise me immediately what steps Phoenix intents [sic] to take to remedy this intolerable situation immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Thereafter, at approximately midnight on January 11, 2003, while one incinerator \u201cwas down for repair,\u201d Phoenix\u2019s other incinerator \u201cruptured,\u201d flooding the basement of the Facility.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plank acknowledged at trial: \u201cThere was nothing we could do at that point but to shut the incinerator down because the water had risen to the level where it would have prevented us from running further----\u201d The water had to be pumped from the basement and, once the incinerators were repaired, they had to warm up for \u201csix to eight\u201d hours.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Plank conceded that, \u201cfor 26 hours,\u201d Phoenix lacked \u201cany incineration capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Consequently, from January 12, 2003, to January 14, 2003, Phoenix did not make all of its scheduled pickups at JHH. In particular, on Sunday, January 12, 2003, Phoenix failed to make all of JHH\u2019s scheduled pickups. On January 13, Phoenix made one of five scheduled pickups, at 10:00 p.m.; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>missed two and made the other two the next day. On January 14, Phoenix missed all five scheduled pickups; the only pickups on that date were two that had been scheduled for January 13, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">At 3:37 p.m. on January 15, 2003, Shealer sent Plank and Ruther a letter, by facsimile, captioned: \u201cNotice of Major Backup under the Waste Supply Agreement between The Johns Hopkins Hospital and Medical Waste Associates Limited Partnership dated October 2,1989 as amended by the First Amendment to Waste Supply Agreement dated November 15, 1994 (the \u201cAgreement\u201d).\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">I am writing in follow-up to Annette Fries\u2019 letter to Mr. Plank dated January 10, 2003, in which we notified you of a significant back-up of waste at The Johns Hopkins Hospital (\u201cJHH\u201d) created by several missed pick-ups and further exacerbated by what we understand to be the partial shut down of the Medical Waste Associates Limited Partnership (\u201cPhoenix\u201d) plant over the weekend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">Please be advised that Phoenix has missed three scheduled pick-ups on January 14: 4:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m., and 10:45 p.m. and two scheduled pick-ups on January 15: 7:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. This has caused a back-up of approximately 200 carts of waste at JHH. This letter constitutes written notice of cause for suspension. At the time of this notice, the pick-ups have not been made. Phoenix\u2019s failure to remedy the situation as provided for in the Agreement will result in the suspension under the Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">JHH\u2019s transportation logs, admitted in evidence, showed that Phoenix was over sixty-one minutes late for the five scheduled pickups referenced in Shealer\u2019s letter. Three missed pickups, combined with substantial accumulation of waste, constituted a Major Backup under the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">JHH\u2019s Notice triggered Phoenix\u2019s obligation under the Amendment to remedy the Major Backup within three hours. Although an illegally parked truck blocked Phoenix\u2019s access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the JHH loading dock until approximately 5:20 p.m. on January 15, 2003, the waste was not removed by 8:20 p.m., <em>i.e., </em>within three hours of clearance of the dock. According to Plank, Phoenix\u2019s employees removed waste from JHH until 6:00 a.m. on January 16, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">By facsimile on January 16, 2003, Shealer sent a \u201cNotice of Suspension\u201d to Plank and Ruther. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">The Major Backup (as such term is defined in the Agreement) of which [JHH] notified [Phoenix] at 3:21 p.m. yesterday was not remedied in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Accordingly, JHH is providing Phoenix with this notice of suspension, which causes the initiation of a suspension period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">During the suspension period, JHH will continue to deliver Acceptable Waste to Phoenix. Under the terms of the Agreement, Phoenix has an on-going responsibility to perform its duties under the Agreement utilizing Phoenix\u2019s Backup Systems (as defined in the Agreement)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">As noted, pursuant to \u00b6 13(b)(1)(D) of the Agreement, in order to avoid an \u201cEvent of Default,\u201d Phoenix had thirty days in which to provide a Certificate of Reasonable Assurances from the Independent Engineer. To that end, Phoenix engaged Beck to satisfy its contractual obligations. In turn, Beck assigned the matter to Herbert Kosstrin, Ph.D.; since 1988, Kosstrin has been \u201ca senior project manager\u201d at Beck. Although Dr. Kosstrin holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering, a Masters Degree in Aerospace Engineering, and a doctorate in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, he is not a licensed professional engineer in any state.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">On January 24, 2003, Richard Montgomery, Chairman of the Board of Phoenix, sent an email to Todd Gartrell, Director of the Department of Environmental Services at Hopkins, concerning \u201cthe scope\u201d of Dr. Kosstrin\u2019s \u201creview.\u201d Montgomery alerted JHH that Kosstrin would \u201cfocus on the causes for Phoenix not picking up the waste at the hospital,\u201d including \u201ca review of the transportation system, the number of carts available to serve the hospital and the back up plan that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>in place at that time.\u201d Montgomery also alerted JHH that Kosstrin \u201cwants to visit the hospital to familiarize himself with the hospital\u2019s requirements, facilities and resources and see how waste is delivered to the loading area for transport to Phoenix,\u201d and to \u201creview the steps being proposed to prevent a repeat of such back up episodes.\u201d In addition, Montgomery indicated that he asked Kosstrin to \u201clook at the total flow of waste from the hospital and determine if the current service template addresses the current needs of the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Kosstrin prepared the proposed Certificate, provided it to Phoenix for comment, and then incorporated Phoenix\u2019s comments. On February 14, 2003,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Beck sent its \u201cCertificate of the Independent Engineer: Medical Waste Associates Changes to Facility Back-Up Plan,\u201d dated February 14, 2003, to Plank and Shealer under the signature \u201cR.W. Beck, Inc.\u201d The cover letter accompanying the Certificate was also from Beck, and was signed by Kosstrin as \u201cPrincipal and Senior Director, Special Projects.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">Attached is our Certificate of the Independent Engineer which is being provided pursuant to Section 13(b)(1)(D) of the First Amendment of the Waste Supply Agreement between Medical Waste Associates Limited Partnership and John Hopkins Hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In the Certificate, Beck explained that it reached its conclusions after it (1) visited the Facility; (2) met with representatives of Phoenix; (3) met with JHH and visited JHH\u2019s waste holding area and loading dock; (4) reviewed Phoenix\u2019s existing backup plan; and (5) reviewed Phoenix\u2019s revised backup plan, intended to prevent the recurrence of noncompliance. Beck also attached as Exhibit A to its Certificate, a four-page report discussing its findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">In Exhibit A, Beck summarized Phoenix\u2019s backup plan at the time of the outages in January 2003, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">In essence, MWA\u2019s primary plan was to minimize the waste received at the Facility via agreed upon measures with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>hospitals including, segregation of the general waste (clear bag) and medical waste (red bag), store as much waste as possible while the units are brought back online and bypass some waste to outside disposal facilities as necessary____ Prior to the time of the claimed Major Back-Up, one combustion system at the Facility was shutdown for scheduled maintenance and repairs. The one steam autoclave that could accept cart waste was awaiting delivery of parts to repair the size reduction system, while the second combustion system was experiencing mechanical issues with the ash sump and was forced to shut down at midnight (24:00 hours), Saturday, January 11, 2003. It took approximately 30 hours to return the first combustion system back into service. During this period, MWA reports that on Sunday, January 12, 2003, it requested the hospitals to segregate their wastes and stated that MWA would cause open top dumpsters to be delivered to the hospitals to take care of the general wastes....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">Although the incinerator forced outage occurred on Saturday night, January 11, 2003 and continued until Monday morning (05:45 hours) January 13, 2003, MWA started to see the effects of the outage on Tuesday and Wednesday when the flow of waste that needed to be incinerated was in excess of the 85 TPD permitted capacity of the single incinerator. This waste flow, combined with the inability of the hospital to segregate waste, resulted in saturation of storage at the Facility and in MWA missing some pick-ups.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Beck also indicated that \u201cstorage capacity [at the Facility] is limited,\u201d and the \u201cinability to store waste puts constraints on the Facility when both incinerators are out of service.\u201d Further, Beck stated that, following the Notice of Suspension, Phoenix \u201chas taken, or <em>has stated that it intends to add, a se\u00f1es of items and arrangements to the Facility.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Beck continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">The primary enhancement to the Facility is the purchase of additional storage trailers that are to be dedicated to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Waste Supplier [i.e., JHH]. MWA has shown the Independent Engineer proof of delivery for 6 trailers with the capacity to store approximately 28 tons of waste. Such additional storage capacity should be able to accommodate approximately two days of [JHH\u2019s] waste generation .... In addition, completion of certain maintenance items has returned the Facility to full capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In addition, Beck discussed appellant\u2019s \u201crevised back-up plan,\u201d which \u201cis to be initiated when there is the potential of a delay in processing deliveries from [JHH] that would cause the next pick-up to be missed.\u201d The revised backup plan involved the following elements: 1) taking advantage of additional onsite storage at the Facility; 2) maximizing use of the autoclaves for acceptable waste if JHH does not segregate the waste; 3) having additional storage at the Facility dedicated solely to JHH; 4) training of Phoenix employees in regard to the revised backup procedure; and 5) annual testing of the procedure. In Beck\u2019s opinion, the \u201crevised back-up plan is dedicated to meeting the needs\u201d of JHH.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Relying on Exhibit A, and noting that it \u201cshould be read in it\u2019s [sic] entirety,\u201d Beck opined in the Certificate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">Based on the Independent Engineer\u2019s review of the back-up plan, the configuration of the Facility, the length of previous dual incinerator outages, and the current waste generation of [JHH] <em>and assuming that </em>[Phoenix] 1) properly operates and maintains the Facility including <em>the timely implementation of renewals and replacements, </em>2) actually initiates the back-up plan as soon as it cannot process [JHH\u2019s] deliveries, and 3) barring a force majeure type event, the Independent Engineer is of the opinion that [Phoenix] via it\u2019s [sic] revised back-up plan, which includes the procurement of additional dedicated storage for [JHH] at the Facility, has made changes to the Facility sufficient to prevent the recurrence of a failure to comply with the current agreed upon schedule of pick-ups.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">On February 25, 2003, Shealer wrote a detailed letter to Ruther, advising that JHH rejected Beck\u2019s Certificate \u201cas a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>reasonable assurance that [Phoenix] has made changes to the Transportation System or to the Facility sufficient to prevent the recurrence of a failure to comply with the agreed-upon schedule of pick-ups\u201d (the \u201cTermination Letter\u201d). Therefore, Shealer informed Phoenix that its letter \u201cserves as Notice of Termination of the Waste Supply Agreement, effective immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Shealer explained that the Certificate failed to provide the requisite assurances</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">because, among other things, (i) Beck\u2019s certificate relies on the facts stated in Exhibit A, and material facts are not included in Exhibit A or considered by the certif\u00edcate; and (ii) it does not identify any changes to the Transportation System or to the Facility that are sufficient to prevent a recurrence of the failure by Phoenix to comply with the agreed-upon schedule of pick-ups ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">In part, Shealer stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">Beck\u2019s analysis simply considers a situation when both incinerators are out of service and does not address the other flaws with the Facility and/or Transportation System that clearly existed prior to the time that both incinerators became inoperable and which caused Phoenix to fail to comply with the agreed-upon schedule of pick-ups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">Further, Beck\u2019s calculation of available waste storage capacity at the Facility in the event that both incinerators become inoperable is flawed. Phoenix has multiple agreements with other hospitals pursuant to which it is obligated to accept medical waste. Beck\u2019s calculations assume that, during a period in which both incinerators are inoperable, Phoenix would cease to provide service to other hospitals to which it was legally obligated to provide service. This is not a realistic or appropriate assumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Claiming that the Certificate failed to \u201cidentify changes to the Transportation System or Facility,\u201d Shealer also asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">The changes contemplated by the First Amendment relate to the Facility and to the Transportation System. <em>They do not contemplate that the backup plan will be the way in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>which Phoenix mil meet its agreed upon schedule of pickups. </em>Rather, subsection 13(3) [of the Agreement] provides that the back-up system will be a redundancy, rather than a primary element of the Phoenix waste removal process. Beck\u2019s certificate expressly states that [the] \u201cIndependent Engineer is of the opinion that MWA via its revised back-up plan, ... has made changes to the Facility sufficient to prevent the recurrence of a failure to comply with the current agreed-upon schedule of pick-ups.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Notably, Shealer did not challenge the Certificate on the ground that Kosstrin is not a licensed professional engineer. Shealer agreed to meet with representatives of Phoenix \u201cto discuss the possibility of a continuing business relationship under a new legal agreement with different terms.\u201d According to Phoenix, that assertion evidenced JHH\u2019s calculated plan, \u201cat the highest levels,\u201d to find a less expensive alternative to the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">By letter dated February 26, 2003, Ruther responded to JHH\u2019s termination letter, stating: \u201cNo cause exists for such termination and Phoenix considers the agreement in full force and effect. Therefore, we will continue to provide service.\u201d During the pendency of the litigation, by agreement of the parties, Phoenix continued to collect JHH\u2019s waste on the same schedule and financial terms as if the Contract had not been terminated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">At trial, Dr. Kosstrin testified that he was part of Beck\u2019s \u201cenergy asset consulting group,\u201d and in January 2003 he was part of the \u201cgeneral consulting group.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He testified generally as to the nature of his work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>[T]he vast majority of my work I do technical due diligence on various waste projects and various alternative energy projects; that includes municipal solid waste, an example of that would be a Montgomery County solid waste system and resource recovery system. It also goes beyond that, being we have done work in the disposing of solid waste, done work with disposal of medical waste. All these in a due diligence fashion where we review the work of others primarily for the purpose of financing a project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">In addition to that, we have also assisted various entities in helping them contract out how to dispose of their waste</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">I have also done a substantial amount of work in alternative energy ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Kosstrin estimated that \u201cthe majority\u201d of the sixty-five engineers at Beck\u2019s Boston office, where Kosstrin then worked, had engineering licenses. While Kosstrin acknowledged that he \u201cdid the majority of the drafting\u201d of the Certificate, he claimed that \u201cany report or certificate that leaves the office needs to be reviewed by a senior person\u201d with a license in engineering. In this matter, said Kosstrin, the Certificate was reviewed by Ken Rush, a licensed engineer with twenty-five years of experience. Rush \u201cwas familiar with the project\u201d because he \u201cworked on it several times over the course of the last eight or nine or ten years.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Describing the steps he took in early 2003 \u201cto decide whether R.W. Beck was going to issue a certificate,\u201d Kosstrin stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">Well, first we looked at the particular clause in the contract to see what type of certificate was to be issued, depending on whether or not something happened. We then gathered information from both Phoenix and the Johns Hopkins Hospital, basically, the certificate was dealing with how to, I\u2019m not sure of the proper words here, but how to give assurances to the hospital that certain things would not reoccur in the future, that the hospital was claiming had occurred sometime in January of 2003. So we investigated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>we tried to investigate what had happened. We talked to both sides as to see what they would propose to do to not have a situation reoccur. And then we independently looked at the system with our knowledge ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">With respect to Phoenix, we asked them what happened, why they didn\u2019t, you know, continuously pick up the material, what was their outage history at the facility, how they intend to maintain the facility, and what was their backup plan in general, if incinerators go down, ... and we gathered the information ..., had additional conversation^] to get more information as we made our review----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">We reviewed that plan, we looked at it as we made our own independent judgment whether they thought that plan was adequate and reasonable. When there was a facility down time, when both units were down, whether Phoenix could continue to have some place to pick up the waste. With the incinerator and facility of this type, once you pick up the waste ..., you have to get the waste out of the carts and clean the carts, put the carts back into service, and there are really only two ways to do that, one is to put them in the incinerator and incinerate the waste, and the second one is put in temporary storage so that the carts can continue [as] part of the transportation system, going back and forth and picking up the medical waste from the hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">According to Kosstrin, a representative of JHH told Beck that there was \u201cno problem with having sufficient carts in the System,\u201d and \u201cthere were sufficient carts.\u201d Because \u201cit appeared from both sides [that] there was sufficient hospital carts,\u201d Kosstrin determined that this \u201cwas no longer an issue.\u201d Kosstrin elaborated on cross-examination: \u201cIf there weren\u2019t sufficient carts at the point of [the] major backup, as claimed, then we would have done some more with the cart work. This incident was defined by Hopkins that there were sufficient carts.\u201d Kosstrin added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>We next concentrated on the next part of the system, when you were dealing with waste and picking up at point A, you are taking to point B is it has to be somehow disposed of at point B, whether they immediately physically operate the incinerator or they put it on the dock, that if done later that becomes a critical process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">During Kosstrin\u2019s discussions with JHH, it became clear that Phoenix\u2019s \u201cinitial plan which was in place at the time ... did not address the issue[s].\u201d Therefore, \u201cPhoenix came up with the second plan which used the idea of storage, dedicated to Hopkins,\u201d which Kosstrin regarded as \u201ca reasonable method.\u201d He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">The last thing was really to calculate how much storage would be reasonable, giving enough margin of safety, so if a longer outage would occur. The other key point is what we wrote in our cert[ificate], is that the process of the backup plan needed to be initiated immediately upon the inability to dispose of waste at Phoenix[\u2019s] site. The reason for that is that delays in implementing the plan had the possibility of delaying the ability to pick up the waste at Hopkins. That was a real key issue in the plan, meeting the limitation of the plan, having a plan [and] not implementing it does not help.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Before issuing the Certificate, Beck \u201creceived confirmation\u201d from Phoenix of a \u201cpurchase order for a storage trailer and a check paying for a storage trailer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">On cross-examination, Kosstrin stated that he was personally involved in the preparation of the 1994 Beck Report and in the underlying investigation of the incident in January 2003. Kosstrin maintained that he considered all causes for the Major Backup in January 2003, stating: \u201cWe think we looked at causes that happened and were relevant to this particular issue.\u201d In his view, the Major Backup in January 2003 was caused by \u201cinsufficient storage ... to handle all that waste that was coming in at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Yet, Kosstrin conceded that, at the time of the Notice of Suspension, Plank informed Kosstrin that Phoenix had space <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>for nine tons of waste, which \u201cwould have taken [care of] a large chunk\u201d of the waste. He also stated that Plank informed him that, at the time of the dual incinerator outage on January 11, 2003, \u201cthere was no waste [in] storage at that point, at the facility.\u201d Kosstrin added: \u201c[S]torage started to get filled up after that Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\u201d Further, Kosstrin agreed that, as of January 11, 2003, \u201cPhoenix was well behind in its pickups from Hopkins\u201d and \u201cit had not ameliorated that situation by putting waste in storage.\u201d Kosstrin recognized that, whether Phoenix\u2019s \u201cbackup plan called for putting [waste] in storage or not, it was available but they didn\u2019t implement it.\u201d Therefore, he indicated that Phoenix \u201cneeded a different backup plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">According to Kosstrin, when he conducted the review in 2003, he understood the Certif\u00edcate requirement as seeking reasonable assurances from Beck concerning the \u201ccapability of the system to perform,\u201d i.e., that the system must include \u201call the physical attributes necessary to meet the [pickup] schedule.... \u201d The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Well, in certifying that the changes that had been made would enable Phoenix to comply with the pickup schedule, did you have in mind, one hundred percent compliance or did you have in mind 90 percent compliance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: The point of what we had reviewed, and what we did, was to put, have in place the physical attribute to allow them during the time when both incinerators were down to continue to serve the hospital. In this case, Johns Hopkins. So that with that, additional equipment, storage, at the facility, that allowed them to have the ability to continue to do what they had been doing with respect to pickup. Just keep to the pickup is to take the carts [sic], empty the carts and clean the carts and put it back on the truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">!]! * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">[COUNSEL FOR JHI-I]: The question was, Dr. Kosstrin, in reviewing the backup plan and preparing the certificate], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>you had in mind a one hundred percent on-time rate or 90 percent on-time rate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: We had in mind the ability for Phoenix to continually pick up the material at the hospital. In reality, I don\u2019t think anybody was going to do a hundred percent on-time pickup rate, every day in the year, every pickup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">We did not pick a number whether it is a hundred percent or 90 percent, but obviously should be a number between these two numbers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Okay. Now, did you understand that the transportation system was a critical component of what you were looking at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: And we say the transportation system, did you understand that the trucks, the carts on the trucks, the people operating the trucks, the people telling, dispatching the trucks, that that was a critical component? What were you looking at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: My understanding [of] the contract, a transportation system and the facility to find physical items, define physical items, did not define people[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: So your understanding was, you were looking at the physical embodiment of the transportation system and the facility and not anything having to do with the management?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: The capability of the system to perform, that the physical attribute systems were in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-14\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Let me ask you this question, then Dr. Kosstrin, let me ask you, hypothetically, suppose you had taken a look at this, and had concluded that all the physical attributes necessary to meet the [pickup] schedule one hundred percent of [the] time were in place, but that the dispatchers were taking three hour breaks right smack in the middle of [the] delivery schedule, and other things of that sort, that amounts to poor work practices, as poor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>management were happening, is it your testimony you would have felt comfortable issuing a cert[ificate] in these circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: The part of the stuff that we look at, if you look at the system, we did not look at management and how management was operating the plant. We did look at some data which demonstrated what they had done from December, I believe, 2, through January 15. But no, we did not look at the dispatcher....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">On the hypothetical basis that a dispatcher was continuously not in place, and continuously did not dispatch the truck, I obviously, that hypothetical situation, would not have gone by.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">THE COURT: [Y]ou use the phrase, not have gone by, does that mean you would not have issued a certificate]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADK\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: We would have gotten some kind of assurance from management\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Okay. So isn\u2019t it accurate to say that you did not look simply at physical assets, but you also looked at management?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: We looked at how to operate in the future. We did not look at hypothetical[s] in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZm\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Well, did you begin by attempting to identify the ca[u]se of the problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: Yes, we did. We said what was the root cause of the situation at Phoenix.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: And is it your testimony, that in looking at the root cause, which is in the past, you looked only at physical assets, but in identifying the solution or certifying the solution, you looked at physical assets as management; is that your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: What we did was, we looked at what prevented, or in other words, what had caused the backup <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>at Hopkins, identified that sufficient storage would allow Phoenix to continue to service Hopkins in the event of a duel incinerator outage, and that, yes, then they had to implement that plan. If the plan is not implemented, it doesn\u2019t do any good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Now, did you attempt, Dr. Kosst-rin to identify a single cause or every cause if there was more than one, of what had happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: Well, when we started things, we thought there were two things, as you said, there\u2019s a transportation system, and there is a facility ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">I said the interface between the two is how you handle the carts at the facility. We didn\u2019t directly ask Hopkins, even we [sic] had a meeting with them, are there sufficient carts. That that was one of the things we were concerned about in the beginning which is, was the transportation system____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">With regard to Kosstrin\u2019s analysis of the cause of the Major Back-up in January 2003, the following exchange is also pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Let me ask the question again, Doctor. Did you look to, or did you attempt to determine every cause, if there was more than one of what had happened or just one cause, and you have answered it in the sense that you said you also looked at carts. But now my question is, did you approach this with the goal of identifying as many causes as there were, or did you limit yourself to just one or just two?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: [W]e looked at key aspects that could cause something, on the equipment side, were there enough tractors and trailer[s]. They had a contract with an outside firm to do the transportation, outside firm. There were sufficient carts dedicated to Hopkins. Hopkins said they had sufficient carts, then looked at two incinerators down, said they can\u2019t process, what do you do. You either store on site or you have to have the hospital agree to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>certain kind of desegregation at the hospital. Hopkins did know what to do anything [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">THE COURT: Was there any causes that you didn\u2019t look at. Yes or no, or I don\u2019t know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: We don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">THE COURT: So you think you looked at every cause?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: We think we looked at causes that happened and were relevant to this particular issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">THE COURT: So you looked at every relevant cause?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: We looked at and illuminated many, many things that were not relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">THE COURT: So you looked at every cause relevant or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: No, I didn\u2019t say that. I said\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">THE COURT: Did you look at all the relevant causes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: We believe we looked at relevant causes that cause backups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-14\">THE COURT: All of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-15\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: Physical?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-16\">THE COURT: All of them? All the physical causes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-17\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: That we believe we looked at physical causes, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-18\">THE COURT: All the relevant physical causes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-19\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: What we thought was relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-20\">THE COURT: Actually, I\u2019m asking you, did you look at what you thought all\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-21\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: What we thought were relevant causes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-22\">In his testimony, Kosstrin asserted: \u201c[Although there were late pickups during the six-week period, the late pickup does not appear to cause the backup.\u201d He elaborated: \u201cIn reviewing the data, that demonstrated that Phoenix has the capability because they have done it, that they were picking up most of the pickups on schedule, and that <em>the reason for the major backup, was the inability to </em>store.... \u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>To be sure, Kosstrin recognized \u201cthat there was a number of pickups that were probably missed over a year\u2019s time period....\u201d Nevertheless, he observed that \u201cas long as the material did get picked up and taken away, that was what the real key was the service of the hospital.\u201d As part of the review, Kosstrin \u201cchecked if there were sufficient trailers available, and we went further to figure out ... what allows the carts to get back to the system.\u201d With regard to the sufficiency of trucks and trailers, he recalled: \u201c[W]e asked [Phoenix] where the trucks and trailers come from, they informed us that they have a contract to the outside contractor for excess trucks and trailers, if one breaks down, they could call up and get another one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In addition, Kosstrin stated: \u201c[W]e looked at all the days,\u201d and there were some \u201cfairly large numbers of delays, lateness.\u201d For example, he acknowledged that on December 8, 2003, some pickups were late by \u201cseven hours, eight hours, [and] nine hours,\u201d which were \u201cvery substantially late deliveries----\u201d However, Kosstrin asserted: \u201cSince there was no notice of a major backup from [JHH at that time], we do not look at that as [a] major backup.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">With regard to Phoenix\u2019s transportation records for pickups at JHH between December 12, 2002, and January 15, 2003, Kosstrin averred that the records demonstrated that appellant was \u201cpicking up most of the pickups on schedule____\u201d Although he conceded that, on December 19, 2003, \u201ceight pickups out of ten\u201d were late, he insisted that the records also showed that Phoenix was \u201cable to get on track within a day and a half\u2019 and, \u201ceven if the pickup[s] on the 19, 20 [of December 2003] were late, they did pick up all the carts that Hopkins delivered.\u201d Kosstrin explained: \u201c[I]f you had consistent two or three hour delays ... there would be a buildup of waste between those points, and the key is being able to pick that stuff up and getting [it] out of the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Now, Dr. Kosstrin, you were only looking to prevent late pickups where there was notice or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>were you looking to ensure there was a system in place that would provide reasonable assurance that there would not be a failure to comply with the pickup schedule?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: [Counsel for appellee], a system in place that allows Phoenix to do its job. We do not go into the management part of things in which, to ascertain on the management side whether Phoenix does actually do, will do the pickup in the future. This is equipment review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjP\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: It was an equipment review, so the answer is, no, you were not looking\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">[DR. KOSSTRIN]: The system, the equipment was in place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The following colloquy is also noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: So what you are suggesting then, you have here as [an] assumption, assuming that [Phoenix] actually initiated the backup plan as soon as it can to process waste supplier\u2019s delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">Now the backup plan that Mr. Plank gave to you, called for its implementation if the plant was down ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajg\">[KOSSTRIN]: That was previous\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Yes, and that was in effect from Mr. Plank\u2019s perspective from January 8[, 2003] through 11, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">[KOSSTRIN]: I believe that is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: And it called for implementation if the plant is down for four hours and would not be operational in the next two hours, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-13\">[KOSSTRIN]: That\u2019s what it said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-14\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: So on January 8[, 2003] when the plant was down for 12 hours, this backup plan should have been implemented, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-15\">[KOSSTRIN]: That\u2019s what it said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-16\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: If it had been implemented, then the waste of Hopkins would be put in storage, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A61\">[KOSSTRIN]: Some.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-17\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: That didn\u2019t happen, did it[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>[KOSSTRIN]: Not according to the information that we read.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: [Knowing that even with the backup plan for waste to be put in storage, Phoenix had not put waste in storage that came from Hopkins, did it concern you, Dr. Kosstrin, to assume that Phoenix actually, would actually initiate the backup plan ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgF\">[KOSSTRIN]: <em>We had specific discussions with Phoenix management on this point, and we wrote this in there to emphasize that the backup plan has to be implemented, that has to be implemented quickly, if not, things will just run away </em>and would not be able to, because there is not enough time.... We put it in we had discussions ..., [and] <em>it would be a very strong point on our </em>certificate].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: <em>And you felt that Hopkins should be reasonably assured that not only would Phoenix [not] fail to make the same mistake and allow four days to go by without putting its waste in storage, but Phoenix would actually implement the backup plan and put the waste in storage, lickety-split immediately, </em>is that correct? [KOSSTRIN]: <em>That\u2019s what I put in the certificate], that\u2019s what is required, and we had to discuss [it] with Phoenix management.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">While Kosstrin recognized that the Certificate contained \u201cseveral assumptions\u201d on which Beck\u2019s opinion was predicated, he maintained that there is \u201cpart assumption in most reports that we write when operations of a facility is involved.\u201d According to Kosstrin, the opinion expressed in the Certificate \u201cassume[d] there were some pickups on the 12 th [of January, 2003]\u201d during the dual incinerator outage. He stated: \u201cWell the 12th and 13th, data I have here and stuff that I looked at indicated to me ... that there was a pickup on the 12th ... there were some pickup[s] on the 12th.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Under the revised backup plan, Kosstrin acknowledged that, in the event of a dual incinerator outage, it would take Phoenix longer to unload the carts of waste than it otherwise would. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Kosstrin conceded that the Certificate \u201cdoes not explicitly state anything\u201d about Phoenix having \u201cemployees available to address the need for additional employees to remove the waste from the carts[.]\u201d According to Kosstrin, however, Beck was \u201cinformed by Phoenix ... that they have a temporary service which they can call if they need more manpower.\u201d And, Kosstrin believed that \u201cthe best proof in the pudding is [al test over a period of time, after the changes were made, that show whether they worked or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Prior to trial, JHH moved <em>in limine </em>to bar any evidence of appellant\u2019s post-termination performance. Given the nature of the dispute, i.e., whether JHH was justified in terminating the Agreement based on deficiencies in the Certificate, Hopkins argued that appellant\u2019s <em>\u201csubsequent </em>performance cannot possibly be relevant to the decision that JHH was required to make in February 2003 based on the information available at that time.\u201d In JHH\u2019s view, it \u201cdid not have the option to wait and see whether the backup plan described in the Certificate ... made any difference at all in Phoenix\u2019s performance^]\u201d Rather, relying on \u00b6 13(b)(1)(D), JHH claimed that it \u201chad two options: either terminate the Agreement if the assurances Phoenix provided were not reasonable ..., or accept the Certificate and continue performing under the Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The court granted JHH\u2019s motion. During trial, however, Phoenix moved for reconsideration, claiming the evidence \u201chas relevance to important issues in this case.... \u201d Phoenix argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">In light of Hopkins\u2019 position that the Certificate was not dispositive and the Hospital was entitled to make its own determination as to whether \u201creasonable assurances\u201d had been provided, Maryland Rules 5-401 and 5-402 make clear that the evidence of Phoenix\u2019s performance after it implemented the plan that the Independent Engineer certified, should be admitted. The fact that the plan in fact worked has clear relevance to the disputed question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Counsel for Phoenix proffered the evidence it sought to offer as to its post-termination performance. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>appellant\u2019s counsel stated that it would offer a log of appellant\u2019s pickups which would show that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avj-dedup-0\">since January 16, 2003 (i.e., the date of the Notice of Suspension), the on time percentage has been over 99 percent. I would also proffer that although the plant was experiencing some significant downtime since January 16, [2003,] Hopkins has been unaware of those occasions when they have occurred, and there have also been some backups at Hopkins, during this time period, despite the fact that Phoenix was making all the deliveries on time. All of which indicate that those backups were not caused by Phoenix, and that the plan instituted by Phoenix and certified by R.W. Beck, in fact, worked[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The court remained unpersuaded. Nonetheless, even without such evidence, the court denied JHH\u2019s motion for judgment. Hopkins then called Shealer as its sole witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">With regard to negotiations concerning the Amendment, Shealer noted that there were several factors pertinent to Hopkins\u2019s decision to resume business with Phoenix, but \u201cone primary, the overriding consideration was that [JHH] never find ourselves in the position that we were in prior to the catastrophic collapse, and a subcomponent of that was that we be assured that the operations were viable.\u201d He emphasized: \u201c[I]f they weren\u2019t able to deliver on promise, that then we would be able to exit the relationship without penalty.\u201d In addition, Shealer stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">I think we all recognized that if there were late, or missed pickups, it had the potential to cause major, major problems for Hopkins, and we also recognized that if there were episodic lateness or less severe or fewer number of lateness-es, that still would cause problems for Hopkins, but not of the nature of significant late or missed pickups.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The following testimony is also pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: And was that last component discussed at these meetings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">[SHEALER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: And was there any ambiguity in the way that Hopkins expressed its position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">[SHEALER]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Who expressed that position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARH\">[SHEALER]: All the Hopkins representatives present, but that, and the invincible, the concept of not having to concern ourselves on how was it was happening [sic] at Phoenix, as we just wanted to get the waste out of the hospital was the overriding theme throughout the discussion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Now, did Grotech express [a] position with respect to any of these matters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">[SHEALER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Okay. And let\u2019s start with, since it is the one that is most immediately relevant, the notion that if Phoenix was unable to perform ... at the level that was promised, that Hopkins would be able to get out of the contract. What position \u2014 did Mr. Woltzen express [a] position on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">[SHEALER]: Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: And what was his position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac_\">[SHEALER]: He understood our position, but articulated very clearly the position of Grotech, that although, that Grotech was making an investment, and wanted to be sure that Grotech\u2019s interest was in assuring that Hopkins was not in a position to arbitrarily terminate the contract, unilaterally, arbitrarily terminate the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Okay. Now, did you discuss with \u2014 well, let me ask you this. Have you been involved in the negotiations of agreements during the course of your legal career, in which there were provisions that provide\u2014 that call for the resolution of disagreement by a third party?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aff\">[SHEALER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: And what sort of provision that you personally have been involved in of that sort, involved in negotiations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>[SHEALER]: One of the potentially, one example would be a binding arbitration provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: When you negotiated with [counsel for Grotech], was there any discussion of either \u2014 well, first, was there any discussions of the determination of the reasonableness of assurances being submitted to an arbitrator for binding arbitration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">[SHEALER]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Was there any discussion of any third party having the right to make a binding determination on that issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">[SHEALER]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Would Hopkins, would you have agreed to submit that determination to a third party for a binding determination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">[COUNSEL FOR PHOENIX]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: Did anyone every indicate, during your discussions with [Grotech\u2019s lawyer] or for that matter, your discussions with Mr. Woltzen or anyone else on behalf of Grotech, that the determination of the independent engineer was binding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">[SHEALER]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-13\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: And who had chosen the independent engineer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-14\">[SHEALER]: The independent engineer, I believe initially arose in the context of Grotechfs] evaluation of investment, and I believe Grotech chose the independent engineer at that time for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-15\">[COUNSEL FOR JHH]: And when you say you believe, is there any question in your mind as to whether Hopkins chose the independent engineer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-16\">[SHEALER]: Hopkins did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-17\">We also point to the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR PHOENIX]: You could not, in your view of the Medical Waste Agreement, kick Phoenix out and obtain other medical waste hauling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">[MR. SHEALER]: We did terminate the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">[COUNSEL FOR PHOENIX]: Who was servicing the medical waste at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">[MR. SHEALER]: Phoenix is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">[COUNSEL FOR PHOENIX]: If you wanted to terminate them, why didn\u2019t you send them packing and tell them not to service your waste?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">[MR. SHEALER]: Because we were giving Phoenix the benefit of the doubt and the opportunity to have the exercise that we are going through and have a determination, judicial determination of the termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">[COUNSEL FOR PHOENIX]: So you were just being nice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">[MR. SHEALER]: That\u2019s one element of it, but we were also being prudent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">[COUNSEL FOR PHOENIX]: Well, isn\u2019t it true that you were, in fact, uncertain about whether you had the right to terminate Phoenix?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">[MR. SHEALER]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">The parties filed post-trial memoranda in April 2004. Thereafter, on June 18, 2004, the court issued a thoughtful and well-written forty-two page \u201cMemorandum Opinion,\u201d in which it ruled in favor of Hopkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">The court articulated Phoenix\u2019s position, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-15\">[T]he Court\u2019s analysis should begin and end with the Certificate of the Independent Engineer because, even assuming there was a Major Backup, and that the Notice of Suspension was valid and properly issued, JHH received \u201creasonable assurances in the form of a certificate of the Independent Engineer stating that [Phoenix] has made changes to the Transportation System or the Facility sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>prevent the recurrence of a failure to comply with the agreed upon schedule of pickups.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">It also set forth JHH\u2019s position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">JHH argues that: (1) the Certificate is defective because it was not prepared by a licensed engineer; (2) it is facially defective because it does not give the certification required by the Amendment; (3) the judgment of the Engineer is not binding because the analysis was superficial and exhibited favoritism toward Phoenix; and (4) the Certificate does not provide the objectively reasonable assurances required by the Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">According to the court, Hopkins had the burden to prove that Phoenix breached the Contract and that \u201cit was justified in terminating the [Cjontract for cause.\u201d The court held that JHH proved that \u201c(1) there was a Major Backup on January 15, 2003; (2) Phoenix failed to bring sufficient personnel and equipment to cure the Major Backup within the required three hours; and (3) its rejection of the Independent Engineer\u2019s Certificate was valid because the Certificate failed to provide reasonable assurance that [Phoenix] had made changes sufficient to prevent a recurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">As to the pickups, the court found that Phoenix \u201cadmitted that it failed to make the 4:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m., and 10:45 p.m. pickups on January 14th, thus it has admitted that it failed to make \u2018three Complete Scheduled pick-ups.\u2019 \u201d The court recognized that Phoenix claimed \u201cthat none of those pickups was \u2018missed.\u2019 \u201d Rather, Phoenix maintained that the pickups were not made at the scheduled times, and that its deviation from the schedule did not amount to a Major Backup because it was entitled to make up a missed pickup later during the week. The court regarded as \u201cnot credible\u201d the testimony of Plank and Montgomery, challenging the accuracy of the transportation logs and disputing that Phoenix missed the pickups merely because they were not timely made. Rejecting Phoenix\u2019s attempt to distinguish a late pickup from a complete failure to make a pickup, the court reasoned that, \u201cunder the plain language of the Agreement, a late pickup <em>is the same </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>a failure to make a pickup under the Major Backup provision.\u201d In this regard, it noted that the Agreement used the word \u201cscheduled,\u201d and a late pickup is not made when \u201cscheduled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ApO\">Notably, the court concluded that, \u201cif the Certificate did, on its face, provide reasonable assurance, that would end the suspension.\u201d But, the court was persuaded that \u201c[n]o party has authority to challenge the Independent Engineer\u2019s recommendation or approval\u201d in a facially valid certificate, because the Independent Engineer\u2019s determination is \u201cfinal and conclusive.\u201d The court added: \u201cContrary to JHH\u2019s argument, there is nothing to suggest that JHH may challenge the certificate of reasonable assurance in section 13(b)(1) if, <em>on its face, </em>it provides \u2018reasonable assurance.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In reaching that conclusion, the court rejected JHH\u2019s attempt to distinguish the language in the reasonable assurance clause from that contained in the binding arbitration clause. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">JHH argues that the fact that the parties used explicit language requiring binding arbitration for certain disputes but did not use it in \u00a7 13(b)(1), shows that the Independent Engineer is not a binding arbitrator and JHH has the right to challenge whether the Certificate actually provides reasonable assurances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">[F]or purposes of the certificate of reasonable assurance in section 13(b)(1) [of the Contract], the Independent Engineer is not an arbiter and thus the arbitration cases relied upon by JHH do not apply. Under section 13(b)(1), the Independent Engineer does not resolve a \u201cdispute\u201d between the parties. The parties do not \u201csubmit their differences\u201d to the Independent Engineer for the Independent Engineer to make a \u201cjudgment\u201d as to which side is correct. The Independent Engineer does not determine if the prerequisites for issuing a Notice of Suspension have been satisfied.[ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">In fact, there is no requirement that the parties have any \u201cdifferences.\u201d The parties may be in total agreement on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the prerequisites to the Notice of Suspension, including total agreement on what needs to happen to remedy the problem. Or they may be in disagreement. In either event, the Independent Engineer\u2019s task is not to solve the disagreement. The Independent Engineer simply determines what, if any, changes Phoenix must make. If the Independent Engineer decides changes are necessary, the Independent Engineer also determines whether Phoenix has made those changes. The Independent Engineer then determines whether <em>in its judgment </em>the changes provide \u201creasonable assurances ... to prevent the recurrence of a failure to comply with the agreed upon schedule of pickups.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">(Italics in original; boldface added).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Upon concluding that it had the authority to assess the facial validity of the Certificate, the court found that the Certif\u00edcate was, indeed, facially defective, because it did \u201cnot provide \u2018reasonable assurances ... that [Phoenix] has made changes to the Transportation System or the Facility sufficient to prevent the recurrence of a failure to comply with the agreed upon schedule of pickups.\u2019 \u201d Characterizing the Certificate variously as \u201cmeaningless,\u201d \u201cso vague that it is unclear,\u201d and \u201cnot worth the paper on which it is written,\u201d it determined that Phoenix failed to provide a Certificate that satisfied \u00b6 13(b)(1)(D) of the Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In finding the Certificate facially flawed, the court rejected Phoenix\u2019s contention that the \u201cassumptions\u201d contained in the Certificate were merely standard disclaimers. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">The Certificate does not provide any assurance that changes <em>have been made </em>which will prevent a reoccurrence. This failure is crucial because the point of the Independent Engineer\u2019s certification is to relieve JHH from having to rely on plans that may or may not come to fruition. An examination of the Certificate reveals the defects. The first and most crucial defect is the word <em>\u201cassuming.\u201d </em>Assumption is defined as \u201c[a] statement accepted or supposed true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>without proof or demonstration.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 136 (2d. c.ed. 1982). Thus, the Certificate effectively begins by stating that it accepts or supposes, <em>without proof or demonstration </em>\u201cthat [Phoenix]\u201d will or is taking certain steps. As the Certificate is written it would be impossible for any party to hold R.W. Beck accountable if the assumptions fail to come true because R.W. Beck has certified nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">Second, the suppositions that it [i.e., the Certificate] makes are that some events will take place <em>in the future </em>but there is <em>nothing </em>in the certification that gives <em>any </em>assurance that [Phoenix] will in fact do what is assumed. The statement that the Independent Engineer is <em>\u201cassuming </em>that MWA 1) properly operates and maintains the Facility including the timely implementation of renewals and replacements, [and] 2) actually initiates the back-up plan as soon as it cannot process the Waste Supplier\u2019s deliveries,\u201d is meaningless .... [1 Nor is there <em>any </em>indication that the Independent Engineer has any expectation based on the factors outlined at the beginning of the sentence that the assumptions will come to fruition. It may well be that the <em>assumptions </em>are in fact well-founded, but as assumptions they do not give <em>any </em>reasonable assurance.... [B]ecause assumptions are by definition \u201caccepted or supposed true without proof,\u201d the Independent Engineer undermines the opinion it provides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">Finally, as if to underscore that its opinion is based on unproven supposition, the Independent Engineer opines \u201cthat MWA via its revised backup plan, which <em>includes the procurement </em>of additional dedicated storage for the Waste Supplier at the Facility, has made changes ... sufficient to prevent the recurrence of a failure to comply with the ... schedule of pick-ups.\u201d The phrase \u201cincludes the procurement\u201d is so vague that it is unclear whether the plan is to get additional storage in the future or if additional space has already been procured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>(Emphasis in original).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The court continued: \u201cThe Certificate must stand on its own, and that is what makes the defects so crucial. With the assumptions and vague language, to put it bluntly, the Certificate is not worth the paper on which it is written.\u201d Comparing the Certificate to Beck\u2019s 1996 certification, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">What Phoenix overlooks is that the actual certificate of completion issued in October 1996 did not leave the Independent Engineer any \u2018wiggle room.\u2019 It stated clearly and unequivocally:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">[W]e are of the opinion that Phoenix has substantially completed the material elements of the Capital Improvement Program. Further we certify that those elements of the Capital Improvement Program which have been modified and those elements which have not been completed are not expected to have a material affect [sic] on the operation of the Facility and the delivery of services by Phoenix under the Waste Supply Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">The difference between that language and the language in the Certificate involved in the current controversy highlights the defect in language in the Certificate issued in 2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Conversely, the court rejected JHH\u2019s contention that the Certificate was invalid because Kosstrin is not a licensed professional engineer. The court recognized that, pursuant to Md.Code (2002 RepLVol.) \u00a7\u00a7 14-501 and 14-502 of the Business Occupations &amp; Professions Article (\u201cB.O.P.\u201d), \u201cit is illegal to practice engineering without a licen[s]e.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But, it reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>[A]s a factual matter, contrary to JHH\u2019s argument, R.W. Beck, and not Dr. Kosstrin, was the Independent Engineer. The Certif\u00edcate is on R.W. Beck\u2019s letterhead and is signed R.W. Beck. The first sentence of the Certificate explicitly provides that the engineering firm R.W. Beck is the Independent Engineer: \u201cThis certificate is being provided by R.W. Beck, Inc., in its role as the Independent Engineer (the \u201cIndependent Engineer\u201d) pursuant to Section 13(b)(1)(D) of the First Amendment of the Waste Supply Agreement____\u201d JHH\u2019s letter rejecting the Certificate refer [sic] to it as: \u201cBeck\u2019s certificate;\u201d \u201cBeck\u2019s conclusions;\u201d \u201cBeck\u2019s reasoning];\u201d \u201cBeck\u2019s analysis;\u201d and \u201cBeck\u2019s calculation^].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">Additionally, R.W. Beck played a major role in the decision of JHH to enter into the First Amendment as evidenced by Beck\u2019s letter dated April 20, 1994 which is attached to the First Amendment. That letter, like the Certificate in dispute, is signed \u201cR.W. Beck.\u201dr ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The court also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">[T]he Agreement does not require, and the licensing provisions relied upon by JHH do not require that a licenced [sic] engineer sign the Certificate. It is sufficient that the Certificate was signed \u201cR.W. Beck.\u201d The fact that Dr. Kosstrin did most of the leg work does not make the Certificate invalid and even if Dr. Kosstrin did all the work, the Certificate is provided by R.W. Beck.n If JHH was of the view that R.W. Beck was not qualified as the Independent Engineer, JHH could have said so before it signed the Agreement. Finally, JHH has failed to point to any provision in the Amendment calling for an illegal act, i.e., a violation of a statute or regulation. The agreement contemplates that the Certificate would be provided by an Independent Engineer; it does not require that an unlicenced [sic] engineer practice engineering.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>On July 7, 2004 (docketed July 15, 2004), the court issued a \u201cDeclaratory Judgment\u201d that provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">Phoenix Services Limited Partnership (\u201cPhoenix\u201d) collects and disposes [of] medical waste from Johns Hopkins Hospital (\u201cJHH\u201d) pursuant to a Waste Supply Agreement dated November 15, 1989 and First Amendment dated November 15,1994 (referred to collectively as \u201cthe Agreement\u201d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">On January 15, 2003, there was a Major Backup of waste at JHH because Phoenix failed to make more than three Complete Scheduled Pickups for which Sanctions were applicable. The failed scheduled pickups were the 4:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m., and 10:45 p.m. pickups on January 14th and the 7:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. pickups on January 15th;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">The failure to make those pickups resulted in the backup of substantially more than 50 carts of bagged waste, excluding waste on the floor and waste brought to the dock during the cleanup. The failure to make the pickups was not caused by a force majeure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">Notice of a Major Backup was sent to Phoenix by JHH and received by Phoenix by 3:50 p.m. on January 15, 2003. Because there was an illegally parked truck that blocked access to the JHH dock until 5:20 p.m., Phoenix had until no later than 8:20 p.m. to arrive at JHH with sufficient tractors, trailers, equipment, and personnel to effect the prompt removal of the more than 50 carts of waste. Phoenix did not get sufficient tractors, trailers, equipment, and personnel to JHH by 8:30 p.m.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">JHH gave Phoenix a Notice of Suspension and, within 30 days of receipt of that Notice, Phoenix was required to provide JHH with reasonable assurances in the form of a certificate of the Independent Engineer stating that it had made changes to the Transportation System or the Facility sufficient to prevent the recurrence of a failure to comply with the agreed upon schedule of pickups;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">Phoenix provided a Certificate from the Independent Engineer within the 30 day period but the Certificate does not on its face give the required reasonable assurances;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Therefore, there was \u201can event of Default,\u201d and JHH had the option of terminating the Agreement without penalty.

DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Atx\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">The parties agree that the Contract is unambiguous. However, they vigorously disagree as to its meaning. Their disagreement has spawned numerous contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Phoenix focuses primarily on the court\u2019s ruling pertaining to the Certificate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It urges us to review <em>de novo </em>the court\u2019s decision as to the Certificate\u2019s validity, \u201cbecause it concerns the interpretation of ... a written contract.\u201d Phoenix contends that the \u201cparties were bound by the Independent Engineer\u2019s Certificate\u201d because \u00a7 13(b)(1)(D) is \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d and it \u201cmakes clear that the Independent Engineer\u2019s judgment was to be final and conclusive on the matters the parties delegated to the Independent Engineer for decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">According to Phoenix, the circuit court \u201cerroneously interpreted the provision in question.... \u201d The court, says Phoenix, improperly \u201cassumed to itself the authority to judge whether the Certificate ... provided reasonable assurances, \u2018on its face.\u2019 \u201d In doing so, declares Phoenix, the court \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d the Contract; by its terms, and when \u201c[r]ead as a whole,\u201d it did not authorize the parties or the court to challenge the determination of the Independent Engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Phoenix explains: \u201c \u2018When parties to a valid contract refer any question of performance to the decision of ... a third person, the decision contracted for is final.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted). According to Phoenix, the Amendment \u201cdid not give either party or the court the authority to second-guess the Independent Engineer\u2019s judgment that Phoenix had made \u2018sufficient changes\u2019 to the Transportation System or the Facility.\u201d Nor did the Amendment require an \u201cunconditional\u201d Certificate. Once the Independent Engineer issued a Certificate that purported to provide reasonable assurances, says Phoenix, neither the court nor JHH could challenge either the facial validity of the Certificate or its substance. Therefore, Phoenix claims that the circuit court \u201cerred when it interpreted the contract to say in effect that JHH or the court had the right to reject the Certificate of R.W. Beck on the ground that it found the Certificate, or the assurances, facially insufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Phoenix adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">[T]he contract made clear that the Independent Engineer\u2019s certificate need only \u201cstate\u201d the Independent Engineer\u2019s judgment that Phoenix had made changes the Independent Engineer found sufficient to prevent a recurrence of a failure to comply with the schedule of pickups. Consistent with the principle that when the parties to a contract agree to submit such a question to a certifying engineer or architect, that professional\u2019s honest judgment is binding, absent fraud, the Independent Engineer\u2019s statement to Phoenix and JHH regarding \u201csufficient changes\u201d was, by the parties\u2019 agreement, supposed to resolve the issue, without more____ Phoenix provided the \u201ccertified assurance\u201d called for by the contract and, pursuant to the clear terms of the contract, that should have ended the suspension....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_R\">Although Phoenix maintains that \u00a7 13(b)(1)(D) of the Amendment is clear and unambiguous, it asserts that, in the event this Court finds, upon <em>de novo </em>review, that the clause is ambiguous, parol evidence \u201ccompels the conclusion\u201d that the parties intended the Independent Engineer\u2019s decision to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>final and conclusive. Appellant asserts that \u201cthe extrinsic evidence that Phoenix offered conditionally at trial supports Phoenix\u2019s interpretation and compels the reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision.... \u201d In support of its position, Phoenix asserts: \u201cThe Circuit Court\u2019s interpretation, that it or JHH could reject the Certificate if they found the assurances were not \u2018reasonable\u2019 on their face, is not consistent with the [extrinsic] evidence that the contract was intended to be virtually non-terminable.\u201d To illustrate, it points to Woltzen\u2019s testimony about the importance to Grotech of an \u201ciron clad\u201d deal between Phoenix and JHH, and to the evidence that \u201cestablished that the contract was designed to be difficult to terminate,\u201d because it secured millions of dollars in bonds issued to pay for the construction of the Facility. As Phoenix notes, $24 million in principal was owed on the bonds when the Amendment was negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Further, appellant argues that the court \u201cerred by adding to the contract a new and additional term, namely, the requirement that the Certificate contain no assumptions and be unconditional.\u201d In its view, \u201cthe two \u2018assumptions\u2019 that the trial court said rendered the Certificate from R.W. Beck \u2018worthless\u2019 were in fact common-sense, reasonable, and expected qualifications to an independent and professional opinion,\u201d and were merely \u201cstandard disclaimer[s].\u201d According to Phoenix, \u201can assumption inherent in certifying any plan is that the entity concerned actually implement the plan.\u201d Moreover, Phoenix argues: \u201cThe fact that the certificate also contained forward-looking caveats does not detract from the \u2018certified assurance\u2019 by R.W. Beck that sufficient changes had been made as of the time it rendered the certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In addition, Phoenix observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">The trial court did not cite any caselaw \u2014 from any jurisdiction \u2014 to support the proposition that an independent engineer\u2019s certificate ... may not contain any assumptions, regardless of what the contract says. Nor did it cite any caselaw to support the proposition that such a term might properly be read into a contract____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Appellant also suggests an \u201cindependent reason\u201d that warrants reversal of the circuit court\u2019s ruling in regard to the Certificate: the court based its decision on clearly erroneous findings of fact. For example, appellant complains that the court erred in finding that Beck \u201cdid not indicate \u2018whether the plan is to get additional storage in the future or if additional space has already been procured.\u2019 \u201d Phoenix observes that Exhibit A contained a section entitled \u201cChanges To The Facility,\u201d in which Beck stated that appellant \u201c \u2018has shown the Independent Engineer proof of delivery for 6 trailers with the capacity to store approximately 28 tons of waste.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, Phoenix claims factual error with regard to the court\u2019s attempt to distinguish the 1996 Certificate, concerning the Capital Improvement Program, and the 2003 Certif\u00edcate. Appellant contends: \u201c[B]oth Certificates looked to the future in addition to certifying that Phoenix had, in fact, already taken certain steps to improve its operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Phoenix also contests the court\u2019s exclusion of evidence relating to its post-termination performance. In appellant\u2019s view, such evidence \u201cwas relevant to whether the Independent Engineer\u2019s certified assurance was \u2018reasonable,\u2019 \u201d and to establish that JHH was not justified in terminating the Contract. To the contrary, says Phoenix, such evidence would have shown \u201cthat the plan had been implemented and worked, in practice.\u201d Thus, Phoenix urges us to award \u201ca new trial at which such evidence will be admitted and considered.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">For its part, Hopkins argues that, under the Contract, it was entitled to challenge the adequacy of the Certificate with regard to its form and its substance. In its view, both were defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Hopkins insists that \u201can engineer\u2019s certificate is not binding unless the contract says it is.\u201d It maintains that, in order to relinquish its right to contest the Independent Engineer\u2019s conclusions in the Certificate, \u201cJHH must have agreed to do so voluntarily, in clear and unambiguous language.\u201d In this matter, says Hopkins, there \u201cis no statement \u2014 and certainly not the explicit statement required \u2014 that the Independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Engineer\u2019s determination is \u2018final and conclusive,\u2019 or that he has the authority to resolve all disputes.\u201d Therefore, Hopkins contends that the trial court properly construed the Contract to permit a challenge to the facial validity of the Certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Moreover, JHH argues that the court correctly determined that, in regard to the form of the Certificate, Beck did not satisfy the Amendment. JHH states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">By its own terms . .., the certificate did not assure JHH, as required, that the changes Phoenix had made would <em>prevent the recurrence of a failure to com,ply with the schedule. </em>Rather, it stated that, <em>assuming the specified conditions were met, </em>such changes would prevent future failures. The conditions were simply stated as assumptions \u2014 the certificate offered no support for them \u2014 and Phoenix\u2019s history was strong evidence that there was no support to offer. In short, the certificate did not actually certify any facts, as the Amendment required it to do \u2014 it merely made dubious assumptions that provided no assurances, reasonable or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Hopkins elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">The holding below was that the certificate failed to meet the requirement of form; instead of making the required statement or its substantial equivalent, the certificate began with assumptions that were preconditions to the sufficiency of Phoenix\u2019s changes. These conditions prevented the certificate from satisfying the clearly defined requirements of form, and without more required the court to find that the certificate did not meet Phoenix\u2019s contractual obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Further, JHH posits that the assumptions underlying the Certificate were hardly the equivalent of a \u201cstandard disclaimer.\u201d Indeed, JHH accuses Phoenix of \u201cthe worst kind of sophistry when it argues that the Circuit Court, by requiring that the certificate be unconditional, \u2018added to the contract a new and additional term.\u2019 \u201d According to appellee, the Agreement expressly required that the Certificate provide \u201creasonable assurances\u201d in \u201cthe form of a simple statement, which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>spelled out clearly,\u201d and not conditional assumptions. Appel-lee asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">Ironically, Phoenix\u2019s claim that the Circuit Court added to the contract a requirement that the certificate be unconditional is itself an attempt to rewrite the contract. It was clearly not the parties\u2019 intention that <em>any </em>document with the heading \u201cCertificate\u201d signed by the independent engineer satisfy the contractual requirement____The trial court held only that Phoenix could not rewrite the bargain by conditioning the certificate on Phoenix\u2019s current problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Adopting the circuit court\u2019s reasoning, appellee points out that \u201cthe difference between the 1996 and 2003 certificates is stark: in 1996, Phoenix procured a certificate stating that it \u2018has substantially completed\u2019 its obligations; in 2003, Phoenix procured a certificate <em>\u2018assuming\u2019 </em>that it would.\u201d (Citations omitted; footnote omitted; emphasis in original). Looking to Phoenix\u2019s record of poor performance, JHH also argues: \u201cThe conditions and assumptions in the certificate were necessary because of Phoenix\u2019s long history of financial and operational problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">In this regard, JHH states: \u201cPhoenix had lost millions of dollars, had been in default on its bonds for more than four years.... Its ability to continue in business was in grave doubt, and no responsible engineer could provide any assurance Phoenix would properly maintain the Facility, an essential precondition to on-time performance.\u201d JHH adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ay-dedup-0\">Phoenix\u2019s ability to operate and maintain the Facility properly was called into question by its financial condition, which was so weak that its annual losses consumed its entire net worth and left it with a $3 million partners\u2019 deficit by the end of 2002. Its auditors were unwilling to certify its financial statements from 1997 through trial, and its 2002 draft financial statements questioned its ability to continue as a going concern. Phoenix\u2019s cash flow was so anemic that it had been in default on the bonds that financed the project since 1998. Phoenix was insolvent and existed at the bondholders\u2019 mercy; the day after the certificate was issued, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>bondholders could have accelerated payment of all principal and interest, putting Phoenix out of business. There was reason to question Phoenix\u2019s ability not just to operate and maintain the Facility, but to continue operations at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">JHH insists, however, that its right to challenge the Certificate is not limited merely to the form of the Certificate. It argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">Had the certificate satisfied the requirement of form, however, it would have been subject to evaluation to determine whether the certificate\u2019s assurances were reasonable. Absent contractual language expressly stating that the certificate is \u201cfinal and conclusive,\u201d the parties had the right to challenge the engineer\u2019s conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">JHH reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">The use of the term \u201creasonable assurances\u201d is inconsistent with a construction that gives the engineer\u2019s determination binding effect. If \u201creasonable assurances\u201d has any meaning ... then the mere delivery of a certificate cannot foreclose a judicial determination whether the certificate does in fact provide reasonable assurances. The Amendment\u2019s requirement of <em>\u201creasonable </em>assurances <em>in the form </em>of a certificate of the independent engineer\u201d establishes two standards, one of form and one of substance. A certificate is sufficient in <em>form </em>if it is certified by the Independent Engineer and states that \u201cchanges have been made sufficient to prevent the recurrence of a failure to comply with the agreed upon schedule of pick-ups.\u201d A certificate must also meet a substantive standard, providing <em>reasonable assurances </em>that the changes made will in fact prevent such a recurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">While recognizing that the court\u2019s findings of fact \u201cwere a critical part\u201d of its evaluation of the Certificate, JHH urges this Court to review the court\u2019s rulings under the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. JHH explains: \u201cPhoenix\u2019s appeal does not challenge the Circuit Court\u2019s exclusively <em>legal </em>conclusion that the contractual provision requiring a certificate prepared by an independent engineer is binding upon JHH.\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>in original). Rather, says appellee, Phoenix challenges the court\u2019s <em>\u201capplication </em>of that legal standard to the factual findings it made with respect to this particular certificate.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">According to Hopkins, the \u201cmany factual errors and oversights in the certificate are an alternative basis for finding it insufficient as a matter of law.\u201d In particular, appellee offers \u201cthree alternative grounds\u201d on which it relies to uphold the circuit court\u2019s \u201cdetermination that the independent engineer\u2019s certificate was deficient.\u201d These include: (1) factual inaccuracies and \u201csuperficial analysis\u201d by Beck; (2) lack of finality of the engineer\u2019s determination; and (3) Kosstrin\u2019s unlicensed status.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Appellee asserts that, even \u201cif a contract provides that the engineer\u2019s judgment is \u2018final and conclusive,\u2019 that judgment must nevertheless be rejected if the engineer \u2018arrived at his conclusion under a clear mistake as to material facts.\u2019 \u201d According to JHH, Kosstrin\u2019s \u201cmost glaring error was his conclusion concerning the cause of the Major Backup \u2014 his predicate for certifying the remedy.\u201d Appellee explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">In short, when Kosstrin wrote the certificate attributing the backup to insufficient storage, he believed that on the day both incinerators were out of commission Phoenix not only continued to make pickups from JHH, but made three more pickups than were scheduled and stored 240 carts of waste. Phoenix was well aware that no such pickups occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Claiming that Kosstrin incorrectly focused on the Facility as the cause of the Major Backup, rather than the Transportation System, JHH asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">Kosstrin\u2019s most glaring error was his conclusion concerning the cause of the Major Backup \u2014 his predicate for certifying the remedy. He found that the backup was caused by the failure of one incinerator while the other was already out of service for maintenance on January 11. The dual failure, he concluded, led to \u201cthe saturation of storage at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Facility\u201d <em>2% </em>days later, on January 14, as a result of which \u201cMWA miss[ed] some pickups.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">Consistent with the certif\u00edcate, Kosstrin initially testified at trial that pick-ups were not delayed until January 14, 2|/\u00bf days after the January 11 dual incinerator failure, and the sole cause of the delayed pickups and resulting backup was the \u201csaturation of storage.\u201d And, Kosstrin testified, Phoenix made five pickups from JHH on January 12, the waste from which he assumed was stored because, with neither incinerator working, there was nothing else to do with it. Based on those \u201cfacts,\u201d he concluded in the certificate that Phoenix\u2019s purchase of additional trailers to store JHH\u2019s waste during dual outages would prevent future non-compliance with the delivery schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">But these facts were simply wrong. In fact, Phoenix\u2019s transportation logs establish what is not in dispute: Phoenix made <em>none </em>of the pickups from JHH scheduled for January 12, and it did not make the January 13 pickups until January 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Further, JHH argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">Had Kosstrin recognized that Phoenix failed to make pickups for two days when all of Phoenix\u2019s storage was available, he could not possibly have attributed the Major Backup to insufficient storage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">As a result of this mistake, the certificate proposed nothing more than a backup plan that added storage trailers dedicated to JHH. But any reasonable person would know, on the facts presented below, that storage was simply not the problem; the backup began in December of 2002 and plainly existed when Phoenix had all 43 tons of its storage available. Thus, the backup plan outlined in the certificate <em>would not even have prevented the Major Backup; </em>it did nothing to assure <em>future schedule compliance, </em>as the Amendment required. The certificate therefore found adequate a remedy \u2014 the addition of storage dedicated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>JHH \u2014 that addressed <em>only </em>problems arising from storage shortages, which were not the cause of the backup.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">(Italics in original; boldface added).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In support of its position, JHH vigorously complains in its brief, as it did at trial, that Kosstrin \u201cnever looked at Phoenix\u2019s contemporaneous transportation logs, misread summaries of the logs, and mistakenly believed that following the dual incinerator outage at midnight on January 11, Phoenix made six pickups at JHH on January 12, one on January 13, and stored the waste it picked up.\u201d To the contrary, asserts JHH, \u201cPhoenix made <em>no </em>pickups from JHH on either date.\u201d According to Hopkins, Kosstrin also erroneously concluded that the effect of the incinerator outage on waste pickups was delayed until January 14, 2003, even though the effect \u201cwas immediate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Therefore, JHH maintains that the Certificate was flawed because of its \u201c[science concerning the Transportation System.\u201d In its view, Kosstrin \u201cgenerated a certificate that placed a rubber stamp on Phoenix\u2019s proposed solution.\u201d Hopkins contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">[T]he Transportation System was plainly intended to be at the heart of the independent engineer\u2019s work. But the certificate offered no analysis of or reference to the Transportation System and proposed no changes to it. Thus, the certificate addressed an issue that was <em>not </em>the cause of the missed pickups \u2014 storage\u2014but failed to address what clearly <em>was </em>one of the causes of the backup: Phoenix\u2019s innumerable late and missed pickups when the incinerators were functioning properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">At trial, the independent engineer all but admitted that he simply accepted what Phoenix told him concerning the Transportation System rather than forming an independent judgment. He conceded that the certificate addressed only late deliveries caused by the physical failure to get waste out of carts so the carts could be returned to JHH when the incinerators were not processing waste \u2014 not late deliveries that occurred when the incinerators were functioning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>JHH also maintains that the Certif\u00edcate was a \u201cnullity\u201d because Kosstrin is \u201can unlicensed engineer in violation of Maryland law.\u201d In its view, the court erroneously determined that JHH waived this contention by failing to include a provision in the Amendment that required a licensed engineer to sign the Certificate. JHH notes the lack of authority \u201csuggesting that a statutorily imposed requirement that protects the public can be subject to waiver or estoppel.\u201d Indeed, JHH argues: \u201cIf licensing provisions have any meaning, the Court cannot accept as satisfaction of a contractual requirement a document the preparation of which was a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Moreover, JHH contends that \u201c \u2018subsisting laws enter into and form part of a contract as if expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted). And, appel-lee argues that \u201cKosstrin is not merely an unlicensed agent acting on behalf of a licensed principal.\u201d Says Hopkins, <em>\u201cNeither </em>Kosstrin nor Beck is licensed according to Maryland law; neither could legally have signed the certif\u00edcate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Further, Hopkins disputes appellant\u2019s complaint that the court erred when it barred evidence related to Phoenix\u2019s post-termination performance. JHH asserts: \u201c[T]he quality of Phoenix\u2019s performance after this dispute arose is irrelevant not only because it came after JHH was required to decide whether to terminate, but also because Phoenix was on notice of the need for exemplary performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In its reply brief, Phoenix posits: \u201cNo magic words are required to make an engineer\u2019s determination final and conclusive.\u201d Moreover, it argues: \u201cNone of the cases Hopkins cites hold that it is only when a contract contains the words \u2018final and conclusive\u2019 that the determination of an engineer or architect on the matters reserved to it bind the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Appellant also asserts that, \u201cunder Maryland law, the standard is not, as Hopkins claims, that the certificate may be rejected if the engineer made mistakes of fact, or even \u2018material facts.\u2019 \u201d Phoenix reiterates that \u201cnothing short of a determination that the engineer committed \u2018a mistake so gross as to imply bad faith or the failure to exercise honest judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ment\u2019 will justify rejection of the certificate.\u201d Phoenix explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">If the Independent Engineer\u2019s decision was not intended to be conclusive, then there was no point in having the certificate provision in the contract; instead, the parties would simply be required to go to court each time there was a dispute \u2014 an interpretation that does not make sense____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">Hopkins\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of the certificate provision of the contract is absurd: Hopkins is suggesting that an engineer would, at great expense, do a substantive analysis and put its reputation on the line by rendering an opinion, and then the parties could completely ignore the engineer\u2019s finding and make their own decision as to whether in their lay opinion the certificate\u2019s assurances were reasonable.[ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">Further, if it had been the parties\u2019 intention, as JHH claims, that they could debate the certificate, the contract could have (and undoubtedly would have) so stated, <em>e.g., </em>\u201cthe engineer shall render a certificate which will resolve the dispute unless either of the parties disputes the reasonableness of the assurances, in which case the matter shall be brought to arbitration, or to court, as the case may be.\u201d Instead, the contract provides that only a failure to provide the <em>\u201ccertified assurance\u201d </em>of the Independent Engineer within the time specified in the contract would constitute an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d after a suspension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Appellant adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">R.W. Beck was supposed to render a certificate that set forth its opinion, and it did so. That constituted the reasonable assurance under the contract. The certificate may not be rejected because the changes certified were to the Facility, rather than the Transportation System. Accordingly, even if this Court reaches this issue, it should reject Hopkins\u2019 argument because Hopkins failed to demonstrate that the Independent Engineer committed \u201ca mistake so gross as to imply bad faith or a failure to exercise honest judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ment,\u201d which is what Maryland law requires to reject an engineer\u2019s certificate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">According to Phoenix, Beck\u2019s \u201cdecision\u201d is the \u201cequivalent of the award of an arbitrator and like such an award is final and conclusive on both parties.... \u201d Looking to the Contract \u201cas a whole,\u201d Phoenix claims it establishes that \u201cthe Independent Engineer was to exercise the role of final arbitrator in such matters as whether the appropriate changes had been made to the waste disposal system and facility to have Hopkins come back to the Regional System.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Phoenix also challenges JHH\u2019s assertions as to omissions in the Certif\u00edcate concerning the Transportation System. Noting that JHH \u201cdid not offer any expert testimony to contradict Dr. Kosstrin\u2019s opinion or to impeach his methods,\u201d Phoenix claims that JHH\u2019s \u201cassertion that the Independent Engineer had to address the Transportation System misstates the clear terms of the contract, which called for a statement that changes had been made to the Transportation System <em>or </em>the Facility.\u201d Phoenix states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">[JHH\u2019s] argument tortures the plain language of the parties\u2019 contract, as well as the evidence. The contract says something very different from Hopkins\u2019 rendition: it states that the Independent Engineer was to certify that changes had been made \u201cto the Transportation System or the Facility sufficient to prevent a recurrence of a failure to comply with the agreed upon schedule\u201d of waste pickups, (emphasis added). The contract did not require that any changes to the Transportation System had to be made, or certified. Moreover, Phoenix points out that the circuit court \u201c \u2018did not</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9Z\">reach\u2019 \u201d the issue of whether the Certif\u00edcate was based on factual error. And, it reminds us that an appellate court has no \u201cpower\u201d to \u201cmake original findings of fact....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Phoenix also rejects the contention that the Certif\u00edcate is invalid because Kosstrin is not a licensed engineer. It argues: \u201cThe contract did not require that the Independent Engineer, or anyone working on the matter, hold a Maryland License.\u201d Moreover, appellant suggests that \u201c[a]ny complaints that Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Kosstrin allegedly violated a Maryland statute should be addressed to the appropriate authority \u2014 the State Board for Professional Engineers____\u201d Regarding the licensure of Beck, Phoenix maintains that such contentions \u201care not properly before this Court,\u201d because appellant did not raise the issue before the circuit court. Alternatively, appellant urges that B.O.P. \u00a7 14-301 <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cstates only that certain \u2018individuals\u2019 must hold a license issued by the State Board\u201d; it does not require that engineering firms hold a Maryland license.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The circuit court concluded that it was entitled to determine whether the Certificate, on its face, provided the requisite \u201creasonable assurances\u201d contemplated by the Contract. But, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>if the form itself satisfied the Contract, the court was of the view that it had no authority to assess the adequacy of the content of the Certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">As noted, appellant contends that the \u201ctrial court erred when it interpreted the contract to say in effect that JHH or the court had the right to reject the Certificate of R.W. Beck on the ground that it found the Certificate, or the assurances, facially insufficient.\u201d In its view, the Amendment \u201cmade final and conclusive the Independent Engineer\u2019s determination of whether Phoenix had made \u2018sufficient changes\u2019 within the meaning of Section 13(b)(1)(D) of the First Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In analyzing this contention, we begin with a review of the well honed principles of contract construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\"> \u201cThe interpretation of a contract, including the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law, subject to <em>de novo </em>review\u201d by an appellate court. <em>Sy-Lene of Washington, Inc. v.

Phoenix asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>In fact, the very first page of the First Amendment is replete with references to the Independent Engineer\u2019s role in certifying that the system had been improved sufficiently to justify JHH\u2019s re-joining the Regional System after the 1994 Phoenix bankruptcy reorganization. Indeed, the First Amendment was not to become effective until the Transportation System had satisfied a performance test and the JHH Capital Improvement Program was completed; and it was the Independent Engineer who was to certify that those events had occurred....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">The contract also establishes that the parties had agreed that the Independent Engineer was to decide any disputes ... regarding the Base Weight of each cart used to transport waste between the hospital and Phoenix. Likewise, the Independent Engineer was to be the arbiter of what changes, if any, could be made to the Capital Improvement Program----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">In addition, the parties agreed that only costs for improvements recommended or approved by the Independent Engineer could be paid from the Transportation Fund. They agreed that the Independent Engineer was to be the arbiter to certify whether the design of a cart was reasonable. Furthermore, the parties agreed that it was the Independent Engineer who was to decide what constituted a \u201creasonable reserve\u201d of equipment, under the Transportation Addendum to the First Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In <em>United States v. Moorman, </em>338 U.S. 457, 462, 70 S.Ct. 288, 94 L.Ed. 256 (1950), the Supreme Court recognized that \u201cthe intention of parties to submit their contractual disputes to final determination outside the courts should be made manifest by plain language.\u201d Yet, the Supreme Court added: \u201c[Tjhis does not mean that hostility to such provisions can justify blindness to a plain intent of parties to adopt this method for settlement of their disputes. Nor should such an agreement of parties be frustrated by judicial \u2018interpretation\u2019 of contracts.\u201d <em>Id. Cf. Questar Homes of the Avalon, LLC v. Pillar Construction, Inc., </em>388 Md. 675, 686-87, 882 A.2d 288 (2005) (acknowledging that \u201cparties have the option to waive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>their right to arbitration,\u201d but waiver \u201c \u2018must be clearly established and will not be inferred from equivocal acts or language\u2019\u201d); <em>Moore v. Jacobsen, </em>373 Md. 185, 817 A.2d 212 (2003) (concluding that, because alimony ordinarily terminates upon remarriage as a matter of statutory law, an agreement to continue alimony after remarriage must be clear and unequivocal in order to be enforceable); <em>Gold Coast Mall, Inc. v. Larmar Corp., </em>298 Md. 96, 103, 107-108, 468 A.2d 91 (1983) (recognizing that \u201c[arbitration is a matter of contract\u201d and a \u201cparty cannot be required to submit any dispute to arbitration that it has not agreed to submit\u201d; when parties disagree as to scope of arbitration provision, \u201cquestion of substantive arbitra-bility should be left to the decision of the arbitrator\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The question here is whether the Contract delegated final and binding authority to the Independent Engineer in regard to the Certificate. Noticeably absent from the text of the clause is any language suggesting that the Certificate is \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d or otherwise binding and not subject to challenge of any sort by the parties. In weighing the omission of such language, we are mindful that, ordinarily, parties to a contract are entitled to turn to the courts to resolve disputes arising from a contract. <em>See Zimmerman v. Marymor, </em>290 Pa. 299, 138 A. 824, 825 (1927) (\u201cAs the effect of the architect\u2019s certificate is to deprive a party of trial by jury, it must be construed strictly.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">As we see it, in order for a contract to foreclose or waive the important right of a party to challenge or litigate the conclusions of a third party, the parties to the contract must clearly and expressly agree that the third party\u2019s determination is final, binding, and conclusive. Put another way, they must use unequivocal language that unmistakably evidences the parties\u2019 intent, because \u201cthe contract must leave no doubt that this was intended.\u201d 14 Williston \u00a7 42.24 at 531 (citing <em>United Constr. Co. v. Haverhill, </em>22 F.2d 256 (2nd Cir.1927)). <em>See also Subsurfco., Inc. v. B-Y Water Dist., </em>337 N.W.2d 448, 453 (S.D.1983) (\u201c[T]o make such a certificate or decision conclusive requires plain language in the contract. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>is not to be implied\u201d). If, as Phoenix suggests, the Amendment conferred final, exclusive, and binding authority upon the Independent Engineer, the Contract should have so stated, using clear, express, and unequivocal language. It did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In reaching our conclusion, we are guided by the spirit of <em>Moore v. Jacobsen, </em>373 Md. at 190, 817 A.2d 212, despite its factual differences. There, the parties entered into a voluntary separation agreement which, among other things, provided for the payment of alimony to the wife for a term of seven years. The alimony clause provided that it was \u201cnon-modifiable....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 817 A.2d 212. It also stated \u201cthat no court shall have the power to modify this agreement with respect to alimony, support or maintenance of either spouse except as provided herein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A few months after the parties were divorced, the wife remarried, prompting the husband to cease payment of alimony. Claiming that she was entitled to the continuation of alimony for seven years, despite remarriage, the wife sought a judgment against the husband for the unpaid alimony. <em>Id. </em>at 187-88, 817 A.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">On appeal, the Court considered \u201cwhether the provision in the parties\u2019 separation agreement obligating the husband to pay alimony to the wife terminated upon the wife\u2019s remarriage, despite the fact that the agreement provided that alimony was \u2018non-modifiable\u2019 by a court and payable for a term of seven years ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 817 A.2d 212. Employing the principles of contract and statutory interpretation, it concluded that the provision in the agreement precluding <em>modification </em>of alimony by the court was insufficient to preclude <em>tennination </em>of alimony <em>upon remarriage. </em>Of import here, the Court held \u201cthat, unless an agreement states explicitly that alimony survives a party\u2019s remarriage, alimony terminates on the marriage of the recipient spouse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Undergirding the Court\u2019s holding was the statutory provision expressly mandating that alimony terminates upon remarriage, \u201c[u'jnless the parties agree otherwise.\u201d <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7 11-108(2). In the Court\u2019s view, the \u201cstatutory presumption\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>of termination controlled because the parties\u2019 agreement was not sufficiently explicit to permit the continuation of alimony upon remarriage, in light of the statutory provision. <em>Id. </em>at 190, 817 A.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The Court was mindful that, \u201c[ujnder Maryland law, alimony has historically terminated on the remarriage of the recipient spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Yet, it also recognized the important right of parties to contract freely. As a matter of \u201cpublic policy,\u201d said the Court, F.L. \u00a7 11-108 embodies both principles, by providing that alimony terminates upon remarriage, <em>unless the parties agree otherwise. Id. </em>Because of the absence of clear and precise language in the agreement, the Court concluded that the provisions as to continued alimony must give way to the statutory provision requiring its termination upon remarriage. The Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 190-91, 817 A.2d 212:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">The public policy set forth in \u00a7 11-108 clearly states that alimony does not survive the remarriage of the recipient. <em>To create an exception to that policy, an agreement must be equally clear. We think a bright-line rule requiring an express provision providing that support shall not terminate upon remarriage fosters certainty, resolves ambiguity and reduces litigation. </em>\u201cTo permit [the statute\u2019s] mandate to be overcome by implication would introduce ambiguity, encourage litigation and, thereby, undermine the statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>Radford v. Radford, </em>16 Va.App. 812, 433 S.E.2d 35, 36 (Va.Ct.App.1993).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\"><em>If the parties had intended that alimony would continue after remarriage, they should have, and could have, included an express requirement in the agreement. </em>They included an express requirement in the agreement as to the termination of child support. <em>See supra </em>note 2. We do not construe the language contained in 8.0 of the agreement before us to evidence an intent of the parties that petitioner was required to continue to pay alimony to respondent for seven years, even if she remarries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The Maryland cases involving third-party engineering and architectural determinations similarly suggest that clarity is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>key in any contract purporting to remove a case from the judicial process by rendering binding and conclusive the decision of a third party. In marked contrast to the case <em>sub judice, </em>for example, in <em>J.A. La Porte, supra, </em>13 F.Supp. at 797, the contract stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\">To prevent disputes and litigation, the Chief Engineer shall in all cases determine the amount, quality and acceptability of work and materials which are to be paid for under the contract; shall determine all questions in relation to said work and materials and the performance thereof, and shall in all cases decide every question which may arise relative to the fulfillment and the construction of the terms and provisions of the contract. <em>His determination, decision and, estimate shall be final and conclusive in respect to the fulfillment thereof....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The importance of clear and unequivocal contractual language is also illustrated by the case of <em>Laurel Race Course, Inc., supra, </em>274 Md. 142, 333 A.2d 319. There, the contract provided that the engineer would issue a final certificate when he found the work acceptable under the contract, and the balance owed to the contractor would then be paid. Moreover, the contract provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">\u201cThe Engineer shall have general inspection and direction of the work as the authorized representative of the Own-er____ He shall also have authority to reject work and materials which do not conform to the plans, specifications and contract documents.... He shall decide all engineering questions which arise in the execution of the work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">\n<em>\u201cThe Engineer shall also interpret the meaning and requirements of the plans, specifications and, contract documents, and decide all disputes that arise. The Engineer\u2019s decisions on these matters shall, be final and binding on both the Contractor and the Owner unless both parties agree to submit the dispute to arbitration or either party resorts to legal action for settlement.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 151-52 n. 3, 333 A.2d 319 (original emphasis omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The contractor argued that the engineer\u2019s certif\u00edcate was a condition precedent to payment only if the parties did not resort to legal action. Conversely, the contractors maintained that, in the event of litigation, the factfinder could determine whether the contract had been satisfied; the absence of an engineer\u2019s certificate, said the contractor, did \u201cnot bar recovery by the contractor .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152, 333 A.2d 319. The <em>Laurel </em>Court analyzed the contractual language to determine the import of the engineer\u2019s rejection of the contractor\u2019s work and subsequent refusal to provide a certificate that was a precondition to payment. The Court recognized the \u201cdurability\u201d of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">the general rule, followed uniformly by decisions of this Court, that where payments under a contract are due only when the certificate of an architect or engineer is issued, production of the certificate becomes a condition precedent to liability of the owner for materials and labor in the absence of fraud or bad faith.... Apart from fraud or bad faith, the only other exceptions to this rule are waiver or estoppel....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 150, 333 A.2d 319 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">However, the Court disagreed with the contractor\u2019s construction of the contract. It concluded that the contract clause (italicized above) did not support the contractor\u2019s position, because it \u201ccompletely ignore[d]\u201d the first paragraph and the parties\u2019 \u201cmanifest intention,\u201d gleaned from \u201cthe clear and unambiguous language\u201d of the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 333 A.2d 319. The Court explained, <em>id. </em>(emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">In accordance with this paragraph, <em>decisions of the engineer on questions pertaining to performance and execution of the work are controlling and unqualified. </em>Paragraph 2, however, is confined to disputes arising out of the engineer\u2019s role as an interpreter of the technical provisions contained in the various documents. The words \u2018these matters,\u2019 to which the \u2018legal action\u2019 exception applies, pertain solely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>such disputes. In this limited respect only are the engineer\u2019s decisions, though otherwise final, subject to the \u2018legal action\u2019 exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Thus, the Court concluded, <em>id. </em>at 154, 383 A.2d 319 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">As we see it, ... the supremacy of the engineer\u2019s certificate on all matters pertaining to conformance and execution survived the resort to \u2018legal action,\u2019 and should not have been ignored, absent a finding of bad faith, fraud, waiver or estoppel. No such finding was made here!] <em>Hence, production of the engineer\u2019s certificate was a condition precedent to the liability of Laurel under count I of the declaration. It is fundamental that </em>where a contractual duty is subject to a condition precedent, whether express or implied, there is no duty of performance and there can be no breach by nonperformance until the condition precedent is either performed or excused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\"><em>Allied Contractors, </em>supra, 236 Md. 534, 204 A.2d 546, is also helpful. There, the contract declared, <em>id. </em>at 538, 204 A.2d 546: \u201cTo prevent disputes and litigations, the Director will be the referee in case any question shall arise ... and his determination, decision, and/or estimate shall be final and conclusive upon the Contractor....\u201d Construing the contract, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 545, 204 A.2d 546:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">It is established that when the parties have provided for a binding determination of disputed matters by a designated person, such as an architect or engineer, even though that person is an official or representative of one of the parties, his decision is the equivalent of the award of an arbitrator and like such an award is final and conclusive on both parties in the absence of fraud or mistake so gross as to imply bad faith or the failure to exercise honest judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Because of the binding determination of the third party, the Court rejected the City\u2019s claim that \u201cit should have been allowed\u201d to establish a mistake. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 204 A.2d 546. It said: \u201cA mistake which will vitiate or invalidate an award must be gross and manifest to the point of showing bad faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>or failure to exercise honest judgment.\u201d <em>Id. See also, e.g., Charles Burton Builders, Inc., </em>260 Md. at 71, 271 A.2d 534 (contract provided, \u201cThe Engineer shall in all cases determine the amount, quality and acceptability of the work to be paid for under the contract, and shall decide all questions in relation to said work. <em>His decision and estimate shall be final and conclusive </em>....\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Hughes v. Model Stoker Co., </em>124 Md. 283, 92 A. 845 (1914) (contract stated, \u201cTo prevent disputes and litigations, the inspector of buildings shall in all cases determine all questions in relation to said work ____ His estimates and decision <em>shall be final and </em>conclusive\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Even if we were to consider the parol evidence adduced at trial, it does not compel the adoption of Phoenix\u2019s position. The extrinsic evidence showed that Phoenix had a long history of poor performance and JHH had reasonable and legitimate concerns about resuming business with Phoenix in 1994, when the Amendment was executed. To be sure, it is equally clear that Grotech considered JHH as vital to the success of Phoenix, and wanted to assure its participation before investing millions of its own dollars. Yet, the parties and Grotech had able counsel; the Amendment could have been crafted to include \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d language, consistent with the position Phoenix advances here, if that was, indeed, the intent of all parties. Yet, there is no such phraseology.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">In our analysis, for purposes of comparison, we cannot ignore the text of the arbitration clause in the Agreement. <em>Cf. Moore, </em>373 Md. at 191, 817 A.2d 212 (contrasting the imprecise alimony clause with an express agreement as to termination of child support). In the arbitration clause, the parties expressly provided that it was <em>binding </em>under certain circumstances. Any attempt to characterize the final authority of the Independent Engineer as tantamount to the binding authority of the arbitrator rings hollow. Indeed, the discrepancy in the language of the two clauses strengthens our view that the parties could have made the Independent Engineer\u2019s decision final and conclusive if that was the intent. Instead, their failure to so state leads us to conclude that the determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>nation of the Independent Engineer was subject to challenge through the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We conclude that production of the Certificate is an important step in the process outlined in the Contract, but the parties did not agree that mere production of the Certificate would preclude a challenge to its facial or substantive adequacy, or otherwise deny access to the courts. Although there are valid contracts in which a third party is clothed with authority to render a final and binding decision, this is not one of them. Because the Contract contains no express provision rendering the Independent Engineer\u2019s determination \u201cbinding\u201d or \u201cfinal and conclusive,\u201d the court below was entitled to determine whether the form of the Certificate complied with the Contract. And, if necessary, the court was also entitled to resolve Hopkins\u2019s substantive claim that the Certificate did not provide the requisite \u201creasonable assurances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">We turn to consider whether the court correctly concluded that the form of the Certificate was facially defective. In our view, the trial court erred in finding the Certificate facially defective on the ground that it contained two \u201cassumptions\u201d (i.e., that Phoenix \u201cproperly operates and maintains the Facility\u201d and \u201cactually initiates the back-up plan as soon as it cannot process [JHH\u2019s] deliveries\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">As we see it, Beck merely included in the Certificate language that is inherently implicit in such assurances, i.e., that the contractor or service provider will properly maintain its facility and equipment, and that it will actually implement and initiate the appropriate plan, when needed. The Independent Engineer was not retained as a guarantor to assure that Phoenix would maintain its equipment or deploy it when needed. Beck\u2019s assumptions that Phoenix would properly operate and maintain the Facility, and timely execute the contingency plan, reflect factors over which the Independent Engineer had no control. That Beck stated the obvious did not transform its representation into worthless paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Notably, in December 1994, when Beck was asked to identify what needed to be included in the Capital Improvement Program, it expressed similar caveats in a letter to Grotech and Phoenix:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">We intend to issue our certificate as described in the [First] Amendment only when, in our professional judgment, the Facility and the Transportation System will be sufficiently reliable.... Such a certificate -will be based on the assumption that MWA properly operates and maintains the Facility including timely implementation of renewals and replacements, and does not encounter unforeseen circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We recognize that there may be instances in which the nature or character of an assumption renders a certificate deficient. But, we agree with Phoenix that the two assumptions in issue were tantamount to \u201ccommon-sense, reasonable, and expected qualifications to an independent and professional opinion.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court erred in concluding that, because of the two assumptions, the Certificate was facially deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Because we disagree with the circuit court that the form of the Certificate was flawed, the question remains as to whether the Certificate was substantively adequate. As we have shown, Phoenix presented considerable evidence that the problem that led to the Major Backup was rooted in its Facility (i.e., the storage system). Conversely, JHH vigorously argued that the problem was caused by the Transportation System, which Beck never addressed. The court below did not have to resolve this contention, because it determined that the form of the Certificate was facially defective. And, it was of the view that the substance of the Certificate was not subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">As previously outlined, \u00b6 13(b)(1)(D) of the Amendment expressly stated that the Independent Engineer must provide \u201creasonable assurances\u201d that Phoenix made sufficient changes either to the <em>\u201cTransportation System or the Facility </em>sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>to prevent the recurrence of a failure to comply with the agreed upon schedule of pickups.\u201d That requirement cannot be considered in a vacuum. Put another way, the use of the word \u201cor\u201d does not mean that the Independent Engineer was entitled arbitrarily to choose which system to analyze \u2014 Facility versus Transportation \u2014 in order to satisfy the Contract, without regard to which particular system was the cause of the Major Backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The plain reading of the Contract (as well as the extrinsic evidence) makes clear that the parties intended the Certificate to assure JHH of resolution of the particular cause or causes of a Major Backup. The intent behind the Certificate requirement would be thwarted if a Certificate were deemed sufficient to satisfy the requirement of \u00b6 13(b)(1)(D) based on reasonable assurances as to a system that did not cause the problem that necessitated the need for the Certificate in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Certainly, the Contract was not meant to give the Independent Engineer the unbridled option to provide reasonable assurances as to the Facility <em>or </em>the Transportation System, without regard to which system precipitated the underlying problem. If the engineer addressed issues as to the Facility, for example, but the cause of the backup was rooted in the Transportation System, then a Certificate addressing matters as to the Facility would not serve the purpose contemplated by the parties. Common sense and logic suggest that the Contract necessarily required the engineer to first identify whether the cause of the underlying problem was due to the Facility or the Transportation System, or both. Therefore, we conclude that Phoenix was obligated to furnish a Certificate providing reasonable assurances that Phoenix made necessary changes to whatever system was, in fact, the cause of the Major Backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Kosstrin testified that, at the time he conducted his investigation, he believed the Major Backup was caused by \u201cinsufficient storage ... to handle th[e] waste that was coming in at that time[.]\u201d He conceded, however, that, during Beck\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>investigation, Plank informed him that, at the time the Notice of Suspension was issued on January 16, 2003, Phoenix still had space for nine tons of waste, which \u201cwould have taken [care of] a large chunk\u201d of the Major Backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Claiming that the Certificate addressed issues that were not the cause of the backup, JHH argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">An equally obvious deficiency in the certificate, and in Kosstrin\u2019s analysis, was its silence concerning the Transportation System. The Amendment requires that the certificate address \u201cchanges to the Transportation System or the Facility\u201d and certify future compliance with the pickup schedule; the Transportation System was plainly intended to be at the heart of the independent engineer\u2019s work. But the certificate offered no analysis of or reference to the Transportation System and proposed no changes to it. Thus, the certificate addressed an issue that was <em>not </em>the cause of the missed pickups \u2014 storage\u2014but failed to address what clearly <em>was </em>one of the causes of the backup: Phoenix\u2019s innumerable late and missed pickups when the incinerators were functioning properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">It is impossible to provide [reasonable] assurances without so much as mentioning the Transportation System, particularly when pickups are late week after week. But Kosstrin prepared a certificate that purported to do so, based on two false premises: the Major Backup was caused by the saturation of Phoenix\u2019s storage, and Phoenix\u2019s Transportation System functioned near perfection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Clearly, the Certificate did not address the Transportation System. And, as noted, the trial court did not make any findings as to the cause of the Major Backup or the sufficiency of the Transportation System, because it resolved the matter on a different ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">As an appellate court, it is not our province to make such factual determinations. <em>See, e.g., Hartley v. State, </em>238 Md. 165, 168, 208 A.2d 72 (1965) (\u201c[0]ur powers are limited to appellate review and we cannot invade the province of the <em>nisi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>prims </em>courts by making an original factual finding.\u201d); <em>see also Montgomery Co. v. Maryland Soft Drink Ass\u2019n., </em>281 Md. 116, 122, 377 A.2d 486 (1977) (\u201cWe cannot, of course, make a factual finding\u201d). Therefore, we shall vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings. In doing so, we express no opinion as to the cause of the Major Backup or the substantive sufficiency of the Certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">For the benefit of the parties on remand, we shall briefly consider JHH\u2019s challenge to the validity of the Certificate based on the fact that Kosstrin is not licensed as a professional engineer. We agree with appellant and the circuit court that this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The court below found that Beck, not Kosstrin, was the Independent Engineer. That finding was amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">As the trial court noted, the certificate is on R.W. Beck\u2019s letterhead and is signed by R.W. Beck. Moreover, the first sentence of the Certificate states that the engineering firm R.W. Beck is the Independent Engineer. And, the Contract refers to the Independent Engineer as R.W. Beck.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Furthermore, as the trial court said, the \u201ctermination\u201d letter of February 25, 2003, indicates that JHH regarded the Certificate as one provided by R.W. Beck, not Dr. Kosstrin individually. In that letter, JHH refers to \u201cBeck\u2019s certificate\u201d; \u201cBeck\u2019s conclusions,\u201d \u201cBeck\u2019s reasoning]\u201d; \u201cBeck\u2019s analysis\u201d; and \u201cBeck\u2019s calculation[s].\u201d Thus, it is readily apparent that JHH clearly understood that the Certificate was provided by R.W. Beck, the Independent Engineer identified in the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">In addition, Kosstrin testified that the content of the Certificate was reviewed by Rush, an experienced licensed engineer. And, appellee agreed to have Beck furnish the Certificate. Therefore, its challenge on this basis is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>As to the licensure of Beck, the issue was not raised below. Therefore, it is not preserved. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Finally, we briefly consider appellant\u2019s evidentiary challenge to the court\u2019s refusal to admit evidence concerning Phoenix\u2019s post-termination performance. In its written opinion, the court explained: \u201cThe Court granted JHH\u2019s Motion in Limine excluding evidence of how Phoenix picked up JHH\u2019s trash after the Notice of Termination was issued, because the determination of whether the Certificate provides reasonable assurance, must be made on the face of the Certif\u00edcate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">We agree with JHH and the circuit court that evidence as to post-termination performance was not relevant. It follows that the court did not err or abuse its discretion in barring its admission. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The admissibility of evidence is generally vested in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See Mason v. Lynch, </em>388 Md. 37, 48-50, 878 A.2d 588 (2005); <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 176, 729 A.2d 910, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 910, 120 S.Ct. 258, 145 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999); <em>Hopkins v. State, </em>352 Md. 146, 158, 721 A.2d 231 (1998); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 5-104(a) (\u201cPreliminary questions concerning ... the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court\u201d). As a general rule, in order for evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant to the issues in the case and tend either to establish or disprove them. <em>Snyder v. State, </em>361 Md. 580, 591, 762 A.2d 125 (2000); <em>Conyers, </em>354 Md. at 176, 729 A.2d 910; <em>Rosenberg v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 221, 252, 741 A.2d 533 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 Md. 382, 749 A.2d 173 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Maryland Rule 5-401 provides that evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Trial courts \u201cretain wide latitude in determining what evidence is material and relevant.\u201d <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>346 Md. 391, 413, 697 A.2d 432 (1997). Thus, \u201c[a] trial judge\u2019s determination on relevance will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>342 Md. 724, 737, 679 A.2d 1106 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds, Wengert v. State, </em>364 Md. 76, 771 A.2d 389 (2001); <em>see Mason v. Lynch, </em>388 Md. at 48-50, 878 A.2d 588; <em>Ebb v. State, </em>341 Md. 578, 587, 671 A.2d 974, <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 832, 117 S.Ct. 102, 136 L.Ed.2d 56 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Here, the issues concerned the entitlement of JHH to terminate the Contract based on its claim that, at the time it was issued, the Certificate was flawed. Appellant\u2019s post-termination performance was not relevant in determining whether the Certif\u00edcate provided the requisite reasonable assurances, or in deciding whether JHH acted lawfully in terminating the Contract. We adopt the reasoning advanced by JHH in the court below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">[T]he termination decision was required to be made, and was made, based on the sufficiency of the assurances at the time they were given.... Just as JHH (had it determined that the Certificate provided reasonable assurances) could not look at actual performance a year later, find it deficient, and retroactively terminate on the ground that the assurances turned out not to have been reasonable, Phoenix cannot now judge the assurances based on its performance during the year that followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">JUDGMENT VACATED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID 50% BY APPELLANT, 50% BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-13\">. We shall present our factual summary chronologically. It is derived from the voluminous testimonial and documentary evidence presented at trial and from the outstanding briefs submitted by counsel for both sides.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-14\">. The Agreement and the Amendment were executed by JHH and Medical Waste Associates Limited Partnership (\"MWA\u201d), the predecessor to Phoenix. Unless we are quoting from a document that provides otherwise, we shall use \"Phoenix\" to refer to Phoenix; its predecessor, MWA; and its successor, Curtis Bay Energy Limited Partnership.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">. The parties characterize the waste disposal system as \u201cunique\" because participating hospitals are not required to segregate regulated medical waste from general waste. In effect, all waste is handled as regulated medical waste with regard to the numerous federal and State regulations governing disposal and transportation of medical waste. During periods when the Facility\u2019s equipment was inoperative, however, other waste disposal facilities could handle hospital waste only if the regulated medical waste was segregated from general waste.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">. Hopkins claimed its \u201cwaste stream never exceeded the GAT for which it paid,\u201d but it paid for alternative waste service because of Phoenix's poor performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">. Phoenix concedes in its brief that \u201cJHH acted lawfully and appropriately in suspending its participation in 1994, before [its] bankruptcy reorganization and before Phoenix and JHH negotiated the First Amendment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\">. The spelling of Grotech appears in two different ways on its letterhead: Grotech and GroTech. As most of the exhibits refer to Grotech, we shall do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\">. At the time of the Amendment, JHH provided approximately 25% of the total waste supply and cash flow coming into the Regional System from the Founding Hospitals. As the circuit court recognized, \"if Phoenix does not collect medical waste from JHH, [Phoenix] will collapse and the other participating hospitals ... would have to find an alternative waste disposal system.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\">. Beck is also referred to as R.W. Beck, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\">. During the suspension period, Phoenix was still required to remove JHH\u2019s waste, pursuant to \u00b6 13(b)(2) of the Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b363-13\">. According to Phoenix, as of early 2003, JHH anticipated that it would cost more than $5 million to cancel the Contract without cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b367-13\">. At trial, and in its brief, JHH recounts the many problems it allegedly experienced as a result of appellant's poor performance. We need not recount all of the evidence, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\">. At trial, Michael Plank, Phoenix\u2019s President, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">The ash from the incinerator, as it goes through the [incineration] process, the very back end of it, goes down into a small pit that's part of the incinerator and it's cooled by water.

And that piece, we call it a water jacket, and there was a rupture in that steal [sic]____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\">We had to stop processing for a while because we had to turn the cooler loop off while we tried to patch that steal [sic],</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b368-12\">. In its brief, Phoenix characterizes the event as a \"catastrophic failure\u201d of its second incinerator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b368-13\">. Even when the repairs were completed, the incinerators were not immediately operational. As Plank explained, the incinerators must reach 1700 degrees before they can accept any waste, and it \"takes some time to go from zero to 17 hundred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\">. The Notice was also hand-delivered on January 15, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\">. In its brief, JHH states that Phoenix provided (he Certificate to JHH on February 24, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\">. As we discuss, <em>infra, </em>JHII moved <em>in Limine </em>to exclude, on relevancy grounds, \u201call evidence relating to Phoenix\u2019s performance subsequent to JHH\u2019s termination of the Waste Supply Agreement on February 25, 2003.\u201d The court granted that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\">. Beck was not offered as an expert witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b396-10\">. In contrast, the court made clear that it did not regard the \"force majeure\" assumption in the Certificate as problematic. It explained: \"[Tjhis assumption is simply a recognition of the uncertainty of life, similar to the assumption that most people made that when they go to bed at night, that they will wake up the next morning. By definition, a force majeure event is an event unlikely to occur.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b396-11\">.

In the circuit court, appellant challenged JHH's termination of the Agreement on numerous grounds. On appeal, appellant states that it focuses \u201cexclusively on the provision stating that the contract could riot be terminated for cause unless Phoenix failed to present a certificate of the Independent Engineer that conformed to the contract's requirements.\u2019\u2019 Nevertheless, Phoenix \u201cmaintains its position that there occurred neither a Major Back-up nor the contractual preconditions for a valid suspension ....\u201d, although \u201cit is not pursuing those issues on appealf.j\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\">.
