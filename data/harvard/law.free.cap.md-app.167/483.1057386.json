Art., \u00a7 _\u201d). On appeal, appellant raises two important issues for our consideration. First, appellant asks us to find that the traffic stop was unlawful, because the police officer did not have probable cause to believe that appellant made an unsafe lane change in violation of Trans. Art., \u00a7 21 \u2014 309(b). Second, appellant requests that we decide, for the first time in Maryland, that the administration of field sobriety tests by a police officer during a valid traffic stop constitutes a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and consequently, the officer must have probable cause that the driver is under the influence of alcohol before conducting such tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>For the reasons set forth herein, we hold that: (1) under the facts of this case, the police officer had probable cause to believe that appellant made an unsafe lane change in violation of Trans. Art., \u00a7 21-309(b); and (2) the administration of field sobriety tests by a police officer constitutes a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, but applying <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), the constitutionally mandated prerequisite for conducting such tests is reasonable articulable suspicion, not probable cause, that the driver is under the influence of alcohol. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\n<em>SUPPRESSION HEARING FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the vehicle stop and the evidence flowing from that stop came before the circuit court on January 18, 2005. The State called one witness: Trooper Harris of the Maryland State Police. Appellant testified on his own behalf, and called Karen Mitchell, his friend and a passenger in his vehicle during the stop at issue. Because the trial court found Trooper Harris \u201cto be a very credible witness\u201d and \u201caccepted] his version of what he observe[d],\u201d we will set forth only those facts of the events in question that appear in the testimony of Trooper Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">On the night of March 17, 2004, Trooper Harris was assigned to traffic enforcement in Harford County. At approximately 11:30 p.m., while on secondary patrol in the vicinity of northbound Route 24 at Wheel Road in Bel Air, he observed a medium colored Acura traveling northbound in lane two on Route 24.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Trooper Harris, in his marked patrol car, was in lane one, a short distance behind the Acura.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was \u201cmedium traffic\u201d on the road at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>While following the Acura, Trooper Harris observed two things: (1) the vehicle was unable to drive within its lane, and (2) the vehicle\u2019s speed fluctuated about eight to ten miles an hour above and below the posted speed limit of 55 m.p.h. Trooper Harris described the vehicle\u2019s movements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">[The Acura was] failing to drive within a single lane. In the slow lane there would be a solid white l[i]ne that would be separating the shoulder and the right lane, and a dotted line would be separating the lane that I was in and the Defendant\u2019s lane. I noticed the vehicle would travel over the right shoulder. When I say travel over the right shoulder, the whole vehicle wasn\u2019t on the shoulder, two wheels were over the solid line. The vehicle would come back across the lane that I was traveling in and two wheels would go over the dotted line. At no time was the vehicle completely over the white line or completely over the dotted line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Trooper Harris observed the Acura leave its lane twice: once over the solid white line separating lane two from the shoulder, and then back the other direction, across the dotted line, and into the lane occupied by Trooper Harris. He noted that \u201c[a]lmost half\u2019 of the vehicle swerved over the solid white line and on to the shoulder of Route 24. These movements were in conjunction with the vehicle speeding up to 65 m.p.h., and then dowm to 45 m.p.h. The vehicle\u2019s movements and variations in speed occurred over approximately one quarter of a mile, on a straight and level section of Route 24.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Trooper Harris was not aware of any external factor, thing, or other car that might have caused the Acura to leave its lane. Trooper Harris noted, \u201cI never lost sight of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AN5\">Based on his observations, Trooper Harris activated his emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop of the Acura. Upon approaching the Acura, Trooper Harris advised appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>lant, the driver, as to why he was stopped, at which time Trooper Harris detected the odor of alcohol within the vehicle. Trooper Harris asked the driver for his license and registration. He identified the driver as appellant, Michael James Blasi.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Noting that appellant had a passenger in the vehicle, Trooper Harris sought to determine whether the driver or the passenger had been drinking. He asked appellant to get out of the car and step to the rear of the vehicle. As Trooper Harris stood an arm\u2019s length away from appellant, he \u201cdetect[ed] a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from [appellant\u2019s] breath and person.\u201d Trooper Harris observed that appellant\u2019s \u201ceyes were bloodshot and glassy,\u201d and that his speech was \u201cabsolutely slurred.\u201d Trooper Harris asked appellant if he \u201chad anything to drink,\u201d to which appellant replied, \u201cjust a few.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Trooper Harris then asked appellant to submit to a battery of field sobriety tests; appellant responded, \u201cno problem.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Trooper Harris administered three standardized field sobriety tests: (1) the horizontal gaze nystagmus (\u201cHGN\u201d), (2) the walk-and-turn, and (8) the one-leg-stand. Prior to commencing the tests, Trooper Harris inquired of appellant as to whether he had any mental or physical impairments that would prohibit him from doing the field sobriety tests; appellant replied in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The field sobriety tests were conducted on the side of Route 24, between appellant\u2019s vehicle and the police car. The surface was flat, level, and clear of debris. On the basis of the HGN test, which measures the involuntary jerking of the eye, Trooper Harris concluded that appellant had alcohol in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>system. On the remaining tests, the walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand, appellant was unable to maintain his balance or walk heel to toe without stepping off the line. At the conclusion of the tests, Trooper Harris placed appellant under arrest. At no time did appellant object to performing the field sobriety tests, and at all times appellant was polite and cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In arguing the motion to suppress, appellant raised two issues: (1) that the initial stop of appellant was unlawful, and (2) that the field sobriety tests were unlawful because appellant was coerced into performing them, and further that the tests require probable cause because they constitute a \u201csearch in the person\u2019s mind and cognitive abilities.\u201d The State countered that the stop was proper based upon Trooper Harris\u2019s observations of appellant\u2019s vehicle as it traveled northbound on Route 24, and that \u201cfield sobriety tests are not a search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">After hearing the testimony and both parties\u2019 arguments, the court stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">In any event, I found the officer to be very credible and I so accept his version of what he observes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">In a quarter to a half a mile the trooper sees the Defendant\u2019s car go one half of the way over the shoulder line and back over to the left one half of the way over into another travel lane occupied by the officer\u2019s vehicle. This is quite different from the <em>Rowe </em>case, and all of this is on Route 24[,] which is a major highway. This is coupled with speeding up to sixty-five and dropping down to forty-five. All of this gives reasonable articulable suspicion to make the stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">Upon stopping the vehicle and encountering the driver[,] he smells alcohol. Quite frankly, in fairness to the occupant driver he asks him to go to the rear so as to isolate the Defendant to make sure that the odor is coming from him and is not coming from another source inside of the car; i.e., the second individual. He goes to the back of the car and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>is coming or emanating from him, and the Defendant even acknowledges that he has had a few.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">Now, the trooper asks him to do some field tests and the Defendant consents. The Court finds absolutely no coercion, no promises, no threats, no subtle threats. The Defendant due to his upbringing feels that he has no choice. The officer did nothing to coerce, et cetera. There is nothing coercive about him requesting him to come to the back of the car, nothing about the questions asked or about taking the tests, and the Court will deny the motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The case immediately went to trial before the circuit court, sitting without a jury. The State proceeded on only one charge, driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of Trans. Art., \u00a7 21-902(a)(l). Appellant entered a plea of not guilty, with consent to submission on an agreed statement of facts. Based on that statement, the court found appellant guilty and sentenced him to thirty days incarceration, a partially suspended fine, and three years of supervised probation. Thereafter, appellant noted a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\n<em>STATEMENT OF ISSUES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Appellant presents one issue with eight sub-parts for our review, which we have re-phrased as follows:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">I. Whether the trial court erred by determining that the police officer had probable cause of a traffic violation that justified a traffic stop of the motor vehicle operated by appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">II. Whether the administration of field sobriety tests by a police officer during a valid traffic stop constitutes a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>III. If the administration of field sobriety tests constitutes a \u201csearch,\u201d whether the Fourth Amendment requires that the police officer have probable cause to believe that appellant was driving under the influence of alcohol <em>prior </em>to the administration of the tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">IY. Whether appellant preserved for appellate review his contention that the administration of field sobriety tests during a valid traffic stop constitutes a custodial interrogation within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we rely solely on the record developed at the suppression hearing. <em>State v. Green, </em>375 Md. 595, 607, 826 A.2d 486 (2003); <em>Alston v. State, </em>159 Md.App. 253, 261, 858 A.2d 1100 (2004), <em>cert. granted, </em>390 Md. 500, 889 A.2d 418 (2006). \u201c[W]e view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion,\u201d and accept factual findings made by the motion court that are not clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439 (2003). Although we extend great deference to the motion court\u2019s findings of fact, such as determinations of witness credibility and the weight of the evidence, we make our own independent constitutional appraisal of the law as it applies to the facts of the case. <em>Alston, </em>159 Md.App. at 261-62, 858 A.2d 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"afx-dedup-0\">\n<em>The Traffic Stop</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable government searches and seizures. <em>See United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). A traffic stop involving a motorist is a detention that implicates the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985); <em>Green, </em>375 Md. at 609, 826 A.2d 486; <em>Rowe v. State, </em>363 Md. 424, 432, 769 A.2d 879 (2001); <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 369, 735 A.2d 491 (1999); <em>Edwards v. State, </em>143 Md.App. 155, 164, 792 A.2d 1197 (2002). Such a stop does not initially violate the U.S. Constitution if a police officer has probable cause to believe that the driver has committed a traffic violation, <em>see Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), or where an officer has reasonable articulable suspicion that \u201ccriminal activity may be afoot.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">While \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d is a less demanding standard than probable cause and requires a showing considerably less than preponderance of the evidence, the Fourth Amendment requires at least a minimum level of objective justification for making the stop. The officer must be able to articulate more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch\u2019 \u201d of criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\"><em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123-24, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\"> Appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because Trooper Harris did not have probable cause to believe that appellant had violated any traffic law. The State counters that Trooper Harris made a lawful traffic stop after observing appellant move out of his lane on two separate occasions and drive at erratic speeds over a short distance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>In support of his position that the traffic stop was unlawful, appellant places great emphasis on the opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Rowe, </em>363 Md. 424, 769 A.2d 879. The relevant facts of <em>Rowe </em>are as follows. A Maryland State Trooper observed a van being driven in the slow lane of Interstate 95 at 1:00 a.m. <em>Id. </em>at 427-28, 769 A.2d 879. The trooper followed the van for 1.2 miles. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 769 A.2d 879. Within that distance, he observed the van cross the white edge line on the right shoulder approximately eight inches and touch the rumble strips and then immediately return to the slow lane. <em>Id. </em>at 427-28, 769 A.2d 879. When the officer observed the vehicle touch the white edge line a second time, he initiated a traffic stop for \u201cthe benefit of the driver\u201d because \u201clate in the evening ... people fall[ ] asleep at the wheel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428, 769 A.2d 879. The officer acknowledged that late night drivers \u201ccould have possibly been intoxicated\u201d when not driving within a single lane. <em>Id. </em>The officer determined that Rowe was not intoxicated, but upon discovering that Rowe was driving a rental vehicle issued to another driver, and that the rental contract had expired, the officer asked to search the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 429, 769 A.2d 879. Rowe consented, and the ensuing search of luggage in the vehicle revealed 34,000 grams of marijuana (seventy-seven pounds). <em>Id. </em>Rowe was charged with possession of marijuana, possession with intent to distribute marijuana, and driving a rented vehicle in violation of the rental agreement. <em>Id. </em>He was also issued a warning for failure to drive within a single lane under Trans. Art., \u00a7 21-309(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 430, 769 A.2d 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The Court of Appeals reversed this Court\u2019s affirmance of the trial court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence derived from the traffic stop. The <em>Rowe </em>Court acknowledged that the purpose of section 21-309(b) is to promote safety on laned highways, but held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">We conclude that the petitioner\u2019s momentary crossing of the edge line of the roadway and the later touching of that line did not amount to an unsafe lane change or unsafe entry onto the roadway, conduct prohibited by \u00a7 21-309, and thus, cannot support the traffic stop in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 441, 769 A.2d 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">In the instant case, appellant analogizes his situation with that of the petitioner in <em>Rowe. </em>Appellant contends that his acts of crossing onto the shoulder of the road, back over and across the line dividing the northbound lanes, coupled with speed changes from 10 m.p.h. over to 10 m.p.h. under the speed limit, were not sufficient to justify a traffic stop. Rather, he asserts that \u201cswerving, jerking movements, or straying more consistently and for longer periods over lane lines, is necessary for there to be a \u2018violation\u2019 that would justify a police stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In response, the State argues that the case <em>sub judice </em>is distinguishable from <em>Rowe </em>and points to two more recent opinions issued by this Court, <em>Edwards, </em>143 Md.App. 155, 792 A.2d 1197, and <em>Dowdy v. State, </em>144 Md.App. 325, 798 A.2d 1 (2002). First, in <em>Ed,wards, </em>this Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccrossing [of] the center line of an undivided, two lane road by as much as a foot, on at least one occasion, provided a legally sufficient basis to justify the traffic stop.\u201d 143 Md.App. at 171, 792 A.2d 1197. We distinguished <em>Rowe, </em>\u201cwhich involved a brief crossing of an edge line separating the slow lane from a shoulder area,\u201d because of \u201cthe danger associated with veering into an opposing lane of traffic, even briefly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Second, in <em>Dowdy, </em>a Maryland State Trooper observed a vehicle being driven in the slow lane of two westbound lanes of Route 140 at 11:54 p.m. 144 Md.App. at 326-27, 798 A.2d 1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>As the trooper followed the vehicle he observed that \u201cit was drifting continuously from side to side,\u201d and on two occasions the vehicle moved from the right lane across the broken lane markings. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 798 A.2d 1. Specifically, the trooper observed the left tires of the vehicle cross over the broken lane markings into lane number one for approximately one tenth of a mile, and then one half of a mile later, he observed one quarter of the vehicle cross the same lane markings and travel another tenth of a mile. <em>Id. </em>These movements of the vehicle occurred over a distance of one and one half miles. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We distinguished the facts in <em>Dowdy </em>from those in <em>Rowe. </em>We said that in <em>Rowe </em>there was no lane change, unsafe or otherwise, because the driver only moved eight inches beyond the right edge line of the roadway, returned to the paved road, and later touched the same edge line. <em>See id. </em>at 330, 798 A.2d 1. By contrast, the vehicle in <em>Dowdy </em>\u201ccrossed over from the slow lane into the passing lane and remained there for one-tenth of a mile twice,\u201d creating a <em>\u201cpotential danger to anyone who may have been proceeding lawfully in the passing lane.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Moreover, the vehicle\u2019s \u201cswaying back and forth \u2018continuously from side to side\u2019 for the entire mile and a half ... was far more egregious than that presented in <em>Rowe.\u201d Id. </em>We concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that the \u201ctotality of the circumstances [established] that appellant was in violation of \u00a7 21-309(b), which established probable cause for the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331, 798 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We agree with the State that the instant case is factually distinguishable from <em>Rowe, </em>and more analogous to <em>Dowdy. </em>Like <em>Dowdy, </em>appellant\u2019s vehicle crossed from the slow lane into the passing lane, with two wheels over the broken line, thereby creating a \u201cpotential danger to anyone who may have been proceeding lawfully in the passing lane.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 798 A.2d 1. It is true that appellant\u2019s vehicle crossed over the broken line only once, as opposed to twice in <em>Dowdy, </em>and apparently did not travel as far on the road while over the broken line, as in <em>Dowdy. </em>However, appellant\u2019s driving in this case was much more erratic than the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>dant\u2019s driving in <em>Dowdy. </em>In <em>Dowdy, </em>other than crossing the broken line twice, the defendant\u2019s vehicle drifted continuously from side to side <em>within the lane </em>for a mile and one half. <em>See id. </em>at 327, 798 A.2d 1. Here, in the span of only one quarter of a mile, appellant went on to the right shoulder of the road, with one half of his vehicle over the solid white line, came back to the left, and crossed over the broken line between lanes one and two, all while speeding up to 65 m.p.h. and then down to 45 m.p.h. These movements occurred on a straight, level road, without any obstructions or other external factors, and would have taken only about sixteen seconds if the vehicle averaged 55 m.p.h.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In sum, appellant made a lane change when part of his vehicle crossed from the slow lane into the passing lane, and his erratic driving immediately preceding such movement made that lane change unsafe. Under the totality of the circumstances in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we conclude that Trooper Harris made a lawful traffic stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle, because he had probable cause to believe that appellant was operating that vehicle in violation of Trans. Art., \u00a7 21-309(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\n<em>Are Field Sobriety Tests A \u201cSearch\u201d?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Appellant contends that field sobriety tests conducted by a police officer during a valid traffic stop constitute a \u201csearch\u201d within the scope of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable governmental searches and seizures. The State counters by arguing that field sobriety tests do not constitute a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Instead, according to the State, field sobriety tests may be administered by a police officer as a part of an investigatory stop based upon a reasonable articulable suspicion that the driver was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The Fourth Amendment provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. The Supreme Court, however, \u201chas never managed to set out a comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>definition of the word \u2018searches\u2019 as it is used in the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 2.1(a) (4th ed.2004). Initially, the Supreme Court limited the protection of the Fourth Amendment to physical intrusions by police into a \u201cconstitutionally protected area,\u201d <em>to wit, </em>persons, houses, papers, and effects. <em>See id. </em>at 430-31, 798 A.2d 1; <em>Goldman v.

United States, </em>265 U.S. 57, 44 S.Ct. 445, 68 L.Ed. 898 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In the seminal case of <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), the Supreme Court reviewed the admission into evidence at trial of the defendant\u2019s telephone conversations from a telephone booth that had been overheard and recorded by F.B.I. agents using an electronic device attached to the exterior of the booth. <em>See id. </em>at 348, 88 S.Ct. 507. The Government argued that the agents\u2019 actions did not constitute a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, because a public telephone booth was not a \u201cconstitutionally protected area\u201d and there was no physical penetration of the telephone booth. <em>See id. </em>at 351-53, 88 S.Ct. 507. Writing for the Court, Justice Stewart rejected the Government\u2019s contention by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">For the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, <em>is not </em>a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 351, 88 S.Ct. 507 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The Court concluded that the \u201cGovernment\u2019s activities in electronically listening to and recording the petitioner\u2019s words violated <em>the privacy upon lohich he justifiably relied </em>while using the telephone booth and this constituted a \u2018search and seizure\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 88 S.Ct. 507 (emphasis added). Based on a concurring opinion by Justice Harlan, the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Katz </em>has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>been stated as \u201cwhenever an individual may harbor a reasonable \u2018expectation of privacy,\u2019 he is entitled to be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (citation omitted). The Court of Appeals of Maryland has articulated the <em>Katz </em>principle by stating that \u201cLt]he scope of the protection afforded by the Fourth Amendment is defined in terms of the individual\u2019s \u2018legitimate expectation of privacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stanberry v. State, </em>343 Md. 720, 731, 684 A.2d 823 (1996); <em>see Sproates v. State, </em>58 Md.App. 547, 563, 473 A.2d 1289 (1984) (describing the principle as a \u201clegitimate or reasonable\u201d expectation of privacy).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">When the teachings of <em>Katz </em>and its progeny are applied to field sobriety tests, we must determine whether the State has intruded into an area where an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy. The area implicated by field sobriety tests has been described as \u201cpersonal characteristics\u201d or \u201cphysical characteristics\u201d of an individual. <em>See </em>La Fave, at \u00a7 2.6(a); <em>United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 14, 93 S.Ct. 764, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973); <em>United States v. Mara, </em>410 U.S. 19, 21, 93 S.Ct. 774, 35 L.Ed.2d 99 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The Supreme Court has held that the physical characteristics of a voice exemplar are not within the ambit of a reasonable expectation of privacy because \u201ca person\u2019s voice, its tone and manner, as opposed to the content of a specific conversation, are constantly exposed to the public.\u201d <em>Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. at 14, 93 S.Ct. 764; <em>see also Miles v. State, </em>365 Md. 488, 513, 781 A.2d 787 (2001). Similarly, the furnishing of a handwriting exemplar is not within the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection because \u201c[hjandwriting, like speech, is repeatedly shown to the public.\u201d Mara, 410 U.S. <em>at 21, </em>93 S.Ct. 774; <em>see also Burns v. State, </em>813 So.2d 668, 681 (Miss.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">On the other hand, the Supreme Court has held that the obtaining of certain physical characteristics does constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>a search under the Fourth Amendment, including taking a blood sample, <em>see Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966); collecting breath and urine samples, <em>Skinner v.

Carlson, </em>677 P.2d 310, 316 (Colo.1984). For example, an officer\u2019s observation of the driver\u2019s gait upon exiting the vehicle and walking to the rear of the vehicle \u201cis no different than the viewing of his general physical characteristics, such as height, weight or build.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, the court held that an individual has a constitutionally protected privacy interest in the \u201ccoordinative characteristics\u201d exposed by the administration of field sobriety tests. <em>Id. </em>at 317. Therefore, field sobriety tests constitute \u201ca full \u2018search\u2019 in the constitutional sense of that term.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In <em>State v. Purdie, </em>209 Mont. 352, 680 P.2d 576, 578 (1984), the Montana Supreme Court initially held that the administration of field sobriety tests constitutes a mere observation of an individual\u2019s physical behavior, \u201cwhich hardly amounts to an intrusion into his reasonable expectation of privacy,\u201d and therefore, does not constitute a search under the Montana or federal constitutions. The Court explained that, like voice and handwriting samples, an individual lacks any reasonable expectation of privacy in his physical behavior. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Fourteen years later, however, the Montana Supreme Court had the occasion to revisit <em>Purdie </em>and expressly overruled its holding that field sobriety tests do not constitute a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Montana Constitution. <em>See Hulse v. State, </em>289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75, 85 (1998). The Court cited with approval the two reasons advanced by the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>State v. Nagel, </em>320 Or. 24, 880 P.2d 451 (1994), for concluding that field sobriety tests \u201cran counter to an individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy[:]\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">First, an individual must perform certain maneuvers not normally performed in public, and, thus, the tests expose to view certain things not otherwise obvious through passive observation of an individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">Unlike the quality of one\u2019s voice or one\u2019s handwriting, people do not regularly display that type of behavior to the public \u2014 there is no reason to believe that motorists regularly stand alongside a public road reciting the alphabet, count backward from 107, stand upon one leg while counting from 1001 to 1030, or walk a line, forward and back, counting steps and touching heel to toe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">Second, an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information an officer obtains from the field sobriety tests. The court explained that like the chemical analysis of urine, \u201ca field sobriety test may reveal evidence of equally private facts about an individual, including whether the individual is illiterate, has [A]lzheimer\u2019s disease, or suffers from multiple sclerosis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\"><em>Hulse, </em>961 P.2d at 84 (quoting <em>Nagel, </em>880 P.2d at 457-58).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The Montana Supreme Court concluded, as did the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>Nagel, </em>that \u201cfield sobriety tests create a situation in which police officers may observe certain aspects of an individual\u2019s physical and psychological condition which would not otherwise be observable,\u201d and potentially reveal certain information concerning that individual\u2019s physical or psychological condition. <em>Hulse, </em>961 P.2d at 85. Thus the administration of these tests intrude into an area for which an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy. <em>See id. </em>The Montana Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>[F]ield sobriety tests are not \u201cmerely observations\u201d of a person\u2019s physical behavior, but, rather, constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution ... because an individual\u2019s constitutionally protected privacy interests are implicated in both the process of conducting the field sobriety tests and in the information disclosed by the tests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State contends that \u201cfield sobriety tests differ in no meaningful way from the myriad of other observations made in the course of a routine DUI stop ... except that the former are administered in a standardized manner.\u201d The Fourth Amendment, according to the State, does not prohibit a police officer from making \u201cnon-standardized\u201d observations <em>(e.g., </em>observing a driver\u2019s gait, speech, ability to follow instructions, <em>etc.), </em>and to differentiate between these permitted observations and field sobriety tests would be an \u201carbitrary distinction\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The State overlooks the rationale underlying the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection of an individual\u2019s personal or physical characteristics. The Fourth Amendment provides no protection for \u201c[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public,\u201d <em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, which includes physical characteristics that are constantly exposed to the public, <em>see Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. at 14, 93 S.Ct. 764. Thus an individual\u2019s physical characteristics or behaviors, such as speech, height, weight, gait, appearance, or smell, observed by a police officer during a valid traffic stop, do not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Hulse, </em>961 P.2d at 85; <em>Carlson, </em>677 P.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">On the other hand, as appellant properly notes in his brief, the field sobriety tests</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">are not, by any means, the sort of normal physical activity that one displays to the public. One just does not see an individual standing at a streetcorner [sic], sitting on a park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>bench, or riding in an elevator, while touching an index finder to the nose, attempting to balance while walking in a straight line in a heel to toe fashion with arms at the sides, or reciting the alphabet backwards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Moreover, the field sobriety tests may reveal private facts about an individual\u2019s physical or psychological condition. <em>See Nagel, </em>880 P.2d at 457-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">We agree with the Montana Supreme Court in <em>Ilulse, </em>and the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>Nagel, </em>that the administration of field sobriety tests by a police officer during a valid traffic stop intrude into an area of an individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy because: (1) the process of conducting field sobriety tests exposes certain aspects of an individual not otherwise observable by the public; and (2) the information disclosed by the field sobriety tests may reveal private facts about an individual\u2019s physical or psychological condition. Therefore, we hold that the administration of field sobriety tests by a police officer during a valid traffic stop constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\n<em>Constitutionally Mandated Grounds for Conducting Field Sobriety Tests</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Given that the administration of field sobriety tests constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, appellant argues that a police officer must have probable cause before conducting such tests during a valid traffic stop. Appellant claims that in the case <em>sub judice, </em>Trooper Harris did not have probable cause to require appellant to perform the field sobriety tests on the evening in question. The State responds that upon balancing the government\u2019s compelling interest in preventing drunk driving with the minimal intrusion occasioned by the field sobriety tests, the constitutional prerequisite for administering field sobriety tests is reasonable articulable suspicion that the operator of the vehicle is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>driving under the influence of alcohol. In the instant case, the State contends that Trooper Harris had more than reasonable suspicion that appellant was driving under the influence of alcohol.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, the Supreme Court decided that a governmental search within the ambit of the Fourth Amendment does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>require \u201cprobable cause\u201d to justify such action. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">But we deal here with an entire rubric of police conduct\u2014 necessarily swift action predicated upon the on-the-spot observations of the officer on the beat \u2014 which historically has not been, and as a practical matter could not be, subjected to the warrant procedure. Instead, the conduct involved in this case must be tested by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s general proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (footnote omitted). The Court concluded that \u201cthere is \u2018no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search (or seize) against the invasion which the search (or seizure) entails.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868. In applying the balancing test to the facts of <em>Terry, </em>the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">[W]here a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous, ... he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak8\"><em>Id. </em>at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Applying the rationale of <em>Terry, </em>the Arizona Supreme Court held in <em>State v. Superior Court, </em>149 Ariz. 269, 718 P.2d 171 (1986), that although field sobriety tests constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment, those tests may be justified by a police officer\u2019s \u201creasonable suspicion (based on specific, articulable facts) that the driver is intoxicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176. The Arizona Court refused to adopt the probable cause standard, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">[T]he threat to public safety posed by a person driving under the influence of alcohol is as great as the threat posed by a person illegally concealing a gun. If nothing in the initial stages of the stop selves to dispel the highway patrol officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion, fear for the safety of others on the highway entitles him to conduct a \u201ccarefully limited search\u201d by observing the driver\u2019s conduct and performance of standard, reasonable tests to discover whether the driver is drunk. The battery of roadside sobriety tests is such a limited search. The duration and atmosphere of the usual traffic stop make it more analogous to a so-called <em>Terry </em>stop than to a formal arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Many other jurisdictions also have held that reasonable articulable suspicion, not probable cause, is the constitutional prerequisite for the administration of field sobriety tests by a police officer. <em>See McCormick v. Municipality of Anchorage, </em>999 P.2d 155, 160 (Alaska Ct.App.2000); <em>State v. Lamme, </em>19 Conn.App. 594, 563 A.2d 1372, 1375 (1989), <em>aff'd, </em>216 Conn. 172, 579 A.2d 484 (1990); <em>State v. Taylor, </em>648 So.2d 701, 703-04 (Fla.1995); <em>State v.

Anderson, </em>74 Ohio App.3d 768, 600 N.E.2d 712, 714 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Only the supreme courts of Colorado, in <em>Carlson, </em>677 P.2d at 316-17, and Oregon, in <em>Nagel, </em>880 P.2d at 458-59, have held that for field sobriety tests to be constitutionally permissible, they must be supported by probable cause. In <em>Hulse, </em>289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75, the Montana Supreme Court expressly rejected the holdings of <em>Carlson </em>and <em>Nagel </em>when it concluded \u201cthat the State\u2019s interest in administering field sobriety tests based upon particularized suspicion rather than the more stringent standard of probable cause substantially outweighs the resulting limited intrusion into an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Applying the balancing test of <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, to the case <em>sub judice, </em>we first observe that the State of Maryland has a \u201ccompelling interest in controlling and preventing drunk driving.\u201d <em>Rowe, </em>363 Md. at 442, 769 A.2d 879; <em>see also Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 464, 597 A.2d 939 (1991) (explaining that \u201c[t]he General Assembly\u2019s goal in enacting the drunk driving laws ... is \u2018to meet the considerable challenge created by this problem by enacting a series of measures to rid our highways of the drunk driver menace\u2019 \u201d). Indeed, many longtime practitioners in this area of the law can recall that, twenty-five years ago, it was not illegal <em>per se </em>to drive in the State of Maryland with a specified blood alcohol concentration (\u201cBAC\u201d); that <em>prima facie </em>evidence of driving while intoxicated was a driver with a BAC of 0.15 or more; and that <em>pHma facie </em>evidence of driving while impaired by alcohol was a driver with a BAC of 0.10 or more. Md.Code (1973, 1980 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 10-307(d)-(e). Now, it is illegal <em>per se </em>to drive in Maryland with a BAC of 0.08 or more; <em>prima facie </em>evidence of driving under the influence of alcohol <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is a driver with a BAC of 0.08 or more; and <em>prima facie </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>evidence of driving while impaired by alcohol is a driver with a BAC of 0.07 to 0.08. <em>See </em>Trans. Art., \u00a7 11-174.1(a), \u00a7 21-902(a)(2); Md.Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 10-307(d),(g); MPJI-Cr., 4:10.4 A, B.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Against this compelling state interest, we must next determine the substantiality of the intrusion of the field sobriety tests. Field sobriety tests are conducted on the roadside during a routine traffic stop. As the State correctly points out, the driver has already been lawfully stopped and detained because the police officer has either: (1) probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred; or (2) reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity, such as drunk driving, may be afoot. <em>See Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769; <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Upon request of the police officer, the driver is required to display his or her driver\u2019s license and registration card. Trans. Art., \u00a7 16-122(c) and \u00a7 13-409(b). The officer also has the right to order the driver out of the vehicle. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 111, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977); <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 410, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997). The officer is entitled to detain the driver \u201cduring the period of time reasonably necessary for the officer to (1) investigate the driver\u2019s <em>sobriety </em>and license status, (2) establish that the vehicle has not been reported stolen, and (3) issue a traffic citation.\u201d <em>Pryor v. State, </em>122 Md.App. 671, 682, 716 A.2d 338 (1998) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The field sobriety tests that are conducted during such routine traffic stops are standard tests used by police officers to \u201cassess promptly the likelihood that a driver is intoxicated.\u201d <em>Little, </em>468 A.2d at 617. These tests are \u201csimple tasks\u201d designed to reveal objective information about the driver\u2019s coordination, cognitive abilities, and consumption of alcohol. <em>See Crampton v. State, </em>71 Md.App. 375, 388, 525 A.2d 1087, <em>aff'd </em>314 Md. 265, 550 A.2d 693 (1987). Specifically, the HGN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>test is used to determine whether a driver has alcohol in his or her system. <em>See Schultz v. State, </em>106 Md.App. 145, 149, 664 A.2d 60 (1995). The walk-and-turn test and the one-leg-stand test focus on whether, and to what extent, the consumption of alcohol has affected a driver\u2019s normal coordination. <em>See generally Crampton, </em>71 Md.App. at 388, 525 A.2d 1087. The \u201calphabet\u201d and \u201cnumber counting\u201d tests measure the effect of alcohol on a driver\u2019s ability to speak with recollection. <em>See generally id. </em>These tests are short in duration and limited in purpose. Therefore, similar to a limited search of a person\u2019s outer clothing for the presence of weapons in order to protect the safety of an officer and others, we conclude that field sobriety tests are a minimal intrusion into a driver\u2019s constitutionally protected privacy interests. <em>See Superior Court, </em>718 P.2d at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In weighing the State\u2019s compelling interest in combating drunk driving against the minimal intrusion of the field sobriety tests, we agree with the rationale and holdings of the Arizona Supreme Court in <em>Superior Court </em>and the Montana Supreme Court in <em>Hulse. </em>The field sobriety tests are like <em>Terry </em>stops because \u201cpublic safety is equally threatened by a person driving under the influence as by a person illegally concealing a gun.\u201d <em>Hulse, </em>961 P.2d at 86; <em>see also Superior Court </em>718 P.2d at 176. A field sobriety test is a \u201ccarefully limited search,\u201d because an officer simply observes the driver\u2019s performance of \u201cstandard, reasonable tests to discover whether the driver is drunk.\u201d <em>Superior Court, </em>718 P.2d at 176. Moreover, because field sobriety tests are used to determine whether probable cause exists for an arrest, \u201cto require probable cause that an individual has been driving under the influence <em>before </em>allowing police officers to administer field sobriety tests <em>would defeat the very purpose of those tests.\u201d Hulse, </em>961 P.2d at 87 (emphasis added). Therefore, we conclude that the administration of field sobriety tests, based on an officer\u2019s reasonable articulable suspicion of drunk driving, clearly outweighs the intrusion caused by such tests into an individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Consequently, we hold that although the administration of field sobriety tests by a police officer during a valid traffic stop constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, the conduct of those tests is constitutionally permissible when the officer has reasonable articulable suspicion that the driver is under the influence of alcohol.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">In the instant case, we have already determined that Trooper Harris made a valid traffic stop of appellant based upon probable cause that appellant committed a traffic violation. Trooper Harris had the following specific, articulable facts prior to requesting that appellant perform the field sobriety tests. First, upon approaching appellant\u2019s vehicle and advising appellant of the reason for the stop, Trooper Harris detected an odor of alcohol from within the vehicle. Second, Trooper Harris asked appellant to exit the car, and to step to the rear of the vehicle. There Trooper Harris detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from appellant\u2019s breath and person. Third, Trooper Harris observed that appellant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and that his speech was \u201cabsolutely slurred.\u201d Finally, appellant admitted to Trooper Harris that he had \u201cjust a few\u201d drinks. It is clear from these facts that Trooper Harris had more than reasonable articulable suspicion that appellant was driving under the influence of alcohol. <em>See Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 391, 735 A.2d 491 (stating that \u201c[bjloodshot eyes, in conjunction with the odor of alcohol emanating from the person, would ordinarily provide the police with reasonable suspicion that a driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>was under the influence of alcohol\u201d). Therefore, we conclude that Trooper Harris had sufficient grounds under the Fourth Amendment to administer field sobriety tests to appellant at the roadside during the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>Miranda Implications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Appellant argues that the field sobriety tests conducted in the instant case were a \u201cdetailed and involved effort\u201d amounting to custodial interrogation within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The State counters that appellant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claim is not preserved, and, in any event, is without merit, because appellant was not in \u201ccustody\u201d during the field sobriety tests, and therefore was not entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings. We agree with the State that appellant\u2019s claim is not preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The scope of our review is set forth in Maryland Rule 8-131(a), which states in relevant part: \u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any ... issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d Although Rule 8-131(a) provides the reviewing court with the authority to decide issues not raised below, \u201csuch power is solely within the court\u2019s discretion and is in no way mandatory.\u201d <em>See Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 148, 729 A.2d 910 (1999). In <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 188, 638 A.2d 107 (1994), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">It is clear from the plain language of Rule 8-131(a) that an appellate court\u2019s review of arguments not raised at the trial level is discretionary, not mandatory. The use of the word \u201cordinarily\u201d clearly contemplates both those circumstances in which an appellate court will not review issues if they were not previously raised and those circumstances in which it will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Nevertheless, \u201cthe main purpose of Md. Rule 8-131(a) is to make sure that all parties in a case are accorded fair treatment, and also to encourage the orderly administration of the law.\u201d <em>Conyers, </em>354 Md. at 148-49, 729 A.2d 910; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>Bell, </em>384 Md. at 189, 638 A.2d 107. Fairness is furthered by \u201c \u2018requiring] counsel to bring the position of their client to the attention of the lower court at the trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct any errors in the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell, </em>334 Md. at 189, 638 A.2d 107 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We conclude from a review of the record that appellant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claim is not preserved for appellate review. Appellant failed to raise the issue in his motion to suppress and accompanying memorandum, and further failed to assert it during the suppression hearing. It is of no consequence that appellant presents a constitutional question. <em>See Medley v. State, 52 </em>Md.App. 225, 231, 448 A.2d 363 (1982) (recognizing that even constitutional issues may be waived if not properly raised at the trial court level pursuant to Rules 885 and 1085, both predecessors to current Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(a)). We also decline to exercise our discretion to review appellant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claim and, consequently, will not address appellant\u2019s last question in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HAR-FORD COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\">. Route 24 is a four lane road, two lanes northbound and two lanes southbound. Lane two is the right lane, or slow lane, of the northbound lanes..</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\">. Lane one is the left lane, or passing lane, of the northbound lanes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">. Trooper Harris\u2019s calculation of one quarter of a mile is based on the distance between the intersections of Route 24 and Singer Road and Route 24 and Wheel Road, which is approximately one mile. At the time Trooper Harris encountered the Acura, he was at the halfway point between those roads. He made the traffic stop just prior to Wheel Road.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\">. Trooper Harris noted that if appellant had refused to submit to the field sobriety tests he would have had to make a reasonable decision to place appellant under arrest, because he would not have felt comfortable letting appellant go knowing there was alcohol in his system. Trooper Harris did not promise, threaten, or induce appellant to take the field sobriety tests and did not tell him that there were any consequences if appellant refused the tests. Appellant was not told by Trooper Harris that he did not have to take the tests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b515-11\">. Appellant also raises the issues of whether the trial court erred in finding: (1) that appellant consented to performing the field sobriety tests, and (2) that there were no promises, threats, subtle threats, or coercive tactics on the part of Trooper Harris to secure appellant\u2019s consent. In light of our decision in this appeal, we need not address these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\">. The State also appears to argue that the traffic stop of appellant can be justified on a separate ground of reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity, <em>i.e., </em>driving under the influence of alcohol. We disagree, for the simple reason that Trooper Harris never testified that he stopped appellant\u2019s vehicle because he believed that the operator was driving while under the influence of alcohol. After describing the maneuvers of appellant\u2019s vehicle, which included \"failing to drive within a single lane\u201d and \u201cspeed [changes] eight to ten [m.p.h.] above and below [the posted speed limit],\u201d Trooper Harris said: \"With those violations observed, I activated my emergency equipment and initiated a traffic stop of [appellant\u2019s] vehicle.\u201d Reasonable suspicion justifying a traffic stop must be based on specific, <em>articulable </em>facts. <em>See Cox v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>State, </em>161 Md.App. 654, 670, 871 A.2d 647 (2005) (explaining that \u201cit is clear that the police may effect a lawful stop of a motorist, so long as the officer is \u2018able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b518-6\">. Section 21-309(b) provides: (b) <em>Driving in a single lane required. </em>A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane and may not be moved from that lane or moved from a shoulder or bikeway into a lane until the driver has determined that it is safe to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\">. Although there is a conceptual distinction between \"reasonable\u201d and \"legitimate,\u201d we will consider those terms synonymous for the purposes of the instant case. <em>See </em>La Fave \u00a7 2.1(d), at 439-45.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\">. In Maryland, the buccal swab for a defendant\u2019s DNA is a search for Fourth Amendment purposes. <em>See State v. Raines, </em>383 Md. 1, 14, 857 A.2d 19 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\">. The State also contends, and appellant disputes, that Trooper Harris had probable cause to arrest appellant <em>prior </em>to the administration of the field sobriety tests because of appellant\u2019s erratic driving, odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and person, bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and admission of drinking. In light of our opinion in this case, we do not find it necessary to address this contention. We do not suggest, however, that a court could not find probable cause to exist under facts similar to those in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b530-6\">. The Editor's Note to Maryland Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol.), section 10-307 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides, <em>inter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>alia, </em>\"that the term 'under the influence of alcohol\u2019 as used in this Act shall include within its meaning the conduct prohibited by the former reference to 'intoxicated'....\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b533-5\">. Appellant also contends that under Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the administration of field sobriety tests by a police officer constitutes a search that can be justified only upon the existence of probable cause. This argument is without merit. The Court of Appeals has held consistently that \"Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights is to be interpreted <em>in pari materia </em>with the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. State, </em>384 Md. 484, 506, 864 A.2d 1006 (2004); <em>see also Scott v. State, </em>366 Md. 121, 139, 782 A.2d 862 (2001); <em>Gadson v. State, </em>341 Md. 1, 8 n. 3, 668 A.2d 22 (1995). Therefore, Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights \"does not accord appellant any greater protection than the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>See Henderson v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 19, 24, 597 A.2d 486(1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
