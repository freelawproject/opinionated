SDAT assigns error to the decision of the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) to rescind SDAT\u2019s termination, and reinstate the employment of David Reier as an assessor for SDAT. It also challenges the court\u2019s decision to award Reier reinstatement of his employee benefits and the OAH decision to award Reier full back pay. SDAT presents three questions for our review, which we rephrase as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">1. Did OAH improperly re-decide previously determined facts, upon remand from this Court, when it answered two questions under the new statutory interpretation of State Personnel and Pensions Article \u00a7 11-106?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">2. If new fact-finding was required, did OAH abuse its discretion when it refused to accept and review evidence addressing the circumstances surrounding an exhibit, when that very exhibit was now being highlighted by Reier in a new way and was relied upon by OAH as the primary point of reference when re-deciding the sequence of events?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>3. Did the circuit court improperly reverse the decision of OAH when it held that the statutory remedy in \u00a7 11-110(d)(l)(iii) included all lost employee benefits?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We answer the first and second questions in the negative, and the third question in the affirmative. We shall therefore affirm OAH\u2019s decision, and reverse the decision of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">As this appeal represents the second occasion for this Court to review arguments in this case, we liberally quote from the background facts set forth in our review of the first appeal, including footnotes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reproduced from the unreported opinion of <em>Reier v. State Dep\u2019t. of Assessments and Taxation, </em>No. 2456, September Term 2001, slip op. at 2-25 (filed December 19, 2002):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">On October 7, 1996, SDAT terminated Reier from his position as a property assessor for Carroll County. Reier appealed his termination to the Director of SDAT, who affirmed the termination. Reier then appealed to the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d), and the matter was assigned to Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) Gayle Haf-ner. ALJ Hafner held hearings on April 17 and May 7 of 1997 to determine the legality of Reier\u2019s termination. She filed a decision on June 23, 1997, in which she upheld appellant\u2019s termination. Reier then filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">Prior to hearing the matter, the trial judge learned that we would interpret [State Personnel and Pension] section ll-106(b)\u2019s thirty-day time limit in the <em>Geiger </em>case, which was then pending before this Court. The trial judge postponed the hearing of the matter pending our decision in that case. After we decided the <em>Geiger </em>case, <em>Western Correctional Institution v. Geiger, </em>130 Md.App. 562 [747 A.2d 697] (2000), the circuit court heard arguments and determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>that the administrative record was insufficient to make a proper decision. He remanded the case to the agency for further findings of fact as to \u201cwhether the investigation was carried out with reasonable diligence.\u201d This remand was necessary due to the test we enunciated in <em>Geiger. </em>On remand, another ALJ (Spencer) heard additional evidence and concluded that Reier had not met his burden to establish a <em>prima facia </em>[sic] case that SDAT had violated section ll-106(b)\u2019s time requirement. On December 31, 2000, the circuit court filed a memorandum opinion and order, affirming the original administrative decision, which had upheld Reier\u2019s termination. This appeal followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">II. <em>EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THE TWO ALJ HEARINGS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">David Reier began his employment with SDAT in March of 1990 as an Assessor I. In the next three years, he advanced to the position of Assessor III. He was reassigned from SDAT\u2019s Baltimore City office to the Carroll County office in 1993. Reier worked at SDAT\u2019s Carroll County office from 1993 until his termination in October of 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The Carroll County SDAT office is charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with performing physical inspections of each of the county\u2019s approximately 48,000 residential properties. As a part of this process, the office receives copies of residential building permits involving improvements. Residents are required to bring their building permits to the SDAT office where the clerical staff enters the information into the data system. Office personnel then file the building permits in a file cabinet in a small \u201cpermit\u201d room in the office. The permits remain filed until an assessor inspects the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Reier\u2019s job duties included performing field inspections and assessing residential properties, reviewing building permits for each property, reviewing and noting sales data concerning properties to be assessed, conducting field interviews with adults residing at the properties, making comparison between his physical review and the pre-existing assessment, noting any changes on the field card kept for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>each property, and completing all associated paperwork. Assessors also are required to be available in the office once a week to answer questions from the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">SDAT management periodically assigns the assessors a list of properties to be inspected. After receiving their assignments, assessors are required to pull their properties\u2019 field cards and check the building permit file to see if any building permits have been submitted for the properties since the date of the last inspection. If a building permit has been submitted for an assigned property, the assessor is required to attach it to the property field card, and bring both the field card and permit along when an inspection of the property is made. The purpose of this requirement is to aid the inspectors in gaining knowledge of all assessable changes made to the properties since the previous inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">At the time of inspection of the properties, assessors are required to note on the building permits (1) what progress, if any, has been made towards completion of the improvements, (2) the date on which they performed the inspections, and (3) their assessor numbers. If the assessor finds that the improvement has been completed, they are required to mark the permit as \u201cassessed,\u201d perform the assessment, and return the marked permit to a specific individual in the office. Tf the assessor finds the improvement has not been completed, he or she must note that fact on the permit and then re-file it in the filing cabinet from which it was obtained. This cabinet is called the un-assessed building permit filing cabinet. In addition, after completing each inspection, the assessor must mark the field card so that it reflects any changes made to the property, the date of the most recent assessment, and the assessor\u2019s number. The assessor then values the properties according to the physical characteristics recorded on the field cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">At all times here relevant, Larry C. White was the Supervisor of Assessments for Carroll County. The Assistant Supervisor of Assessments for Carroll County was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>William F. Norris, Jr. Mr. Norris was Reier\u2019s direct supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">On July 24, 1996, Messrs. White and Norris called a meeting of all the assessors in the Carroll County office. At that meeting, they distributed a memorandum entitled \u201cDepartment Guidelines for Job Performance,\u201d which outlined the proper methods for performing field inspections. This memorandum, among other things, reminded the assessors that they should make notes on the building permits at the time they inspect the properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">A few weeks later, in early August of 1996, Mr. Norris found a group of eight to ten building permits stacked on a cabinet in the permit room. There were no notations on these permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">At the April 1997 hearing before ALJ Hafner, Mr. Norris testified as to this discovery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">I found [the permits] in a stack on a corner of the cabinet, and I wondered why they were there. There was no notation on them that they had been assessed or visited or anything. From checking further I found that they were accounts which had been assigned to Mr. Reier, and that\u2019s why we checked those. They should not have been there. They should have either been back in the file with a notation that work was underway, or they should have been assessed and put in the assessed file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">Q. So you found the permits in a pile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">A. Um-hum. Stacked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">Q. And when was this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">A. <em>I think it was in the first part of </em>August.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-14\">Q. ... Had you started reviewing [Mr. Reier\u2019s] work at the time that you found that pile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-15\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Q. Okay. <em>What did you do with the permits?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">A. <em>I went out and checked them in the field to see if they were in fa,ct any degree of completion, not completion, not started or whatever.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">Q. Why didn\u2019t you just give the pile to Mr. Reier, since they were his accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">A. I could have done that. This is a good way to check to see if anybody was there. It\u2019s a quality control check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">Q. Well, how do you know if he had been there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">A. <em>Because I pidled the card and the card said May of 1996. </em>So that indicates to me that <em>the </em>\u2014 it <em>said on the field card with his number that he was there in May of 1996 or whenever. That indicated to me that he had already been there, but yet there was no indication on these permits that anybody was there.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">Q. How do you know the permits had been available or pulled prior to his visit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">A. They were in the file. <em>Some of them had been in the office since 1993. </em>It\u2019s the assessor\u2019s job to pull the permits when he gets these cards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">Q. But you have no way of knowing that the permits were even available?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-13\">A. They are in the office in the permit file. I don\u2019t know what you mean by available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-14\">Q. Well, this group of permits were in a pile. They obviously weren\u2019t where they should have been, and you don\u2019t know how they got there. So how do you know that they were ever where they were supposed to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-15\">A. I\u2019m assuming that they weren\u2019t where they were supposed to be, <em>and if someone was at the property, they would have noticed these changes. Whether you ham a permit or not, </em>when you go to a property and there is something added, you pick it up. You go to a property and you don\u2019t have a permit, and there\u2019s an attached garage there that is not on the card, you just ignore that? That\u2019s not the procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Mr. Norris further testified that after finding the permits he discussed the matter with Mr. White, who said, \u201cLet\u2019s go out and look at [the properties mentioned in the permits].\u201d According to Mr. Norris, they went to the properties and found that, even though Reier\u2019s records showed that he had visited the properties and even though the improvements to the properties had been made, Reier had failed to note the improvements even though those improvements would have been open and obvious if Reier had walked to the rear of the premises as required.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Mr. White testified at the ALJ hearing conducted in April 1997 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">Q. Now, when did you first become aware that there was any kind of a problem with Mr. Reier\u2019s work performance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">A. I found [their] permits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">Q. You found them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">A. Well, Lou [Norris] found them, actually \u2014 Mr. Norris found them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">Q. Where did he find them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-12\">A. Somewhere over where he was supposed to have his permits. They were in the vicinity of the permits where they were located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-13\">Q. And you told [Mr. Norris] to give them back to Mr. Reier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-14\">A. No. I said, well, this will be a good test. We\u2019re checking everybody\u2019s work anyway. Let\u2019s go look and see if he\u2019s \u2014 (inaudible)\u2014these things up, and low and behold, he hadn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-15\">Q. So, at that point, did you speak with Mr. Reier about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-17\">Q. And why was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>A. I didn\u2019t think it was a concern at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">Q. You didn\u2019t think it was a concern at that point, deficiencies weren\u2019t worth \u2014 weren\u2019t enough for you to have a counseling session with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">A. Not at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Neither Mr. White nor Mr. Norris was asked at the April 1997 hearing when they went to the properties \u2014 mentioned on the permits \u2014 to check to see if Reier had performed his duties properly. But Jack Ferguson,<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> an Assessor III, testified that in \u201ceither late August or early\u201d September 1996, he was asked by Mr. White and Mr. Norris to check \u201c20 or 30\u201d properties that Reier had already visited. Ferguson [sic] testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">Q. Okay. Did you ask them what the reason was, why you\u2019re going out and rechecking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">A. No. Yeah. <em>Became they thought some of them, had been missed or something. </em>Just wanted to make sure stuff wasn\u2019t missed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">Q. Is this something you had ever done before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">A. No. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-12\">Q. Did you ask the reasons why you were going about rechecking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-13\">A. No. I just assumed I was supposed to, <em>because we had found some discrepancies in some of the work that ivas done. </em>So we just wanted to check all the work and make sure it was right for that, you know, the end of that year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-14\">Q. What, if anything, did they say to you about these particular permits that you were given to check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-15\">A. Just to go out and look at the properties and see if the additions and the decks and whatever that were on the permits were there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Q. How many errors did you find out of this group of 20 or 30?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">A. About 20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">According to a notation on one of the permits for one of the premises re-inspected by Ferguson [sic], a re-inspection was done by Ferguson [sic] on September 4, 1996, <em>ie., </em>more than thirty days before Reier was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The original hearing before ALJ Hafner was continued until May 7, 1997. When the hearing resumed, Mr. White testified that he first realized there was a problem with Reier\u2019s work when he visited the properties \u2014 which he said was during the week of September 9, \u201clike the 9th, 10th, and 11th.\u201d In that hearing, he contradicted his earlier testimony and swore that finding the permits on the cabinet did not alert him that there were problems with Reier\u2019s work. He stressed that management did not immediately check the field cards to see which assessor had been assigned to evaluate the properties mentioned in the report and that Reier did not advise management until September 2, 1996, that he had completed his field work.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Mr. White also testified more than three years later, at the hearing before ALJ Spencer, on September 6, 2000, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">MR. LYON<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> [ATTORNEY FOR SDAT]: And what triggered the investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">MR. WHITE: The missed permits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">MR. LYON: And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">MR. WHITE: Well, we did a review of the permits that were found, which at the time we found them was \u2014 you know, like I said, Mr. Reier didn\u2019t finish his work until September 3rd. There was a holiday I think in there, too. And I was away that Friday and anyway, I came back and we started his check on his quality control, for lack of a better word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Once I found out that \u2014 I don\u2019t think he was in any of these properties. And then it just, you know, kind of like snowballed. You know, I called downtown and of course-advise me on what to do on something like this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Mr. White also testified in September 2000 that, after each assessor finishes physically inspecting each group of properties assigned to him or her, the assessor is required to let Management know. Management then performs routine quality control \u201cspot\u201d checks or audits of a sampling of the assessor\u2019s field work. According to Mr. White\u2019s testimony in 2000, the supervisors routinely performed these quality-control checks every September as a means of assuring adequate assessor performance. The audit process usually entails randomly selecting approximately fifteen properties from each assessor\u2019s file and performing an independent field inspection of the selected properties to determine whether an assessor\u2019s inspections have picked up any relevant improvements/changes to the property and whether all proper notations on the field cards and building permits have been made. In Reier\u2019s case, however, management did not begin with a random selection of the properties Reier had inspected; instead, the audit began with an inspection of the properties mentioned in the misplaced building permits. The audit was completed by September 13, 1996, according to Mr. White\u2019s testimony. That audit revealed that the improvements listed on the building permits had been completed in all cases and all the improvements were visible from the outside of the property. This was important because SDAT expected its assessors to note on the building permits and field cards any visible improvements. Reier had uniformly failed to do this according to Mr. White.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Mr. White additionally testified at the September 2000 hearing that, after completing the initial audit, SDAT\u2019s management undertook a full-scale investigation of Reier\u2019s assessments, which revealed numerous and substantial deficiencies in his performance. SDAT completed its full investigations by the end of September 1996, whereupon Reier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>met with Mr. White on October 3, 1996. At that meeting, Reier was given an opportunity to defend his poor performance. Reier did not cooperate, refused to even look at the examples of his errors, and responded three times to inquiries by saying that he was just a \u201cbad assessor.\u201d Additionally, he admitted to not getting out of the car and walking the properties he inspected as required by departmental procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">On October 7, 1996, Reier was given a termination notice that advised him of his termination and the reasons for it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">1. That the employee has been negligent in the performance of his duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">2. That the employee has been guilty of conduct such as has brought or, if published, would bring the State into disrepute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">3. That the employee has violated any lawful order or has failed to obey any lawful order given by a superior officer when the violation or failure to obey amounts to insubordination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">4. That the employee has engaged in insolent behavior constituting a serious breach of discipline that undermines management\u2019s authority and lowers employee morale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">5. That the employee is incompetent, inefficient, or indolent in the performance of his duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">6. That the employee has engaged in willful misconduct, without justification, that has compromised the integrity of real property assessments in Carroll County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-11\">7. That the employee has displayed indifference towards his job and responsibilities as a State employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">III. <em>ALJ HAFNER\u2019S FINDINGS OF FACT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">ALJ Hafner, the first ALJ to consider this case, found, <em>inter alia, </em>the following facts to be true:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-14\">9. The Employee knew the standards for field assessments and documentation requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\">11. In August 1996 Management discovered a stack of building permits which were inappropriately stored on the corner of a filing cabinet. The properties reflected in the permit were assigned to the Employee. Of the permits reviewed, Management found more than 50% of the assessments had errors significant enough to affect the valuation and the reassessment of the property. <em>The errors reflected that the Employee did not visit the property or did not go to the back or side of the property. </em>The permits should have been filed with the property cards that were already filed as completed assessments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">12. In early September 1996 Management reviewed the Employee\u2019s assessments for 68 sold properties. Management discovered 21 significant errors which affected property valuations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">13. In mid-September 1996 Management selected and reviewed an entire box of the Employee\u2019s completed assessments and computer sheet edits, a total of 300, and found 87 properties with significant errors affecting valuation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">14. On September 30, 1996, an assessment from the State Office reviewed the field work on 33 properties. Of the 24 properties with changes from the previous assessment, the Employee had accurately reflected one change, incorrectly noted five of the changes that he identified, and failed to reflect 18 significant changes, including a variety of add-on decks and additional buildings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">15. The Employee usually did not walk around the property, often did not get out of his car, and did not attempt to contact the homeowner or an adult household member. The Employee did not correct data entry errors in the computer sheets as required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">IV. <em>THE TWO GEIGER DECISIONS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">As mentioned earlier, the trial court remanded this case to the OAH for additional fact-finding. This additional fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>finding was necessary in order to comply with the opinion of this Court in <em>Western Correctional Institution v. Geiger. </em>We said in <em>Geiger:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">We reject appellee\u2019s contention that the 30-day limitation period begins the moment that the appointing authority acquires any knowledge, however slight, of the incident for which disciplinary action is ultimately imposed. There is an important distinction between (1) information that indicates the necessity for an investigation, and (2) the completion of an investigation by \u00a7 ll-106(a)(l). The statutory check found in \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b) does not start <em>until the appointing authority had [sic] </em>\u2014 or, <em>in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should reasonably have </em>\u2014 acquired <em>enough knowledge to justify the imposition of discipline.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"avl-dedup-0\"><em>Geiger, </em>130 Md.App. at 569, 747 A.2d 697 (emphasis added). In <em>Geiger, </em>we also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">[W]hen a disciplined employee contends that the time limitation of \u00a7 ll-106(b) has not been complied with, the employee must overcome the presumption of correctness by making a <em>prima facia </em>[sic] showing that the appointing authority was \u201con notice\u201d of the alleged misconduct more than 30 days before the disciplinary action was imposed.

ALJ Spencer ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">The Employee was terminated because of negligent, incompetent and inefficient work performance that compromised the integrity of the real property assessment in Carroll County. <em>The initial discovery of the permits, however, was not sufficient notice to support terminating the Employee. </em>A review of the properties reflected on the permits confirmed that the Employee had been to the properties but had not placed notations on the permits. <em>Clearly the failure to compute the permits was an error but at the time the permits were discovered, the Employee had not completed his field work. </em>If Management had discovered that the Employee had not reported to the properties, that would have indicated the need for an immediate investigation. However, the Employee was performing his duties, he had just failed to complete the permits. Since the Employee had not completed his fieldwork, it was reasonable for Management to wait until the Employee had completed his fieldwork before conducting an audit of his work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\"><em>While I agree with the Employee that the initial discovery of the incomplete permits was notice of errors in performance, it was not notice of misconduct to justify termination. ... It is clear from the evidence presented by Management in support of the charges that Management was not on notice of the misconduct that resulted in the charges until the audit began on September 9, 1996. </em>Management initially only discovered 8 to 10 permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>while the initial audit involved 68 properties with 21 errors. The initial discovery of the permits did not form the basis for the Notice of Termination and the investigation of those permits did not produce notice of misconduct to justify the imposition of the discipline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">In light of the above, I find that the Employee has failed to overcome the presumption of correctness by making a <em>prima facie </em>showing that Management was on notice of the alleged misconduct more than 30 days before the Employee was disciplined. Based on the facts in this appeal, <em>Management was on notice as of September 9, 1996 of the alleged misconduct that justified the Notice of Termination. The notice of termination was filed on October 7, 1996, less than SO days after Management acquired sufficient notice of the misconduct. </em>Accordingly, the notice of termination was filed in a timely manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANx\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Earlier in her opinion, ALJ Spencer set forth her factual findings concerning \u201cthe thirty-day-clock\u201d issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">3. In early August 1996, Lumen [sic] Norris, Assistant Supervisor of Assessments for Carroll County, found a stack of 8 to 10 building permits on a cabinet. There were no notations of [sic] the permits. The properties reflected on the permits were assigned to the Employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">4. Mr. Norris discussed the permits with Larry White, Supervisor of Assessments for Carroll County. Mr. Norris and Mr. White took the permits and went to the properties to determine if work had been performed pursuant to the permits. <em>They discovered that the Employee had been to the properties but had not made any notations on the permits.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">5. On September 3, 1996, the Employee completed his fieldwork.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">6. As part of a quality control review, once an assessor completes his fieldwork, Mr. White conducts a random audit of the assessor\u2019s work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>7. On September 9, 1996, Mr. White conducted a field audit of the Employee\u2019s completed fieldwork. The assessments for 68 properties were reviewed and 21 errors, which affected property valuations, were discovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">8. Between September 14 and September 30, at least three more audits of the Employee\u2019s work were conducted. One of the audits revealed 87 out of a total of 300 properties with errors affecting evaluation. Another audit reviewed the fieldwork on 33 properties. Of the 24 properties with changes from previous assessments, the Employee accurately reflected one change, incorrectly noted five changes that he identified!!,] and failed to reflect 18 changes, including decks and additional buildings on the properties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The chronology set forth above suggests \u2014 but does not definitively establish \u2014 that prior to September 3, 1996, Messrs. Norris and White went to the property mentioned on the mislaid permits and discovered that Reier had not noted the improvements on the permits even though he had claimed to have been on the premises. If that suggestion is accurate, management would have known by at least September 3, 1996, that Reier was not performing his job properly \u2014 provided that management looked at the field cards for the properties prior to September 3, 1996.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the field cards were reviewed shortly after the permits were discovered (as suggested by Mr. Norris\u2019s April 17, 1997, testimony quoted supra), there is no doubt that the employer would have then known not only that Reier had failed to note improvements on the permits but that he had claimed to have been to the properties but had failed to see the improvements and note them on the field cards. Thus, under that scenario, at least by September 3, 1996, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Reier reported that he had completed his field work, the employer\u2019s knowledge clearly would have been sufficient to launch an investigation. The trouble is, however, we cannot know for sure, because no explicit determination was made by either ALJ Hafner or ALJ Spencer as to when management looked at Reier\u2019s field notes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">VI. <em>THE COURT OF APPEALS\u2019 GEIGER DECISION AS APPLIED TO THIS CASE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Both parties wrote their initial briefs based on the assumption that our decision in <em>Geiger </em>accurately enunciated the applicable law. After the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision, Reier wrote a reply brief in which he contended that SDAT \u201cactually launched its investigation\u201d into the misconduct that led to his termination prior to September 7, 1996. Because knowledge of facts sufficient to launch an investigation into the misconduct for which Reier was terminated on October 7, 1996, started the thirty-day clock to tick, appellant argues that the disciplinary action for which he was fired must be rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In its brief, SDAT asserts that the core reason Reier was terminated was \u201cthat his field inspections and final work product were so poor that they indicated he was intentionally not performing his duties or just superficially doing them.\u201d We agree. The question then becomes: Did the employer have knowledge sufficient to order an investigation into the question of Reier\u2019s poor performance prior to September 7, 1996? SDAT asserts that the answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d It further assert [sic] that it was not put on notice of Reier\u2019s poor performance until September 9, 1996 \u2014 when Messrs. White and Norris went to the premises (mentioned in the permits discovered in early August 1996) and found that various improvements mentioned in those permits had been completed but had not had been discovered by Reier. SDAT further asserts that the inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>tion of the premises (mentioned in the misplaced permits) was in lieu of the usual random re-inspections that are routinely performed concerning the work of all their assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Reier counters that the evidence is clear that in the various hearings before the two ALJs, SDAT consistently pointed to the discovery of the permits in August 1996 as its initial notice that there were problems with the employee\u2019s performance. Reier also points out that the notation on one of the building permits for one of the properties the employer ordered reinspected indicates that the inspection was made on September 4, 1996. Additionally, Mr. White testified, at one point, that he and Mr. Norris first began to check Reier\u2019s work on September 2,1996.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Taking the evidence produced at the various hearings before the ALJ in the light most favorable to Reier, one could find the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">1. That eight to ten permits were found in early August 1996 laying atop a file cabinet;</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">2. Mr. Norris determined immediately that the properties mentioned in the permits had all been assigned to Reier to assess.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">3. That management knew prior to September 3, 1996, that there was a problem with Reier\u2019s work, and prior to September 4, 1996, management asked Jack Berleson [sic] to investigate the quality of Reier\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">4. That by September 4, 1996, Jack Berleson [sic] started to investigate whether Reier had properly inspected the various premises mentioned in the eight to ten misplaced permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">On the other hand, if we take the evidence in the light most favorable to SDAT, the employer never suspected that Reier had not been properly performing his job until September 9, 1996, which was the date Messrs. White and Norris visited the various premises mentioned in the mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>placed permits and found that Reier had failed, on repeated occasions, to note on the assessment records that various open and obvious improvements had been made to the properties mentioned in the misplaced permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In our view, the date that SDAT acquired knowledge sufficient to order an investigation into whether Reier had been properly performing his field work was when the employer discovered (1) that improvements (mentioned on the misplacement [sic] permits) had been performed <em>and </em>(2) that Reier had visited the premises but had failed to note on SDAT\u2019s field cards that the improvements had been completed. As already noted, the evidence presented to the two ALJ\u2019s is conflicting as to when the employer received the knowledge necessary to launch an investigation. ALJ Spencer (understandably) never answered that question. Instead, she answered the question posed by the <em>Geiger </em>decision by this Court: \u201cWhen did the employer acquire sufficient knowledge of the alleged misconduct to justify the termination?\u201d she answered, \u201cSeptember 9, 1996.\u201d In arriving at that answer, ALJ Spencer said that it was \u201creasonable for Management to wait until the employer completed his fieldwork before conducting an audit of work.\u201d Because Reier\u2019s field work was completed on September 3, 1996, this at least suggests, but does not compel, the conclusion that the ALJ thought that the employer, as of September 3, 1996, had good reason to believe that Reier\u2019s field work was being done incompetently.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The employer asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">Consistent with White\u2019s normal practice, the field audit of Reier\u2019s work was not done until after he had indicated his field work was finished on September 3, 1996. Neither Mr. Norris nor Mr. White reviewed the assessment work sheets when the permits were found or before they subsequently visited the properties on September 9th. Consequently, when they visited the properties, they did not know whether the improvements had been started or finished or whether the assessment records reflected those improvements. However, the September 9th field <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>audit revealed that the improvements on the permits had been completed. When they returned to the office and checked the work sheets, Mr. White and Mr. Norris learned for the first time that Reier had failed to record the new improvements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">(References to record extract and footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">There is evidence in the record to support each of the facts set forth in the paragraph just quoted. But, as we have already noted, many of those facts were contrary to earlier testimony by Reier\u2019s witnesses. And, while ALJ Spencer did find that Mr. White \u201cconducted a field audit of the Employee\u2019s fieldwork\u201d on September 9, 1996 (Finding No. 7), it is not at all clear that the \u201cfield audit\u201d she is referring to is the audit of the premises (referred to in the misfiled permits) because (1) she says in Finding No. 4 that White and Norris visited the premises (mentioned in the misplaced permits) on a date, which she does not specify, and then discovered that Reier \u201chad been to the properties but had not made any notation on the permits\u201d and (2) in Finding No. 7, she indicates (but does not say explicitly) that the audit performed on September 9, 1996, was far more extensive than merely checking the premises mentioned in the misplaced permits. As stated earlier, Finding No. 7 was that the September 9 audit uncovered the fact that Reier had assessed 68 properties and had made 21 errors \u201cwhich affected property valuations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">We shall remand this case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County with instructions to once again remand the case to the OAH. Upon remand, the ALJ shall answer the following question: When did SDAT acquire information sufficient to launch an investigation into whether Reier\u2019s work performance was \u201cnegligent, incompetent, and inefficient.\u201d The ALJ should also answer the following subsidiary questions: Did SDAT\u2019s agents go to the premises (mentioned in the misplaced permits) prior to September 7, 1996, to determine if the improvements mentioned in the permits had been completed? If the answer to that question is \u201cyes,\u201d did SDAT know prior to September 7, 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>that Reier had been to the premises (mentioned in the misplaced permits) but had failed to note on the field cards the fact that improvements to the property had been made? If the answer to <em>both </em>those questions is \u201cyes,\u201d then, as a matter of law, SDAT\u2019s termination of Reier must be rescinded. If the answer to either of these questions is in the negative, then Reier\u2019s termination should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Pursuant to our decision to remand the matter to the circuit court, which would then remand to OAH to consider our questions in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Geiger, </em>both parties submitted memoranda to OAH in support of their respective positions for, and against, the need for additional evidence. SDAT claimed our questions could be answered without additional evidence. In the event OAH decided additional fact-finding would be necessary, SDAT specifically requested \u201cthat evidence be allowed to offset the loss of the original testimony through which Management Ex. # 9 (the exhibit dated 9/4/96) was entered.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Reier countered that the testimony and evidence adduced from prior hearings contained all the necessary information for the agency to follow our mandate and properly answer the pertinent questions. ALJ Spencer agreed with Reier and denied SDAT\u2019s request for additional evidence in a letter to both parties dated October 24, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>After hearing oral argument on March 8, 2004, ALJ Spencer, in a Decision after remand dated April 12, 2004, reprinted many of the findings of fact she made on December 8, 2000, <em>supra, </em>and proceeded to make additional findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">9. On October 3, 1996, Management met with Reier to discuss the results of the audits and to provide Reier an opportunity to offer mitigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">10. On October 7, 1996, Reier was provided with the Notice of Termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">As a result of the remand order and further review of the record, I find the following additional facts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">11. Mr. Norris found a stack of misplaced permits in August 1996. There were no notations of the permits that the property had been assessed or visited. Upon further checking, Mr. Norris concluded that the properties had been assigned to Reier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">12. After finding the field cards, Mr. Norris pulled the field cards to determine if Reier had been to the properties. The notation on the field cards indicated Reier had been to the properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">13. Mr. Norris discussed his findings with Mr. White. Both Mr. Norris and Mr. White then went to the properties identified in the permits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">14. Mr. White next instructed Jack Burgeson [sic], another assessor, to reassess the properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">15. Mr. Burgeson [sic] conducted reassessments on September 4, 1996, September 14, 1996, and September 30, 1996.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">ALJ Spencer then addressed our questions on remand, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-13\">I. Did SDAT\u2019s agents go to the premises (mentioned in the misplaced permits) prior to September 7, 1996, to determine if the improvements mentioned in the permits had been completed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-14\">As reflected in the testimony from the April .17, 1997 hearing, Messrs. Norris, White and Burgeson [sic] went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the properties mentioned in the misplaced permits prior to September 7, 1996. Mr. White testified that he found the misplaced permits in August 1996 and concluded that the properties had been assigned to Reier. He then pulled the field cards and concluded that Reier had been to the properties. Next, he discussed his findings with Mr. White. Both Messrs. White and Norris testified that they then went to the properties identified in the misplaced permits. After going to the properties, Mr. White testified that he instructed Jack Burgeson [sic] to reassess the properties. Mr. Burgeson [sic] conducted a reassessment on September 4, 1996. Thus, based on the testimony presented at the April 17, 1997 hearing, SDAT\u2019s agents went to the properties mentioned in the misplaced permits prior to September 7, 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">At the hearing conducted on May 7, 1997, Mr. White testified that he went to the properties during the week of September 9, 1996. At the September 6, 2000 hearing, Mr. White changed his testimony. He first testified that he went to the properties on September 2, 1996. This is highly unlikely, however, because September 2, 1996 was a State holiday (Labor Day). He then testified that he went to the properties on September 7, 1996. Again, this is highly unlikely because September 7,1996 was a Saturday. Finally, he again testified that he went to the properties on September 9, 1996 after Reier completed his field work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">After reviewing the evidence, I conclude that the testimony at the April 17, 1997 hearing is more credible and accurately reflects that chronology of events in this case. Messrs. Norris and White went to the properties prior to September 4, 1996. After they went to the properties, Mr. White assigned Mr. Burgeson [sic] to conduct reassessments. Mr. Burgeson [sic] conducted a reassessment on September 4, 1996 as reflected by his notation on the permit. Contrary to the argument presented by SDAT, there is no reason to conclude that the notation was in error. While it is not clear as the exact date the [sic] Messrs. Norris and White went to the properties, it is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>that they went to the properties prior to Mr. Burgeson\u2019s [sic] assignment to conduct a reassessment and it is also clear that Mr. Burgeson [sic] reassessed at least one of the properties on September 4,1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">II. Did SDAT know prior to September 7, 1996, that Reier had been to the premises (mentioned in the misplaced permits) but had failed to note on the field cards the fact that improvements to the property had been made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">At the April 17, 1997 hearing, Mr. Norris testified that after he found the misplaced permits in August 1996, he pulled the field cards and determined that Reier had been to the properties. This was done prior to September 4, 1996 when Mr. Burgeson [sic] began to reassess the properties. In addition, in order to conduct the reassessment, Mr. Burgeson [sic] would have had to have the field cards in order to note if any improvements had been recorded. Thus, the answer to the question is yes \u2014 SDAT knew prior to September 7, 1996 that Reier had been to the properties mentioned in the misplaced permits but had failed to note on the field cards that the fact the improvements to the property had been made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">In the remand order, the court, after listing findings of fact number 3 through 8 from my December 8, 2000 decision, noted the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">The chronology set forth above suggests \u2014 but does not establish \u2014 that prior to September 3, 1996, Messrs. Norris and White went to the property mentioned in the mislaid permits and discovered that Reier had not noted the improvements on the permits even though he had claimed to have been on the premises. If that suggestion is accurate, management would have known by at least September 3, 1996, [that Reier] was not performing his job properly \u2014 provided that management looked at the field cards for the properties prior to September 3, 1996 (footnote omitted) If the field cards were reviewed shortly after the permits were discovered (as suggested by Mr. Norris\u2019s April 17, 1997, testimony quoted supra), there is no doubt that the employer would have then known not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>only that Reier had failed to note improvements on the permits but that he had claimed to have been to the properties but had failed to see the improvements and note them on the field cards. Thus, under that scenario, at least by September 3, 1996, when Reier reported that he had completed his field work, the employer\u2019s knowledge clearly would have been sufficient to launch an investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">Furthermore:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">In our view, the date that SDAT acquired knowledge sufficient to order an investigation into whether Reier had been properly performing his field work was when the employer discovered (1) that improvements (mentioned on the misplaced permits) had been performed <em>and </em>(2) that Reier had visited the premises but had failed to note on SDAT\u2019s field cards that the improvements had been completed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">In light of the preceding discussion, I conclude that as of September 4, 1996, SDAT had discovered that the improvements mentioned on the misplaced permits had been performed and that Reier had visited the premises but had failed to note on the field cards that the improvement had been completed. This conclusion is consistent with the testimony of Messrs. White, Norris and Burgeson [sic] presented at the April 17, 1997 hearing and the notations on the permits. Thus, I conclude that as of September 4, 1996, the SDAT had knowledge sufficient to order an investigation into whether Reier had been properly performing his field work. Accordingly, the termination notice of October 7,1996 was beyond the thirty-day limit and must be rescinded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">With regard to Reier\u2019s request for benefits, in addition to an award of full back pay under \u00a7 11-110(d) of the State Personnel and Pension Article, AL J Spencer found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">Having concluded that the Notice of Termination must be rescinded and in light of [\u00a7 ll-110(d) of the State Personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>and Pension Article], I order that Reier be reinstated to his position of Assessor III with full back pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">Reier requests that in addition to full back pay, I also order restoration of benefits, such as reimbursement for medical insurance, for the period of his termination. The applicable statute ... is written in the disjunctive. Thus, pursuant to the statute, I can rescind or modify the disciplinary action taken and restore to the employee any lost time, compensation, status, or benefits; OR order reinstatement to the position that the employee held at dismissal or order full back pay OR order both, reinstatement and full back pay. (emphasis added) I have ordered that Reier be reinstated to the position that he held at the time of dismissal with full back pay. The statute does not provide for the restoration of benefits when reinstatement and full back pay are ordered. Pursuant to Md. State Pers. &amp; Pen.Code Ann. \u00a7 2-601, a reinstated employee is entitled to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u00a7 2-601.

State Pers. &amp; Pen.Code Ann. \u00a7 11-110(d)(1)(h) is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">SDAT requests that the award of back pay be reduced by interim earnings and the failure of Reier to mitigate damages. To support its position, SDAT uses the legislative history regarding House Bill 774 (Personnel Reform) from the 1996 Session of the General Assembly. However, the legislative history does not support the position of SDAT. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the original bill, there was an offset and reduction for interim earnings from employment elsewhere or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence. 1996 Md. Laws, Chap[.] 347. This language would have been provided for the adjustment of back pay in a manner suggested by SDAT. However, this language was stricken from the bill and the current statute simply provides for \u201cfull back pay.\u201d Therefore, the award of back pay will not be offset or reduced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact and Discussion, I conclude as a matter of law that SDAT\u2019s termination of Reier must be rescinded. Md. State Pers. &amp; Pen.Code Ann. \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b); <em>Western Correctional Institution, Department of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Services v.

State Pers. &amp; Pen.Code Ann. \u00a7 ll-110(d)(iii)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">Having concluded that the termination of Reier must be rescinded, I order that Reier be reinstated to his position as an Assessor III with full back pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Both parties timely petitioned the circuit court for judicial review of ALJ Spencer\u2019s decision. After conducting a hearing on March 17, 2005, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">On appeal, SDAT argues that Judge Spencer erred in her decision of April 12, 2004 because in answering the two questions posed to her by the Court of Special Appeals she re-determined facts which had not been vacated. SDAT also argues that Judge Spencer erred in not holding another evidentiary hearing to hear evidence on these issues since significant evidence, which had previously been heard in front of another Administrative Law Judge had not been recorded. Interestingly, no objection was made at the proceeding before Judge Spencer on remand by SDAT for her failure to take additional testimony. At no time did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>SDAT request to put on additional evidence or to reopen the evidentiary hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">This Court does not agree with the arguments posed by SDAT. The Court of Special Appeals remanded this instant case back to Judge Spencer with specific instructions for her to answer two specific questions. The Court of Special Appeals instructed Judge Spencer on the outcome of the case depending on how she answered these two questions. Judge Spencer did not err; she merely answered the questions posed to her by the Court of Special Appeals and based on her answers, reinstated Reier as the Court of Special Appeals instructed. This Court finds that there is substantial evidence in the record to support Judge Spencer\u2019s decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">On cross-appeal, Reier argues that Judge Spencer erred in reinstating him with back pay dating from October 7, 1996 but without any benefits. This Court agrees with Reier and therefore awards him benefits dating back from his wrongful termination on October 7, 1996. While SDAT argues that Section 11-110 of the State Personnel and Pension Article precludes these \u201cbenefits\u201d as part of a reinstatement, this Court finds that it is inconsistent with the intent of the legislature. It is inconceivable that the legislature would have intended a wrongfully fired employee, when eventually reinstated for this wrongful termination, to only be entitled to their back pay and not other benefits, which the employee would have received absent the wrongful termination. This is not a logical result. Accordingly, this Court grants Reier benefits dating back to his October 7, 1996 termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">The decision of the Administrative Law Judge is AFFIRMED and supplemented by the addition of benefits wrongfully withheld.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Appellant then filed a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">SDAT argues that AL J Spencer erred when she improperly re-decided \u201cfacts contrary to that which had already been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>decided\u201d at previous hearings before OAH. It points to the fact that when this matter was initially remanded by this Court, OAH was only authorized to apply the new standard set forth by the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Geiger </em>for interpreting State Personnel and Pension \u00a7 11-106, and not to re-decide facts that were not vacated, or make new factual determinations, where OAH initially failed to make any determinations. SDAT also contends the ALJ abused her discretion by refusing the proffered evidence it offered upon remand, and then relying on certain evidence to decide the case, that the proffered evidence could have refuted. Lastly, SDAT claims the circuit court erred in its interpretation of State Personnel and Pension \u00a7 11-110, and its decision to reverse the decision of OAH and award appellee benefits, in addition to his award of full back pay after rescission of his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In the instant case, we are asked to review the decisions of ALJ Spencer and the circuit court\u2019s statutory interpretation. \u201cIn deciding whether the ALJ was correct, we stand in the same shoes as did the circuit court.\u201d <em>McKay v. Dep\u2019t of Public Safety, </em>150 Md.App. 182, 192, 819 A.2d 1088 (2003)(citing <em>Gigeous v. Eastern Corr. Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 495-95, 769 A.2d 912 (2001)). Because \u201cadministrative agency decisions are <em>prima facie </em>correct and carry a presumption of validity, we must review the [] decision in the light most favorable to that [agency].\u201d <em>Cox v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>86 Md.App. 179, 187, 586 A.2d 43 (1991)(analogizing Tax Court decision review to that of administrative agency review). \u201cWe do \u2018not overturn the agency\u2019s factual findings or its application of law to facts if the decision is supported by substantial evidence considered in light of the record as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 586 A.2d 43 (citation omitted.) Furthermore, under this substantial evidence test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">... our inquiry is focused on whether evidence exists in the record from which a reasonable person could draw the same conclusion as the ALJ. In applying this test, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>we \u201cd[o] not substitute [our] judgment, even on the question of the appropriate inference to be drawn from the evidence, for that of the agency.\u201d Rather, we afford deference to the factual findings of the agency, as long as they are supported by the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><em>Dep\u2019t of Public Safety and Corr. Services v. Thomas, </em>158 Md.App. 540, 551-52, 857 A.2d 638 (2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In contradistinction to the substantial evidence test, \u201can arbitrary and capricious standard applies to our review of an agency\u2019s discretionary functions, making such actions essentially unreviewable \u2018[a]s long as [the agency\u2019s] exercise of discretion does not violate regulations, statutes, common law principles, due process, and other constitutional requirements[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 857 A.2d 638 (quoting <em>Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 557, 625 A.2d 914 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">We conclude that the ALJ did not err in its factual determinations, which SDAT argues were previously determined. Judge Salmon, writing for the Court, vacated the judgment and ordered that the case be remanded, as a result of the Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of our interpretation of \u00a7 11-106. In our first review of this case, we did not hold or order the vacation of the ALJ\u2019s factual findings. Our mandate, however, as well as the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Geiger, </em>in effect, vacated those factual findings. The legal conclusion reached previously by ALJ Spencer was based upon our interpretation of \u00a7 11-106, which the Court of Appeals declared incorrect and reversed. In light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, and per Judge Salmon\u2019s instructions, ALJ Spencer was to answer specific questions that would undoubtedly go to the merits of what the Court of Appeals declared agencies and appellate courts should seek in reviewing matters under \u00a7 11-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">We agree with SDAT that an agency walks that fine line of <em>res judicata </em>when it engages in factual findings after one or two remands from appellate courts. We, nevertheless, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>agree that ALJ Spencer made erroneous factual findings in this case. Previously, Judge Salmon noted there were several facts that were not definitively determined by either ALJ in this case, or were not elicited in a manner that would form the basis upon which the Court could formulate a proper legal determination. Upon remand, the ALJ was to make a definitive determination as to when SDAT had adequate information to begin an investigation of Reier.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Patently, certain facts will remain unchanged, regardless of the legal principles applicable. ALJ Spencer\u2019s factual findings, or her reissuing certain findings, while making new determinations, was not error, considering the new legal principles to be applied to these facts. SDAT contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">The instant remand was not an opportunity for the ALJ to re-decide facts or to correct determinations that she now felt were erroneous, given that this Court did not vacate any previous finding of fact. Yet, OAH did not apply the Court of Appeals\u2019 <em>Geiger </em>standard to the existing findings of fact, but to facts improperly re-decided in a contrary manner. That is made abundantly clear by the fact that if one applied this Court\u2019s <em>Geiger </em>standard of due diligence to the ALJ\u2019s new fact-finding, one must reach a conclusion opposite of the January 3, 2001 OAH decision. If SDAT knew before September 4th that Reier had been to the permit properties and had not reported the new improvements (as determined in the second remand decision), how could due diligence not have triggered the 30-day period? Accordingly, the termination could not have been timely under this Court\u2019s <em>Geiger </em>standards. But that was not the decision that the ALJ made. Rather, she said that: \u201c[i]f Management had not discovered that the Employee has not reported to the properties, that would have presented evidence that the Employee was not performing any of his duties and would have indicated the need for immediate investigation,\u201d but then concluded that \u201c[i]t is clear from the evidence presented by Management in support of the charges that Management was not on notice of the misconduct that resulted in the charges until the audit began on September 9, 1996.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>That initial conclusion by ALJ Spencer is clearly and indisputably inconsistent with her later answer to the second remand question.... Reier\u2019s new argument highlighting an old piece of evidence in a different way does not allow a re-determination of the facts for the same reason it would not allow a second grievance or a second appeal to be filed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">SDAT would be accurate if the legal standard had remained the same for both ALJ Spencer decisions. The primary distinction between the Court of Appeals\u2019 standard and our standard was that, in the first decision, the ALJ analyzed the evidence to find when SDAT <em>should have acquired sufficient knowledge to justify the imposition of a disciplinary sanction. </em>Under the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation, we then instructed ALJ Spencer to examine the evidence to determine when SDAT <em>acquired sufficient information to launch an investigation into Reier\u2019s work. </em>In the ALJ\u2019s second decision, she sought to discover evidence that would lead to an investigation, which could include minor inaccuracies or omissions, as opposed to determining whether Reier engaged in any misconduct to warrant discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">According to ALJ Spencer, September 4, 1996 became the critical day because that was the date listed on Management Exhibit number 9, a permit used by Burgesen, to re-assess Reier\u2019s work. As we noted before, the fact that SDAT became aware of information supporting its decision to launch an investigation was not previously determined by OAH. ALJ Spencer, however, on remand, makes this determination based upon the exhibit and testimony from White, Morris, and Burgesen. Utilizing the differing standards, and upon review of the facts, led the ALJ to different conclusions. Under our standard of review of the ALJ\u2019s decision after remand, a reasoning person could reach the same conclusion as the ALJ in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Our review of that testimony reveals the time period White, Morris and Burgesen seem to agree upon is late August to the middle of September as the time they attempted to gather information on Reier. It appears, for purposes of answering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>our questions, the scale tipped in favor of September 4th as the date for SDAT to acquire the knowledge to launch an investigation into Reier\u2019s employment practices. The affirmative answers to both our questions, as Judge Salmon earlier concluded, indicated Reier\u2019s termination, under the law, had to be rescinded. This same factual information may not have necessarily led to the conclusion under our initial standard\u2014 sufficient knowledge to justify imposing some form of discipline \u2014 in light of the fact that our initial standard implies an employee engaged in <em>any form </em>of misconduct may lead to disciplinary action, as opposed to an intermediary step of launching an investigation. Viewing the ALJ\u2019s decision on remand, as <em>prima facie </em>correct, we hold that the ALJ did not err in her factual determinations made under the applicable interpretation set forth by the Court of Appeals, and restated by this Court by way of questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Because of the deference we afford administrative agencies for factual findings and their expertise, we determine ALJ Spencer did not abuse her discretion. Here, ALJ Spencer decided against additional evidence regarding testimony which was not recorded in 1997. During the first appeal to this Court, we remanded, in contemplation that the OAH would do all that would be necessary to definitively answer our questions. If that included making the requisite factual determinations, or examining new or clarifying evidence on remand, we are certain she would have done so. Our review of the ALJ\u2019s decision on remand reveals no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">In reaching our decision, of critical importance were the dates and the running of days in this case. As Judge Salmon noted in the first appeal to this Court, the chronology of events suggested that some investigation of Reier\u2019s work occurred prior to September 3rd. This fact, however, was not definitively determined. In light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 enunciation of the proper interpretation OAH was to utilize in reviewing Reier\u2019s termination, whether SDAT had knowledge prior to September 7, 1996, had to be clearly set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Given ALJ Spencer\u2019s prior experience with this case, and the voluminous record, it is not surprising that she decided no further testimony or evidence was necessary. Of note is that these events occurred in 1996; the ALJ did not start the remand process until October of 2003; she heard argument in March of 2004; and she entered her decision in April of 2004. The ALJ stated in her opinion that she found the testimony taken closest to the time of Reier\u2019s termination to be the most credible testimony. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that ALJ Spencer accepted SDAT\u2019s proffered evidence to supplement the testimony regarding Burgesen\u2019s re-assessment in early September, she still could have reached the same conclusion that she reached without the additional evidence. Because we discern no legal error, nor abuse of discretion, we affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision, insofar as her answering this Court\u2019s questions on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\"> Lastly, SDAT assigns error to the circuit court for reversing ALJ Spencer\u2019s decision interpreting State Personnel and Pension Article \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(d). ALJ Spencer, after ruling Reier\u2019s termination was to be rescinded because SDAT did not comply with the 30-day requirement under 11-106, denied Reier\u2019s request for restored benefits, while reinstating him to his position with full back pay. ALJ Spencer also did not reduce the award by interim earnings or because Reier failed to mitigate damages, as SDAT requested. The circuit court concluded ALJ Spencer\u2019s interpretation was not what the General Assembly intended in drafting \u00a7 11-110, when employees are wrongfully terminated, and subsequently reinstated. The court failed to address the interim earnings finding. For the following reasons, we agree with ALJ Spencer and reverse the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In respect to statutory interpretation and construction, as Chief Judge Bell has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">Repeatedly, we have emphasized that \u201cthe paramount object of statutory construction is the ascertainment and effectua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>tion of the real intention of the Legislature.\u201d In seeking to ascertain legislative intent, we first look to the words of the statute, viewing them \u201cin ordinary terms, in their natural meaning, in the manner in which they are most commonly understood.\u201d \u201cWhere the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning, courts do not normally look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent.\u201d Nor may a court under those circumstances add or delete language so as to \u201creflect an intent not evidenced in that language,\u201d or construe the statute with \u201c \u2018forced or subtle interpretations\u2019 that limit or extend its application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">Only when the statutory language is unclear and ambiguous, will courts look to other sources, such as the legislative history. We neither add words to, nor delete words from, a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature chose to use, and we do not engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning. Moreover, whenever possible, the statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory. And a statute is to be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">We have acknowledged that in determining a statute\u2019s meaning, courts may consider the context in which a statute appears, including related statutes and, even when a statute is clear, its legislative history. We have cautioned, however, that this inquiry is \u201cin the interest of completeness,\u201d \u201cto look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account.\u201d That inquiry, in other words, we emphasized in <em>Chase, </em>\u201cis a confirmatory process; it is not undertaken to contradict the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d (\u201ca court may not as a general rule surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or insert exceptions not made by the legislature.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>Western Corr. Inst v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 140-43, 807 A.2d 32 (2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The statute at issue here is Md.Code (1997 Repl.Vol., 2005 Supp.), State Pers. &amp; Pens. \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(d), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">(d)(1) Except as otherwise provided by this subtitle, the Office of Administrative Hearings may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">(i) uphold the disciplinary action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">(ii) rescind or modify the disciplinary action taken and restore to the employee any lost time, compensation, status, or benefits; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">(iii) order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">1. reinstatement to the position that the employee held</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">at dismissal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">2. full back pay; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">3. both 1 and 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">Our examination of the language of this statute leads us to conclude that the words are plain, and their meaning, unambiguous. The powers of an administrative law judge under these circumstances are limited to these actions, no more, no less. Upon an appeal to OAH, the judge may decide upon any of these actions. ALJ Spencer, emphasizing the legislature\u2019s use of \u201cor,\u201d decided that due to the rescission of Reier\u2019s wrongful termination, he was entitled to both reinstatement and full back pay under subsection (d)(l)(iii)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">We reject the circuit court\u2019s reading of the subsection, or the statute as a whole, ascribing to that provision the intendment by the legislature to include benefits in the reinstatement of terminated employees receiving full back pay. A fair reading of section (d) indicates that the legislature granted the judge the power to restore benefits under a different option. The legislature could have placed that language under subsection (iii), but for its reasons, clearly did not. The court\u2019s interpretation amounts to a forced interpretation, which is impermissible under statutory construction principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">Because of the unambiguous language of the statute, we are not required to look at the legislative history; we shall, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>however, briefly address the interim earnings issue. When the General Assembly enacted the State Personnel Management System Reform Act of 1996, it sought to provide procedures for many issues significant to our analysis, specifically, disciplinary actions, termination and reinstatement. On the road to becoming an enrolled and enacted bill, there were only two provisions that were deleted from the drafts of subsection (d). The deletion of concern to us on this appeal is the omission from subsection (d)(l)(iii)(2) ordering full back pay, \u201c... with a deduction for interim earnings from employment elsewhere or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence.\u201d The fact that the passage in quotation marks was deleted demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intent to award the wrongfully terminated employee back pay in its entirety. Although not considered by the court, we shall affirm the ALJ\u2019s finding concerning this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">This deletion also highlights the fact that the legislature used the term \u201cpay\u201d to mean monetary or financial earnings. The deleted passage mentions nothing of a possible deduction for interim benefit coverage that a terminated employee may have received from another employer between the period of termination and reinstatement. The deletion manifests the legislature\u2019s intent to separate awarding back pay from restoring benefits, as it does between subsections (ii) and (iii). Consequently, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision on this issue, and order the circuit court to issue a revised memorandum and order affirming the ALJ\u2019s reinstatement and award of full back pay for Reier.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm, in full, the decision of ALJ Spencer, and reverse only the circuit court\u2019s decision concerning the full back pay finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.
