J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A4qH\">A writ of <em>certiorari </em>was allowed by the former Supreme Court on April 2, 1948, to review an ordinance of the Borough of Moonachie entitled, \u201cAn ordinance to license and regulate trailer camps and camp sites within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the Borough of Moonachie and to provide penalties for the violation thereof.\u201d The ordinance was adopted September 17, 1947, and amended December 11, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"> It is conceded that the ordinance imposes a license fee for revenue; that the power of the municipality to impose a license fee for revenue upon a business or occupation depends upon a grant of such power by the legislature; and that the only statutes granting such power are <em>R. S. </em>40:52-1 and 40:52-2. We examine the law as it existed at the times in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\"><em>R. S. </em>40:52-2 authorized the governing body of the municipality to fix the fees for all licenses granted under <em>R. S. </em>40:52-1 and provided that such fees \u201cmay be imposed for revenue.\u201d <em>R. S. </em>40:52-1 provided: \u201cThe governing body may make, amend, repeal and enforce ordinances to license and regulate,\u201d followed by twelve subsections, each containing descriptions of businesses and occupations subject to such licensing and regulation. The municipality claims that the power to enact this ordinance was granted by subsection (a), by subsection (d) and by subsection (g) of <em>R. S. </em>40:52-1. That neither subsection (a) nor subsection (d) granted such power, is so obvious as not to require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Subsection (g), in pertinent part, provided: \u201cLumber and coal yards, stores for the sale of meats, groceries and provisions, dry goods and merchandise, and goods and chattels of every kind, <em>and all other hinds of business conducted in the municipality other than herein mentioned, and the places and premises in or at which the business is conducted and carried on; </em>* * *\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The municipality argues that the grant of power to enact this ordinance is contained in the language of subsection (g) italicized above, and cites <em>Independent Warehouses, Inc., v. Scheele, </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>133 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1946); <em>Prinz v. Paramus, </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>72 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1938); affirmed on opinion below, 121 <em>N. J. L. </em>585 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1939), and <em>Becker v. Pickersgill, </em>105 <em>N. J. L. </em>51 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1928), as holding that authority is thereby granted to license for revenue all businesses not specifically mentioned in the rest of the section. The prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>cutor argues that the language italicized above is a grant limited to businesses of the same class or general character as the named or described businesses preceding, under the doctrine of <em>ejusdem </em>generis, and that this construction effectuates the legislative intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><em>R. S. </em>40:52\u20141 had its origin in <em>P. L. </em>1917, c. 97 and c. 152. The language of subsection (g), quoted above, was added by amendment in P. <em>L. </em>1918, c. 252, to the long list of businesses then subject to license for revenue. The fact that the Legislature chose to add specifically named or described businesses together with the italicized general language, instead of simply using one compendious expression to include all businesses and occupations, strongly suggests that the general language was used in the light of the <em>ejusdem generis </em>doctrine. But stronger evidence of the legislative intent is the fact that, in the very same enactment of 1918, another subsection, namely, subsection (c), was also amended so as to add \u201cautomobile garages\u201d to the other businesses mentioned therein. Since 1918 the section has been further amended, from time to time, to include other businesses as the need appeared. Thus, present subsection (b) was added by <em>P. L. </em>1920, c. 89; present subsection (i) by P. <em>L. </em>1926, <em>c.</em> 113; \u201ctransient merchants\u201d by P. <em>L. </em>1927, c. 280; \u201cmotor vehicle junk dealers\u201d and \u201cdealers in second-hand motor vehicles and parts thereof\u201d by P. <em>L. </em>1929, c. 215; \u201creal estate brokers engaged in selling at auction or real estate auctioneers licensed by the New Jersey Real Estate Commission\u201d by P. <em>L. </em>1941, c. 92; present subsection (j) by P. <em>L. </em>1944, <em>c. </em>245; and after the enactment of the ordinance under review and the allowance of the writ in this case, \u201ctrailer camps and camp sites\u201d was added to subsection (d) by <em>P. L. </em>1948, c. 425. This history makes the legislative intent clear and the italicized language must be limited in meaning to businesses similar in nature to the businesses enumerated by the preceding specific words. <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction (3rd ed.), </em>\u00a7 4909. Trailer camps and camp sites are not similar in nature to the businesses enumerated by the preceding specific words in subsection (g), and therefore the general language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>italicized above granted no power to enact the ordinance under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">In the <em>Independent Warehouse case, </em>above, the business involved was that of a warehouse for the storage of coal, and apparently considered as a \u201ccoal yard,\u201d which is one of the specifically named businesses in subsection (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In the <em>Prinz case, </em>above, the ordinance was upheld as an exercise of the police power and not of the taxing power, as clearly indicated by the excerpt cited by the municipality t</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">\u201cThe authority permitting the municipal corporation to pass an ordinance regulating dog kennels within its territorial limits is amply provided for in the New Jersey Municipalities act. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>pp. </em>319 <em>et seq. Article </em>14, <em>section </em>2 <em>and article </em>15, <em>section </em>1 <em>(d), Pamph. L. </em>1918, <em>p. </em>959. By virtue of the police power so granted the municipality may pass any reasonable regulation of any business the unrestrained pursuit of which \u2019 might affect injuriously the public health or safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Article 14, section 2 of the Home Rule Act, cited and relied on to support the ordinance, is the section authorizing the passage of ordinances under the police power (now <em>R. S. </em>40:48-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The <em>Becker case, </em>above, involved an ordinance providing for the examination and registration of electricians and fixing fees therefor. The ordinance could be and was upheld as a proper exercise of the police power. We consider the court\u2019s reliance upon the language of subsection (g), as quoted above, unnecessary to the decision and the construction thereof too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">The ordinance under review is set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
