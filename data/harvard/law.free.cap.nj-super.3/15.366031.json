They appealed to the Passaic County Board of Taxation for a reduction of $800 in the assessment; the County Board affirmed. A further appeal was taken to the Division of Tax Appeals and the assessment ivas again affirmed. Appeal was then taken to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The appendix contains only the decision of the Division, the judgment of affirmance, and a short statement by appellants designated \u201cErrata in Decision of Commissioners,\u201d which alleges that one fact statement in the decision is contrary to the testimony. Each question raised by appellants requires, for its determination, a reading of the pertinent part of the testimony taken before the Division of Tax Appeals. The brief of appellants throughout refers to page numbers which we assume to be references to page numbers of the stenographic transcript filed with the clerk of the Superior Court. <em>Rule </em>1:3-2(f) requires appellants to furnish an appendix which \u201cshall contain such parts of the record material to the questions presented as the appellant desires the court to read.\u201d The appendix fails to meet this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
