Wilson, the plaintiff, a duly licensed pilot for the port of New York, on July 34,1870, offered his services to the schooner H. H. Thompson, then bound to said port.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-9\">At the time of the offer the schooner was not far from Barnegat, and, it was claimed, not on pilotage ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-10\">The evidence as to the position of the vessel, and also as to the limits of pilotage ground, was conflicting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-11\">The master of the vessel, on being hailed, replied that he would want a pilot \u2018 \u2018 when th.ey got on pilotage ground but kept his course, and though the pilot-boat followed a short time, the vessel entered port without a pilot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-12\">This suit was brought against Stephen H. Mills &amp; John L. Merrill, agents and consignees of the vessel, for the pilotage fees. On the trial defendants moved for a nonsuit, on the grounds, 1. That the action should have been by the commissioners of pilots. 3. That plaintiff\u2019s testimony showed no refusal such as is contemplated by the act. 3. That the master was not bound to accept the offer at the time it was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-13\">The motion was denied, and judgment rendered for plaintiff; and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-14\">D. <em>&amp; T. </em>McMahon, for defendants, appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Thomas H. </em>Hubbard, for plaintiffs, respondents,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8\">I. The pilot fees belong to the pilot, and he alone can sne.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">II. The facts clearly constitute an offer and refusal, under the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">III. The preponderance of evidence shows that the offer was made on pilotage ground, and the fact that the master did not suppose that he h\u00b0ad then reached it is no defense. Cisco <em>v. </em>Roberts (36 <em>N. Y., </em>292), is decisive against the objection that the refusal was beyond the jurisdiction of the State (citing, also, <em>Story on Confl. of L., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 620-625 ; Scoville <em>v. </em>Canfield, 14 <em>Johns., </em>338; Van Schaick <em>v. </em>Edwards, 2 <em>Johns. Cas., </em>355 ; 1 <em>Kent Com., </em>*368, and 406, 9 ed. ; <em>Vattel's Law of N., </em>128, ed. of 1854, \u00a7 289). And the cases of Steamship Company <em>v. </em>Joliffe (2 <em>Wall., </em>450), and Henderson <em>v. </em>Spofford <em>(Ante, </em>140), are decisive of the constitutionality of the New York statute.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b161-8\">Larremore, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQh\">The act to amend the pilot laws, passed April 3, 1857 <em>(Laws of </em>1857, ch. 243, \u00a7 29), provides that\u00a3\u00a3 all vessels sailing under register, bound to,or from the port of New York, by the way of Sandy Hook, shall take a licensed pilot, or in case of refusal to take such pilot the master shall himself or the owner or consignee shall pay the said pilotage as if one had been employed, and such pilotage shall be paid to the pilot first speaking or offering his services to such vessel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">It was alleged in the complaint, and not denied by the answer, that plaintiff was the <em>first </em>pilot who offered his services to said vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">This disposes of one of the questions raised by the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">That the conduct of the master amounted to a refusal within the act can admit of but little doubt; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Ms misapprehension as to the location of pilot ground, would not bar plaintiff\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The main question presented is whether the master was bound to accept plaintiff\u2019s services at the time they were offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Nothing appears in the case to show that \u201c pilot ground\u201d is clearly defined and prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">On the trial witnesses differed as to the precise location, and the testimony on the point being conflicting, the decision of the question thereon cannot be reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">But it is claimed on the part of the appellant (under the authority of Peterson <em>v. </em>Walsh, 1 Daly, 182), that the place where such offer and refusal were made, being more than a marine league beyond the State lines, the court has no jurisdiction in the premises; that the action being for a penalty under the law of the State, and strictly local in its character, there can be no recovery for an offense under it committed beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Since that decision was rendered, the case of Cisco <em>v. </em>Roberts (36 <em>N. Y., </em>292), has been determined by the court of appeals, wherein it was held that this question \u201cis not an issue as to the relative boundaries of State and Federal jurisdiction,\u201d that \u201cthe regulations of port pilotage stand substantially on the same footing with our quarantine laws,\u201d and that \u201cit is the right and duty of the State, by appropriate legislation to guard the public health, and the security of general commerce, and to provide against the dangers to which every maritime people are exposed, by intercepting and averting them <em>on the sea without the bounds of exclusive territorial </em>dominion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">The board of commissioners of pilots are empowered by section 12 of said act, to make, promulgate, and enforce new rules and regulations not inconsistent with the laws of tMs State or of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u2022It would appear, therefore, that a pilot in pursuance of such rules and regulations might lawfully claim pilotage for services rendered beyond the territorial limits of State jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Thus, the exercise of such right, as well as the correction of its abuse, are dependent upon the legislation of the board of commissioners of pilots.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">That such was the intention of the act in question, the decision in Cisco <em>v. </em>Roberts fairly indicates.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The judgment appealed from must be affirmed with costs. '</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Charles P. Daly, Ch. J., and J. F. Daly, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
