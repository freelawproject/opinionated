Lindsley and Isaac B. Cotterell, to recover the amount of thirteen promissory notes, made by the European Petroleum Company, to the order of L. E. Lahens, and indorsed by Lahens to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-11\">The answer of the defendants was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-12\">\u201cThe defendants come into court, and answering the complaint of plaintiffs, admit the making, indorsement, transfer and delivery of the said notes, and <em>deny the other allegations therein contained </em>/\u2019 \u2019 and then proceeded to set forth an affirmative defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-13\">Upon atrial before a referee, the defendants\u2019 counsel proposed to open the case, and insisted on his right so to do, on the ground that the burden of the proof was on the defendant, and that the affirmative was with them. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected, and claimed that he was entitled to open and close the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-14\">The referee decided that the plaintiff was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>open and close the case; to which decision defendants\u2019 counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-5\">The counsel for plaintiffs thereupon opened the case, produced the promissory notes mentioned in the complaint, and rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-6\">The referee having decided in favor of plaintiffs, the defendants appealed to the general term, upon the foregoing and other exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-7\"><em>Frederic R. Coudert, </em>for appellant, argued as follows, on the point above suggested :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-8\">The referee erred in his ruling to the effect that the plaintiffs were entitled to open and close.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-9\">I. The defendants specifically admitted all the facts in the complaint contained, that were necessary to the recovery of plaintiffs, viz: \u201cthe making, indorsement, transfer, delivery and non-payment\u201d of the notes in suit. The subsequent denial was manifestly intended to dispute the lawfulness of the claim, and nothing more. If the affirmative defense in the answer was established on the trial, then the plaintiffs were not the lawful owners of the notes in suit, and the defendants were not justly indebted on the notes. If no affirmative defense was proven, then the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment, without any proof whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-10\">II. It being clear that the affirmative was with the defendants, we submit that the error of the learned referee, in denying them their right to open and close, is a subject of review by the appellate court, and that the defendants on this ground alone are entitled to a new trial (Huntington <em>v. </em>Conkey, approved in <em>31 N. Y., </em>614; 33 <em>Barb., </em>218 ; and see Davis <em>v. </em>Mason, 4 <em>Pick., </em>158; Brooks <em>v. </em>Barrett, 7 <em>Id., </em>98; 8 <em>Metc., </em>563; Rolum <em>v. </em>Hanson, 11 <em>Cush., </em>44; Hoxie <em>v. </em>Green, 37 <em>How. Pr., </em>97).</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-11\">III. Nor is it for the defendant to show that the error of the referee prejudiced him. It is for the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>tiff to prove the negative of that proposition (Green <em>v. </em>White, 37 <em>N. Y., </em>405).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-5\"><em>George C. Genet </em>and <em>James C. </em>Carter, for respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKX\">Argued that the denial of \u201call other allegations \u201d was sufficient to entitle plaintiffs to the affirmative, and moreover that it was a question within the discretion of the referee, and his ruling thereon would not be reviewed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b125-6\">By the Court. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014Ingraham, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABn\">We must decline to look into the other exceptions in the case; but as the referee erred in not allowing defendants to open and close the case, the judgment must accordingly be reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Order accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-14\"> Present, Ingraham, P.
