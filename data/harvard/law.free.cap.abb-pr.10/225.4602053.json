To the first indictment the defendant pleaded guilty of an assault and battery, and was sentenced to four months\u2019 imprisonment on October 23,1858. On Rovember 5, 1858, a notice was given of a motion for a new trial, and on Rovember 15, 1859, an order was made,in the General Sessions, by Russell, City Judge, that the conviction and the sentence upon conviction be quashed, and that the order of imprisonment be revoked, \u201c said indictment having been on the same day\u201d <em>(i. e., </em>the day of its finding), \u201c by operation of the statute, superseded and quashed by the filing of another indictment for the same matter, although charged as robbery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-10\">From this order of City Judge Russell the People appealed to the General Term of the Supreme Court by a writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-11\"><em>N.

On the same day, at a later hour, an indictment for robbery in the first degree, was found against the same person, for the same act or matter for which the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>indictment was found. On the 4th October, 1858, Barry was arraigned on the indictment first found, and then pleaded guilty of assault and battery; and upon that plea was, on 23d October, 1858, sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary for the term of four months. On the 5th November, 1858, a motion was made in Sessions, on the said indictments and other papers, for a new trial, on the ground of irregularity in the proceedings, and on the merits; and on 15th November, 1858, that court ordered that said conviction and sentence be quashed, and the order of imprisonment to the Sheriff thereon be revoked and annulled, \u201c for the irregularity of taking the same on the indictment found May 21, 1858, against the said Richard Barry, charging him with an assault and battery, with intent to kill one Philip Wolfe, said indictment having been on the same day, by operation of the statute, superseded and quashed by the filing of another indictment for the same matter, although charged as the offence of robbery.\u201d This last order of Sessions is now brought before this court, by writ of error, for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The counsel for Barry move to quash the writ of error as unauthorized by law. In the case of The People <em>a. </em>Corning (2 Comst., 9), decided in December, 1848, the Court of Appeals dismissed the writ of error on the ground that writ of error to that court would not then lie in behalf of the People after judgment for the defendant in a criminal case; and, in the opinion in that case, Judge Bronson also expresses the opinion that the writ in behalf of the People would not be from the Sessions to Supreme Court. By the act of 22d March, 1852 <em>(laws of </em>1852, 76, ch. 82), it is enacted that \u201cwrits of error to review any judgment rendered, in favor of any defendant, upon any indictment for a criminal offence (except after acquittal by a jury), may be brought in behalf of the People,\u201d &amp;c., on being allowed by a Justice of the Supreme Court. In this case, the judgment of the court below was rendered on 23d October, 1858, on conviction by confession, that Barry be imprisoned in the penitentiary four months. Afterwards it was, by the Court of Sessions, on motion, ordered that said conviction and sentence be quashed for irregularity, &amp;c. In my opinion, this order or decision of the Court of Sessions, on motion, was not a judgment rendered upon the indictment, within the meaning and intent of the act of 1852. The motion to quash the writ of error should consequently be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u2022 The order of the Court of Sessions sought to be reviewed, was by that court founded on 2 Rev. Stat., 726, \u00a7 42, which is .in the following words: \u201c If there be, at any term, pending against the same defendant, two indictments for the same offence, or two indictments for the same matter, although charged as different of-fences, the indictment first found shall be deemed to be superseded by such second indictment, and shall be quashed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In this case, two indictments for the same matter, but charged as different offences, were on the same day (21st May, 1858), v found against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Afterwards, on the 4th October, 1858, on being arraigned in the first indictment, which was for the minor offence, by leave of the court and consent of the district-attorney, he pleaded guilty of an offence less than that charged, and, on that conviction by confession, sentence was pronounced on 23d October, 1858.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The statute is clear and positive, and there can be no question that, on the finding of the second indictment, the defendant was entitled to have the first indictment quashed. But the statute does not say that the first indictment shall, on the finding of the second, become void, so that no trial or conviction thereupon can afterwards be had by confession, or otherwise. Some action by the court, on motion, in behalf of the accused, or otherwise, to put that indictment out of the way, was evidently intended, and an order of the court was necessary to quash it.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">From the case as it now appears, it is a legitimate conclusion that this defendant preferred a conviction by confession, on the indictment for the minor offence, in its mitigated form, to the hazard of a conviction by the jury, on trial of the indictment for the greater offence, and acted accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">In my opinion, it was competent for him to waive the provision of the statute in 1ms favor, and I think he has clearly and advisedly done so; and that after his confession, he had no right to claim the benefit of the statute which he had so waived. The cases of the- People <em>a. </em>Monroe (Oyer and Terminer, 20 <em>Wend., </em>108), is direct authority on this point. If, however, I am right in the conclusion first stated, we have no power to correct the error committed by the court below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-12\"> Present, Sgtherland, Bonney, and Allen, JJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
