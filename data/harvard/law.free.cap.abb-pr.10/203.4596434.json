The time to answer expired January 16,1860. On that day defendants\u2019 attorney, at Troy, obtained an order extending the time to answer twenty days, and duly served such answer by mail; that is, by depositing the same in the post-office at Troy, directed to plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, at Hew York, and paying postage. The order was not received by plaintiff\u2019s attorneys until 18th January, after they had, on that morning, entered judgment in the action, and issued execution, and they then gave defendants\u2019 attorneys notice that the papers so served would be disregarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-10\"><em>J. Francis Walton, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A88\">I. Under sections 410 and 411 of the Code, the service was valid, even though th\u00e9 papers served were deposited in the post-office after the closing of the mail on the last day. (Noble <em>a. </em>Trotter, 4 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>322.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-11\">II. This motion is made as a matter of right and not of favor, and affidavits showing that the order extending time was improvidently granted are inadmissible.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>James W.

(after stating the facts).</author>\n<p id=\"AbY\">\u2014The motion must, I think, be granted. The service of the order was regular, and in time to stay plaintiff\u2019s proceedings, although not received until two days afterwards, and after judgment had been regularly and properly entered, according to all information which plaintiff\u2019s attorneys then had. The defendants show no cause why earlier attention to the action was not given, and there is reasonable ground, at least, for believing that-their object was delay. Still they were strictly regular <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 410, 411), and entitled to the benefit of the order, on receipt of which plaintiff\u2019s attorneys should, I think, have moved to vacate it, or have opened the judgment and waited for an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Motion granted, with $10 costs, to abide the event of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
