Plaintiff is entitled to the items in question as matter of right, under Code, section 307, subdivision <em>5, </em>alone, which provides, \u201cWhen allowed, costs <em>shall </em>be as follows.\u201d Subdivision 5 of the same section fixes the amount of costs as follows: \u201c <em>To either party on appeal, </em>except to the court of appeals, and except appeals in the cases mentioned in subdivisions 1, 3, 4 and 5 of section 349, and except in cases mentioned in the second paragraph of section 344, <em>before argument, twenty dollars ; for argument, forty dollars.\u201d . . . . </em>The costs here claimed by plaintiff arose on an appeal, and that appeal was not one of those excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\">II. Plaintiff is also entitled to the disputed items under subdivision 2 of section 349, the appeals mentioned in which, not being excepted, are embraced within the provisions of subdivision 5 of section 307 (above quoted). The first clause of section 349 reads as follows : \u201cAn appeal may in like manner, and within the same time, be taken from an order made at a special term, by a single judge of the same court or county, .or a special county judge, or by a recorder, or by any recorder\u2019s court of any city, in any stage of the action, including proceedings supplementary to the execution ; and may be thereupon reviewed in the following cases: (1.) \u201c. . . . (2.) When it grants or refuses a new trial, or when it sustains or overrules a demurrer.\u201d We have punctuated the above quotation as we find it in the editions of the annotated Code, from 1864 to 1870 ; which we submit gives the meaning intended by the legislature. A fanciful interpretation was suggested below, based, we suppose, on the funny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>punctuation of the Session Laws of 1862. For the convenience of the court we quote this part of the section from the Session Laws of 1851 and 1862: 1851. \u201cAn appeal may in like manner and within the same time, be taken from an order made at a special term or by a single judge of the same court, or a county or a special county judge, in any stage of the action, including proceedings supplementary to the execution, and may be thereupon reviewed in the following cases : \u201d 1862. \u201c An appeal may in like manner, and within the same time, be taken from an order made at a special term by a single judge of the same court, or county, or a special county judge, \u201c or by a recorder, or by any recorder\u2019s court of any city,\u201d in any stage of the action, including proceedings supplementary to the execution, and may be thereupon reviewed in the following cases : \u201d The meaning we submit is plain, though the punctuation is erroneous. If we adopt the strained construction suggested by defendant, it implies that the legislature supposed\u2014(1.) That a special term might be held by more than \u201ca single judge.\u201d (2.) That the judge or judges holding the special term might be of another court. (3.) Or, indeed, be held by a county or special county judge! \u201cAn order made at a special term,\u201d and an \u201corder made by a single judge,\u201d had each a well defined meaning, and had the legislature meant what defendant claims, it might as well have amplified the reference to the single judge by insisting that he should be a counselor at law, as that a special term should be held by a single judge. See the case of Ahern <em>v. </em>Standard Life Ins.Co., 9 <em>Abb. Pr. N. </em>S., 69, allowing like costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-5\"><em>Charles E. </em>Woodbury, for defendant, appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeO\">The Code (subd. 5, \u00a7 307) does not authorize costs before and for argument on appeals from orders denying motions for new trials made upon the judge\u2019s min <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>utes. Such costs are allowed by that subdivision only on appeals from orders denying mptions for new trial upon a <em>case made, </em>which can only be at special term (\u00a7 307, subd. <em>&amp;). </em>The omission from the exceptions in subdivision 5, section 307, of subdivision 3 of section 349 of the Code, does not help the plaintiff, for the reason that the appeal allowed by subdivision 2 of section 349 is from an order made <em>at a special term by a single judge of the same </em>court, <em>when it grants or refuses a new trial </em>(\u00a7 349). The omission of that subdivision from the exceptions in subdivision 5, section 307, was because such costs were expressly granted in the latter part of the same subdivision, and they did not desire to grant the same costs twice (See \u25a0 subd. 5, \u00a7 307). There is no comma in section 349, between the words \u201cspecial term \u201d and the words \u201c by a,\u201d as appears in Yoorhies\u2019 edition of the Code. See <em>Laws of </em>1863, ch. 460, \u00a7 32, when the phraseology was changed to what it now is. See certificate of secretary of state presented herewith. Prior to 1863, section 307 excepted all appeals in cases provided by section 349, but authorized appeal costs \u201cas\u201d for a new trial on a case made; which word created diversities of opinion as to such costs. Section 349 at that time authorized appeals from orders denying new trials \u201cmade at a special term, or. by a single judge.\u201d If the same phraseology existed <em>now, </em>the appeal costs would be taxable, because the order denying a new trial, made upon the judge\u2019s minutes would be \u201cby a single judge.\u201d But in <em>Laws of </em>1863, ch. 460, \u00a7 33, that section was changed to what it now is by striking out the comma and the word \u201cor,\u201d so that the appeals now authorized by that subdivision are those from orders made at a <em>special term </em>by a single judge. By the Constitution of 1846, Art., 6, \u00a7 6, special terms might have been held by <em>one </em>or <em>more </em>justices, and I suppose that no appeal could have been taken under section 349, if the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>term had been composed of more than one judge. The change made in section 349 by striking out the comma and the word \u201c or,\u201d and the change of the word \u201cas\u201d in subdivision 5, section 307 to the word \u201cor,\u201d compelled in the latter subdivision the omission from the exceptions from appeal costs, of subdivision <em>2 </em>of section 349, because appeals allowed by subdivision <em>2 </em>of section 349 were expressly provided for by the change of the \u201cas\u201d to the word \u201cor\u201d in subdivision 5, section 307. All the cases cited by appellant as .to such costs being allowed, are on appeals from orders made at special term on a case made. The appellant having taxed his costs as allowed by the order appealed from, and entered judgment therefor, has lost his right to appeal (Radway <em>v. </em>Graham, 4 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S, </em>468).</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-14\"> Otherwise in the New York superior court (see Matthews v.
