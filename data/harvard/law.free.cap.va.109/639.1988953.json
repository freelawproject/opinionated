Whereupon, the plaintiff suggested that the garnishee had not fully answered, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>jury was impaneled to inquire whether the amount in the hands of the Exchange Bank was the property of the defendant, the White and Bumsey Grain Company, or of the Chicago hank.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">At the conclusion of the testimony for the plaintiff on that issue, the Exchange Bank demurred to the evidence, and to a judgment sustaining the demurrer this writ of error was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The first assignment of error involves the action of the court in compelling the plaintiff to join in the demurrer to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The plaintiff insists that it had an absolute right to a trial by jury under the statute of which it was deprived by the court\u2019s action in requiring it to join in the demurrer. But that assignment is founded on a misconception of the office of a demurrer to evidence. It does not invade the province of the jury as triers of disputed facts, but, assuming that the. evidence demurred to is true, the court is called on to determine whether such evidence as a matter of law warrants a judgment for the demurree. In other words, it is a supervisory power over jury trials invoked and exercised by the courts whose duty it is to decide questions of law arising upon undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In 6 Eney. of Pleading and Practice, 439, it is said: \u201cThere is nothing in this practice which is in contravention of jury trial.\u201d Citing <em>Hopkins </em>v. Nashville, <em>&amp;c. Ry. </em>Co., 96 Tenn. 409, 34 S. W. 1029, 32 L. R. A. 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">That case contains an exhaustive review of the authorities, and shows that the practice obtains in about one-half of the States of the Union, while in the United States courts and the courts of other States much more drastic methods prevail, such as directing verdicts and ordering non-suits. The practice has come down to us from the common law and is too thoroughly embedded in our jurisprudence to admit of serious question.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">The next assignment ascribes error to the ruling of the court in sustaining the demurrer to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>As remarked, the sole issue of fact was whether the avails of the draft in the hands of the Exchange Bank were the property of the White and Rumsey Grain Company, or of the Chicago bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The Negotiable Instrument Act (Va. Code, 1904, see. 28'41a, 24), declares that \u201cevery negotiable instrument is deemed <em>prima facie </em>to have been issued for a valuable consideration, and every person whose signature appears thereon to have become a party thereto for value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The Lynchburg Milling Company can stand on no higher ground in respect to this litigation than the maker of the draft, the White and Rumsey Grain Company, would have occupied at the suit of the Chicago bank. In either case, under the statute, the Chicago bank would <em>prima facie </em>be deemed a holder for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In addition to this <em>prima facie </em>presumption, the Lynchburg Milling Company put in evidence a letter written by the White and Rumsey Grain Company to the Exchange Bank, in which it expressly declares that the fund in controversy is \u201cthe property, not of our company, but of your correspondent, the Continental National Bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In the case of <em>Oeters v. Knights of Honor, </em>98 Va. 201, 205-206, 35 S. E. 356, in discussing the effect of certain letters from the defendant to the plaintiff, Keith, P., in delivering the opinion of the court, observes: \u201cThey could not have been introduced by the defendant, but when offered by the plaintiff were, of course, admitted. The statements made in them were clearly relevant to the issue before the jury, are uncontradicted by any evidence in the record, and are, therefore, to be taken as tending to prove the facts stated in them. We need not undertake to measure and define their exact probative force and effect. It is enough that they are declarations of the defendant offered by the plaintiff, and are germane to the issue.\u201d Citing <em>Downer &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>2 Gratt. 238, 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In this state of the case the burden rested upon the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>to prove that the White and Bumsey Grain Company was the owner of the fund and that the Chicago hank held the draft, not for value, hut for- collection merely. If that had been the true theory of the case, the Chicago bank would have had no interest in concealing the fact and the deposition of one of its officers would have put the question at rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The plaintiff,.however, did not undertake to disprove the <em>\u25a0prims facie </em>title of the Chicago bank by direct evidence, but chose rather to rely on certain circumstances as tending to sustain its contention. Eor instance, it was said that the Chicago bank had not asserted claim to the fund or employed counsel to maintain it. But the fact must not be lost sight of that the bank was not a party to the litigation, and, doubless, preferred to leave the defense to the White and Bumsey Grain Company, which -was a party, and would have been liable over to the payee in the event the fund was held subject to the plaintiff\u2019s attachment. In its correspondence with the Exchange Bank, the Chicago bank uniformly claimed the proceeds of the draft, and acted under the advice of counsel in Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Our attention has also been called to- the circumstances, that the drawers waived protest and notice, and that after the draft had been dishonored and returned to the Chicago bard!;, the plaintiff wrote the defendant to return the draft and it would be promptly honored. When the draft came back the second time, there was a slip attached with a pencil memorandum bearing the initials of the White and Bumsey Grain Company, \u201cplease send back and present againand also, that the Chicago bank stamped on the bill of lading that it was neither responsible for the quantity, quality nor delivery of the goods, and indorsed the draft without recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We do not regard these circumstances inconsistent with the Chicago bank\u2019s <em>bona fide </em>ownership of the draft. The drawer, a wholesale grain company, resided in Chicago and the draft was drawn on a customer in a distant State. In the event the draft was not paid, the Chicago bank would have had ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>recourse against the drawer; and it seems to us that its action was not incompatible with ordinary business methods and the dictates of common prudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Lastly, the ruling of the court in excluding certain correspondence between the Lynchburg Milling Company and the 'White and Bumsev Grain Company is made the ground of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The excluded letters if admissible possessed very little probative value and could not have affected the result, so that the error, if error there was, in excluding .the letters was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Upon the whole case the judgment is plainly right and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
