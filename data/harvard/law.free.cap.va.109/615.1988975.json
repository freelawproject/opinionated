Hicks and the Galvert Mortgage and Deposit Company of Baltimore City, afterwards, to-wit, on the 2nd day of January, in the year 1907, entered into said premises and exercised acts of ownership thereon and claimed title thereto, and that they, the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>defendants, W.

Hunter to <em>V. </em>O. Cassell, trustee, which deed in a certain cause lately pending in this court, entitled Robert I. Hunter et al. <em>v. </em>Henry C. Cooper et al., wherein the said plaintiffs in this cause were plaintiffs and the defendants in this cause were defendants, was construed, and by a decree entered therein by this court on its chancery side the said plaintiffs were declared not entitled to the land set out and mentioned in the bill filed in said cause, of which the lot of land set out and mentioned in the said declaration filed in this cause is a part. The bill in said cause of Robert I. Hunter et al. <em>v. </em>Henry C. Cooper et al., the petition of the said the Calvert Mortgage and Deposit Company of Baltimore City, its answer and demurrer, the decree filing said demurrer and answer, and the final decree therein and herewith filed, marked 'Exhibit Ho. 1.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-7\">\"(B) Because, as shown by the deed aforesaid, from Isaac R. Hunter to V. O. Cassell, trustee, set out in said plaintiff\u2019s declaration, it appears that it was the intention of the said Issac R. Hunter to grant unto the said trustee for the benefit of Martha Louisa Hunter only a life interest in the land conveyed, with a power to sell by and with the co-operation and assent of the said V. O. Cassell, trustee, during her lifetime, and not to create a fee simple estate in the said Martha Louisa Hunter, and that, by signing and sealing the said deed, Martha Louisa Hunter agreed to all the provisions thereof, and that, therefore, at the ,death of said Martha Louisa Hunter under the terms, limitations, and agreements contained in the said deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>all interest of the said Martha Louisa Hunter in said land ceased and determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-5\">\u201c(C) That, under the said deed aforesaid, set out in said declaration, from Isaac E. Hunter to V. O. Cassell, trustee, Martha Louisa Hunter, under whom the plaintiffs claim, took only a life estate in the lands set out in said deed, of which the lot claimed in this cause forms a part, which life estate upon the death of the said Martha Louisa Hunter ceased and determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-6\">\u201c(D) That under the deed aforesaid set out in said declaration from Isaac E. Hunter to V. O. Cassell, trustee, the plaintiffs have no title to the land sought to be recovered in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-7\">\u201c(E) Because the said declaration does not show that the plaintiffs at the time of the filing of said declaration were entitled to recover the said lot of land set out in said declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-8\">\u201c(F) Because of the decision in the suit of Eobert-1. Hunter et al. <em>v. </em>Henry C.

Specifications \u201ca\u201d and \u201cf\u201d were overruled; \u201cb,\u201d \u201cc,\u201d \u201cd\u201d and \u201ce\u201d were sustained, and the correctness of the .judgment turns upon whether or not Martha Louisa Hunter took a fee simple or a life estate in the land conveyed to her by the deed from Isaac Hunter.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">By the deed Martha Louisa Hunter is given full power to sell and dispose of the property covered by it, \u201cand make such disposition of the proceeds of sale as she may think proper, and also through said trustee to collect the said notes, and deliver them to the makers or other proper person and dispose of their proceeds, always, however, and in all cases, with the cooperation and assent of the said V. O. Cassell, trustee, who on his part- agrees to execute such instruments as may be needful in the premises as the said Martha Louisa Hunter may direct by her becoming a party to and signing said instrument. And the said Martha Louisa Hunter may also if she think proper Avith the proceeds as aforesaid purchase other property, real or personal, through and by her said trustee, and the deed made to said trustee for her sole benefit, and to be held upon the same terms as the other property herein mentioned. If the said Martha Louisa Hunter should depart this life leaving her said husband, the grantor in this deed, surviving, then this grant as to the property then remaining is to cease and determine, but she shall have power and full authority is hereby given her by instrument in the nature of a last Avill and testament to dispose of one-half of the property .hereinbefore described or hereafter acquired as aforesaid then remaining; but if the said Isaac B.

Such intention must fail on account of its uncertainty, and the first taker acquires the absolute property.\u201d <em>Farish </em>v. <em>Wayman, </em>91 Va. 430, 21 S. E. 810, and cases there cited.
