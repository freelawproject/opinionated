On the said 20th day of January, 1907, the plaintiff in Petersburg, Yirginia, summoned, the defendant by telephone to transport the said trunk to Kichmond, Yirginia, but did not inform said company that the trunk was of unusual value. The Southern Express Company sent its agent to the residence whence the summons came, and the said agent removed the trunk from the upper floor to the lower floor of the house and there left it, saying that he would call later and take it away, but no information was asked or given said agent as to the value of the trunk and the contents. Although summoned three times to come for the trunk the Southern Express Company failed to send its agent back. Thereupon, on the 22nd day of J anuary, the plaintiff intrusted the trunk to a colored driver to be carried to the office of the express company. The said colored driver, on said 22nd day of January, delivered said trunk, which was locked, to the agent of the Southern Express Company at Petersburg. The said agent inquired of the said driver the value of said trunk. The reply of the said driver Was that he did not know. Whereupon the agent of the defendant company did receive the said trunk for transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>to Richmond, Virginia, and did issue to the said agent of the shipper the bill of lading, a copy of which is hereto attached by agreement of counsel, the original being lost by said plaintiff, which said bill of lading was accepted by the said driver, as agent of the plaintiff, and by said driver delivered to said plaintiff, with the words, value asked and not given, stamped on said bill of lading. At the time of the delivery of the said bill of lading to the agent of said shipper, he paid the agent of said defendant company, the sum of sixty-five cents, freight on said .trunk, which weighed one hundred and fifty-five pounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-4\">II.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">The contents of said truck were: underwear; one black broadcloth suit; one white broadcloth suit; one gray serge suit; one white crepe de chine dress; one black velvet hat (plumes) ; one white hat; one brown hat; two lace waists; one black silk waist; one dozen shirt waists; one black voile skirt; one black silk underskirt; one white silk underskirt; five pair of shoes; two blankets; five pillows; collection of sterling silver souvenir spoons, between six and seven dozen; manicure set; toilet articles\u2014brush, silver, mirrors, etc.; one gold chain purse; two fancy combs; gold pins; gold buttons; belt buckles; three chains; and also one case containing the following sterling silver; one dozen dinner knives, one dozen dinner forks, one dozen dessert forks, one dozen dinner knives, one dozen fruit knives, one dozen tea spoons, one dozen table spoons, one dozen dessert spoons, one butter knife, one sugar shell, one cream dipper, one meat fork.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">The rates of freight on packages shipped from Petersburg, Virginia, to Richmond, Virginia, then established and in force by the company were, for packages of less value than fifty dollars ($50.00), the sum of forty cents (40c.) per cwt.; and on packages of greater value than fifty dollars ($50.00), the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>as the above, plus the further sum of five cents (5c.) for each one hundred dollars of the value or fraction thereof. The State Corporation Commission of the State of Virginia had not yet formally promulgated or established any rates, but upon complaints by shippers as to express rates the Southern Express Company had been summoned before the commission and their rates inquired into, and the commission had not changed the same. In March, 1907, the commission promulgated it rates which were the same as those formerly promulgated, fixed and charged by the express company, and these rates are uoav in force in the State of Virginia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-4\">Hence if the true value of said trunk and its contents had been declared by the shipper or her agent, the value being four hundred dollars ($400.00) and the weight 155 pounds, the charge would haAe been sixty-five cents (65c.) according to weight, plus twenty cents (20c.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">III.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">When the trunk aboA^e mentioned Avas delivered tp the company as aforesaid, it was promptly handled and transported from Petersburg, Virginia, to Richmond, Virginia, in the manner and Avay in which packages of the knoAvn Aalue of less than fifty dollars were and usually are handled, and was, on its arrival at the latter place, promptly taken to the warehouse and office of the Southern Express Company, as is customary Avith such packages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">IV.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\">On the night of its arrival at the said warehouse, the said Avarehouse and office were destroyed by fire, together Avith a great portion of the contents thereof. The said fire was an accidental fire and was in no way caused by the negligence of the carrier nor of any of its servants or agents, and the said carrier, its agents and servants, used every reasonably possible exertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>to save from destruction the contents of the said warehouse, and office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-4\">From destruction by said fire were saved all packages delivered to the defendant express company for carriage on which a value of as much as fifty dollars had been declared by the consignors, and such packages of less value as was possible to save under the circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-5\">Before the expiration of thirty days from the time when said goods were lost, the plaintiff gave the defendant notice, in writing, of her claim for the loss of said goods and chattels.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\">V.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-7\">The method of handling packages in use on the lines of the Southern Express Company varies directly as the value of such packages, it giving more care to packages of great value than to packages of a lesser value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-8\">All packages shipped from Petersburg, Virginia, to Richmond, Virginia, of a declared value of as much as fifty dollars ($50.00) are handled and transported in the following manner:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-9\">A package being offered to the company in Petersburg, at the company\u2019s office, it is weighed, and the shipper is asked the value. The rate of freight is then fixed as above mentioned, according to the published rates, and depends on the weight and on the value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-10\">The rate being paid (or the package being sent C. O. D.), a receipt, contract or bill of lading, is issued showing the consignor, consignee, destination, origin and rate paid, the conditions and terms on which the shipment is accepted. The contract, receipt, or bill of lading in this case was in the usual form and contained the usual conditions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-11\">The package is then taken charge of by the agent of the express company, and if a value of as much as fifty dollars ($50.00 has been declared it is especially noted on an individual way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>bill showing the consignor, origin, destination, train handled on, consignee, value, rate paid, and the messenger by whom handled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-4\">This messenger is personally responsible for the package, and is charged with the duty of taking extraordinary care thereof, and with placing it in the safest possible place, if the size permits, in a fire and burglar proof safe. In case of fire, accident or other unusual danger, he is charged with the duty of saving all valuable packages first, and then other packages if possible. In case a package has been declared of an extraordinary value, a special messenger is sent in charge of the individual package.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">When the messenger in charge of a package of the value of fifty dollars ($50.00) or more, arrives at the destination of such package, or at the end of his run, he surrenders the package only when he has been given a written individual receipt for the said package, said receipt being signed by the person receiving said package.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">In cases of all packages on which a value of as much as fifty dollars ($50.00) is declared, every agent and servant of the express company who handles the packages knows the value so declared, knows that there is a written proof that the said package is in his hands, and knows that he must not surrender the said,, package under any consideration unless he has received like written proof of him to whom he delivers it. In case of all packages of the declared value of fifty dollars ($50.00), every possible precaution is taken for their safety. This necessitates a more costly method of handling by the company of those valuable packages than is used in the handling and transportation of packages of small value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-7\">Packages of small value are handled in the following more economical manner:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-8\">A package is offered the company, at its office, at point of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>shipment, and the package weighed and valued as above described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-4\">The rate is then fixed as above with regard to weight and value. All packages on which a value of less than fifty dollars ($50.00) has been declared are then noted on the general way bill, which show point of shipment, consignee and destination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">Such packages are not handled- individually, in that they are cheeked only in the general run, that is, when arriving at destination or end of the messenger\u2019s run, they are called off by one messenger and checked by the other. Due care is used but not the unusual and extraordinary care that is expended on packages of greater value. Ho individual receipt for each package is taken, but a receipt for the general cargo is taken, and the way bills show what articles are included therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-6\">In case of fire or of attack or of any extraordinary danger the messenger\u2019s instructions and duty are to care first for the packages of greatest value, then for those of greater declared value than fifty dollars ($50.00), and then for those of less value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-7\">Every messenger or other servant or agent can look at his way bills and see exactly what packages are of a value of fifty dollars or more and exactly what the value of each of these has been declared to be. All messengers or other agents or servants of the defendant company know that packages on which no value has been declared \u00e1re of less than fifty dollars of value, and that the freight rate paid on such packages has been secured on such low value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-8\">Every messenger knows that it is his duty as above described to pay every attention, ordinary and extraordinary, to the safety of the valuable packages, and to use every reasonable care to insure the safety of the packages of low value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-9\">Every messenger or other servant of the company is chargeable personally with all losses occurring while the package lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>is in his custody and control, unless such loss can be properly explained as unavoidable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-4\">\n<em>Oopy of Bill of Lading.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\">Read this contract,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">SOUTHERN EXPRESS COMPANY.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-7\">Domestic Bill of Lading.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-8\">Not Negotiable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-9\">Petersburg, Va., January 22, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-10\">Received of <em>Balnn M</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-11\">Value asked and not given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-12\">One trunk.

E. 35, in which an opinion was handed down at the present term. Both cases arose under the concluding sentence of the first paragraph of section 1294c (24), Ya. Code, 1904, which provides, that \u201cno contract, receipt, rule, or regulation shall exempt any such common carrier, railroad or transportation company from the liability of a common carrier which would exist had no contract been made or entered! into.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">An express company is declared to be a \u201ctransportation company,\u201d by our statute, and is, therefore, expressly included in the foregoing enactment. Section 1294a (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The fundamental error in the contention in favor of the limited liability of the express company in the present instance consists in assuming that the rights of the parties are as at common law, ignoring the provisions of section 1294c (24). It is Well settled that, while at common law a common carrier could not contract against his own negligence, he could qualify his liability as <em>quasi insurer </em>by special acceptance upon such reasonable terms and conditions as might be agreed upon with the shipper, provided they were not incompatible with his duty to the public. But it was the manifest purpose of the legislature, by the language quoted, to deprive the common carrier of the right to thus limit his liability and to relegate him to his common law rights and responsibilities, independent of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">It need only be observed, in conclusion, that the agreed facts do not sustained' the remaining contention, that the plaintiff obtained a cheaper rate for the transportation of her trunk by fraudulent concealment of its true value.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The agent of the express company received the trunk from the owner, removing it from the upper to the lower floor of the house in Petersburg a.t which she was staying, and went away, promising to return for the trunk later, but without making any inquiry as to its value, or imparting any information on the subject of rates. The company was afterwards three times requested by \u2019phone to call for the trunk, but n'eglected to do so; and it was finally sent to the express office by a negro driver. When asked the value of the trunk, the driver truthfully answered that he did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Fraud cannot be predicated of such a state of facts, and the mere acquiescent acceptance by the shipper of a bill of lading prepared by the express company with the customary stamp, \u201cvalue asked and not given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">We are of' opinion that the judgment of the La.w and Equity Court of the city of 'Richmond is without error, and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">yl <em>\u00a1firmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
