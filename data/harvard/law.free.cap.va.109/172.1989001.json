Street <em>Railways\u2014Personal Injury\u2014Contributory </em>negligence\u2014 <em>Case at </em>Bar.\u2014The evidence in the case at bar shows that the plaintiff, who was struck and injured by a street ear at night, was perfectly familiar with all of his surroundings, including the street railway and its method of operation; that he was in a place of safety, with nothing to disturb his judgment, and with no duty imposed upon him, but that he stooped down to strike a match to signal a rapidly approaching car, at a point Where it did not usually stop, with his head projecting over the rail, and, while in this position, was struck by the car. It thus appears that he, of his own volition, exposed himself to danger, and contributed to the injury which he received. The proximate cause of his injury was his own voluntary and negligent act, and hence there can be no recovery.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-7\">Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Norfolk county in an action of trespass on the case.

The first and second are frivolous and need not be considered. The third is to the refusal to grant two instructions asked for by plaintiff in error, and the fourth is to the refusal of the court to set aside the verdict on the ground that it was contrary to the law and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">On0the night of August 8, 1906, a few minutes before ten o\u2019clock, White left his house on Plorida avenue, in Port Norfolk, Norfolk county, Virginia, in company with Mr. and Mrs. William Armstrong, who had' spent the evening at his house, it being their purpose to take the car of the defendant company (plaintiff in error) at the corner of Mt. Vemon avenue and Second street. Mt. Vernon avenue runs north and south, and Second street crosses it at right angles. After reaching the intersection of the streets, where they were to take the car, in five or six minutes plaintiff says that he saw or thought he saw a flash about one block or six hundred feet away, and at that moment he stepped upon the car track and said to his friends, \u201cI think the car is coming. Get on this side of the street,\u201d and stooped down to strike a match, \u201cand just as I struck the. match I saw the car from a light that shown from Mr. -Johnson\u2019s grocery store on the corner. I threw my head up, and didn\u2019t have time to step out of the way, and it struck me, and I did not know anything more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In answer to the question by his counsel, \u201cDid you say you did not see this car coming after it came around the curve?\u201d he replied: \u201cNo, sir; I can\u2019t say that I did see the car. I saw the car when she rounded in the curve, and after waiting a moment or two, I thought I saw a flash six or seven hundred feet off. It- could not have been the car, because there didn\u2019t three seconds elapse between that time and the time I was struck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The plaintiff, in his own behalf, and other witnesses, testify that they saw no light on the oar\u2014no headlight and no lights within the car. Several witnesses, on the contrary,'testify that the lights within the car were burning; that they were upon the same current which furnished the motive power, and that when the car was in motion the lights within the car were necessarily burning.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We do not find it necessary, however, to determine in this case whether this diversity of statement between the witnesses constitutes a conflict of evidence upon that point. There is evidence that the car, as it approached this crossing, was moving quite rapidly, and that it did not slow up, and no effort was made to stop it until after the accident had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The plaintiff in error asked the court to instruct the jury, that \u201cif they believe from the evidence that the plaintiff leaned over the track upon which the car* of the defendant was approaching in order to signal it, and that the action of the plaintiff in so leaning over the said track contributed to the injury, then the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence; and the verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury, that if they believe from the evidence that the plaintiff knew that the car of the defendant was approaching, and leaned over the track upon which the said car was approaching in order to signal it, and that the action of the plaintiff in leaning over the said track contributed to his injury, then the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, and the verdict should be for the defendant,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The evidence shows that the plaintiff had lived near the point at which he received the injury for a number of years: that he was acquainted with all of its surroundings, including the street railway and its method of operation. The point at which his friends were to take the car was not a regular stopping place. He knew, therefore, that the car would pass by at its usual rate of speed unless a signal was given it to stop. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>They had waited five or six minutes for the car, and must have known, therefore, that it might he momentarily expected. He actually saw it at a short distance from the crossing, and warned his friends to pass over to the opposite side.of the track,, in order to enter the car when it should reach them, and, that he might give the signal, he stooped down to strike a match upon the rail, and in so doing his head projected over the track and was struck hy the car, and he received the injury of which he complains. The very fact that he used a match as a signal is evidence of his consciousness of the near approach of the .car, for we know that a match could he relied upon as a signal for only a very brief time.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The sight or sound of the approaching car could only have warned him of danger, as to which there was quite enough to put a prudent man upon his guard. Being in a place of safety, with nothing to disturb his judgment, with no duty imposed upon him, but in a moment of forgetfulness or of carelessness, he of his own volition exposed himself to danger, and thus contributed to the injury which he received. Although it be conceded that the car was without lights, it is beyond doubt that the proximate cause of the injury which he sustained was his own voluntary and negligent act. <em>Garvey </em>v. <em>Rhode Island Co., </em>26 R.
