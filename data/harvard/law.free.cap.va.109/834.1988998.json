The maxim is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of indivduals, and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislature and not in the judicial department. jSTo man incurs a penalty unless the act which subjects him to it is clearly within the spiidt and letter of the statute which imposes such penalty. There can be no constructive offenses, and before a man can be punished his case must be plainly and unmistakably within the statute. If these principles are violated, the fate of the accused is determined by the arbitrary discretion of the judges and not by the express authority of the law. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Com'th, </em>81 Va. 240, 59 Am. Rep. 666; <em>Lascallett </em>v. <em>Com'th, </em>89 Va. 878, 17 S. E. 546; <em>United States </em>v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76. 5 L. Ed. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">In the light of this fundamental rule of construction, we are of opinion that the question raised by this record must be answered in the negative. The purpose of the statute was to interdict the practice of carrying a deadly weapon about the person, concealed, and yet so accessible as to afford prompt and immediate use. \u201cAbout the person\u201d must mean that it is so connected with the person as to be readily accessible for use or surprise if desired. A pistol in a scabbard and in a pair of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>saddle-bags with the lids down, though the saddle-bags be in the hand, does not fall within the language of the statute, which says: \u201cIf a person carry about his person, hid from common obseration, any pistol,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">- Evidence that the defendant had a pistol concealed under a rug in the bottom of the buggy in which he was riding was held not to be sufficient to convict him of carrying a pistol concealed about his person. <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>State, </em>92 Ala. 58, 9 South, 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Evidence that the defendant had a pistol concealed in saddlebags while riding along the public road was held not to be sufficient to convict him of carrying a pistol concealed about his person. <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>State, </em>76 Ala. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The act of which the accused stands convicted in this case does not come within the spirit, and certainly not within the letter of the statute, which it must do.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">As said by Chief Justice Marshall in <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Wiltberger, supra, </em>\u201cit would be dangerous indeed to carry the principle that a ease which is within the reason or mischief of a statute, is within its provisions, so far as to punish a crime not enumerated in the statute because it is of a kindred character with those which are enumerated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">If the statute be less comprehensive than the legislature intended, it is for that body to extend its operation and not for the courts to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">The judgement must be reversed, the verdict of the jury set aside, and the case remanded for a new trial not in conflict with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
