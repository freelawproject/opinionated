Among them:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-4\">\u201cBecause the said act of March 5, 1908, is unconstitutional, null and void, as by section 156 (a), article XII of the Constitution of Virginia, the power and authority to create and establish such a corporation as said Manchester and Bichmond Free Bridge Company is distinctly taken from the General Assembly and vested in the Corporation Commission of this State.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\">There was a demurrer to the petition which was sustained, and the petition dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-6\">The following is a copy of the order of dismissal:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-7\">\u201cThis day came again the parties, by their attorneys, and the court having maturely considered the various matters of law arising upon the demurrers interposed by the defendants, is of opinion as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-8\">First. That the Manchester and Bichmond Free Bridge Company was, under the terms of the original act of the General Assembly of April 2, 1902, distinctly a <em>public </em>corporation, municipal in its character, and that the General Assembly, therefore, had full -inherent power, notwithstanding the provisions of article XII of the Constitution, to pass the amendatory act of March 5, 1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-9\">Second.
