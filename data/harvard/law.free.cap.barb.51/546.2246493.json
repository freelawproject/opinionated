A mere authority, in the nature of a license or permission to make the arrest would not be a warrant, within the statute, or at common law.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b546-9\">The direction is an essential part of every warrant. Unless it is directed to the sheriff, or the constables of the county, or town, or some individual officer or to some individual by name, who is not an officer, it is not a proper or sufficient warrant,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b546-10\">At common law, a warrant 'might be directed to some indifferent person who was not an officer; and this may still be done; but the practice should not be resorted to if an officer can conveniently be found.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b546-11\">But where the warrant is-directed, in the body thereof, \u201c to the sheriff or any constable of the county,\u201d in which the magistrate resides, an authority cannot be conferred upon a person who is not an officer, to execute the same, by an indorsement on the back thereof, signed by the justice, \u201c authorizing and empowering \u201d such person to arrest the defendant and bring him before the justice. Such an indorsement is not a direction to the person named therein; and the warrant will afford no justification to him for an arrest made under it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-12\">THIS action was for an assault and battery and false imprisonment. The defendant attempted to justify under a warrant, and its indorsements, issued by A. W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Casey, a justice of the peace, July 8, 1866, for the arrest of the plaintiff H. W. Abbott, on a charge of assault and battery. The warrant was directed, in the body of it. \u201cTo the sheriff, or any constable of said county,\u201d and was indorsed, on the'back of it, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">\u201cI hereby authorize and empower John F. Booth to arrest the within named H. W. Abbott, and bring him before me. A. W. Casey, J.

Abbott, who is here before the court. J. F. Booth, deputy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">On the trial, at the circuit, before Justice E. Darwin Smith and a jury, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked that the second defense,\u2014justification under the warrant\u2014be excluded, on the ground that a justice of the peace has no power to deputize another person, not an officer, to make an arrest when the warrant is not to such person by name on its face. The court sustained the objection. The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to this ruling of the court. The court charged the jury that there was no justification for the arrest and imprisonment of the plaintiff, and that he therefore had a right of action. The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, for $50 damages; and judgment being entered thereon, the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-8\"><em>J. </em>Peddie, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmI\">I. The warrant, taken in connection with the indorsement signed by the same officer who issued it, was sufficient, under the statute, to authorize the appellant to arrest and detain the respondent, 1. The warrant itself complies on its face, as to its recitals, with section 3 of the Devised Statutes, <em>(5th ed. vol. 3,p. </em>993,) and it was also under his hand, and without seal. 2. The indorsement on the back being made and signed by the same officer, in connection with what had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>previously signed, and ail done before delivery for execution, was a sufficient direction within the meaning of the sam\u00e9 statute. 3. The statute is, \u201c commanding the officer to whom it shall be directed,\u201d &amp;c. The manner in which this direction shall be made to appear upon the warrant is not pointed out. It is no part of its \u201crecitals.\u201d ' The object of the \u201crecitals\u201d is to apprise the party of the charge. He can not be interested in its \u201c direction.\u201d And the object of the \u201c direction \u201d is to protect the person who is named as the \u201cofficer\u201d to execute the process, and to apprise him of his appointment and duty, if a private person, and he accepts it; and it can make no difference to any party how this \u201c direction \u201d is given, provided it is about the warrant, and appears upon or with it, properly executed by the officer issuing the process. 4. The words \u201c to whom it shall be directed \u201d can have no other value or importance to the party arrested than to acquaint him with the individual who interferes with his liberty. The direction is no part of the warrant. And the same thing, and indeed every thing calculated to be accomplished by the direction, if contained on the face of the process, is accomplished by the direction contained in the indorsement as it appears in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-5\">II. The warrant and the indorsement were sufficient at comnon law, as well as under the statute, 1. It was sufficient in form, (1 <em>Chit. Crim. </em>Law, <em>Riley\u2019s ed. marginal p. </em>44.) 2. The magistrate had a discretionary power to nominate an individual who was no officer to be his officer to execute the process. <em>(Barb. crim. </em>Law, 459. 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Crim. Law, </em>38, 48 1/2.) 3. And this nomination or direction could be made by a separate writing, indorsed upon or attached to the warrant and referring to it. 4. By a careful perusal of 1 Chitty\u2019s Crim. Law, (38 <em>to </em>51,) under the subject \u201cform and requisites of the warrant,\u201d it will appear that the.only materiality of the direction was to designate the person by name or character who was charged with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>execution. And this was effected by the indorsement in the case at bar. 5. Our Revised Statutes only change the common law upon these subjects in this respect; <em>that the. accusation shall he recited in the warrant. (See R. S. </em>\u00a7 3, <em>supra; </em>1 <em>Chitty's Crim. Law, </em>41, 42.) 6. And by section 17, of the New York State Constitution of 1846, the common law, as it existed in the state, April 19, 1775, with other matters, it is declared \u201c shall be and continue the law of this state, subject to such alterations as the legislature shall make concerning the same.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-6\">III. ' In determining the legal import and effect of the warrant and its indorsement and delivery, both parts and acts must be taken and construed together, as <em>one paper, one instrument, </em>and one <em>official </em>or <em>ministerial act; </em>and as a whole making the process a \u201cproper warrant\u201d under the statute, and being properly directed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-7\">IV. As an independent proposition, we claim, also, that the writing on the hack of the assumed warrant, by its reference to the within writing, constitutes of itself, a sufficient warrant and direction to the appellant, and within the letter, and especially the spirit, of the Revised Statutes on the subject, and must protect him in its execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-8\">V. For all these reasons, the several exceptions, to the ruling excluding the second defense, and to the charge of the court, were well taken. And the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-9\"><em>Quincy Van Voorhis, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFn\">I. The warrant in question constituted no authority by which Booth could legally arrest Abbott. 1. A justice of the peace has no authority to deputise any person not an officer to serve a criminal warrant. In this state justices of the peace, and their courts, are creatures of the statute. They have no jurisdiction, except what the statute provides and prescribes. While in civil actions the justice is expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>authorized to depute any person to serve any civil process except a <em>venire, </em>(2 <em>R. S. 4th ed. p. </em>458, \u00a7\u00a7 191, 192,) there is no such authority granted in criminal cases. On the contrary the statute concerning the arrest of offenders requires the magistrate to issue a proper warrant, \u201c <em>commanding the officer to whom it shall be directed,\u201d </em>to make the arrest. (2 <em>R. S. 4th ed. p. </em>890, \u00a7 3. 1 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>488. <em>N. Y. Const, art. </em>6, \u00a7 17. 2 <em>R, S. </em>225-276, 703, 606, 710.) 2. But if this is not so and we are to look to the common law for the practice, the rule there is clear and explicit that no person not an officer can serve a criminal warrant, unless the warrant in the body of it is directed to such person by name. (1 <em>Chit. Crim. Law, </em>37, 38. 1 <em>Hale P. C. </em>531. 2 <em>id. </em>110. <em>Barb. Crim. Law, </em>527-531. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>1 <em>Barn. &amp; Cress. </em>288. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>1 <em>Mass. R. </em>488. <em>Arch. Crim. Plead. </em>120, 128, <em>and notes. </em>In case a felony has been actually committed, the offender may be arrested by any person. <em>(Holley </em>v. <em>Mix, 3 Wend. </em>350.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-6\">II. The indorsement upon the warrant does not purport to authorize Booth to execute the warrant. There is no allusion whatever in it to the warrant. There exists the naked circumstance only that it is written on the back of the same piece of paper upon which the warrant is written. If this indorsement is any thing, it is a warrant of itself. It commands Booth\u2014not to execute the within warrant\u2014but to arrest Abbott. It is an independent instrument. It is an arbitrary direction to Booth to arrest Abbott. It has no more validity than it would have if written on a separate piece of paper, and is a nullity.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b550-7\"><em>By the Court, </em>Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC7\">The question in this case is whether the warrant issued by the justice of the peace, against the plaintiff, afforded a justification to the defendant, for the arrest and detention of the plaintiff. The defendant was not an officer, and the warrant was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>directed to him, in the body thereof, but \u201c to the sheriff or any constable of the county,\u201d in which the magistrate resided. The statute (2 <em>R. S. </em>706, \u00a7 3,) provides for the issuing of a warrant by a magistrate when it shall appear before him in a proper manner, \u201cthat an offense has been committed.\u201d It must be under his hand, with or without seal, \u201c reciting the accusation, and commanding \u201d the officer to whom it shall be directed forthwith to take the person accused and bring him before such magistrate. All the forms and authorities agree that a proper warrant contains a command, or a requirement, in the nature thereof, to the person to whom the warrant is directed, to make the arrest. A mere authority in the nature of a license or permission to make the arrest would not be a warrant, within the statute, or at the common law. The direction is an essential part of every warrant. Unless it is directed to the sheriff or the constables of the county, . or town, or some individual officer, or to some individual by name, who is not an officer, it is not a proper or sufficient warrant. All the authorities will, I think, be found to agree in this. <em>(Barb. Crim. Law, </em>459. <em>Addis. </em>376.) At common law the warrant might be directed to some indifferent person who is not an officer. <em>(Barb. Cr. Law, </em>459. 1 <em>Chit. Cr. Law, </em>38.) And I am of opinion this may still be done; but a magistrate should, I think, never resort to such a practice if an officer can be conveniently found to perform the service, inasmuch as a common person cannot be compelled to make service or be punished in case of refusal. In Massachusetts it was held that a warrant addressed to the proper officers and to an individual by name who was not an officer was erroneous, and conferred no authority upon the individual to make the arrest. <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>(1 <em>Mass. R. </em>488.) Though a doubt was expressed in that case, whether it might not be lawfully done when no officer was at hand to perform the service, and that fact was expressed in the warrant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>But here the warrant was not in any sense directed to the defendant. The magistrate, instead of directing it to the defendant by name, and commanding Mm to execute it, undertook to confer an authority, by an indorsement on the back of the warrant in the nature of a permission or license to make the arrest. A warrant issued in that form, merely authorizing the arrest, without requiring and commanding it, would not be a valid warrant. Here the warrant was plainly directed to the sheriff or any constable of the county, in the body of it, and the indorsement, in the form in which it was made, was not a direction to the defendant. The learned judge at the circuit therefore properly held that the warrant afforded no justification to the defendant.</p>\n<court id=\"b552-6\">[Monroe General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate id=\"Axg\">September 7, 1868.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"AW\"><em>E.
