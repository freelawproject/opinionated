Whatever its imperfections in a particular case, the jury is a necessary check on governmental power. The jury, over the centuries, has been an inspired, trusted, and effective instrument for resolving factual disputes and determining ultimate questions of guilt or innocence in criminal cases. Over the long course its judgments find acceptance in the community, an acceptance essential to respect for the rule of law. The jury is a tangible implementation of the principle that the law comes from the people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the era of our Nation's founding, the right to a jury trial already had existed and evolved for centuries, through and alongside the common law. The jury was considered a fundamental safeguard of individual liberty. See The Federalist No. 83, p. 451 (B. Warner ed. 1818) (A. Hamilton). The right to a jury trial in criminal cases was part of the Constitution as first drawn, and it was restated in the Sixth Amendment. Art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 3 ; Amdt. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By operation of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is applicable to the States.\n   <em>\n    Duncan v. Louisiana,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767723\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/145/#p149\">\n    391 U.S. 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149-150,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767723\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/145/#p149\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767723\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/145/#p149\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Like all human institutions, the jury system has its flaws, yet experience shows that fair and impartial verdicts can be reached if the jury follows the court's instructions and undertakes deliberations that are honest, candid, robust, and based on common sense. A general rule has evolved to give substantial protection to verdict finality and to assure jurors that, once their verdict has been entered, it will not later be called into question based on the comments or conclusions they expressed during deliberations. This principle, itself centuries old, is often referred to as the no-impeachment rule. The instant case presents the question whether there is an exception to the no-impeachment rule when, after the jury is discharged, a juror comes forward with compelling evidence that another juror made clear and explicit statements indicating that racial animus was a significant motivating factor in his or her vote to convict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   State prosecutors in Colorado brought criminal charges against petitioner, Miguel Angel Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez, based on the following allegations. In 2007, in the bathroom of a Colorado horse-racing facility, a man sexually assaulted two teenage sisters. The girls told their father and identified the man as an employee of the racetrack. The police located and arrested petitioner. Each girl separately identified petitioner as the man who had assaulted her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State charged petitioner with harassment, unlawful sexual contact, and attempted sexual assault on a child. Before the jury was empaneled, members of the venire were repeatedly asked whether they believed that they could be fair and impartial in the case. A written questionnaire asked if there was \"anything about you that you feel would make it difficult for you to be a fair juror.\" App. 14. The court repeated the question to the panel of prospective jurors and encouraged jurors to speak in private with the court if they had any concerns about their impartiality. Defense counsel likewise asked whether anyone felt that \"this is simply not a good case\" for them to be a fair juror.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 34. None of the empaneled jurors expressed any reservations based on racial or any other bias. And none asked to speak with the trial judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After a 3-day trial, the jury found petitioner guilty of unlawful sexual contact and harassment, but it failed to reach a verdict on the attempted sexual assault charge. When the jury was discharged, the court gave them this instruction, as mandated by Colorado law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The question may arise whether you may now discuss this case with the lawyers, defendant, or other persons. For your guidance the court instructs you that whether you talk to anyone is entirely your own decision.... If any person persists in discussing the case over your objection, or becomes critical of your service either before or after any discussion has begun, please report it to me.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 85-86.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the discharge of the jury, petitioner's counsel entered the jury room to discuss the trial with the jurors. As the room was emptying, two jurors remained to speak with counsel in private. They stated that, during deliberations, another juror had expressed anti-Hispanic bias toward petitioner and petitioner's alibi witness. Petitioner's counsel reported this to the court and, with the court's supervision, obtained sworn affidavits from the two jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The affidavits by the two jurors described a number of biased statements made by another juror, identified as Juror H.C. According to the two jurors, H.C. told the other jurors that he \"believed the defendant was guilty because, in [H.C.'s] experience as an ex-law enforcement officer, Mexican men had a bravado that caused them to believe they could do whatever they wanted with women.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 110. The jurors reported that H.C. stated his belief that Mexican men are physically controlling of women because of their sense of entitlement, and further stated, \" 'I think he did it because he's Mexican and Mexican men take whatever they want.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 109. According to the jurors, H.C. further explained that, in his experience, \"nine times out of ten Mexican men were guilty of being aggressive toward women and young girls.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 110. Finally, the jurors recounted that Juror H.C. said that he did not find petitioner's alibi witness credible because, among other things, the witness was \" 'an illegal.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (In fact, the witness testified during trial that he was a legal resident of the United States.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After reviewing the affidavits, the trial court acknowledged H.C.'s apparent bias. But the court denied petitioner's motion for a new trial, noting that \"[t]he actual deliberations that occur among the jurors are protected from inquiry under [Colorado Rule of Evidence] 606(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 90. Like its federal counterpart, Colorado's Rule 606(b) generally prohibits a juror from testifying as to any statement made during deliberations in a proceeding inquiring into the validity of the verdict. See Fed. Rule Evid. 606(b). The Colorado Rule reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"(b) Inquiry into validity of verdict or indictment. Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury's deliberations or to the effect of anything upon his or any other juror's mind or emotions as influencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning his mental processes in connection therewith. But a juror may testify about (1) whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jurors' attention, (2) whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror, or (3) whether there was a mistake in entering the verdict onto the verdict form. A juror's affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror may not be received on a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying.\" Colo. Rule Evid. 606(b) (2016).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The verdict deemed final, petitioner was sentenced to two years' probation and was required to register as a sex offender. A divided panel of the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction, agreeing that H.C.'s alleged statements did not fall within an exception to Rule 606(b) and so were inadmissible to undermine the validity of the verdict. - -- P.3d ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205457362\">\n    2012 WL 5457362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed by a vote of 4 to 3.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868207\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/350/287/\">\n    350 P.3d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The prevailing opinion relied on two decisions of this Court rejecting constitutional challenges to the federal no-impeachment rule as applied to evidence of juror misconduct or bias. See\n   <em>\n    Tanner v.

After reviewing those precedents, the court could find no \"dividing line between different\n   <em>\n    types\n   </em>\n   of juror bias or misconduct,\" and thus no basis for permitting impeachment of the verdicts in petitioner's trial, notwithstanding H.C.'s apparent racial bias.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868207\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/350/287/\">\n    350 P.3d, at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v. New York,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223686\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/352/#p355\">\n    500 U.S. 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223686\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/352/#p355\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223686\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/352/#p355\">\n    114 L.Ed.2d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) (plurality opinion). Yet we have also used the language of race when discussing the relevant constitutional principles in cases involving Hispanic persons.

University of Tex. at Austin,\n   </em>\n   570 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698470\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/297/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698470\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/297/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Rosales-Lopez v.

Petitioner and respondent both refer to race, or to race and ethnicity, in this more expansive sense in their briefs to the Court. This opinion refers to the nature of the bias as racial in keeping with the primary terminology employed by the parties and used in our precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At common law jurors were forbidden to impeach their verdict, either by affidavit or live testimony. This rule originated in\n   <em>\n    Vaise v. Delaval,\n   </em>\n   1 T.R. 11, 99 Eng. Rep. 944 (K.B. 1785). There, Lord Mansfield excluded juror testimony that the jury had decided the case through a game of chance. The Mansfield rule, as it came to be known, prohibited jurors, after the verdict was entered, from testifying either about their subjective mental processes or about objective events that occurred during deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   American courts adopted the Mansfield rule as a matter of common law, though not in every detail. Some jurisdictions adopted a different, more flexible version of the no-impeachment bar known as the \"Iowa rule.\" Under that rule, jurors were prevented only from testifying about their own subjective beliefs, thoughts, or motives during deliberations. See\n   <em>\n    Wright v. Illinois &amp; Miss. Tel. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343468\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/iowa/20/195/\">\n    20 Iowa 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1866). Jurors could, however, testify about objective facts and events occurring during deliberations, in part because other jurors could corroborate that testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   An alternative approach, later referred to as the federal approach, stayed closer to the original Mansfield rule. See\n   <em>\n    Warger,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593404\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/521/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593404\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/521/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Under this version of the rule, the no-impeachment bar permitted an exception only for testimony about events extraneous to the deliberative process, such as reliance on outside evidence-newspapers, dictionaries, and the like-or personal investigation of the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This Court's early decisions did not establish a clear preference for a particular version of the no-impeachment rule.

Instead it endorsed a broad no-impeachment rule, with only limited exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The version of the rule that Congress adopted was \"no accident.\"\n   <em>\n    Warger,\n   </em>\n   574 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593404\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/521/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Advisory Committee at first drafted a rule reflecting the Iowa approach, prohibiting admission of juror testimony only as it related to jurors' mental processes in reaching a verdict. The Department of Justice, however, expressed concern over the preliminary rule. The Advisory Committee then drafted the more stringent version now in effect, prohibiting all juror testimony, with exceptions only where the jury had considered prejudicial extraneous evidence or was subject to other outside influence.

S.Rep. No. 93-1277, pp. 13-14 (1974). Siding with the Senate, the Conference Committee adopted, Congress enacted, and the President signed the Court's proposed rule. The substance of the Rule has not changed since 1975, except for a 2006 modification permitting evidence of a clerical mistake on the verdict form.

During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury's deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror's or another juror's\n   vote; or any juror's mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment.

Within both classifications there is a diversity of approaches. Nine jurisdictions that follow the Federal Rule have codified exceptions other than those listed in Federal Rule 606(b). See Appendix,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .

Various Courts of Appeals have had occasion to consider a racial bias exception and have reached different conclusions. Three have held or suggested there is a constitutional exception for evidence of racial bias. See\n   <em>\n    United States v.

One Court of Appeals has declined to find an exception, reasoning that other safeguards inherent in the trial process suffice to protect defendants' constitutional interests. See\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Another has suggested as much, holding in the habeas context that an exception for racial bias was not clearly established but indicating in dicta that no such exception exists. See\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Price,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096710\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/223/#p237\">\n    343 F.3d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237-239 (C.A.3 2003) (Alito, J.). And one Court of Appeals has held that evidence of racial bias is excluded by Rule 606(b), without addressing whether the Constitution may at times demand an exception. See\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

At the outset of the trial process,\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   provides an opportunity for the court and counsel to examine members of the venire for impartiality. As a trial proceeds, the court, counsel, and court personnel have some opportunity to learn of any juror misconduct. And, before the verdict, jurors themselves can report misconduct to the court. These procedures do not undermine the stability of a verdict once rendered.

This Court's decisions demonstrate that racial bias implicates unique historical, constitutional, and institutional concerns. An effort to address the most grave and serious statements of racial bias is not an effort to perfect the jury but to ensure that our legal system remains capable of coming ever closer to the promise of equal treatment under the law that is so central to a functioning democracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Racial bias is distinct in a pragmatic sense as well. In past cases this Court has relied on other safeguards to protect the right to an impartial jury. Some of those safeguards, to be sure, can disclose racial bias.\n   <em>\n    Voir dire\n   </em>\n   at the outset of trial, observation of juror demeanor and conduct during trial, juror reports before the verdict, and nonjuror evidence after trial are important mechanisms for discovering bias.

Yet more pointed questions \"could well exacerbate whatever prejudice might exist without substantially aiding in exposing it.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosales-Lopez,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183646\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/182/#p189\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183646\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/182/#p189\">\n    at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183646\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/182/#p189\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rehnquist, J., concurring in result).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The stigma that attends racial bias may make it difficult for a juror to report inappropriate statements during the course of juror deliberations. It is one thing to accuse a fellow juror of having a personal experience that improperly influences her consideration of the case, as would have been required in\n   <em>\n    Warger\n   </em>\n   . It is quite another to call her a bigot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The recognition that certain of the\n   <em>\n    Tanner\n   </em>\n   safeguards may be less effective in rooting out racial bias than other kinds of bias is not dispositive. All forms of improper bias pose challenges to the trial process. But there is a sound basis to treat racial bias with added precaution. A constitutional rule that racial bias in the justice system must be addressed-including, in some instances, after the verdict has been entered-is necessary to prevent a systemic loss of confidence in jury verdicts, a confidence that is a central premise of the Sixth Amendment trial right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Court now holds that where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that the no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of the juror's statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Not every offhand comment indicating racial bias or hostility will justify setting aside the no-impeachment bar to allow further judicial inquiry. For the inquiry to proceed, there must be a showing that one or more jurors made statements exhibiting overt racial bias that cast serious doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the jury's deliberations and resulting verdict. To qualify, the statement must tend to show that racial animus was a significant motivating factor in the juror's vote to convict. Whether that threshold showing has been satisfied is a matter committed to the substantial discretion of the trial court in light of all the circumstances, including the content and timing of the alleged statements and the reliability of the proffered evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The practical mechanics of acquiring and presenting such evidence will no doubt be shaped and guided by state rules of professional ethics and local court rules, both of which often limit counsel's post-trial contact with jurors. See 27 C. Wright &amp; V. Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence \u00a7 6076, pp. 580-583 (2d ed. 2007) (Wright); see also Variations of ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.5 (Sept. 15, 2016) (overview of state ethics rules); 2 Jurywork Systematic Techniques \u00a7 13:18 (2016-2017) (overview of Federal District Court rules). These limits seek to provide jurors some protection when they return to their daily affairs after the verdict has been entered. But while a juror can always tell counsel they do not wish to discuss the case, jurors in some instances may come forward of their own accord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   That is what happened here. In this case the alleged statements by a juror were egregious and unmistakable in their reliance on racial bias. Not only did juror H.C. deploy a dangerous racial stereotype to conclude petitioner was guilty and his alibi witness should not be believed, but he also encouraged other jurors to join him in convicting on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Petitioner's counsel did not seek out the two jurors' allegations of racial bias. Pursuant to Colorado's mandatory jury instruction, the trial court had set limits on juror contact and encouraged jurors to inform the court if anyone harassed them about their role in the case. Similar limits on juror contact can be found in other jurisdictions that recognize a racial-bias exception. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Fla. Standard Jury Instrs. in Crim. Cases No. 4.2 (West 2016) (\"Although you are at liberty to speak with anyone about your deliberations, you are also at liberty to refuse to speak to anyone\"); Mass.

Model Jury Charges, Non 2C Charges, Dismissal of Jury (2014) (\"It will be up to each of you to decide whether to speak about your service as a juror\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   With the understanding that they were under no obligation to speak out, the jurors approached petitioner's counsel, within a short time after the verdict, to relay their concerns about H.C.'s statements. App. 77. A similar pattern is common in cases involving juror allegations of racial bias. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villar,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3485515\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/76/#p87\">\n    586 F.3d, at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (juror e-mailed defense counsel within hours of the verdict);\n   <em>\n    Kittle v.

Pursuant to local court rules, petitioner's counsel then sought and received permission from the court to contact the two jurors and obtain affidavits limited to recounting the exact statements made by H.C. that exhibited racial bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   While the trial court concluded that Colorado's Rule 606(b) did not permit it even to consider the resulting affidavits, the Court's holding today removes that bar. When jurors disclose an instance of racial bias as serious as the one involved in this case, the law must not wholly disregard its occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As the preceding discussion makes clear, the Court relies on the experiences of the 17 jurisdictions that have recognized a racial-bias exception to the no-impeachment rule-some for over half a century-with no signs of an increase in juror harassment or a loss of juror willingness to engage in searching and candid deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The experience of these jurisdictions, and the experience of the courts going forward, will inform the proper exercise of trial judge discretion in these and related matters. This case does not ask, and the Court need not address, what procedures a trial court must follow when confronted with a motion for a new trial based on juror testimony of racial bias. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20Wright%20575\">\n    27 Wright 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -578 (noting a divergence of authority over the necessity and scope of an evidentiary hearing on alleged juror misconduct). The Court also does not decide the appropriate standard for determining when evidence of racial bias is sufficient to require that the verdict be set aside and a new trial be granted. Compare,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shillcutt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1754067\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/827/1155/#p1158\">\n    827 F.2d, at 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (inquiring whether racial bias \"pervaded the jury room\"), with,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11147224\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/1111/#p1119\">\n    238 F.3d, at 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"One racist juror would be enough\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   It is proper to observe as well that there are standard and existing processes designed to prevent racial bias in jury deliberations. The advantages of careful\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   have already been noted. And other safeguards deserve mention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Trial courts, often at the outset of the case and again in their final jury instructions, explain the jurors' duty to review the evidence and reach a verdict in a fair and impartial way, free from bias of any kind. Some instructions are framed by trial judges based on their own learning and experience. Model jury instructions likely take into account these continuing developments and are common across jurisdictions. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   1A K. O'Malley, J. Grenig, &amp; W. Lee, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, Criminal \u00a7 10:01, p. 22 (6th ed. 2008) (\"Perform these duties fairly. Do not let any bias, sympathy or prejudice that you may feel toward one side or the other influence your decision in any way\"). Instructions may emphasize the group dynamic of deliberations by urging jurors to share their questions and conclusions with their colleagues. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g., id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 20:01, at 841 (\"It is your duty as jurors to consult with one another and to deliberate with one another with a view towards reaching an agreement if you can do so without violence to individual judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Probing and thoughtful deliberation improves the likelihood that other jurors can confront the flawed nature of reasoning that is prompted or influenced by improper biases, whether racial or otherwise. These dynamics can help ensure that the exception is limited to rare cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Nation must continue to make strides to overcome race-based discrimination. The progress that has already been made underlies the Court's insistence that blatant racial prejudice is antithetical to the functioning of the jury system and must be confronted in egregious cases like this one despite the general bar of the no-impeachment rule. It is the mark of a maturing legal system that it seeks to understand and to implement the lessons of history. The Court now seeks to strengthen the broader principle that society can and must move forward by achieving the thoughtful, rational dialogue at the foundation of both the jury system and the free society that sustains our Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-89\">\n   Justice THOMAS, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court today holds that the Sixth Amendment requires the States to provide a criminal defendant the opportunity to impeach a jury's guilty verdict with juror testimony about a juror's alleged racial bias, notwithstanding a state procedural rule forbidding such testimony. I agree with Justice ALITO that the Court's decision is incompatible with the text of the Amendment it purports to interpret and with our precedents.

Although partiality was a ground for setting aside a jury verdict,\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   the English common-law rule at the time the Sixth Amendment was ratified did not allow jurors to supply evidence of that misconduct. In 1770, Lord Mansfield refused to receive a juror's affidavit to impeach a verdict, declaring that such an affidavit \"can't be read.\"\n   <em>\n    Rex v. Almon,\n   </em>\n   5 Burr. 2687, 98 Eng. Rep. 411 (K.B.).

Neither should we.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice THOMAS join, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Our legal system has many rules that restrict the admission of evidence of statements made under circumstances in which confidentiality is thought to be essential. Statements made to an attorney in obtaining legal advice, statements to a treating physician, and statements made to a spouse or member of the clergy are familiar examples. See\n   <em>\n    Trammel v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777844\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/40/#p51\">\n    445 U.S. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777844\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/40/#p51\">\n    100 S.Ct. 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777844\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/40/#p51\">\n    63 L.Ed.2d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). Even if a criminal defendant whose constitutional rights are at stake has a critical need to obtain and introduce evidence of such statements, long-established rules stand in the way. The goal of avoiding interference with confidential communications of great value has long been thought to justify the loss of important evidence and the effect on our justice system that this loss entails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The present case concerns a rule like those just mentioned, namely, the age-old rule against attempting to overturn or \"impeach\" a jury's verdict by offering statements made by jurors during the course of deliberations. For centuries, it has been the judgment of experienced judges, trial attorneys, scholars, and lawmakers that allowing jurors to testify after a trial about what took place in the jury room would undermine the system of trial by jury that is integral to our legal system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Juries occupy a unique place in our justice system. The other participants in a trial-the presiding judge, the attorneys, the witnesses-function in an arena governed by strict rules of law. Their every word is recorded and may be closely scrutinized for missteps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   When jurors retire to deliberate, however, they enter a space that is not regulated in the same way. Jurors are ordinary people. They are expected to speak, debate, argue, and make decisions the way ordinary people do in their daily lives. Our Constitution places great value on this way of thinking, speaking, and deciding. The jury trial right protects parties in\n   court cases from being judged by a special class of trained professionals who do not speak the language of ordinary people and may not understand or appreciate the way ordinary people live their lives. To protect that right, the door to the jury room has been locked, and the confidentiality of jury deliberations has been closely guarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Today, with the admirable intention of providing justice for one criminal defendant, the Court not only pries open the door; it rules that respecting the privacy of the jury room, as our legal system has done for centuries, violates the Constitution. This is a startling development, and although the Court tries to limit the degree of intrusion, it is doubtful that there are principled grounds for preventing the expansion of today's holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Court justifies its decision on the ground that the nature of the confidential communication at issue in this particular case-a clear expression of what the Court terms racial bias\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -is uniquely harmful to our criminal justice system. And the Court is surely correct that even a tincture of racial bias can inflict great damage on that system, which is dependent on the public's trust. But until today, the argument that the Court now finds convincing has not been thought to be sufficient to overcome confidentiality rules like the one at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Suppose that a prosecution witness gives devastating but false testimony against a defendant, and suppose that the witness's motivation is racial bias. Suppose that the witness admits this to his attorney, his spouse, and a member of the clergy. Suppose that the defendant, threatened with conviction for a serious crime and a lengthy term of imprisonment, seeks to compel the attorney, the spouse, or the member of the clergy to testify about the witness's admissions. Even though the constitutional rights of the defendant hang in the balance, the defendant's efforts to obtain the testimony would fail. The Court provides no good reason why the result in this case should not be the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Rules barring the admission of juror testimony to impeach a verdict (so-called \"no-impeachment rules\") have a long history.

First, no-impeachment rules advance crucial interests. Second, the right to trial by an impartial jury is adequately protected by mechanisms other than the use of juror testimony regarding jury deliberations. The first of these propositions applies regardless of the nature of the juror misconduct, and the Court does not argue otherwise. Instead, it contends that, in cases involving racially biased jurors, the\n   <em>\n    Tanner\n   </em>\n   safeguards are less effective and the defendant's Sixth Amendment interests are more profound.

And the Court marshals no evidence that such pre-deliberation reporting is rarer than the post-verdict variety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Even if there is something to the distinction that the Court makes between pre- and post-verdict reporting, it is debatable whether the difference is significant enough to merit different treatment. This is especially so because post-verdict reporting is both more disruptive and may be the result of extraneous influences. A juror who is initially in the minority but is ultimately persuaded by other jurors may have second thoughts after the verdict is announced and may be angry with others on the panel who pressed for unanimity. In addition, if a verdict is unpopular with a particular juror's family, friends, employer, co-workers, or neighbors, the juror may regret his or her vote and may feel pressured to rectify what the jury has done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In short, the Court provides no good reason to depart from the calculus made in\n   <em>\n    Tanner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Warger\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, the majority itself uses hedged language and appears to recognize that this \"pragmatic\" argument is something of a makeweight.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 868 - 869 (noting that the argument is \"not dispositive\");\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 869 (stating that the operation of the safeguards \"may be compromised, or they may prove insufficient\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The real thrust of the majority opinion is that the Constitution is less tolerant of racial bias than other forms of juror misconduct, but it is hard to square this argument with the nature of the Sixth Amendment right on which petitioner's argument and the Court's holding are based. What the Sixth Amendment protects is the right to an \"impartial jury.\" Nothing in the text or history of the Amendment or in the inherent nature of the jury trial right suggests that the extent of the protection provided by the Amendment depends on the nature of a jury's partiality or bias. As the Colorado Supreme Court aptly put it, it is hard to \"discern a dividing line between different\n   <em>\n    types\n   </em>\n   of juror bias or misconduct, whereby one form of partiality would implicate a party's Sixth Amendment right while another would not.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868207\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/350/287/\">\n    350 P.3d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293 (2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Nor has the Court found any decision of this Court suggesting that the Sixth Amendment recognizes some sort of hierarchy of partiality or bias. The Court points to a line of cases holding that, in some narrow circumstances, the Constitution requires trial courts to conduct\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   on the subject of race. Those decisions, however, were not based on a ranking of types of partiality but on the Court's conclusion that in certain cases racial bias was especially likely.

But it is hard to see what that has to do with the scope of an\n   <em>\n    individual criminal defendant's\n   </em>\n   Sixth Amendment right to be judged impartially. The Court's efforts to reconcile its decision with\n   <em>\n    McDonald,Tanner,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Warger\n   </em>\n   illustrate the problem. The Court writes that the misconduct in those cases, while \"troubling and unacceptable,\" was \"anomalous.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 868. By contrast, racial bias, the Court says, is a \"familiar and recurring evil\" that causes \"systemic injury to the administration of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 868.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Imagine two cellmates serving lengthy prison terms. Both were convicted for homicides committed in unrelated barroom fights. At the trial of the first prisoner, a juror, during deliberations, expressed animosity toward the defendant because of his race. At the trial of the second prisoner, a juror, during deliberations, expressed animosity toward the defendant because he was wearing the jersey of a hated football team. In both cases, jurors come forward after the trial and reveal what the biased juror said in the jury room. The Court would say to the first prisoner: \"You are entitled to introduce the jurors' testimony, because racial bias is damaging to our society.\" To the second, the Court would say: \"Even if you did not have an impartial jury, you must stay in prison because sports rivalries are not a major societal issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   This disparate treatment is unsupportable under the Sixth Amendment. If the Sixth Amendment requires the admission of juror testimony about statements or conduct during deliberations that show one type of juror partiality, then statements or conduct showing any type of partiality should be treated the same way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Recasting this as an equal protection case would not provide a ground for limiting the holding to cases involving racial bias. At a minimum, cases involving bias based on any suspect classification-such as national origin\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   or religion\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   -would merit equal treatment.

Suppose that the allegedly biased juror in this case never made reference to Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez's race or national origin but said that he had a lot of experience with \"this macho type\" and knew that men of this kind felt that they could get their way with women. Suppose that other jurors testified that they were certain that \"this macho type\" was meant to refer to Mexican or Hispanic men.

For example, the majority approvingly refers to the widespread rules limiting attorneys' contact with jurors.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 883. But under the reasoning of the majority opinion, it is not clear why such rules should be enforced when they come into conflict with a defendant's attempt to introduce evidence of racial bias. For instance, what will happen when a lawyer obtains clear evidence of racist statements by contacting jurors in violation of a local rule? (Something similar happened in\n    <em>\n     Tanner\n    </em>\n    .\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28154\" index=\"365\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/107/\">\n     483 U.S., at 126\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28154\" index=\"366\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/107/\">\n     107 S.Ct. 2739\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) It remains to be seen whether rules of this type-or other rules which exclude probative evidence, such as evidentiary privileges-will be allowed to stand in the way of the \"imperative to purge racial prejudice from the administration of justice.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 867.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
