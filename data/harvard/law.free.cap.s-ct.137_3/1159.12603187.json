The statute authorizes a district court to issue an order enforcing such a subpoena. The question presented here is whether a court of appeals should review a district court's decision to enforce or quash an EEOC subpoena\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   or for abuse of discretion. This decision should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" \u00a7 703(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Stat.%20255\">\n    78 Stat. 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a).

Ochoa worked for eight years as a \"cigarette selector\" for petitioner McLane Co., a supply-chain services company. According to McLane, the job is a demanding one: Cigarette selectors work in distribution centers, where they are required to lift, pack, and move large bins containing products. McLane requires employees taking physically demanding jobs-both new employees and employees returning from medical leave-to take a physical evaluation. According to McLane, the evaluation \"tests ... range of motion, resistance, and speed\" and \"is designed, administered, and validated by a third party.\" Brief for Petitioner 6. In 2007, Ochoa took three months of maternity leave. When she attempted to return to work, McLane asked her to take the evaluation. Ochoa attempted to pass the evaluation three times, but failed. McLane fired her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ochoa filed a charge of discrimination, alleging (among other things) that she had been fired on the basis of her gender. The EEOC began an investigation, and-at its request-McLane provided it with basic information about the evaluation, as well as a list of anonymous employees that McLane had asked to take the evaluation. McLane's list included each employee's gender, role at the company, and evaluation score, as well as the reason each employee had been asked to take the evaluation. But the company refused to provide what the parties call \"pedigree information\": the names, Social Security numbers, last known addresses, and telephone numbers of the employees who had been asked to take the evaluation. Upon\n   learning that McLane used the evaluation nationwide, the EEOC expanded the scope of its investigation, both geographically (to focus on McLane's nationwide operations) and substantively (to investigate whether McLane had discriminated against its employees on the basis of age). It issued subpoenas requesting pedigree information as it related to its new investigation. But McLane refused to provide the pedigree information, and so the EEOC filed two actions in Federal District Court-one arising out of Ochoa's charge and one arising out of a separate age-discrimination charge the EEOC itself had filed-seeking enforcement of its subpoenas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The enforcement actions were assigned to the same District Judge, who, after a hearing, declined to enforce the subpoenas to the extent that they sought the pedigree information.

In the mine run of cases, the district court's decision whether to enforce a subpoena will turn either on whether the evidence sought is relevant to the specific charge before it or whether the subpoena is unduly burdensome in light of the circumstances. Both tasks are well suited to a district judge's expertise. The decision whether evidence sought is relevant requires the district court to evaluate the relationship between the particular materials sought and the particular matter under investigation-an analysis \"variable in relation\n   to the nature, purposes and scope of the inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v.

Even accepting\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   ' view of the district court's task, however, this understanding of abuse-of-discretion review is\n   too narrow. As commentators have observed, abuse-of-discretion review is employed not only where a decisionmaker has \"a wide range of choice as to what he decides, free from the constraints which characteristically attach whenever legal rules enter the decision[making] process\"; it is also employed where the trial judge's decision is given \"an unusual amount of insulation from appellate revision\" for functional reasons.
