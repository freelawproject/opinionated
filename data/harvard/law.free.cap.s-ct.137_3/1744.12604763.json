Eventually, Congress stepped in to provide\n   a degree of national uniformity, passing the first federal legislation protecting trademarks in 1870. See Act of July 8, 1870, \u00a7\u00a7 77-84,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20Stat.%20210\">\n    16 Stat. 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -212. The foundation of current federal trademark law is the Lanham Act, enacted in 1946.

By that time, trademark had expanded far beyond phrases that do no more than identify a good or service. Then, as now, trademarks often consisted of catchy phrases that convey a message.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under the Lanham Act, trademarks that are \"used in commerce\" may be placed on the \"principal register,\" that is, they may be federally registered.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201051\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

This system of federal registration helps to ensure that trademarks are fully protected and supports the free flow of commerce. \"[N]ational protection of trademarks is desirable,\" we have explained, \"because trademarks foster competition and the maintenance of quality by securing to the producer the benefits of good reputation.\"\n   <em>\n    San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v.

See 3 McCarthy \u00a7 19:8. And an unregistered trademark can be enforced against would-be infringers in several ways. Most important, even if a trademark is not federally registered, it may still be enforceable under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, which creates a federal cause of action for trademark infringement.

We thus begin by explaining why Tam's argument about the definition of \"persons\" in the Lanham Act is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As noted, the disparagement clause prohibits the registration of trademarks \"which may disparage ... persons, living or dead.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Tam points to a definition of \"person\" in the Lanham Act, which provides that \"[i]n the construction of this chapter, unless the contrary is plainly apparent from the context ... [t]he term 'person' and any other word or term used to designate the applicant or other entitled to a benefit or privilege or rendered liable under the provisions of this chapter includes a juristic person as well as a natural person.\" \u00a7 1127. Because racial and ethnic groups are neither natural nor \"juristic\" persons,\n   Tam asserts, these groups fall outside this definition. Brief for Respondent 46-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Tam's argument is refuted by the plain terms of the disparagement clause. The clause applies to marks that disparage \"persons.\" A mark that disparages a \"substantial\" percentage of the members of a racial or ethnic group, Trademark Manual \u00a7 1203.03(b)(i), at 1200-150, necessarily disparages many \"persons,\" namely, members of that group. Tam's argument would fail even if the clause used the singular term \"person,\" but Congress' use of the plural \"persons\" makes the point doubly clear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Tam's narrow reading of the term \"persons\" also clashes with the breadth of the disparagement clause. By its terms, the clause applies to marks that disparage, not just \"persons,\" but also \"institutions\" and \"beliefs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). It thus applies to the members of any group whose members share particular \"beliefs,\" such as political, ideological, and religious groups. It applies to marks that denigrate \"institutions,\" and on Tam's reading, it also reaches \"juristic\" persons such as corporations, unions, and other unincorporated associations. See \u00a7 1127. Thus, the clause is not limited to marks that disparage a particular natural person. If Congress had wanted to confine the reach of the disparagement clause in the way that Tam suggests, it would have been easy to do so. A neighboring provision of the Lanham Act denies registration to any trademark that \"[c]onsists of or comprises a name, portrait, or signature identifying a\n   <em>\n    particular living individual\n   </em>\n   except by his written consent.\" \u00a7 1052(c) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Tam contends that his interpretation of the disparagement clause is supported by its legislative history and by the PTO's willingness for many years to register marks that plainly denigrated African-Americans and Native Americans. These arguments are unpersuasive. As always, our inquiry into the meaning of the statute's text ceases when \"the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnhart v.

Here, it is clear that the prohibition against registering trademarks \"which may disparage ... persons,\" \u00a7 1052(a), prohibits registration of terms that disparage persons who share a common race or ethnicity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Even if resort to legislative history and early enforcement practice were appropriate, we would find Tam's arguments unconvincing. Tam has not brought to our attention any evidence in the legislative history showing that Congress meant to adopt his interpretation. And the practice of the PTO in the years following the enactment of the disparagement clause is unenlightening. The admitted vagueness of the disparagement test\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the huge\n   volume of applications have produced a haphazard record of enforcement. (Even today, the principal register is replete with marks that many would regard as disparaging to racial and ethnic groups.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Registration of the offensive marks that Tam cites is likely attributable not to the acceptance of his interpretation of the clause but to other factors-most likely the regrettable attitudes and sensibilities of the time in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because the disparagement clause applies to marks that disparage the members of a racial or ethnic group, we must decide whether the clause violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. And at the outset, we must consider three arguments that would either eliminate any First Amendment protection or result in highly permissive rational-basis review. Specifically, the Government contends (1) that trademarks are government speech, not private speech, (2) that trademarks are a form of government subsidy, and (3) that the constitutionality of the disparagement clause should be tested under a new \"government-program\" doctrine. We address each of these arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The First Amendment prohibits Congress and other government entities and actors from \"abridging the freedom of speech\"; the First Amendment does not say that Congress and other government entities must abridge their own ability to speak freely.

During the Second World War, the Federal Government produced and distributed millions of posters to promote the war effort.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   There were posters urging enlistment, the purchase of war bonds, and the conservation of scarce resources.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   These posters expressed a viewpoint, but the First Amendment did not demand that the Government balance the message of these posters by producing and distributing posters encouraging Americans to refrain from engaging in these activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   But while the government-speech doctrine is important-indeed, essential-it is a doctrine that is susceptible to dangerous misuse. If private speech could be passed off as government speech by simply affixing a government seal of approval, government could silence or muffle the expression of disfavored viewpoints. For this reason, we must exercise great caution before extending our government-speech precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At issue here is the content of trademarks that are registered by the PTO, an arm of the Federal Government. The Federal Government does not dream up these marks, and it does not edit marks submitted for registration. Except as required by the statute involved here,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), an examiner may not reject a mark based on the viewpoint that it appears to express. Thus, unless that section is thought to apply, an examiner does not inquire whether any viewpoint conveyed by a mark is consistent with Government policy or whether any such viewpoint is consistent with that expressed by other marks already on the principal register. Instead, if the mark meets the Lanham Act's viewpoint-neutral requirements, registration is mandatory.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (requiring that \"[n]o trademark ... shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless\" it falls within an enumerated statutory exception). And if an examiner finds that a mark is eligible for placement on the principal register, that decision is not reviewed by any higher official unless the registration is challenged.

If the federal registration of a trademark makes the mark government speech, the Federal Government is babbling prodigiously and incoherently. It is saying many unseemly things. See App. to Brief for Pro-Football, Inc., as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   . It is expressing contradictory views.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is unashamedly endorsing a vast array of commercial products and services. And it is providing Delphic advice to the consuming public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For example, if trademarks represent government speech, what does the Government have in mind when it advises Americans to \"make.believe\" (Sony),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Think different\" (Apple),\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Just do it\" (Nike),\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   or \"Have it your way\" (Burger King)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   ?

Governments have used monuments to speak to the public since ancient times; parks have traditionally been selective in accepting and displaying donated monuments; parks would be overrun if they were obligated to accept all monuments offered by private groups; \"[p]ublic parks are often closely identified in the public mind with the government unit that owns the land\"; and \"[t]he monuments that are accepted ... are meant to\n   convey and have the effect of conveying a government message.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Trademarks share none of these characteristics.

And there is no evidence that the public associates the contents of trademarks with the Federal Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This brings us to the case on which the Government relies most heavily,\n   <em>\n    Walker,\n   </em>\n   which likely marks the outer bounds of the government-speech doctrine. Holding that the messages on Texas specialty license plates are government speech, the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   Court cited three factors distilled from\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   . 576 U.S., at ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587403\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1293/#p1299\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2246-2247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, license plates have long been used by the States to convey state messages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587403\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1293/#p1299\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587403\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1293/#p1299\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2248-2249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, license plates \"are often closely identified in the public mind\" with the State, since they are manufactured and owned by the State, generally designed by the State, and serve as a form of \"government ID.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587403\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1293/#p1299\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587403\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1293/#p1299\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

As explained above, none of these factors are present in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, the federal registration of trademarks is vastly different from the beef ads in\n   <em>\n    Johanns,\n   </em>\n   the monuments in\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   and even the specialty license plates in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   . Holding that the registration of a trademark converts the mark into government speech would constitute a huge and dangerous extension of the government-speech doctrine. For if the registration of trademarks constituted government speech, other systems of government registration could easily be characterized in the same way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Perhaps the most worrisome implication of the Government's argument concerns the system of copyright registration. If federal registration makes a trademark government speech and thus eliminates all First Amendment protection, would the registration of the copyright for a book produce a similar transformation?

The Government and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   supporting its position argue that all trademarks are commercial speech. They note that the central purposes of trademarks are commercial and that federal law regulates trademarks to promote fair and orderly interstate commerce. Tam and his\n   <em>\n    amici,\n   </em>\n   on the other hand, contend that many, if not all, trademarks have an expressive component. In other words, these trademarks do not simply identify the source of a product or service but go on to say something more, either about the product or service or some broader issue. The trademark in this case illustrates this point. The name \"The Slants\" not only identifies the band but expresses a view about social issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We need not resolve this debate between the parties because the disparagement clause cannot withstand even\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson,\n   </em>\n   a restriction of speech must serve \"a substantial interest,\" and it must be \"narrowly drawn.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/\">\n    at 564-565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

The disparagement clause fails this requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   It is claimed that the disparagement clause serves two interests. The first is phrased in a variety of ways in the briefs. Echoing language in one of the opinions below, the Government asserts an interest in preventing \" 'underrepresented groups' \" from being \" 'bombarded with demeaning messages in commercial advertising.' \" Brief for Petitioner 48 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366496\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/1321/#p1331\">\n    808 F.3d, at 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dyk, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).

But no matter how the point is phrased, its unmistakable thrust is this: The Government has an interest in preventing speech expressing ideas that offend. And, as we have explained, that idea strikes at the heart of the First Amendment. Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express \"the thought that we hate.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366496\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/1321/#p1331\">\n    808 F.3d, at 1379-1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Reyna, J., dissenting); Brief for Petitioner 49; Brief for Native American Organizations as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   18-21. Commerce, we are told, is disrupted by trademarks that \"involv[e] disparagement of race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and similar demographic classification.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366496\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/1321/#p1331\">\n    808 F.3d, at 1380-1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of Reyna, J.). Such trademarks are analogized to discriminatory conduct, which has been recognized to have an adverse effect on commerce. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366496\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/1321/#p1331\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Brief for Petitioner 49; Brief for Native American Organizations as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   18-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   A simple answer to this argument is that the disparagement clause is not \"narrowly\n   drawn\" to drive out trademarks that support invidious discrimination. The clause reaches any trademark that disparages\n   <em>\n    any person, group, or institution\n   </em>\n   . It applies to trademarks like the following: \"Down with racists,\" \"Down with sexists,\" \"Down with homophobes.\" It is not an anti-discrimination clause; it is a happy-talk clause. In this way, it goes much further than is necessary to serve the interest asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The clause is far too broad in other ways as well. The clause protects every person living or dead as well as every institution. Is it conceivable that commerce would be disrupted by a trademark saying: \"James Buchanan was a disastrous president\" or \"Slavery is an evil institution\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   There is also a deeper problem with the argument that commercial speech may be cleansed of any expression likely to cause offense. The commercial market is well stocked with merchandise that disparages prominent figures and groups, and the line between commercial and non-commercial speech is not always clear, as this case illustrates. If affixing the commercial label permits the suppression of any speech that may lead to political or social \"volatility,\" free speech would be endangered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For these reasons, we hold that the disparagement clause violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. The judgment of the Federal Circuit is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Justice GORSUCH took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Justice KENNEDY, with whom Justice GINSBURG, Justice SOTOMAYOR, and Justice KAGAN join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has denied the substantial benefits of federal trademark registration to the mark THE SLANTS.

The Government's action and the statute on which it is based cannot survive this scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court is correct in its judgment, and I join Parts I, II, and III-A of its opinion. This separate writing explains in greater detail why the First Amendment's protections against viewpoint discrimination apply to the trademark here. It submits further that the viewpoint discrimination rationale renders unnecessary any extended treatment of other questions raised by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Those few categories of speech that the government can regulate or punish-for instance, fraud, defamation, or incitement-are well established within our constitutional tradition. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stevens,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582194,12448252\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/460/\">\n    559 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582194,12448252\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/460/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582194,12448252\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/460/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Aside from these and a few other narrow exceptions, it is a fundamental principle of the First Amendment that the government may not punish or suppress speech based on disapproval of the ideas or perspectives the speech conveys.

See\n   <em>\n    Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p806\">\n    473 U.S. 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 806,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p806\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p806\">\n    87 L.Ed.2d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) (\"[T]he government violates the First Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject\"). In the instant case, the disparagement clause the Government now seeks to implement and enforce identifies the relevant subject as \"persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Within that category, an applicant may register a positive or benign mark but not a derogatory one. The law thus reflects the Government's disapproval of a subset of messages it finds offensive. This is the essence of viewpoint discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Government disputes this conclusion. It argues, to begin with, that the law is viewpoint neutral because it applies in equal measure to any trademark that demeans or offends. This misses the point. A subject that is first defined by content and then regulated or censored by mandating only one sort of comment is not viewpoint neutral. To prohibit all sides from criticizing their opponents makes a law more viewpoint based, not less so. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p831\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p831\">\n    at 831-832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p831\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The ... declaration that debate is not skewed so long as multiple voices are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewed in multiple ways\"). The logic of the Government's rule is that a law would be viewpoint neutral even if it provided that public officials could be praised but not condemned. The First Amendment's viewpoint neutrality principle protects more than the right to identify with a particular side. It protects the right to create and present arguments for particular positions in particular ways, as the speaker chooses. By mandating positivity, the law here might silence dissent and distort the marketplace of ideas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Government next suggests that the statute is viewpoint neutral because the disparagement clause applies to trademarks regardless of the applicant's personal views or reasons for using the mark. Instead, registration is denied based on the expected reaction of the applicant's audience. In this way, the argument goes, it cannot be said that Government is acting with hostility toward a particular point of view. For example, the Government does not dispute that respondent seeks to use his mark in a positive way. Indeed, respondent endeavors to use The Slants to supplant a racial epithet, using new insights, musical talents, and wry humor to make it a badge of pride. Respondent's application was denied not because the Government thought his object was to demean or offend but because the Government thought his trademark would have that effect on at least some Asian-Americans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Government may not insulate a law from charges of viewpoint discrimination by tying censorship to the reaction of the speaker's audience. The Court has suggested\n   that viewpoint discrimination occurs when the government intends to suppress a speaker's beliefs,\n   <em>\n    Reed,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2230\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ---- - ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2229-2230, but viewpoint discrimination need not take that form in every instance. The danger of viewpoint discrimination is that the government is attempting to remove certain ideas or perspectives from a broader debate. That danger is all the greater if the ideas or perspectives are ones a particular audience might think offensive, at least at first hearing. An initial reaction may prompt further reflection, leading to a more reasoned, more tolerant position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Indeed, a speech burden based on audience reactions is simply government hostility and intervention in a different guise. The speech is targeted, after all, based on the government's disapproval of the speaker's choice of message. And it is the government itself that is attempting in this case to decide whether the relevant audience would find the speech offensive. For reasons like these, the Court's cases have long prohibited the government from justifying a First Amendment burden by pointing to the offensiveness of the speech to be suppressed. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1763 - 1764 (collecting examples).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Government's argument in defense of the statute assumes that respondent's mark is a negative comment. In addressing that argument on its own terms, this opinion is not intended to imply that the Government's interpretation is accurate. From respondent's submissions, it is evident he would disagree that his mark means what the Government says it does. The trademark will have the effect, respondent urges, of reclaiming an offensive term for the positive purpose of celebrating all that Asian-Americans can and do contribute to our diverse Nation. Brief for Respondent 1-4, 42-43. While thoughtful persons can agree or disagree with this approach, the dissonance between the trademark's potential to teach and the Government's insistence on its own, opposite, and negative interpretation confirms the constitutional vice of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The parties dispute whether trademarks are commercial speech and whether trademark registration should be considered a federal subsidy. The former issue may turn on whether certain commercial concerns for the protection of trademarks might, as a general matter, be the basis for regulation. However that issue is resolved, the viewpoint based discrimination at issue here necessarily invokes heightened scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \"Commercial speech is no exception,\" the Court has explained, to the principle that the First Amendment \"requires heightened scrutiny whenever the government creates a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\"\n   <em>\n    Sorrell v.
