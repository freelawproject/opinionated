Whoever engages in one of these acts \"without authority\" from the patentee may face liability for patent infringement. \u00a7 271(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When a patentee sells one of its products, however, the patentee can no longer control that item through the patent laws-its patent rights are said to \"exhaust.\" The purchaser and all subsequent owners are free to use or resell the product just like any other item of personal property, without fear of an infringement lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case presents two questions about the scope of the patent exhaustion doctrine: First, whether a patentee that sells an item under an express restriction on the purchaser's right to reuse or resell the product may enforce that restriction through an infringement lawsuit. And second, whether a patentee exhausts its patent rights by selling its product outside the United States, where American patent laws do not apply. We conclude that a patentee's decision to sell a product exhausts all of its patent rights in that item, regardless of any restrictions the patentee purports to impose or the location of the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The underlying dispute in this case is about laser printers-or, more specifically, the cartridges that contain the powdery substance, known as toner, that laser printers use to make an image appear on paper. Respondent Lexmark International, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells toner cartridges to consumers in the United States and around the globe. It owns a number of patents that cover components of those cartridges and the manner in which they are used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When toner cartridges run out of toner they can be refilled and used again. This creates an opportunity for other companies-known as remanufacturers-to acquire empty Lexmark cartridges from purchasers in the United States and abroad, refill them with toner, and then resell them at a lower price than the new ones Lexmark puts on the shelves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Not blind to this business problem, Lexmark structures its sales in a way that encourages customers to return spent cartridges. It gives purchasers two options: One is to buy a toner cartridge at full price, with no strings attached. The other is to buy a cartridge at roughly 20-percent\n   off through Lexmark's \"Return Program.\" A customer who buys through the Return Program still owns the cartridge but, in exchange for the lower price, signs a contract agreeing to use it only once and to refrain from transferring the empty cartridge to anyone but Lexmark. To enforce this single-use/no-resale restriction, Lexmark installs a microchip on each Return Program cartridge that prevents reuse once the toner in the cartridge runs out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lexmark's strategy just spurred remanufacturers to get more creative. Many kept acquiring empty Return Program cartridges and developed methods to counteract the effect of the microchips. With that technological obstacle out of the way, there was little to prevent the remanufacturers from using the Return Program cartridges in their resale business. After all, Lexmark's contractual single-use/no-resale agreements were with the initial customers, not with downstream purchasers like the remanufacturers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lexmark, however, was not so ready to concede that its plan had been foiled. In 2010, it sued a number of remanufacturers, including petitioner Impression Products, Inc., for patent infringement with respect to two groups of cartridges. One group consists of Return Program cartridges that Lexmark sold within the United States. Lexmark argued that, because it expressly prohibited reuse and resale of these cartridges, the remanufacturers infringed the Lexmark patents when they refurbished and resold them. The other group consists of all toner cartridges that Lexmark sold abroad and that remanufacturers imported into the country. Lexmark claimed that it never gave anyone authority to import these cartridges, so the remanufacturers ran afoul of its patent rights by doing just that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Eventually, the lawsuit was whittled down to one defendant, Impression Products, and one defense: that Lexmark's sales, both in the United States and abroad, exhausted its patent rights in the cartridges, so Impression Products was free to refurbish and resell them, and to import them if acquired abroad. Impression Products filed separate motions to dismiss with respect to both groups of cartridges. The District Court granted the motion as to the domestic Return Program cartridges, but denied the motion as to the cartridges Lexmark sold abroad. Both parties appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Federal Circuit considered the appeals en banc and ruled for Lexmark with respect to both groups of cartridges. The court began with the Return Program cartridges that Lexmark sold in the United States. Relying on its decision in\n   <em>\n    Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11290058\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/976/700/\">\n    976 F.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), the Federal Circuit held that a patentee may sell an item and retain the right to enforce, through patent infringement lawsuits, \"clearly communicated, ... lawful restriction[s] as to post-sale use or resale.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n    816 F.3d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735 (2016). The exhaustion doctrine, the court reasoned, derives from the prohibition on making, using, selling, or importing items \"without authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n    at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). When you purchase an item you presumptively also acquire the authority to use or resell the item freely, but that is just a presumption; the same authority does not run with the item when the seller restricts post-sale use or resale.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n    816 F.3d, at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the parties agreed that Impression Products knew about Lexmark's restrictions and that those restrictions did not violate any laws, the Federal Circuit concluded that Lexmark's sales had not exhausted all of its patent rights, and that the company could sue for infringement when Impression Products refurbished\n   and resold Return Program cartridges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As for the cartridges that Lexmark sold abroad, the Federal Circuit once again looked to its precedent. In\n   <em>\n    Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade Commission,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9486197\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/1094/\">\n    264 F.3d 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), the court had held that a patentee's decision to sell a product abroad did not terminate its ability to bring an infringement suit against a buyer that \"import[ed] the article and [sold] ... it in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n    816 F.3d, at 726-727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That rule, the court concluded, makes good sense: Exhaustion is justified when a patentee receives \"the reward available from [selling in] American markets,\" which does not occur when the patentee sells overseas, where the American patent offers no protection and therefore cannot bolster the price of the patentee's goods.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n    at 760-761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, Lexmark was free to exercise its patent rights to sue Impression Products for bringing the foreign-sold cartridges to market in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Judge Dyk, joined by Judge Hughes, dissented. In their view, selling the Return Program cartridges in the United States exhausted Lexmark's patent rights in those items because any \"authorized sale of a patented article ... free[s] the article from any restrictions on use or sale based on the patent laws.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n    at 775-776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As for the foreign cartridges, the dissenters would have held that a sale abroad also results in exhaustion, unless the seller \"explicitly reserve[s] [its] United States patent rights\" at the time of sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n    at 774, 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Lexmark failed to make such an express reservation, its foreign sales exhausted its patent rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We granted certiorari to consider the Federal Circuit's decisions with respect to both domestic and international exhaustion, 580 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12608512,12608513,12608514,12608515,12608516,12608511\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/546/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=196%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20442\">\n    196 L.Ed.2d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), and now reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First up are the Return Program cartridges that Lexmark sold in the United States. We conclude that Lexmark exhausted its patent rights in these cartridges the moment it sold them. The single-use/no-resale restrictions in Lexmark's contracts with customers may have been clear and enforceable under contract law, but they do not entitle Lexmark to retain patent rights in an item that it has elected to sell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Patent Act grants patentees the \"right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling [their] invention[s].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). For over 160 years, the doctrine of patent exhaustion has imposed a limit on that right to exclude. See\n   <em>\n    Bloomer v.

The limit functions automatically: When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that product \"is no longer within the limits of the monopoly\" and instead becomes the \"private, individual property\" of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3478501\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/55/539/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3478501\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/55/539/\">\n    at 549-550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England \u00a7 360, p. 223 (1628); see J.

Congress enacted and has repeatedly revised the Patent Act against the backdrop of the hostility toward restraints on alienation. That enmity is reflected in the exhaustion doctrine.

Take a shop that restores and sells used cars. The business works because the shop can rest assured that, so long as those bringing in the cars own them, the shop is free to repair and resell those vehicles. That smooth flow of commerce would sputter if companies that make the thousands of parts that go into a vehicle could keep their patent rights after the first sale. Those companies might, for instance, restrict resale rights and sue the shop owner for patent infringement. And even if they refrained from imposing such restrictions, the very threat of patent liability would force the shop to invest in efforts to protect itself from hidden lawsuits. Either way, extending the patent rights beyond the first sale would clog the channels of commerce, with little benefit from the extra control that the patentees retain.

There, a company that made eyeglass lenses authorized an agent to sell its products to wholesalers and retailers only if they promised to market the lenses at fixed prices. The Government filed an antitrust lawsuit, and the company defended its arrangement on the ground that it was exercising authority under the Patent Act. We held that the initial sales \"relinquish [ed] ... the patent monopoly with respect to the article[s] sold,\" so the \"stipulation ... fixing resale prices derive[d] no support from the patent and must stand on the same footing\" as restrictions on unpatented goods.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368147\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/241/#p250\">\n    316 U.S., at 249-251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368147\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/241/#p250\">\n    62 S.Ct. 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   It is true that\n   <em>\n    Boston Store\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Univis\n   </em>\n   involved resale price restrictions that, at the time of those decisions, violated the antitrust laws. But in both cases it was the sale of the items, rather than the illegality of the restrictions, that prevented the patentees from enforcing those resale price agreements through patent infringement suits. And if there were any lingering doubt that patent exhaustion applies even when a sale is subject to an express, otherwise lawful restriction, our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   settled the matter. In that case, a technology company-with authorization from the patentee-sold microprocessors under contracts requiring purchasers to use those processors with other parts that the company manufactured. One buyer disregarded the restriction, and the patentee sued for infringement. Without so much as mentioning the lawfulness of the contract, we held that the patentee could not bring an infringement suit because the \"authorized sale ... took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674197\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/617/#p625\">\n    553 U.S., at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674197\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/617/#p625\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Turning to the case at hand, we conclude that this well-settled line of precedent allows for only one answer: Lexmark cannot bring a patent infringement suit against Impression Products to enforce the single-use/no-resale provision accompanying its Return Program cartridges.

The \"exhaustion doctrine,\" the court believed, \"must be understood as an interpretation of\" the infringement statute, which prohibits anyone from using or selling a patented article \"without authority\" from the patentee.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n    816 F.3d, at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). Exhaustion reflects a default rule that a patentee's decision to sell an item \"\n   <em>\n    presumptively\n   </em>\n   grant[s] 'authority' to the purchaser to use it and resell it.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n    816 F.3d, at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, the Federal Circuit explained, the patentee does not have to hand over the full \"bundle\n   of rights\" every time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n    at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

The right to use, sell, or import an item exists independently of the Patent Act. What a patent adds-and grants exclusively to the patentee-is a limited right to prevent others from engaging in those practices. See\n   <em>\n    Crown Die &amp; Tool Co. v. Nye Tool &amp; Machine Works,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6136861\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/261/24/#p35\">\n    261 U.S. 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6136861\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/261/24/#p35\">\n    43 S.Ct. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6136861\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/261/24/#p35\">\n    67 L.Ed. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1923). Exhaustion extinguishes that exclusionary power. See\n   <em>\n    Bloomer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3478501\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/55/539/\">\n    14 How., at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the purchaser \"exercises no rights created by the act of Congress, nor does he derive title to [the item] by virtue of the ... exclusive privilege granted to the patentee\"). As a result, the sale transfers the right to use, sell, or import because those are the rights that come along with ownership, and the buyer is free and clear of an infringement lawsuit because there is no exclusionary right left to enforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Federal Circuit also expressed concern that preventing patentees from reserving patent rights when they sell goods would create an artificial distinction between such sales and sales by licensees. Patentees, the court explained, often license others to make and sell their products, and may place restrictions on those licenses. A computer developer could, for instance, license a manufacturer to make its patented devices and sell them only for non-commercial use by individuals. If a licensee breaches the license by selling a computer for commercial use, the patentee can sue the licensee for infringement. And, in the Federal Circuit's view, our decision in\n   <em>\n    General Talking PicturesCorp. v. Western Elec. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10650\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/175/\">\n    304 U.S. 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10650\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/175/\">\n    58 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10650\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/175/\">\n    82 L.Ed. 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , aff'd on reh'g,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138947\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/305/124/\">\n    305 U.S. 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138947\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/305/124/\">\n    59 S.Ct. 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138947\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/305/124/\">\n    83 L.Ed. 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1938), established that-when a patentee grants a license \"under clearly stated restrictions on post-sale activities\" of those who purchase products from the licensee-the patentee can\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   sue for infringement those purchasers who knowingly violate the restrictions.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176192\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/721/#p735\">\n    816 F.3d, at 743-744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If patentees can employ licenses to impose post-sale restrictions on purchasers that are enforceable through infringement suits, the court concluded, it would make little sense to prevent patentees from doing so when they sell directly to consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Federal Circuit's concern is misplaced. A patentee can impose restrictions on licensees because a license does not implicate the same concerns about restraints on alienation as a sale. Patent exhaustion reflects the principle that, when an item passes into commerce, it should not be shaded by a legal cloud on title as it moves through the marketplace. But a license is not about passing title to a product, it is about changing the contours of the patentee's monopoly: The patentee agrees not to exclude a licensee from making or selling the patented invention, expanding the club of authorized producers and sellers. See\n   <em>\n    General Elec. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501286\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/476/#p489\">\n    272 U.S., at 489-490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501286\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/476/#p489\">\n    47 S.Ct. 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the patentee is exchanging rights, not goods, it is free to relinquish only a portion of its bundle of patent protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A patentee's authority to limit\n   <em>\n    licensees\n   </em>\n   does not, as the Federal Circuit thought, mean that patentees can use licenses\n   to impose post-sale restrictions on\n   <em>\n    purchasers\n   </em>\n   that are enforceable through the patent laws. So long as a licensee complies with the license when selling an item, the patentee has, in effect, authorized the sale. That licensee's sale is treated, for purposes of patent exhaustion, as if the patentee made the sale itself. The result: The sale exhausts the patentee's rights in that item. See\n   <em>\n    Hobbie v. Jennison,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569324\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/149/355/#p362\">\n    149 U.S. 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 362-363,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569324\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/149/355/#p362\">\n    13 S.Ct. 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569324\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/149/355/#p362\">\n    37 L.Ed. 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1893). A license may require the licensee to impose a restriction on purchasers, like the license limiting the computer manufacturer to selling for non-commercial use by individuals. But if the licensee does so-by, perhaps, having each customer sign a contract promising not to use the computers in business-the sale nonetheless exhausts all patent rights in the item sold. See\n   <em>\n    Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692764\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/243/502/#p506\">\n    243 U.S. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506-507, 516,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692764\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/243/502/#p506\">\n    37 S.Ct. 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692764\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/243/502/#p506\">\n    61 L.Ed. 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1917). The purchasers might not comply with the restriction, but the only recourse for the licensee is through contract law, just as if the patentee itself sold the item with a restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    General Talking Pictures\n   </em>\n   involved a fundamentally different situation: There, a licensee \"knowingly ma[de] ... sales ...\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   the scope of its license.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10650\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/175/\">\n    304 U.S., at 181-182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10650\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/175/\">\n    58 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). We treated the sale \"as if no license whatsoever had been granted\" by the patentee, which meant that the patentee could sue both the licensee and the purchaser-who knew about the breach-for infringement.\n   <em>\n    General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Elec. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138947\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/305/124/\">\n    305 U.S. 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138947\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/305/124/\">\n    59 S.Ct. 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138947\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/305/124/\">\n    83 L.Ed. 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1938). This does not mean that patentees can use licenses to impose post-sale restraints on purchasers. Quite the contrary: The licensee infringed the patentee's rights because it did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   comply with the terms of its license, and the patentee could bring a patent suit against the purchaser only because the purchaser participated in the licensee's infringement.\n   <em>\n    General Talking Pictures,\n   </em>\n   then, stands for the modest principle that, if a patentee has not given authority for a licensee to make a sale, that sale cannot exhaust the patentee's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, patent exhaustion is uniform and automatic. Once a patentee decides to sell-whether on its own or through a licensee-that sale exhausts its patent rights, regardless of any post-sale restrictions the patentee purports to impose, either directly or through a license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Our conclusion that Lexmark exhausted its patent rights when it sold the domestic Return Program cartridges goes only halfway to resolving this case. Lexmark also sold toner cartridges abroad and sued Impression Products for patent infringement for \"importing [Lexmark's] invention into the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Lexmark contends that it may sue for infringement with respect to all of the imported cartridges-not just those in the Return Program-because a foreign sale does not trigger patent exhaustion unless the patentee \"expressly or implicitly transfer[s] or license[s]\" its rights. Brief for Respondent 36-37. The Federal Circuit agreed, but we do not. An authorized sale outside the United States, just as one within the United States, exhausts all rights under the Patent Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This question about international exhaustion of intellectual property rights has also arisen in the context of copyright law. Under the \"first sale doctrine,\" which is codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), when a copyright owner sells a lawfully made copy of its work, it loses the power to restrict the purchaser's freedom \"to sell or otherwise dispose of ... that copy.\" In\n   <em>\n    Kirtsaeng v.

A domestic sale, it argues, triggers exhaustion because the sale compensates the patentee for \"surrendering [those]\n   <em>\n    U.S.\n   </em>\n   rights.\" Brief for Respondent 38. A foreign sale is different: The Patent Act does not give patentees exclusionary powers abroad. Without those powers, a patentee selling in a foreign market may not be able to sell its product for the same price that it could in the United States, and therefore is not sure to receive \"the reward guaranteed by U.S. patent law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20154\">\n    at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

In short, there is no patent exhaustion from sales abroad because there are no patent rights abroad to exhaust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The territorial limit on patent rights is, however, no basis for distinguishing copyright protections; those protections\n   \"do not have any extraterritorial operation\" either. 5 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, Copyright \u00a7 17.02, p. 17-26 (2017). Nor does the territorial limit support the premise of Lexmark's argument. Exhaustion is a separate limit on the patent grant, and does not depend on the patentee receiving some undefined premium for selling the right to access the American market. A purchaser buys an item, not patent rights. And exhaustion is triggered by the patentee's decision to give that item up and receive whatever fee it decides is appropriate \"for the article and the invention which it embodies.\"\n   <em>\n    Univis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368147\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/241/#p250\">\n    316 U.S., at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368147\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/241/#p250\">\n    62 S.Ct. 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Graff,\n   </em>\n   decided over 125 years ago. All that case illustrates is that a sale abroad does not exhaust a patentee's rights when the patentee had nothing to do with the transaction.\n   <em>\n    Boesch\n   </em>\n   -from the days before the widespread adoption of electrical lighting-involved a retailer who purchased lamp burners from a manufacturer in Germany, with plans to sell them in the United States. The manufacturer had authority to make the burners under German law, but there was a hitch: Two individuals with no ties to the German manufacturer held the American patent to that invention. These patentees sued the retailer for infringement when the retailer imported the lamp burners into the United States, and we rejected the argument that the German manufacturer's sale had exhausted the American patentees' rights. The German manufacturer had no permission to sell in the United States from the American patentees, and the American patentees had not exhausted their patent rights in the products because they had not sold them to anyone, so \"purchasers from [the German manufacturer] could not be thereby authorized to sell the articles in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1129254\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/133/697/#p703\">\n    133 U.S. 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 703,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1129254\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/133/697/#p703\">\n    10 S.Ct. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1129254\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/133/697/#p703\">\n    33 L.Ed. 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1890).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Our decision did not, as Lexmark contends, exempt all foreign sales from patent exhaustion. See Brief for Respondent 44-45. Rather, it reaffirmed the basic premise that only the patentee can decide whether to make a sale that exhausts its patent rights in an item. The American patentees did not do so with respect to the German products, so the German sales did not exhaust their rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, the United States, as an\n   <em>\n    amicus,\n   </em>\n   advocates what it views as a middle-ground position: that \"a foreign sale authorized by the U.S. patentee exhausts U.S. patent rights unless those rights are expressly reserved.\" Brief for United States 7-8. Its position is largely based on policy rather than principle. The Government thinks that an overseas \"buyer's legitimate expectation\" is that a \"sale conveys all of the seller's interest in the patented article,\" so the presumption should be that a foreign sale triggers exhaustion.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 32-33. But, at the same time, \"lower courts long ago coalesced around\" the rule that \"a patentee's express reservation of U.S. patent rights at the time of a foreign sale will be given effect,\" so that option should remain open to the patentee.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 22 (emphasis deleted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Government has little more than \"long ago\" on its side. In the 1890s, two\n   circuit courts-in cases involving the same company-did hold that patentees may use express restrictions to reserve their patent rights in connection with foreign sales. See\n   <em>\n    Dickerson v. Tinling,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6725809\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/84/192/#p194\">\n    84 F. 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 194-195 (C.A.8 1897) ;\n   <em>\n    Dickerson v.

But no \"coalesc[ing]\" ever took place: Over the following hundred-plus years, only a smattering of lower court decisions mentioned this express-reservation rule for foreign sales. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    Sanofi, S.A. v. Med-Tech Veterinarian Prods., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565534\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/565/931/#p938\">\n    565 F.Supp. 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 938 (D.N.J.1983). And in 2001, the Federal Circuit adopted its blanket rule that foreign sales do not trigger exhaustion, even if the patentee fails to expressly reserve its rights.\n   <em>\n    Jazz Photo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9486197\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/1094/\">\n    264 F.3d, at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These sparse and inconsistent decisions provide no basis for any expectation, let alone a settled one, that patentees can reserve patent rights when they sell abroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The theory behind the Government's express-reservation rule also wrongly focuses on the likely expectations of the patentee and purchaser during a sale. Exhaustion does not arise because of the parties' expectations about how sales transfer patent rights. More is at stake when it comes to patents than simply the dealings between the parties, which can be addressed through contract law. Instead, exhaustion occurs because, in a sale, the patentee elects to give up title to an item in exchange for payment. Allowing patent rights to stick remora-like to that item as it flows through the market would violate the principle against restraints on alienation. Exhaustion does not depend on whether the patentee receives a premium for selling in the United States, or the type of rights that buyers expect to receive. As a result, restrictions and location are irrelevant; what matters is the patentee's decision to make a sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Justice GORSUCH took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-61\">\n   Justice GINSBURG, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   I concur in the Court's holding regarding domestic exhaustion-a patentee who sells a product with an express restriction on reuse or resale may not enforce that restriction through an infringement lawsuit, because the U.S. sale exhausts the U.S. patent rights in the product sold.
