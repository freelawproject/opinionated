The Government concedes that \"American judges have long made th [e] sorts of judgments\" called for by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \"in indeterminate-sentencing schemes, and this Court has never understood such discretionary determinations to raise vagueness concerns.\" Brief for United States 42. Because the \u00a7 3553 factors-like the Guidelines-do not mandate any specific sentences, but rather guide the exercise of a district court's discretion within the applicable statutory range, our holding today casts no doubt on their validity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Holding that the Guidelines are subject to vagueness challenges under the Due Process Clause, however, would cast serious doubt on their validity. Many of these other factors appear at least as unclear as \u00a7 4B1.2(a)'s residual clause. For example, courts must assess \"the need for the sentence imposed\" to achieve certain goals-such as to \"reflect the seriousness of the offense,\" \"promote respect for the law,\" \"provide just punishment for the offense,\" \"afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" and \"provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training ... in the most effective manner.\" \u00a7 3553(a)(2). If petitioner were correct that \u00a7 4B1.2(a)'s residual clause were subject to a vagueness challenge, we would be hard pressed to find these factors sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice and prevent arbitrary enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Government tries to have it both ways, arguing that the individualized sentencing required by the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors is different in kind from that required by the Guidelines. \"An inscrutably vague advisory guideline,\" it contends, \"injects arbitrariness into the sentencing process that is not found in the exercise of unguided discretion in a traditional sentencing system.\" Reply Brief for United States 10-11. But it is far from obvious that the residual clause implicates the twin concerns of vagueness any more than the statutory command that sentencing courts impose a sentence tailored, for example, \"to promote respect for the law.\" \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). And neither the Guidelines nor the other \u00a7 3553 factors implicate those concerns more than the absence of any guidance at all, which the Government concedes is constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Government also suggests that the Guidelines are not like the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors \"because they require a court to decide whether the facts of the case satisfy\n   a legal standard in order to derive a specific numerical range.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 22. But that does not distinguish the other sentencing factors, which require courts to do the same thing. Section 3553(a) states that district courts \"shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [ \u00a7 3553(a)(2) ].\" In fact, the Guidelines generally offer more concrete advice in imposing a particular sentence and make it easier to review whether a court has abused its substantial discretion. There is no sound reason to conclude that the Guidelines-but not \u00a7 3553(a)'s other sentencing factors-are amenable to vagueness review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because the advisory Sentencing Guidelines are not subject to a due process vagueness challenge, \u00a7 4B1.2(a)'s residual clause is not void for vagueness.

In that instance, a litigant might use the word vague in a general sense-that is to say, imprecise or unclear-in trying to establish that the sentencing decision was flawed. That something is vague as a general matter, however, does not necessarily mean that it is vague within the well-established legal meaning of that term. And it seems most unlikely that the definitional structure used to explain vagueness in the context of fair warning to a transgressor, or of preventing arbitrary enforcement, is, by automatic transference, applicable to the subject of sentencing where judicial discretion is involved as distinct from a statutory command.

And when Guidelines ranges change-because the Guidelines themselves change, or because the court is informed of an error it made in applying them-sentences change, too.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Molina-Martinez,\n   </em>\n   578 U.S., at ----, 136 S.Ct., at 1346 ;\n   <em>\n    Peugh,\n   </em>\n   569 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 2084-2085.

First, a district court's reliance on such a Guideline deprives an ordinary person of \"fair notice\" of the consequences of his actions. See\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2556. A defendant is entitled to understand the legal rules that will determine his sentence. But a vague Guideline is by definition impossible to understand. Take the career-offender Guideline at issue here. We explained in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   that the\n   identically worded provision in the ACCA created \"pervasive disagreement\" among courts imposing sentences as to \"the nature of the inquiry\" that they were required to conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2560. The result was a law that was \" 'nearly impossible to apply consistently.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chambers v.

An ordinary person cannot be expected to understand the consequences that such a shapeless provision will have on his sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, and more importantly, a district court's reliance on a vague Guideline creates a serious risk of \"arbitrary enforcement.\" See\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2556. As set out above, although the Guidelines do not bind a district court as a\n   <em>\n    formal\n   </em>\n   matter, as a\n   <em>\n    functional\n   </em>\n   matter they \"anchor both the district court's discretion and the appellate review process.\"\n   <em>\n    Peugh,\n   </em>\n   569 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 2087. It introduces an unacceptable degree of arbitrariness into sentencing proceedings to begin by applying a rule that is so vague that efforts to interpret it boil down to \"guesswork and intuition.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2559. One judge may conduct a statistical analysis to decide that a defendant's crime of conviction is not a crime of violence. Another may rely on gut instinct to conclude that it is. Still a third may \"throw [our] opinions into the air in frustration, and give free rein to [her] own feelings\" in making the decision.\n   <em>\n    Derby v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451073,4335154,12451074,4337399\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/1047/\">\n    564 U.S. 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1049,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451074\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/180/904/12451074/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451072,12451073,12451074\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/180/904/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Importantly, that decision is the end of the ballgame for a criminal defendant. Although he may ask the judge to vary downward from the Guidelines range, he must take the range as the starting point for his request. He may ask for a month here or a month there, but he is negotiating from a baseline he cannot control or predict. The result is a sentencing proceeding hopelessly skewed from the outset by \"unpredictability and arbitrariness.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2558. The Due Process Clause does not tolerate such a proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Consider, by way of example, a hypothetical version of Beckles' own sentencing proceeding in which the commentary played no clarifying role. Beckles was convicted of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), and sentenced to 360 months in prison. That sentence sat at the bottom end of the applicable Guidelines range, factoring in the career-offender Guideline: 360 months to life. But had the career-offender Guideline\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   applied to Beckles, the Guidelines range calculated by the District Court would have been significantly lower: 262 to 327 months. See\n   <em>\n    Beckles v. United States,\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 10-23517 (S.D.Fla., Mar. 4, 2013), App. 129-130. Absent that Guideline, Beckles would have been sentenced to between 33 and 98 fewer months in prison. The District Court admitted as much, explaining that had the Guideline not applied, she \"would not have imprisoned Beckles to 360 months\" in prison.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis deleted). Years of\n   Beckles' life thus turned solely on whether the career-offender Guideline applied. There is no meaningful way in which the Guideline exerted less effect on Beckles' sentence than did the statute setting his minimum and maximum terms of imprisonment; indeed, it was the Guidelines, not just the statute, that \"fix[ed]\" Beckles' \"sentenc[e]\" in every meaningful way.\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2556-2557. Nothing of substance, in other words, distinguishes the Guidelines from the kind of laws we held susceptible to vagueness challenges in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ; both law and Guideline alike operate to extend the time a person spends in prison. The Due Process Clause should apply equally to each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The majority brushes past this logic in its decision to shield the Guidelines from vagueness challenges. In doing so, it casts our sentencing jurisprudence into doubt and upends the law of nearly every Court of Appeals to have considered this question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of its explanations justify its novel and sweeping conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The majority first reasons that the Guidelines are not susceptible to vagueness challenges because they \"do not fix the permissible range of sentences,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 892, but merely \"guide district courts in exercising their discretion,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 894. But we have not embraced such formalism before, and the majority provides no coherent justification for its decision to do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Indeed, we have refused before to apply exactly the formalistic distinction that the majority now embraces.

The factor was unconstitutional, we explained, notwithstanding the fact that only the jury, not the judge, was instructed on the factor; that the judge, not the jury, made the final decision to sentence the defendant to death; and that the judge, in doing so, was not required to defer to the jury's recommendation. \"This kind of indirect weighing of an invalid aggravating factor,\" we explained, \"creates the same potential for arbitrariness as the direct weighing of an invalid aggravating factor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480933\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1079/#p1082\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480933\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1079/#p1082\">\n    at 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480933\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1079/#p1082\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, we effectively rejected just the argument the majority now embraces: that advisory guidelines lack the kind of binding legal effect that subject them to constitutional scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   If there were any doubt that advisory sentencing guidelines are subject to constitutional limits, we dispelled it in\n   <em>\n    Peugh,\n   </em>\n   where we held that the Guidelines are amenable to challenges under the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause. See 569 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 2077-2078. There, the Government argued that the \"advisory\" nature of the Guidelines rendered them immune from such claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 2081-2082. But we rejected such an argument. \"The federal system,\" we explained, \"adopts procedural measures intended\n   to make the Guidelines the lodestone of sentencing,\" and \"considerable empirical evidence indicate[s] that the ... Guidelines have the intended effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at ---- - ----, 133 S.Ct., at 2084. We declined the Government's invitation to limit our\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence to rules that, as a formal matter, \"increase[d] the maximum sentence for which a defendant is eligible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 2081. And we explained that a rule may exert \" 'binding legal effect' through ... procedural rules and standards for appellate review that, in combination, encourag[e] district courts to sentence within the guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 2086. It was not true, we concluded, that \"the Guidelines are too much like guideposts and not enough like fences,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; instead, the Guidelines were just fencelike enough-just lawlike enough-that they cannot be shielded from the Constitution's reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The same principle should dictate the same result in this case. How can the Guidelines carry sufficient legal weight to warrant scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment and the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause, but not enough to warrant scrutiny under the Due Process Clause? Cf.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The majority offers no convincing answer. It asserts that the Due Process Clause \"requires a different inquiry\" than these provisions do.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 895. But it does not explain why it views this as relevant to the constitutional status of the Guidelines. A court considering a challenge to a criminal statute under the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause will apply a different legal standard than will a court considering a vagueness challenge to the same statute; that does not make the statute more or less susceptible to constitutional challenge in one context than the other. Our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Peugh\n   </em>\n   is particularly difficult for the majority to escape, given that the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause, like the Due Process Clause's prohibition against vagueness, is rooted in concerns about \"fair warning\" and \" 'fundamental fairness.' \" 569 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 2085 (plurality opinion). The majority musters no persuasive explanation for why those concerns would have less force in this context than in that one. That is because none exists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The majority next posits that because courts have long sentenced defendants under purely discretionary regimes, there can be no vagueness concern with any system that, like the Guidelines regime, sets guideposts on the exercise of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 892 - 894. But this argument fundamentally misunderstands the problem caused by a court's reliance on a vague sentencing guideline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   True enough, for many years, federal courts relied on \"a system of indeterminate sentencing\" in criminal cases.\n   <em>\n    Mistretta,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p363\">\n    488 U.S., at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p363\">\n    109 S.Ct. 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also K. Stith &amp; J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9-14 (1998). Under such a scheme, a sentencing judge considers the full range\n   of relevant aggravating and mitigating facts and circumstances, as well as his view of proper sentencing policy, and then imposes a sentence in light of those considerations.

As the majority notes, no party here \"suggests that a system of purely discretionary sentencing could be subject to a vagueness challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 893. The majority reasons that the Guidelines-which limit the sentencing judge's discretion from what he otherwise would have enjoyed-must therefore also be immune from vagueness attacks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730168\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/81/#p113\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   But the majority misapprehends the nature of the constitutional infirmity that occurs when a sentencing judge relies on an inscrutably vague guideline. A defendant who is sentenced under a purely discretionary regime does not face the prospect of \"arbitrary enforcement\" by the sentencing judge,\n   <em>\n    Kolender,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298570\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/352/#p357\">\n    461 U.S., at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298570\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/352/#p357\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; rather, he faces a fact- and context-sensitive determination informed by the exercise of reasoned judgment. A defendant sentenced pursuant to an impossibly vague Guideline, by contrast, is put in an untenable position. The \"lodestone\" of his sentence-the baseline against which the district court will assess his characteristics and his conduct-is set by a rule that is impossible to understand. Such a proceeding is the antithesis of due process. See\n   <em>\n    Giaccio v.

It is not reliance on discretion that makes a sentencing regime vague; it is reliance on an impenetrable rule as a baseline for the exercise of that discretion. Reliance on a rule of this kind, whether set out in a statute or in a Guideline, does not comport with \" 'ordinary notions of fair play.' \"\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2557.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The majority ends by speculating that permitting vagueness attacks on the Guidelines would call into question the validity of many Guidelines, and even the factors that Congress has instructed courts to consider in imposing sentences. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 895 - 896. In doing so, the majority once more resuscitates arguments we have already considered and dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   confronted and rejected a version of this argument. There, the Government contended that \"dozens of federal and state criminal laws use terms like 'substantial risk,' 'grave risk,' and 'unreasonable risk,' \" terms that-in its view-were indistinguishable from the residual clause at issue in that case. 576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2561. We rejected the argument, explaining that such rules \"call[ed] for the application of a qualitative standard such as 'substantial risk' to real-world conduct; 'the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly ... some matter of degree.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nash v.

What rendered the ACCA's residual clause unconstitutionally vague, we explained, was not that it required \"gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages\n   <em>\n    on a particular occasion,\n   </em>\n   \" but that it required the application of an ambiguous standard \"to an idealized ordinary case of the crime.\" 576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2561. Holding the residual clause unconstitutionally vague, in other words, cast no doubt on the dozens\n   of laws elsewhere in the U.S. Code requiring the application of general standards to particular conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The same is true here. The sentencing factors described by the majority bear no similarity to the categorical risk analysis that the Court held unconstitutionally vague in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , nor to any other statutes it has previously found vague. Congress' instruction to district courts to consider, for instance, \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" \u00a7 3553(a)(1), bears little resemblance to statutes requiring subjective determinations as to whether conduct is \"annoying\" or \"unjust.\" See\n   <em>\n    Coates v.
