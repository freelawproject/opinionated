Reg. 15567 (1999) <em>{\u201cFinal Determination\u201d). </em>Plaintiffs dispute Commerce\u2019s finding in this investigation that certain programs or transactions did not confer countervailable subsidies upon a Belgian producer of stainless steel coiled plate, and question whether the Department accurately measured the subsidies that it found had been conferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">Counsel have presented well-briefed and ably argued claims concerning the various points in dispute. Upon consideration of these arguments, the Court finds that a remand is necessary so that Commerce may (a) evaluate whether it erred in not investigating the Government of Belgium\u2019s (\u201cGOB\u201d) 1984 purchase of stock in the Belgian steel company Siderurgie Maritime SA (\u201cSidmar\u201d), and (b) consider record evidence which appears to undermine its conclusion that no subsidy was conferred though the GOB\u2019s participation in a joint venture with Sid-mar. In all other respects, the <em>Final Determination </em>is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b470-19\">On March 31,1998, Plaintiffs filed a countervailing duty petition with Commerce alleging that a Belgian producer of stainless steel plate in coils, ALZ N.V (\u201cALZ\u201d), had benefitted from numerous types of subsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>dies provided by the GOB, the regional Government of Flanders (\u201cGOF\u201d) and the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d). <em>See Initiation of Countervailing Duty Investigations: Stainless Steel Plate in Coils from Belgium, Italy, the Republic of Korea, and the Republic of South Africa, </em>63 Fed. Reg. 23272 (1998) <em>(\u201cInitiation Notice\u201d). </em>Based upon this information, on April 28,1998, Commerce initiated a countervailing duty investigation concerning the subject merchandise, identifying fourteen programs operated by the GOB and the GOF, and five programs operated by the EC, that potentially provided countervailable subsidies<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the Belgian stainless steel coiled plate industry. <em>Id. </em>at 23273. Besides subsidies that were allegedly provided directly to ALZ, Commerce also investigated whether certain subsidies provided to Sidmar should be attributed to ALZ, on account of Sidmar\u2019s ownership interests in ALZ. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">On August 28, 1999, Commerce issued its <em>Preliminary Determina</em>tion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, after conducting verification and considering the parties\u2019 case and rebuttal briefs, issued its <em>Final Determination </em>on March 31, 1999. <em>See Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15584 (finding the countervail-able subsidy rate for ALZ to be 1.82 percent, <em>ad valorem). </em>Four aspects of this determination are relevant to Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge and are discussed in the respective sections below.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">In reviewing Commerce\u2019s determination, the Court \u201cshall hold unlawful any determination, finding, or conclusion found * * * to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B) (1994). \u201cAs long as the agency\u2019s methodology and procedures are reasonable means of effectuating the statutory purpose, and there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the agency\u2019s conclusions, the court will not impose its own views as to the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s investigation or question the agency\u2019s methodology.\u201d <em>Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A. v. United States, </em>10 CIT 399, 404-5, 636 F. Supp. 961, 966 (1986), <em>aff'd, </em>810 F.2d 1137 (Fed. Cir. 1987). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something more than a \u2018mere scintilla,\u201d\u2019 and must be enough evidence to reasonably support the Department\u2019s conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 405, 636 F.

Plaintiffs did not identify the GOB\u2019s 1984 investments in Sidmar as a subsidy \u201c[attributable to ALZ,\u201d although they did reference these investments in a separate section of the petition entitled \u201cOverview of the Belgian Industry Producing Stainless Steel Plate in Coils and the Subsidies Alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at iii and 28. In the overview section, Plaintiffs stated that \u201c[i]n 1984 the GOB increased its ownership in Sidmar through a combination of debt to equity conversions and direct equity infusions * * <em>Id. </em>at 30. As support, Plaintiffs cited and attached excerpts from a 1988 book which briefly described these transactions and noted that \u201c[t]he [European] Commission indicated that in its view the Belgian government had overvalued the shares acquired in Sidmar, but was \u2018prepared to consider that a higher price could be considered normal for the purchase of a blocking minority.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Ex. B-8, p. 124. Apart from this one sentence statement, however, which was made in the course of a general discussion of the GOB\u2019s ownership interests in both ALZ and Sidmar, Plaintiffs petition did not address the 1984 equity infusion in Sidmar.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Presumably because of this fact, Commerce did not list these investments as subject to investigation in its <em>Initiation Notice </em>of April 28, 1998. <em>See Initiation Notice, </em>63 Fed. Reg. at 23273. Plaintiffs neither specifically challenged this action, nor commented on Commerce\u2019s failure to investigate these investments in the <em>Preliminary Determination. </em>Three days prior to the start of verification, however, Plaintiffs requested that Commerce examine the terms of the GOB\u2019s 1984 acquisition of Sidmar stock through a debt-to-equity conversion and verify the methodology used by the GOB to arrive at the value per share. <em>See </em>Letter from Petitioners to Commerce of 11/06/98 at 9-10. Plaintiffs followed up this request by arguing in their case brief, submitted following verification, that Commerce should countervail these transactions because the GOB failed to make an objective analysis of the commercial soundness of its investment in Sidmar. <em>See </em>Petitioners\u2019 Case Brief of 02/11/99 at 17-33; <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15575.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>In the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce declined to investigate these transactions, since it found that Plaintiffs \u201cfirst made this allegation\u201d after the regulatory deadline set out in 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301(d) (4)(i)(A). <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed.

For the reasons stated below, the Court remands this issue to Commerce for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Commerce Did Not Mischaracterize Plaintiffs\u2019 Claim as a \u201cNew Subsidy Allegation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Plaintiffs first argue that, rather than presenting a new subsidy allegation, their case brief \u201csimply represented a legal theory about how to treat factual information already on the record.\u201d Memorandum Of Law In Support Of Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion For Judgment On The Agency Record (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum\u201d) at 8. Essentially, Plaintiffs claim that Commerce misconstrued record evidence in finding that the 1984 transactions were not already a part of the Department\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Pursuant tol9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671a(b)(l) (1994) (\u201cPetition requirements\u201d), a proper subsidy allegation \u201calleges the elements necessary for the imposition of the duty imposed by section 1671(a) of [Title 19],\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 1671(a) states that a countervailing duty shall be imposed if Commerce determines that a government is providing a \u201ccountervailable subsidy with respect to the manufacture, production, or export of a class or kind of merchandise imported * * * into the United States.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671(a) (1994). A subsidy, in turn, is deemed to be conferred when a government authority \u201cprovides a financial contribution,\u201d including an equity infusion, \u201cto a person and a benefit is thereby conferred.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(B) &amp; (D) (1994). \u201cGovernment provision of equity does not <em>per se </em>confer a countervailable benefit,\u201d however. <em>Comeau Seafoods Ltd. v. United States, </em>13 CIT 923, 935, 724 F. Supp. 1407, 1417 (1989). Rather, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(E) (1994) provides that, \u201cin the case of an equity infusion,\u201d a benefit is generally conferred \u201cif the investment decision is inconsistent with the usual investment practice of private investors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>In light of these requirements, it is clear that Plaintiffs did not properly allege, until submission of their case brief, that the 1984 investments in Sidmar constituted countervailable subsidies that should be investigated. Although Plaintiffs\u2019 initial petition noted that \u201c[i]n 1984 the GOB increased its ownership in Sidmar through a combination of debt to equity conversions and direct equity infusions,\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Countervailing Dufy Petition of 03/31/98 at 30, this general statement was made only in the \u201coverview\u201d section of their petition. Plaintiffs did not list these investments with the other alleged subsidies that it specifically requested to be investigated. Nor did Plaintiffs allege the elements necessary for the imposition countervailing duties, since their petition failed to indicate that any \u201cbenefit\u201d was conferred through the GOB\u2019s equity investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Notwithstanding this initial shortcoming, Plaintiffs advance multiple arguments for why their case brief did not advance a \u201cnew allegation.\u201d First, Plaintiffs note that the 1984 infusion was just one in a series of related steel restructuring subsidies that was already being investigated by Commerce. This fact, Plaintiffs argue, \u201cillustrates the error in the agency\u2019s characterization of the 1984 transaction as a \u2018new subsidy allegation.\u2019\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">While Plaintiffs appear correct in noting the similarity of the Sidmar investments to other financial contributions that were under investigation (namely, the GOB\u2019s 1985 equity investments in ALZ), this fact does not excuse Plaintiffs\u2019 earlier failure to identify these transactions in an enumerated claim. Although made pursuant to the same general GOB plans for aiding the steel industry, the GOB\u2019s purchase of Sidmar common and preferred stock involved different transactions and separate companies.than the GOB\u2019s investments in ALZ. Moreover, because 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(E) (1994) provides that a benefit will normally be conferred through an equity infusion when \u201cthe investment decision is inconsistent with the usual investment practice of private investors,\u201d different financial contributions made pursuant to the same general program may lead to opposing countervailability determinations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Nation Ford Chem. Co. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 1371, 1377, 985 F. Supp. 133, 138 (1997) (recognizing that even subsidy determinations involving a previously reviewed program are \u201cfact-specific\u201d and subject to changed circumstances), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>166 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Such factors illustrate the uniqueness of the Sidmar transactions and reasonably support Commerce\u2019s decision to treat Plaintiffs\u2019 claims concerning them as distinct from those subsidy claims already under investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 second claim is that Commerce wrongly considered Plaintiffs\u2019 argument to be a new allegation because all the factual information relevant to the 1984 equity transaction was on the record. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 11-12. While this evidence may raise questions about whether Commerce had timely \u201cdiscovered\u201d this alleged subsidy (as discussed below), the mere fact that information about the transaction had been put into the record says nothing about whether the GOB\u2019s purchases of Sidmar\u2019s stock constituted a distinct transaction. Nor does such evidence demonstrate that Plaintiffs \u201callege[d] the elements necessary for the imposition of [a countervailing] duty,\u201d as required by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671a(b)(l) (1994), within the time limits laid down in 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301(d)(4)(i)(A) (2000). Thus, even if true, this argument provides no basis for disturbing Commerce\u2019s characterization of the facts before it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Finally, the Court also rejects Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the 1984 equity infusion did not constitute a new subsidy allegation because \u201cit clearly occurred within the time period being examined by Commerce.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 10 n.4. The time period examined by Customs corresponds to the time period over which the Department must allocate non-recurring subsidies (i.e., the average useful life (\u201cAUL\u201d) of a firm\u2019s assets) when determining a subsidy rate for the period of investigation (in this case, 1997). <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.524(b) (2000) (codifying the Department\u2019s practice of allocating non-recurring benefits). It is unrelated and irrelevant to whether a party has made an adequate and timely subsidy allegation. To find otherwise would make Commerce\u2019s regulations concerning timely allegations meaningless, since, under Plaintiffs\u2019 argument, any subsidy conferred in the decade or two prior to the period of investigation would <em>automatically </em>be alleged (regardless of whether a respondent <em>actually </em>alleged the subsidy).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15568 (noting the AUL for ALZ and Sid-mar\u2019s assets as 15 and 19 years, respectively).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In short, the Court finds that substantial record evidence supports Commerce\u2019s conclusion that Plaintiffs\u2019 case brief raised a \u201cnew allegation\u201d with respect to the Sidmar share transactions, in violation of the time limits of 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301(d)(4)(i)(A) (2000). Plaintiffs have identified no grounds for disturbing this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Remand Is Necessary So That Commerce May Either Conform its Decision Not to Accept Plaintiffs\u2019 New Subsidy Allegation with its Prior Decision to Investigate Untimely Allegations, or Explain its Apparently Inconsistent Actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In addition to challenging Commerce\u2019s characterization of the facts, Plaintiffs allege that Commerce\u2019s rejection of its claim is inconsistent with its earlier decision to examine Plaintiffs\u2019 untimely allegations concerning the GOB\u2019s 1987 and 1993 sales of ALZ stock to Sidmar. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 13. Such inconsistency, Plaintiffs argue, is directly contrary to this Court\u2019s holdings that Commerce must either conform its actions to its prior decisions or explain the reasons for its departure. <em>Id. </em>at 13 &amp; n.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u201cAlthough Commerce is traditionally granted broad discretion in its selection of methodology to implement the [antidumping and countervailing duty statutes], Commerce may not abuse its discretion and its choice of methodology may not be arbitrary.\u201d <em>Hussey Copper, Ltd. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 993, 997, 834 F. Supp. 413, 418-19 (1993). Rather, \u201can agency must either conform itself to its prior decisions or explain the reasons for its departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 997, 834 F. Supp. at 418. This rule against creating conflicting precedents \u201cis not designed to restrict an agency\u2019s consideration of the facts from one case to the next, but rather it is to insure consistency in an agency\u2019s administration of a statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, it is well-established that Commerce may depart from a prior practice so long as it provides a \u201c\u2018reasoned analysis\u2019\u201d for its change. <em>See Rust v. Sullivan, </em>500 U.S. 173, 187;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Motor Vehicle Mfgs. Ass\u2019n of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983); <em>accord Mantex, Inc. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 1385, 1399, 841 F. Supp. 1290, 1302-03 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">In its brief, Defendant attempts to address the Department\u2019s apparent inconsistency by distinguishing the late allegations Commerce <em>did </em>choose to investigate. Specifically, Defendant states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">although plaintiffs filed their submission describing these additional share transactions after the regulatory deadline, the filing took place prior to the preliminary determination and verification of questionnaire responses. Consequently, there was time for Commerce to solicit additional information and to verify such information with respect to these transactions. Additionally, ALZ did not argue that plaintiffs\u2019 submission describing these additional share transactions constituted an untimely filed subsidy allegation. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Exh. 2, Pub. Doc. 72. Indeed, in <em>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip in Coils from France, </em>64 Fed. Reg. 30774, 30787 (June 8, 1999), Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>merce exercised its discretion to address a subsidy allegation filed after the deadline because the respondents did not express an objection to the petitioners\u2019 allegation with respect to its possible untimeliness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Memorandum Of The United States In Opposition To Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion For Judgment Upon The Administrative Record (\u201cDefendant\u2019s Response\u201d) at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">This explanation might sufficiently distinguish the two situations, since Plaintiffs\u2019 case brief discussing the GOB\u2019s 1984 Sidmar investments was submitted after verification and had drawn a protest from the respondents. <em>See Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15575 (noting ALZ\u2019s untimeliness argument); <em>see also American Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Service, </em>397 U.S. 532, 539 (1970) (\u201c\u2019[I]t is always the discretion of * * * an administrative agency to relax or modify its procedural rules adopted for the orderly transaction of business before it when in a given case the ends of justice require it. The action of [an agency] in such a case is not reviewable except upon a showing of substantial prejudice to the complaining party.\u2019\u201d) (quoting NLRB v. Grace Co., 184 F.2d 763, 764 (8th Cir. 1953)). The Government\u2019s problem, however, lies in the fact that this explanation was made only by the Department of Justice in the course of this litigation, and not by the Department of Commerce in its countervailing duty investigation. <em>See Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168-69 (1962) (\u201cThe courts may not accept * * * counsel\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations for agency action; * * * an agency\u2019s discretionary order [must] be upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">A review of the <em>Final Determination, </em>the <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>and the other papers in this case fails to show any similar explanation <em>by Commerce </em>of why it chose to investigate some untimely allegations, but not others. Rather, the record simply shows that in one instance Commerce used its discretion to consider untimely allegations, while in a later instance it decided not to do so. <em>Compare Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15575 (\u201c[W]e have not conducted an investigation of the Sidmar share transactions because the petitioners did not meet this regulatory deadline.\u201d), <em>with </em>Memorandum of 08/28/98 from Team to Richard Moreland (\u201cConcurrence Memorandum; Summary of Issues\u201d) at 5-6 (investigating the 1987 and 1993 sale by the GOB of its shares in ALZ to Sidmar, despite the observation that petitioners asked Commerce to investigate these transactions \u201c[o]nly in the more recent submissions made after the deadline for filing new allegations\u201d). Such inconsistency by Commerce is inappropriate, absent an adequate explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Accordingly, this aspect of the <em>Final Determination </em>is remanded with instructions that Commerce either conform its decision not to accept Plaintiffs\u2019 new subsidy allegation with its prior decision to investigate untimely allegations, or explain on the record the reasons for this apparent inconsistency. To ensure consistency with other investigations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Commerce is also instructed to explain how its decision on remand comports with other instances where it has used its discretion to similarly reject or accept untimely allegations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Remand Is Necessary For Commerce to Consider Whether it Had a Legal Obligation to Investigate the 1984 Equity Infusion in Sidmar.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">As an alternative to their arguments above, Plaintiffs assert that, even if their case brief did make a \u201cnew allegation,\u201d Commerce was required by statute to consider the Sidmar share transaction in the <em>Final Determination. </em>According to Plaintiffs, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677d and its implementing regulation, as well as 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e), impose on Commerce an obligation to consider subsidies discovered during an investigation. Commerce violated these mandates, Plaintiffs claim, by ignoring reliable record data evidencing this subsidy. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 16-17 (\u201cCommerce was in possession of all the verified information necessary to perform its statutory analysis and thus had no justification for failing to consider plaintiffs\u2019 arguments.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">In relevant part, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677d (1994) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">If, in the course of a proceeding under this subtitle, the administering authority discovers a practice which appears to be a countervail-able subsidy, but was not included in the matters alleged in a countervailing duty petition * * * then the administering authority\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">(1) shall include the practice, subsidy, or subsidy program in the proceeding if the practice, subsidy, or subsidy program appears to be a countervailable subsidy with respect to the merchandise which is the subject of the proceeding * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">In turn, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.311 (2000) (\u201cCountervailable subsidy practice discovered during investigation or review\u201d) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">(b) <em>Inclusion in proceeding. </em>If during a countervailing duty investigation or a countervailing duty administrative review the Secretary discovers a practice that appears to provide a countervailable subsidy with respect to the subject merchandise and the practice was not alleged or examined in the proceeding * * * the Secretary will examine the practice, subsidy, or subsidy program if the Secretary concludes that sufficient time remains before the scheduled date for the final determination or final results of review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">(c) <em>Deferral of examination. </em>If the Secretary concludes that insufficient time remains before the scheduled date for the final determination or final results of review to examine the practice, subsidy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>or subsidy program described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">(1) During an investigation, allow the petitioner to withdraw the petition without prejudice and resubmit it with an allegation with regard to the newly discovered practice, subsidy, or subsidy program; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">(2) During an investigation or review, defer consideration of the newly discovered practice, subsidy, or subsidy program until a subsequent administrative review, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">(d) <em>Notice. </em>The Secretary -will notify the parties to the proceeding of any practice the Secretary discovers * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Based upon the plain meaning of this statute and regulation, it is clear that Commerce has an affirmative duty to investigate subsidies discovered during the course of an investigation, even if (for practical reasons) the investigation of the newly discovered subsidies must wait for an administrative review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">While not challenging the validity of this obligation, the Government asserts that these provisions are not relevant, since \u201cCommerce did not indicate that it had discovered a 1984 equity infusion in Sidmar during the proceeding.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Response at 15. According to Defendant, \u201c[t]he absence of any such finding renders the statutory and regulatory provisions described above inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">This argument is unpersuasive. While it may be true that Commerce \u201cdid not indicate\u201d that it had discovered the 1984 equity infusion in Sid-mar, this explanation says nothing about whether Commerce actually discovered this transaction, should have discovered this transaction, or had this potential subsidy brought to its attention.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here, Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>have identified record evidence collected by Commerce during its investigation which indicates the existence of a countervailable subsidy. Specifically, Plaintiffs point to ALZ\u2019s questionnaire response, as well as their own case brief, as evidence not only of the equity infusion, but also the terms of the transaction and the benchmark share price needed to measure the benefit bestowed. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 11. Such evidence, on its face, appears to trigger Commerce\u2019s investigatory obligations under the plain language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677d and 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.311.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Despite the seeming relevance of this information, in the <em>Final Determination </em>Commerce did not address this evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although Commerce found that Plaintiffs had untimely advanced their allegations concerning the 1984 equity infusion, <em>Final Determination </em>at 15575, the Department said nothing concerning its own, independent obligation to investigate potential subsidies discovered during the investigation. Failing such explanation, the Court is left only to conclude that Commerce committed legal error by simply overlooking or ignoring this record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Accordingly, this aspect of the <em>Final Determination </em>is also remanded for further consideration by Commerce. On remand, Commerce is instructed to examine the record evidence concerning the 1984 equity infusion in Sidmar that it collected (or was put before it) during this investigation and, in light of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677d (1994) and 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.311 (2000), discuss whether it had an obligation to investigate this transaction as a potential subsidy for the <em>Final Determination. </em>Should it find in the affirmative, Commerce is instructed to reopen its investigation, determine whether this transaction constitutes a countervailable subsidy, and (to the extent it does) adjust ALZ\u2019s net countervailable subsidy rate accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Commerce Did Not Err in its Analysis of SNCI Loans to the Belgian Steel Industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 next claim challenges Commerce\u2019s finding that loans made to the Belgian steel industry by the Societe Nationale de Credite a l\u2019ln-dustrie (\u201cSNCI\u201d)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> were not \u201cspecific\u201d to that industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Before Commerce may countervail a subsidy, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(A) (1994) requires the Department to find that the subsidy is \u201cspecific\u201d to an enterprise or industry.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cSpecificity\u201d may be established in several ways, one of which is a showing that a particular industry received a disproportionate share of the total subsidies provided under a program. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5A)(D)(iii)(III) (1994) (providing that a subsidy is specific \u201cas a matter of fact\u201d if \u201c[a]n enterprise or industry receives a disproportionately large amount of the subsidy\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">In its <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce concluded that loans made to the Belgian steel industry by SNCI between 1987 and 1990 were not specific (and, thus, not countervailable) because the steel industry did not receive a disproportionate share of SNCI\u2019s loans. <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15570-71, 15577. Plaintiffs allege that Commerce erred in two ways in making this determination: first, by improperly departing from its former methodology for determining specificity; and second, by improperly accounting for SNCI loans made to the Belgian steel industry through indirect channels. Each of these points is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Commerce Reasonably Explained Why it Applied a Different Methodology to Determine Whether SNCI Loans to the Steel Industry Were \u201cSpecific.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The first error alleged by Plaintiff is that Commerce, without proper explanation, improperly used a different methodology in the <em>Final Determination </em>for determining specificity than that used in both the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>and a previous investigation involving the same alleged subsidy from SNCI, <em>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products From Belgium, </em>58 Fed. Reg. 37273 (1993) <em>(\u201cCertain Steel\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>In <em>Certain Steel, </em>Commerce determined whether the Belgian steel industry had received a disproportionate share of all SNCI loans by comparing SNCI\u2019s loans <em>outstanding </em>to the steel industry with SNCI\u2019s loans <em>outstanding </em>to all other borrowers. <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15570 (citing <em>Certain Steel, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37280-81). In so doing, Commerce found that the Belgian steel industry had received a disproportionate share of SNCI\u2019s loans before 1987, but not during 1987 and 1988. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">In <em>tine Preliminary Determination </em>in this case, Commerce applied this methodology to data on outstanding SNCI investment loans in 1989 and 1990, and preliminarily concluded that \u201cloans approved between 1987 and 1990 * * * were non-specific and, therefore, not countervailable.\u201d <em>Id. Inthe Final Determination, </em>however, Commerce \u2014 though coming to the same result \u2014 applied a different methodology. Commerce explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">In a change from the analysis used in <em>Certain Steel </em>and the <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>we have focused our analysis on the steel industry\u2019s share of <em>loans approved </em>in a given year rather than that industry\u2019s share of <em>loans outstanding </em>in a given year. We believe the former provides a better indication of whether loans are limited to specific industries. Loans outstanding can be affected by other factors besides the approval process which are not relevant to a specificity determination, such as the terms of loans. Therefore, for the final determination, we are modifying our analysis to examine the percentage of loans approved for the basic metals industry in each year. On this basis, we determine that the steel industry did not receive a disproportionate share of SNCI loans for the years 1987 through 1990.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">As noted previously, while Commerce is granted broad discretion in its administration of the antidumping and countervailing duty laws, its exercise of this discretion may not be arbitrary. Rather, Commerce \u201cmust either conform itself to its prior decisions or explain the reasons for its departure.\u201d <em>Hussey Copper, </em>17 CIT at 997, 834 F. Supp. at 418; <em>see also Rust, </em>500 U.S. at 187 (requiring a \u201creasoned analysis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In this case, Commerce\u2019s explanation, though short, was adequate. Here, Commerce\u2019s undisputed goal was to determine whether the Belgian steel industry received disproportionately favorable treatment from SNCI during each of the years under review. It was thus perfectly reasonable for Commerce to focus on a methodology (loans approved) that is directly related to SNCI\u2019s actions during the relevant period of time, in lieu of its previous methodology (loans outstanding) that was susceptible to distortion from factors unrelated to SNCI\u2019s actions <em>dur</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>ing </em>that period.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> While Commerce certainly could have provided a longer statement or more examples to support its new approach, the inherent logic of examining SNCI\u2019s <em>actual </em>loan practices during the year under review \u2014 as opposed to data which only reflects SNCI\u2019s <em>prior </em>loan practices \u2014 speaks for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">While Commerce\u2019s explanation alone is sufficient, the Department\u2019s approach is further supported hy the emergence of new evidence for the <em>Final Determination. </em>In <em>Certain </em>Steel, the respondent argued that Commerce should consider the percentage of new loans opened or granted (rather than total loans outstanding) by industrial sector, in each year, to make its specificity determination. <em>Certain Steel, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37290. Commerce responded to this proposal not by rejecting it, but by stating that such an analysis was not possible, since \u201cthe GOB did not provide data which would allow us to look at year-by-year shares or new loans issued as opposed to amounts outstanding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in the <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>Commerce again examined only data on SNCI loans outstanding, since this was the only relevant data before the agency. <em>See Preliminary Determination, </em>63 Fed. Reg. at 47245 (stating that for SNCI loans made before 1989 \u201c[n]o new information has been presented in this investigation to change our Certain Steel determination\u201d and that \u201c[t]he GOB provided information on the sectoral distribution of loans under the program for the years 1989 and 1990\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">For the <em>Final Determination, </em>however, Commerce had, for the first time, information on SNCI\u2019s loans approved during a given year. In response to this information, Commerce stated in its Memorandum on this subject that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">[i]n <em>Certain Steel, </em>we used the figures for \u201ctotal loans outstanding,\u201d because we did not have information to conduct a year-by-year analysis of loans approved. <em>(Certain Steel </em>at 37290) In the present case, we have information on loans approved for every year between 1984^1990. Therefore, we are including this data in our analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">SNCI Memorandum at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Commerce\u2019s decision to examine SNCI loans approved in the <em>Final Determination </em>can not be considered arbitrary in light of this reasoned explanation. <em>See Rust, </em>500 U.S. at 187. The Department\u2019s SNCI Memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>randum, which is cited in the <em>Final </em>Determination,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> makes clear that its decision to examine loans approved in the <em>Final Determination </em>\u2014 as opposed to loans outstanding in <em>Certain Steel </em>and the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>\u2014 was the result of examining the best evidence before it in each circumstance. In the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce had before it new and better evidence than it had previously, and it decided to use this data. Not only is such a result reasonable, but it raises the question of whether Commerce\u2019s use of this data should even be characterized as a \u201cchange\u201d in its methodology (as opposed to the application of the same methodology to different data).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">In short, Commerce provided reasonable explanations for why it did not rely on SNCI\u2019s loans outstanding in the <em>Final Determination. </em>This aspect of the <em>Final Determination </em>is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Commerce Did Not Err in Evaluating SNCI Loans Made Through Coordination Centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Besides challenging Commerce\u2019s explanation for its new methodology, Plaintiffs argue that the Department erred in evaluating certain SNCI loans that were made indirectly to the Belgian steel industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">In their case brief to Commerce, Plaintiffs argued that the data relied on by Commerce in <em>Certain Steel </em>and the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>understated the Belgian steel industry\u2019s share of SNCI loans, since this data did not account for SNCI loans made through \u201ccoordination centers.\u201d Petitioners\u2019 Case Brief of 02/11/99 at 34-37. Among other activities, coordination centers provide companies with financial services, such as \u201cloan and equity financing and hedging of foreign exchange.\u201d SNCI Memorandum at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Agreeing with Plaintiffs, for the <em>Final Determination </em>Commerce considered such indirect loans in its specificity determination. <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15577. Commerce, however, was unable to obtain specific information on these loans, and was forced to make an approximation based on limited evidence. <em>See </em>SNCI Memorandum at 3.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Specifically, Commerce found that SNCI reported in its 1990 Annual Report that when loans made through coordination centers are accounted for, \u201cthe percentage of loans outstanding which went to the production and preliminary processing of metals industry (which includes steel) increases from 8.4 percent to 10.7 percent\u201d <em>Id. </em>Using this data on loans <em>outstanding, </em>Commerce estimated the percentage of loans <em>approved </em>for the steel industry through coordination centers in the years through 1990. To do this, the Department took the percentage of SNCI\u2019s loans outstanding to steel coordination centers in 1990 (2.3 <em>%), </em>divided it by the percentage of outstanding SNCI\u2019s loans to the banking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>and finance industry (through which SNCI accounted for coordination center loans), and determined that steel coordination centers comprised 8.01 <em>% </em>of SNCI\u2019s loans to the banking and finance industry. <em>Id. </em>at 4 and Attachment 1. Commerce \u201cthen applied this percentage to the banking and finance industry\u2019s share of total loans <em>granted </em>for each year\u201d to arrive at revised, estimated figures. <em>Id. </em>at 4 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Based on these new numbers, Commerce then analyzed whether the steel industry had received a disproportionate share of SNCI loans, and determined that loans provided by SNCI from 1987 to 1990 were not specific to that industry. <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15571.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Plaintiffs challenge this methodology by arguing that, despite having rejected SNCI\u2019s figures for loans outstanding, Commerce then (improperly) relied on these figures in its calculations. According to Plaintiffs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">despite concluding that \u201c{l}oans outstanding can be affected by other factors * * * which are not relevant to a specificity determination,\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15,570, Commerce relied on a change in the percentage of outstanding loans held by the steel industry to estimate the percentage of loans granted to the steel industry in 1990. In so doing, the agency embraced the very approach it rejected in switching to a different specificity methodology in the final determination. Based on this inherent contradiction, Commerce\u2019s specificity determination should be remanded with instructions to calculate either a measurement of all SNCI loans granted to the steel industry, including those loans provided through coordination centers, based on record data concerning loans granted, or, if data is not available, to calculate the percentage of all outstanding SNCI loans held by the steel industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Plaintiffs further argue that \u201cCommerce\u2019s methodology compounds this error by extrapolating the figure for 1990 to every year between 1984 and 1990,\u201d since \u201c[t]he record is devoid of any evidence that supports the agency\u2019s wholesale application of its 1990 calculations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. As support, Plaintiffs observe that \u201cnot only does the agency explicitly state that the record contains no information on the percentage of all outstanding SNCI loans held by the steel industry for years other than 1990,\u201d but \u201cthe record contains evidence demonstrating that a higher percentage of coordination center loans were made to the industrial sector in 1989 than in 1990, presumably indicating that the percentage of outstanding loans held by the steel industry in 1989 was higher than the 2.3 percent figure used for 1990.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">There is Nothing \u201cInherently Contradictory\u201d about Commerce\u2019s Use\u2019 of SNCI\u2019s 1990 Data on Steel Loans Outstanding to Coordination Centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">As noted above, substantial evidence supports Commerce\u2019s decision to use data on SNCI\u2019s loans granted, rather than loans outstanding, for determining specificity in the <em>Final Determination. </em>In applying its new methodology, the Department did not \u201creject\u201d record evidence concerning loans outstanding. The record shows that Commerce used data on loans granted because (a) it was better evidence, and (b) this evidence was available to it for the first time. Commerce did <em>not </em>indicate that evidence of loans outstanding was unreliable, or that such evidence should not be used. On the contrary, the record of this case, as well as Plaintiffs\u2019 own arguments, show that \u201cdata reflecting the amount of loans outstanding is useful in the absence of evidence regarding the amount of loans approved.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Response at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The Court does not agree that it was an \u201cinherent contradiction\u201d for Commerce to use the 1990 information on loans outstanding. Here, Commerce used this information as an alternative means of measuring specificity, since specific information concerning loans granted to the steel industry through coordination centers was not available. It did not use <em>rejected </em>or manifestly incorrect data. Moreover, Commerce did not simply rely upon the SNCI data concerning loans outstanding in 1990; it <em>used this figure to make an estimate ofSNCI\u2019s loans approved through coordination centers (for the steel industry) for each year between 1984 and 1990. See </em>SNCI Memorandum at 4. Such an approach is perfectly consistent with Commerce\u2019s stated preference for \u201cexaminfing] the percentage of loans approved for the basic metals industry in each year,\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15570, and, absent a specific showing of error by Defendant, is a reasonable means of accounting for indirect loans made through coordination centers. Thus, there is nothing <em>inherently </em>wrong with Commerce\u2019s use of these figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Commerce\u2019s Methodology Did Not Fail to Appreciate the Difference Between Loans Granted and Loans Outstanding to Coordination Centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Turning from the general to the specific, the Court also does not agree that Commerce, in using SNCI\u2019s 1990 data on steel loans outstanding to coordination centers, \u201cwrongly equated loans granted with loans outstanding.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> at 8. Plaintiffs argue that Commerce erred in wrongly equating loans granted to loans outstanding for 1990 by <em>adding </em>the coordination centers\u2019 share of loans outstanding in 1990 (2.3%) to the percentage of loans granted to the steel industry in 1990. <em>Id. </em>This was incorrect, Plaintiffs argue, because the percentage of loans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>granted to coordination centers in 1990 was significantly greater than the coordination center\u2019s share of loans outstanding in that year. Plaintiffs argue that, \u201c[b]y failing to account for the discrepancy between loans <em>granted </em>to coordination centers versus loans <em>outstanding, </em>Commerce\u2019s methodology thus artificially reduces the amount of loans granted to the steel industry by assuming that the coordination centers\u2019 share for loans outstanding in 1990 is a fair approximation of loans granted to coordination centers in that year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is based on a misunderstanding of how Commerce used the 1990 data. As their briefs make clear, Plaintiffs presume that Commerce simply added the percentage of outstanding SNCI loans to steel coordination centers in 1990 (2.3 <em>%) </em>to SNCI\u2019s reported figures for either loans outstanding or loans granted to the Belgium steel industry for the years 1987-90.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This is incorrect. As shown above, Commerce used the 2.3 % figure for loans outstanding to calculate the percentage (8.01 <em>%) </em>of SNCI\u2019s loans outstanding to the hanking and finance industry that went to steel coordination centers in 1990. <em>See </em>SNCI Memorandum at 4. From there, Commerce <em>applied this percentage to the banking and finance industry\u2019s share of total loans granted for each year </em>to approximate figures for steel loans granted. <em>Id. </em>In 1990, for example, Commerce used 8.01 % as an approximation for the percentage of banking and finance loans that went to steel coordination centers, multiplied this figure by 45.6 % (representing SNCI loans granted to banking and finance), and estimated that 3.65 <em>% </em>of all SNCI loans granted went to steel coordination centers. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Similarly, Commerce multiplied this 8.01 <em>% </em>figure by the percentage of SNCI loans granted to banking and finance to calculate loans granted to steel coordination centers for each of the years at issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In light of this evidence, it is clear that Commerce did not, as Plaintiffs claim, ignore record evidence \u201c[b]y failing to account for the discrepancy between loans <em>granted </em>to coordination centers versus loans <em>outstanding.\u201d </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply at 9. By using record evidence on banking and finance loans granted to approximate steel loans granted through coordination centers, Commerce accounted for the fact that \u201ca greater share of loans was <em>granted </em>to coordination centers during the period in question.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply at 9 (emphasis in original). Commerce did not, in using SNCI\u2019s 1990 figure on steel loans outstanding, treat loans granted and loans outstanding as comparable. Rather, it simply used this figure to approximate the percentage of loans <em>granted </em>to \u201cbanking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>and finance\u201d during the years at issue that actually went to steel coordination centers. As such, Commerce\u2019s analysis neither ignores nor contradicts record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Commerce Did Not Erroneously Extrapolate 1990 Data on Outstanding Loans Held by the Belgian Steel Industry in Analyzing Loans Granted to That Industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Finally, the Court rejects Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that record evidence contradicts the Department\u2019s decision to use the 1990 loan figure in deriving loan information for other years. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 23-24. According to Plaintiffs, Commerce\u2019s extrapolation of this data to the years prior to 1990 is unsupported by substantial evidence, since the percentage of SNCI loans granted through coordination centers in 1989 that went to companies in the industrial sector (90 %) is greater than the corresponding percentage of SNCI loans that went through coordination centers to such companies in 1990 (74 %). Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply at 11. This evidence, Plaintiffs say, \u201cdemonstrat[es] that a higher percentage of coordination center loans were [sic] made to the <em>industrial sector </em>in 1989 than in 1990.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 23 (emphasis added). Thus, they conclude, \u201cCommerce\u2019s decision to derive the loan figures for prior years based on the lending patterns for 1990 contradicts the record evidence, making this aspect of its SNCI specificity methodology unsupported by the record.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument fails on three counts. First, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument presumes that because a higher percentage of coordination center loans was made to the <em>industrial sector </em>in 1989 than in 1990, a higher percentage of coordination center loans was also made to the Belgian <em>steel industry </em>in 1989. Plaintiffs identify no reason or evidence <em>why </em>this would be true, but simply assume that the two figures moved in tandem. Absent evidence, Plaintiffs\u2019 assumption is unproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Second, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument does not undermine the methodology chosen by Commerce. For the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce compared steel loans outstanding to total banking and finance loans outstanding in 1990 to derive a figure (8.01 <em>%) </em>by which it could estimate the percentage of steel loans granted through coordination centers for the years at issue. <em>See </em>SNCI Memorandum at 4. While the resulting figures may not be entirely accurate, they constitute reasonable estimates <em>derived from actual record evidence </em>of outstanding SNCI loans to steel coordination centers in 1990. In contrast, correlating coordination center loans made to the <em>industrial sector </em>in 1989 with such loans made to the Belgian <em>steel industry </em>in 1989 seems, absent evidence to the contrary, a clumsy means of estimating an increase in the latter. In the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce appears to have recognized as much, stating that \u201c[i]nstead of employing the petitioners\u2019 suggestion to include all coordination center loans to industrial sectors and adding 10 percentage points to the calculation of loans provided to the steel indus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>try, <em>we are accounting for coordination centers by using the information specific to the steel industry.\u201d Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15577 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Third, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is challenged by record evidence showing that coordination centers played a less important role in 1989 than in 1990. <em>See </em>SNCI Memorandum at 3-4 (\u201c[W]e also saw no indication that loans through the coordination centers had a greater impact in the years prior to 1990. Instead, the [SNCI] annual reports for those years indicate that the banking and finance sector, and specifically coordination centers, played a less significant role in the years prior to 1990.\u201d). In 1989, banking and finance (though which coordination center loans are accounted for in SNCI\u2019s annual reports) constituted only 40.6 percent of all SNCI\u2019s loans <em>granted, </em>compared to 45.6 percent for 1990. SNCI Memorandum at 4. Thus, even if coordination center loans to the steel industry were actually higher as a relative percentage of all SNCI <em>banking and finance loans </em>in 1989 than in 1990, they would not necessarily have constituted a higher percentage of SNCI\u2019s <em>total loans </em>in 1989. Of course, it is the steel industry\u2019s percentage of total loans that matters in determining whether SNCI\u2019s loans were \u201cspecific.\u201d <em>See Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15570 (\u201c[F]or the final determination, we are modifying our analysis to examine <em>the percentage of [SNCFs] loans approved </em>for the basic metals industry in each year.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs have not shown that Commerce\u2019s methodology for approximating SNCI loans granted to steel coordination centers for the years up to, and including, 1990 is unsupported by substantial record evidence. The Court accordingly upholds this aspect of the <em>Final Determination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Commerce\u2019s Calculation Of Sidmar\u2019s Sales Denominator Is Not Contrary To Law Or Record Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 third claim challenges the manner in which Commerce allocated subsidies provided to the Sidmar Group of companies (\u201cSidmar Group\u201d) in calculating a subsidy rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">When Commerce finds an event countervailable, it determines the appropriate countervailing duty rate by \u201cdivid[ing] the amount of the subsidy by the amount of sales products assisted by that subsidy.\u201d <em>Inland Steel Industries v. United States, </em>188 F.3d 1349, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1999).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In line with this practice, Commerce determined the countervailing duty rate for the Sidmar Group by dividing the countervailable subsidies it discovered (the numerator) that were attributable to the period of investigation by the consolidated sales figures reported by ALZ\u2019s for the Sidmar Group\u2019s Belgian steel operations during the period of investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>tion (the denominator). <em>See Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15574; Defendant\u2019s Response at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Providing Commerce with a sales \u201cdenominator,\u201d however, was not a straight-forward task. To derive a Belgium-only sales figure, ALZ took the revenues for the Sidmar Group\u2019s steel companies located in Belgium and subtracted cost account information on intra-company transfers. Reply Brief of ALZ, N.V of 02/11/99 (\u201cALZ Case Brief\u201d) at 3; <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15574. To do this, ALZ was required to add in, and then subtract out, sales revenue unrelated to any subsidies. Specifically, although the Sidmar Group derived total sales figures for its companies based on their accounts starting with the number \u201c70,\u201d cost accounts covering intra-company transfers did not correspond exactly with the \u201c70\u201d accounts. Rather, \u201c[wjhile cost accounts beginning with the number \u201860\u2019 (the \u201860 account\u2019) correspond <em>mostly </em>to 70 accounts, some of the items included therein correspond to 74 account items.\u201d ALZ Case Brief at 3 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Sidmar Group\u2019s \u201c74 accounts\u201d covered \u201cOther Operating Income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The other costs corresponding to revenue items recorded in the 74 accounts were recorded in accounts beginning with the number \u201c61.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Because of this lack of correspondence, to simply deduct the Sidmar Group\u2019s intra-group 60 account entries from its 70 account revenues would have understated the Sidmar Group\u2019s steel revenues by deducting costs unrelated to steel sales. <em>See id. </em>In turn, if used as the denominator to calculate a countervailing duty rate, this understated figure would have lead to a subsidy rate that was inappropriately high.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> To avoid this problem and \u201cachieve complete correspondence between revenues and expenditures,\u201d ALZ added the Group\u2019s 70 accounts (turnover) and its 74 account (other operating income), and then \u201cdeducted from that combined total the intra-group acquisitions reflected in accounts 60 and 61,\u201d to arrive at a consolidated sales figure. <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15574.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce approved of this approach, stating simply that \u201c[a]s noted by respondents, simply deducting the 60 account results in an understatement of Sidmar\u2019s operating income. Thus, for purposes of our final determination, we have retained in Sid-mar\u2019s sales denominator the revenue from account 74 because this is the most accurate information on the record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Plaintiffs challenge this aspect of the <em>Final Determination </em>on essentially two grounds, one substantive, one procedural. The Court finds neither argument persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Commerce Did Not Err in Failing to Exclude Revenue From: the Sidmar Group\u2019s \u201c74 Accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Plaintiffs first argue that Commerce erred in using the sales figures provided by ALZ, since this figure \u201cincluded sales from a revenue account [the \u201c74 accounts\u201d] that bear no relation to Sidmar\u2019s production of the subject merchandise.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 25. According to Plaintiffs, \u201c[i]n accordance with Commerce practice * * * these sales should not have been reflected in SIDMAR\u2019s sales denominator * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Essentially, Plaintiffs posit an argument that Commerce unjustifiably departed from its former practice for calculating countervailing duty rates. As noted previously, Commerce may depart from a practice used in prior antidumping and countervailing duty investigations so long as it provides a reasoned analysis for its change. <em>See Rust, </em>500 U.S. at 187. Here, however, the Court need not evaluate the reasonableness of the Department\u2019s explanation, since Plaintiffs have failed to show that Commerce actually departed from its former methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Standing alone, Commerce\u2019s inclusion of a non-production-related source of revenue in the denominator would certainly be contrary to its practice. <em>See, e.g., Inland Steel Industries v. United States, </em>21 CIT 553, 563, 967 F. Supp. 1338, 1351 (1997) (\u201c[Commerce] calculates the per-unit subsidy rate by dividing the amount of the subsidy * * * by the <em>appropriate portion of the subsidized firm\u2019s sales\"), aff\u2019d, </em>188 F.3d 1349 (Fed. Cir. 1999). As discussed above, however, this non-production-related revenue was effectively \u201cremoved\u201d from the denominator by subtracting out the Sidmar Group\u2019s \u201c60\u201d and \u201c61\u201d cost accounts, leaving only a figure representing the Group\u2019s consolidated steel sales. <em>See ALZ </em>Case Brief at 3. The only reason for the inclusion of \u201c74 account\u201d revenues in the first place was to ensure that \u201ccosts\u201d unrelated to the Sidmar Group\u2019s steel sales were not inappropriately included in the denominator. <em>See Certain Iron-Metal Castings From India: Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 32297, 32302 (1997) (\u201c[I]t is imperative that both the numerator (the benefit) and denominator (the universe of sales to which the benefit applies) used in our calculation of a subsidy reflect the same universe of goods. Otherwise the rate calculated will either over- or understate the subsidy attributable to the subject merchandise.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In its briefs, Plaintiffs argue only that Commerce improperly included \u201csales from a revenue account that bear no relation to Sidmar\u2019s production of the subject merchandise\u201d; they do not discuss the fact that this \u201cimproper\u201d revenue was subtracted from the denominator before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Commerce ran its computations.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Because the resulting denominator used by Commerce appears to include only Sidmar Group sales that benefitted from subsidies, and because Plaintiffs have provided nothing to rebut this appearance, the Court finds Commerce\u2019s denominator determination to be in accordance with law and supported by substantial record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Commerce Was Not Required to Use Facts Otherwise Available In Calculating a Sales Denominator for the Sidmar Groue</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Plaintiffs also challenge the sales denominator used by Commerce on procedural grounds. According to Plaintiffs, the record shows that Commerce \u201chad asked ALZ to report Sidmar\u2019s sales data exclusive of non-production related sources of revenue on more than one occasion,\u201d but that ALZ repeatedly failed to provide it with this data. Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply at 15. As a result, Commerce was forced to rely on \u201ca newly estimated sales figure\u201d for consolidated sales submitted at verification, <em>id., </em>\u201cwhich resulted in an inflated denominator and thus benefitted ALZ by incorrectly reducing the subsidy margin,\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 26. This reduced subsidy margin, Plaintiffs continue, \u201cwrongly rewarded ALZ for its failure to cooperate,\u201d in violation of the policy objectives underlying the facts available rule. <em>Id. </em>at 27. Thus, they propose, \u201cthis issue should be remanded for Commerce to revise its denominator calculation with the facts available rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2637(d) (1994) states that \u201cthe Court of International Trade shall, where appropriate, require the exhaustion of administrative remedies\u201d for such a challenge. A review of the record does not show that Plaintiffs ever specifically argued before the Department that it should have resorted to \u201cfacts available\u201d \u2014 a fact acknowledge by both parties at oral argument. Rather, Plaintiffs appearance before this Court is the first time they argue that Commerce should employ \u201cfacts available,\u201d even though they had opportunities to present this argument earlier. Thus, without more, the Court must reject Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Delverde v. United States, </em>21 CIT 1294, 1301, 989 F. Supp. 218, 225 (1997) (dismissing a party\u2019s challenge to Commerce\u2019s calculation of a sales denominator where the party had not previously exhausted it administrative remedies), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>202 F.3d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">At oral argument, Plaintiffs attempted to provide the Court with \u201csomething more\u201d by clarifying that they are not seeking a punitive application of facts available on remand. Rather, Plaintiffs noted, their ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>gument is simply that Commerce was unjustified in selecting an inaccurate figure which benefitted ALZ, given a choice between an understated or overstated sales denominator. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply at 15. Plaintiffs also agreed with the Court that this argument would be largely irrelevant if the Court did not find that Commerce\u2019s denominator calculation benefitted ALZ.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Regardless of whether this clarification saves Plaintiffs\u2019 argument from \u00a7 2637(d), it does not lead to a different substantive result. As noted above, Plaintiffs have failed to show that the denominator used by Commerce included Sidmar Group revenues that did not benefit from subsidies. Accordingly, even if ALZ failed to provide Belgium-only sales figures in an untimely manner, as Plaintiffs allege, there is no evidence that ALZ \u201cbenefitted\u201d from its inaction. By Plaintiffs\u2019 own admission, therefore, there is no need for the Court to address whether ALZ\u2019s presentation of sales figures to the Department was untimely or whether the application of facts available sought by Plaintiffs is, indeed, punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In short, Plaintiffs have not shown that Commerce erred, either substantively or procedurally, in calculating a sales denominator figure for the Sidmar Group. The Court accordingly finds the Department\u2019s calculation of the Sidmar Group\u2019s sales denominator to have been in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Remand Is Necessary So That Commerce May Consider Whether Sidmar Benefitted Through its Participation in a Joint Venture With the Government of Flanders.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final claim concerns Commerce\u2019s decision not to countervail the regional Government of Flanders\u2019 participation in a joint venture with Sidmar.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">In 1985, the GOB purchased both common and preferred stock in ALZ, pursuant to a royal decree which allowed the GOB to make share subscriptions in the Belgian steel industry. Commerce\u2019s Analysis Memorandum of ALZ Preference Shares of 03/19/99 at 1. According to the terms of the purchase, in 2005 the preferred shares are to be redeemed by ALZ at the higher of their subscription value (initial cost) or fair market value, or, at ALZ\u2019s option, converted to common shares. <em>Id. </em>at 2. Holders of preferred stock are entitled to a preferred dividend of six percent of the stock\u2019s face value, to the extent profits for such a dividend are available. <em>Id. </em>These dividends are not mandatory or cumulative; at the time of investigation ALZ had not issued a common or preferred dividend since 1985, although the company had been profitable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">In 1993, Sidmar expressed interest in buying this ALZ preferred stock from Gimvindus, a financial holding company for the GOF which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>acquired the stock in 1989 through a government reorganization. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At verification, Sidmar officials informed Commerce that 1993 was an unprofitable year for the Sidmar Group, and that it [was seeking to increase its consolidated holdings]. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>[The Government and Sidmar entered into a joint venture.

Reg. at 47243. Commerce found that because \u201cthe GOB [ ] sold these preference shares at a price below the market value for ALZ stock,\u201d the GOB had conferred a countervailable subsidy to Sid-mar. <em>Id. </em>For the <em>Final Determination, </em>however, Commerce reversed its position and found that, as Sidmar had not actually acquired any interests in the ALZ preferred shares, \u201cno countervailable benefit was conferred upon Sidmar though the creation of the joint venture.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15570. Explaining this reversal, Commerce stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">the Department verified that this transaction was structured in such a way that the government maintained ownership of ALZ\u2019s preference shares. Moreover, it was established at verification that Sidmar does not control the company. Thus, Sidmar neither controls the ALZ preference shares contributed to this company nor can profit from the shares. Accordingly, contrary to our <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>we determine that Sidmar did not \u201cacquire\u201d the preference shares originally purchased by the GOB. Therefore, no countervailable benefit was conferred upon Sidmar through the creation of the joint venture by Sidmar and the GOB.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Plaintiffs challenge the Department\u2019s findings on various grounds, each of which is summarized below. For the following reasons, the Court finds that remand is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Commerce Did Not Err in Concluding That Gimvindus Maintained Ownership of the ALZ Shares.</p>\n<p id=\"AyS\">Plaintiffs first attack the Department\u2019s conclusions by arguing that \u201cCommerce failed to recognize that ALZ\u2019s preference shares derived their value from two sources: (1) the market value of the shares, and (2) dividends.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 28. According to Plaintiffs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>record evidence shows that [the GOB\u2019s retained rights had no value] <em>Id. </em>As support for their claim, Plaintiffs cite, <em>inter alia, </em>[record evidence that the Government never realized a return from the retained rights]. <em>Id. </em>at 29. This, according to Plaintiffs, illustrates that \u201cthe preference shares derived their value from the eventual repurchase or reconversion of the shares at the market value,\u201d which was \u201cexactly what the GOB relinquished in the transaction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">In order for Commerce to impose a countervailing duty on merchandise imported into the United States, it must determine that a government is \u201cproviding, directly or indirectly, a countervailable subsidy with respect to the manufacture, production, or export\u201d of that merchandise. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671(a)(1) (1994). In relevant part, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(B) (1994) provides that a subsidy exists when \u201can authority * * * provides a financial contribution * * * to a person and <em>a benefit is thereby conferred.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">As noted above, in the <em>Final Determination </em>Commerce based its finding that no benefit had actually been conferred to Sidmar on the fact that Sidmar (1) did not own or control the ALZ preference shares, (2) could not profit from these shares, and (3) did not control Sidfin. <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15570. Plaintiffs essentially attack this conclusion by arguing that Sidmar did, in fact, receive a \u201cbenefit\u201d through Gimvindus\u2019 transfer of the \u201cmarket value\u201d of its ALZ shares to the joint venture. A close review of the evidence cited by Plaintiffs, however, proves this claim unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">To support their assertions that the ALZ preferred stock [had multiple rights, only some of which the Government retained in the transaction], Plaintiffs cite pages five and six of Commerce\u2019s verification report for Sidmar. Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 29. This document, however, does not evidence such a distinction. While the report states that any dividends paid by ALZ [cannot profit Sidmar], Verification Report for Sidmar of 1/20/99 (\u201cSidmar Verification Report\u201d) at 6, it says nothing about whether Sidmar or Sidfin became entitled to the \u201cmarket value\u201d of the ALZ preferred shares. Rather, it simply provides a description of the creation of Sidfin which, if anything, implies that [the Government] retained <em>all </em>the rights associated with the ALZ stock. <em>See id. </em>at 6 [The joint venture consolidates Sidmar\u2019s holdings while retaining the Government\u2019s ownership of ALZ\u2019s preference shares] (emphasis added).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Moreover, other evidence cited by Plaintiffs actually undermines their argument. In their effort to show that the \u201cdividend rights\u201d from the ALZ preferred stock had no value, Plaintiffs cite the Government of Flanders Verification Report as evidence that [the Government] \u2018\u201cviewed the dividend as insignificant and would rather focus on the eventual repurchase or reconversion of the preference shares in 2005.\u2019\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 29 (quoting Verification Report for the Government of Flanders of 01/27/99 (\u201cFlanders Verification Report\u201d) at 9). By showing that [the Government] was concerned with the repurchase or reconversion of the shares in 2005, however, this statement actually indicates that [the Government retained ownership] of the ALZ preferred stock after the creation of Sidfin. Presumably, had Sidmar become entitled to [profit from the shares, the Government] would have little or no interest in their redemption.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\">In light of this evidence, the Court finds no basis for concluding that Gimvindus retained anything less than the complete right to all revenues that were to be derived from the ALZ preferred stock after the formation of Sidfin. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument therefore fails to disturb the Department\u2019s factual findings that a benefit had not been conferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Remand Is Necessary So That Commerce May Fully Consider Sidmar\u2019s Statement That it Administers the Joint Venture Alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The Record Does Not Show That Commerce Considered Sidmar\u2019s Financial Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Plaintiffs further challenge Commerce\u2019s factual findings by arguing that Commerce ignored three pieces of record evidence which show that Sidmar actually controlled the joint venture. First, Plaintiffs cite a remark in Sidmar\u2019s audited financial statement that Sidfin \u201cis administered by our group only\u201d as evidence that the ALZ preferred stock was actually controlled by Sidmar, contrary to the Department\u2019s findings. Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 32 (citing Sidmar\u2019s 1994 Financial Statement at 64). Upon review, the Court finds merit in this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">In reviewing Commerce\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard, the agency is \u201cpresumed * * * to have considered all pertinent information sought to be brought to its attention.\u201d <em>Nakajima All Co. v. United States, </em>14 CIT 469, 478, 744 F. Supp. 1168, 1175 (1990); <em>see also United States v.

Torrington Co. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 220, 224, 790 F. Supp. 1161, 1167-68 (1992) (\u201cThe fact that certain information is not discussed in a[n International Trade] Commission determination does not establish that the Commission failed to consider that information because there is no statutory requirement that the Commission must respond to each piece of evidence presented by the parties.\u201d), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>991 F.2d 809 (Fed.

INS, </em>972 F.2d 631, 636 (5th Cir. 1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">That said, it is also well-established that Commerce\u2019s total failure to consider or discuss record evidence which, on its face, provides significant support for an alternative conclusion renders the Department\u2019s determination unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See Usinor Sacilor v.

Cir. 1994) (unpublished disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Applying these considerations to this case, the Court finds that further explanation is necessary. Although Sidmar\u2019s statement that it alone administers Sidfin clearly contradicts a seemingly significant factual basis underpinning the Department\u2019s determination that no benefit was conferred,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the Department did not explicitly weigh or analyze the significance of this statement. For instance, when Plaintiffs raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>this statement before Commerce, the Department simply responded that \u201c[a]s noted above, we have determined that the 1993 capitalization of Sidfin International did not involve a sale of shares or any other potentially countervailable event. Consequently, the valuation methodologies used in this transaction are irrelevant.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15576. Nothing in this explanation addresses the issue of whether Sidmar \u201ccontrols\u201d Sidfin. Rather, it simply cites to the Department\u2019s findings without discussing what, if any, effect Sidmar\u2019s statement may have on those findings. Without more, the Court is simply left to conclude that this seemingly important record evidence was not considered by Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">In its Response, Defendant observes that when Commerce asked Sid-mar officials about this remark at verification, the Department received the answer that \u201cthis statement was \u2018perhaps a slight exaggeration intended to strengthen Sidmar\u2019s company image.\u2019\u201d Defendant\u2019s Response at 32-33 (quoting Sidmar Verification Report at 6). According to Defendant, \u201c[t]his explanation, which is not addressed by plaintiffs, undermines plaintiffs\u2019 reliance upon the financial statement as support for their argument that Sidmar controlled the joint venture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">This explanation, however, reads more into the record than in fact exists. A review of Sidmar\u2019s Verification Report confirms that Sidmar officials did characterize their statement about administering Sidfin as a slight exaggeration. <em>See </em>Sidmar Verification Report at 6. Beyond simply noting this response, however, Commerce did not weigh, or even comment upon, the significance of this characterization in its verification report of Sidmar. Nor has Defendant pointed to any other place in the record where Commerce considered this evidence. Thus, Defendant\u2019s statement that Sidmar\u2019s explanation \u201cundermines plaintiffs\u2019 reliance upon the financial statement\u201d constitutes a <em>post hoc </em>rationalization that this Court may not consider. <em>See Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>499 U.S. 144, 156 (1991) (\u201c[Ajgency \u2018litigating positions\u2019 are not entitled to deference when they are merely * * * counsel\u2019s \u2018post hoc rationalizations\u2019 for agency action, advanced for the first time in the reviewing court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Accordingly, because there is no evidence that Commerce actually evaluated Sidmar\u2019s statement that Sidfin \u201cis administered by our group only,\u201d remand is appropriate. On remand, Commerce is instructed to consider the significance of this statement and determine whether, or how, this affects its conclusion that no countervailable benefit was conferred to Sidmar through the creation of Sidfin. In so doing, Commerce shall examine this statement in light of Sidmar\u2019s subsequent explanation (noted in Sidmar\u2019s Verification Report at 6) that this statement was \u201cperhaps a slight exaggeration intended to strengthen Sidmar\u2019s company image,\u201d as well as any other relevant record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">On Remand, Commerce is Instructed to Clarify its Methodology for Determining Whether a Benefit Was Conferred Through Sidmar\u2019s Participation in the Joint Venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In addition to raising a factual question about whether Sidfin was actually controlled by Sidmar, Sidmar\u2019s audited financial statement raises a question about the methodology Commerce applied to reach its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">As noted previously, Plaintiffs\u2019 multiple arguments attack the factual basis for Commerce\u2019s conclusion that a benefit was not conferred upon Sidmar through its participation in the Sidfin joint venture with Gim-vindus. Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(B) (1994), a subsidy is conferred when \u201can authority * * * provides a financial contribution * * * to a person <em>and a benefit is thereby conferred.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Although this statute elaborates on the concept of \u201cbenefit conferred\u201d by stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that an equity infusion will normally confer a benefit if the government\u2019s investment decision is inconsistent with the normal practice of private investors, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(E)(i) (1994), the statute does not state further what it means to \u201cconfer\u201d a benefit or be the \u201crecipient\u201d of a benefit. Nor has Commerce promulgated any regulations on point. Thus, the Court is left to infer from the <em>Final Determination </em>itself what methodology, if any, Commerce employed to make its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In the <em>Final Determination </em>Commerce identified the fact that \u201cthe government maintained ownership of ALZ\u2019s preference shares,\u201d as well as the fact that \u201cSidmar neither controls the ALZ preference shares contributed to this company nor can profit from the shares,\u201d to support its finding. While the question of whether Sidmar owns or can profit from the ALZ shares has obvious relevance to whether a countervailable benefit was conferred to Sidmar, it is not obvious how \u201ccontrol\u201d of Sidfin would benefit Sidmar. <em>See Aimcor, Alabama Silicon, Inc. v. United States, </em>18 CIT 1117, 1120, 871 F. Supp. 447, 451 (1994) (\u201cThat [a Venezuelan Government-owned holding company] exercised some control over [a Venezuelan producer of ferrosilicon] does not necessarily indicate that the benefit to [the holding company] passed through to [the producer].\u201d), <em>aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>154 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Moreover, the record does not make clear what significance the question of \u201ccontrol\u201d has compared to the questions of ownership or profits, or what relevance these two factors have in relation to each other. Thus, without elaboration, following remand the Court would find it difficult to assess whether Commerce\u2019s findings are supported by substantial record evidence, should Commerce reverse its finding on this issue of \u201ccontrol.\u201d <em>See Atchinson, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. Wichita Bd. of Trade, </em>412 U.S. 800, 805 (1973) (\u201cA reviewing court must be able to discern in the Commission\u2019s actions the policy it is now pursuing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>On remand, therefore, Commerce is further instructed to clarify its methodology for determining whether a benefit was conferred to Sid-mar through the creation of, and its participation in, Sidfin. Specifically, Commerce is instructed to state <em>why </em>it examined \u201cownership,\u201d \u201ccontrol,\u201d and \u201cprofit\u201d in determining whether a countervailing benefit had been conferred, and clarify the relative importance that it attributed to each of these or other factors. Should the Department determine upon remand that Sidmar actually controlled Sidfin, Commerce shall also discuss, in light of its methodology, whether (and if so, how) Sidmar\u2019s control affects its determination that a benefit had not been conferred upon Sidmar.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">None of the Other Evidence Identified by Plaintiffs Undermines Commerce\u2019s Findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Turning to the last two pieces of record evidence which, Plaintiffs claim, undermine Commerce\u2019s factual determination, the Court finds Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In their brief, Plaintiffs cite the explanation of a Sidmar official that [Sidmar was consolidating its assets] as evidence that \u201cthe government structured this transaction to transfer control of ALZ\u2019s preference shares to SIDMAR.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 32 (citing Sidmar Verification Report at 5). Whether or not all of ALZ\u2019s assets were consolidated within the Sidmar Group for accounting purposes, however, does not indicate whether Sidmar actually controlled the joint venture or the ALZ preferred shares. In fact, this evidence actually makes clear that the creation of Sidfin did <em>not </em>transfer ownership of the ALZ shares to Sidmar. <em>See </em>Sidmar Verification Report at 6 [Sidmar explained that this transaction is structured in such a way that the Government maintained ownership of ALZ\u2019s preference shares]. It also indicates that Sid-mar did reo\u00ed have exclusive control over Sidfin\u2019s activities. <em>See id. </em>(noting that the chairmanship of the board of Sidfin \u201calternates annually between the companies,\u201d that \u201cthe chairman does not have the authority of a deciding vote,\u201d and that its statement about exclusively administering Sidfin \u201cwas perhaps a slight exaggeration\u201d). Thus, when read in context, the Court does not agree that a remand is necessary for Commerce to consider (or reconsider) this record evidence, since it does not undermine the Department\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Finally, and as further alleged evidence that \u201cthe GOB sought to transfer control of ALZ\u2019s preference shares to SIDMAR to confer an economic benefit on [Sidmar],\u201d Plaintiffs cite a statement by a [Government official that Sidmar was interested in purchasing the ALZ preference shares]. Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 33 (citing Flanders Verification Report at 11). Once again, however, Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence does not indicate that Sidmar exercised any control over Sidfin, or for that matter obtained ownership of the ALZ preferred shares. Rather, when read in its entirety, this evidence is simply silent as to the control of Sidfin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>and makes clear that Sidmar did <em>not </em>eventually own the ALZ preferences shares. <em>See </em>Flanders Verification Report at 11 [explanation by Government official that the Government retained the full value of its shares] (emphasis added). Thus, the Court does not find that this evidence undermines the reasonableness of the Department\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Should Commerce Decide That Sidmar Received a Countervailable Subsidy, the Department Must Consider Plaintiffs\u2019 Arguments on How to Measure Whether a Benefit Was Conferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final argument concerns the value of the shares that the GOB and Sidmar respectively contributed to the creation of Sidfin. According to Plaintiffs, \u201c[t]he record shows that the GOB contributed ALZ\u2019s preference shares to the joint venture on preferential terms because SIDMAR gained partial ownership of assets worth significantly more than its contribution, and the GOB received shares in the joint venture worth considerably less that its contribution of the ALZ preference shares.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 29-30.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> As support, Plaintiffs note that the GOB incorrectly treated the ALZ preferred stock as \u201cdebt instruments\u201d when, in order to value its contribution, it figured the net present value of the stocks\u2019 minimum redemption price in 2005. <em>Id. </em>at 30. Rather, Plaintiffs say, the value of the preferred shares should have been based on their market value at the time of the transaction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Responding to this argument in the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce stated that since it had \u201cdetermined that the 1993 capitalization of Sid-fin International did not involve a sale of shares or any other potentially countervailable event * * * the valuation methodologies used in this transaction are irrelevant.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15576. Though brief, this explanation is sufficient, should Commerce continue to find on remand that Sidmar did not receive a countervailable benefit from the Sidfin joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Underlying Plaintiffs\u2019 valuation argument is the assumption that Sidmar received a countervailable benefit because it <em>\u201cgained partial ownership of assets </em>worth significantly more than its contribution.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 29-30 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 33 (\u201cSIDMAR received a benefit * * * because the company received a 50 percent ownership interest in ALZ\u2019s preference shares * * *. \u201c). As Commerce found, however, [the Government] did not relinquish, and Sidmar did not gain, ownership of assets through the creation of Sidfin. Rather, each side retained full ownership over its respective contributions to the joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">In light of this determination, the Court finds that Commerce acted reasonably in not valuing Gimvindus\u2019 preferred shares in ALZ. Simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>put, the valuation of assets that were never actually \u201cconferred\u201d for purposes of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(E) (1994) is, quite obviously, a moot question.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Accordingly, if the Department continues to find on remand that Sidmar did not receive a countervailable benefit (notwithstanding Sid-mar\u2019s remarks in its financial statement), the Court will uphold its decision not to examine the valuation data as being in accordance with law and supported by substantial record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">A different situation arises, however, if the Department finds that a financial contribution was conferred to Sidmar. In that case, the question of valuing the ALZ preferred stock would be relevant in determining whether the financial contribution <em>actually </em>conferred a \u201cbenefit\u201d to Sidmar for purposes of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(E) (1994). Specifically, under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(E)(i) (1994), Commerce would be required to determine whether [the Government\u2019s] decision was \u201cinconsistent with the ususal investment practice of private investors\u201d in Belgium \u2014 an inquiry for which use of Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed valuation methodology may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Because Commerce did not address this matter in the <em>Final Determination, </em>however, it is not appropriate for the Court to do so now. Rather, under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the question of what methodology to use in deciding whether [the Government\u2019s] equity infusion was consistent with usual investment practices is one best addressed by Commerce in the first instance. <em>See Union Camp. Corp. v. United States, </em>53 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1327 (CIT 1999) (\u201c[P]rimary jurisdiction is appropriately invoked where the question at hand involves complicated issues of administrative policy, practice and procedure that ought best to be resolved by the agency.\u201d); <em>Borlem S.A.\u2014Empreedimentos </em>Indus<em>triais v. United States, </em>13 CIT 231, 234, 710 F. Supp. 797, 800 (1989) (\u201c\u2019Primary jurisdiction is a doctrine of common law, wholly court-made, that is designed to guide a court in determining whether and when it should refrain from or postpone the exercise of its own jurisdiction so that an agency may first answer some question presented.\u2019\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>(quoting Davis, Administrative Law Treatise 81 (2nd Ed., Vol. 4,1983)), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>913 F.2d 933 (Fed. Cir. 1990).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Thus, should Commerce reverse its prior finding on remand and decide that a financial contribution was conferred to Sidmar through the joint venture, the Department is instructed to examine and decide upon the propriety of using Plaintiffs\u2019 suggested methodology for (1) deciding whether a \u201cbenefit\u201d was conferred for purposes of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(E)(i) (1994); and; (2) if applicable, valuing the amount of subsidy conferred by Gimvindus.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court remands this case to Commerce for consideration of the issues discussed herein.

Reg. at 15569. In so doing, Commerce requested specific information concerning <em>each </em>of the GOB\u2019s 1985 equity infusions to ALZ. See Dep\u2019t of Commerce Countervailing Duty Questionnaire at 2-3 (seeking information on the conversion of BF 1,161 billion in state-guaranteed debt to equity and the purchase of additional ALZ shares for BF 1,400 billion). Commerce then analyzed the GOB\u2019s purchase of ALZ\u2019s \u201cpreference shares\u201d in 1985 separately from its investigation of the GOB\u2019s purchase of ALZ\u2019s \u201ccommon shares\u201d in that year, and concluded in both instances that the equity infusions did <em>not </em>constitute contervailable subsidies. <em>See Final Determination, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 15569-70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\"> Plaintiffs further appear to argue that, because this record evidence was sufficient to make a subsidy determination, Commerce erred in finding this evidence inadequate. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 12. (\u201cThus, to the extent the agency\u2019s consideration of a new allegation turns on whether the record evidence is sufficient to make a determination regarding a program\u2019s countervailability, the 1984 equity infusion did not constitute a \u2018new allegation\u2019 given the abundance of record evidence concerning this subsidy.\u201d). As noted above, in the <em>Final Determination </em>Commerce rejected Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation because it was untimely \u2014 not because the record evidence supporting it was inadequate. To the extent Plaintiffs attack a rationale that was not advanced by Commerce in the <em>Final Determination, </em>the Court will not consider their argument. <em>See SEC v.

Such a power would also conflict with Congress\u2019 intention in adding this provision to the Tariff Act of 1930, which was to avoid \u201cunnecessary separate\u201d investigations and \u201cincreased] expenses and burdens\u201d by \u201cincluding] such practices within the scope of any current investigation, or make them a part of the library of subsidy practices so that persons in the future may know of them when deciding whether to petition for an investigation.\u201d Sen.

Congress, however, clearly intended that all potentially countervailable programs be investigated and catalogued, regardless of when evidence on these programs became reasonably available.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">Of course, a petitioner who does not timely make a subsidy allegation, even though it could, risks having Commerce defer its investigation to a subsequent administrative review. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.311(c)(2) (2000) (allowing Commerce to \u201cdefer consideration of the newly discovered practice, subsidy, or subsidy program until a subsequent administrative review\u201d if Commerce \u201cconcludes that insufficient time remains before the scheduled date for the final determination.\u201d). Thus, it is always in a petitioner\u2019s interest to expeditiously make Commere aware of potential subsidies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\"> in its Response, Defendant states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">The information relied upon by plaintiffs certainly does not provide a complete factual basis for investigating, not to mention countervailing, benefits associated with a 1984 equity infusion m Sidmar. Of course, if this information was sufficient to provide a basis for investigating a 1984 equity infusion, there is no reason why petitioners could not have filed a timely subsidy allegation considering that such information was filed in June 1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUn\">Defendant\u2019s Response at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">This argument is problematic in two respects. First, while Defendant correctly notes that Plaintiffs should have made a timely subsidy allegation if all the facts were reasonably available, this point is irrelevant to whether Commerce had an obligation to investigate this transaction. Nothing in the plain language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677d (1994) suggests that Commerce is relieved of its obligation if a petitioner could have made a timely allegation, but failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">Second, there is no finding by Commerce that the information Plaintiffs cite provides an insufficient factual basis for investigating the 1984 equity infusion in Sidmar. Thus, counsel\u2019s observation concerning this evidence can only be viewed as a <em>post hoc </em>rationalization, which this Court may not consider.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b480-13\"> SNCI was a public credit institution which, until 1997, was fifty percent owned by the Belgian Government. <em>Final Determination, </em>64 Fed.

In considering these four factors, the investigating authority is to take account of the diversification of economic activities within the relevant jurisdiction, as well as the length of time that a subsidy program has been in operation.

The Court therefore addresses the two arguments concurrently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b502-6\"> In their initial memorandum, Plaintiffs indicate that Sidmar\u2019s balance sheet was strengthened through its participation in the Sidfin joint venture, and that this \u201cstrengthening\u201d conferred a countervailable benefit on Sidmar. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum at 33 &amp; n.34 (stating that \u201c[t]he GOB was able to accomplish its objectives of * * * strengthening SIDMAR\u2019s balance sheet by contributing ALZ\u2019s preference shares\u201d and that \u201c[the joint venture] had other economic benefits for SIDMAR such as strengthening its balance sheet\u201d). Whether or not a firm\u2019s balance sheet benefitted from its participation in a joint venture with a government entity, however, is also a moot question where, as here, Commerce finds that no beneficial financial contribution for purposes of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(B) (1994) passed between the government and the private party. Rather, in the absence of such a showing under \u00a7 1677(5)(B), any benefit that the private party received through its participation is simply of no matter for countervailing duty purposes. <em>See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Stainless Steel Plate in Coils from South Africa, </em>64 Fed. Reg. 15553 (1999) (finding that, even though two private parties in a joint venture with the South African Government accounted for one-third of the venture\u2019s year-end results in their financial statements, the Government\u2019s participation did not convey a countervailable subsidy because it participated on terms consistent with the normal practice of private investors).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Thus, if Commerce continues to find that Sidmar did not receive a countervailable benefit from [the Government] on remand, notwithstanding Sidmar\u2019s remarks in its financial statement, Commerce need not consider whether Sidmar\u2019s balance sheet benefitted from the creation of Sidfin. Should Commerce reverse its finding, however, and find that a countervailable benefit was conferred to Sidmar, Commerce may wish to examine record evidence concerning Sidmar\u2019s financial statements to determine whether the government\u2019s investment decision was inconsistent with private investment practice, for purposes of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(E), or make any other determination that the Department finds necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b503-19\"> In <em>United States v.
