(\u201cGourmet\u201d). The determination under review is <em>Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts from Taiwan, </em>64 Fed. Reg. 17,314 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1999) (final results of antidumping duty admin, rev.) [hereinafter <em>\u201cFinal Results\u201d]. </em>Gourmet argues that the United States Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d or \u201cthe Department\u201d) erred in refusing [o conduct a verification of Gourmet\u2019s reported cost and sales data, despite Gourmet\u2019s alleged independent substantiation of the information submitted to Commerce. Gourmet also argues that Commerce erred in applying total adverse facts available to determine Gourmet\u2019s dumping margin on the ground that the information provided by Gourmet in its questionnaire responses was unverifiable pursuant to both 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(D) and 1677e(b) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (1994). The court must uphold Commerce\u2019s final determination unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">On October 30,1997, Commerce published a notice of initiation of the sixth administrative review of an antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts (\u201cCPLN\u201d) from Taiwan. <em>See Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews, </em>62 Fed. Reg. 58,705 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1997). The period of review (\u201cPOR\u201d) was September 1,1996 through August 31,1997. <em>Id. </em>Commerce sent questionnaires to eighteen companies, including Gourmet. <em>Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts from </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>Taiwan, </em>63 Fed. Reg. 53,875, 53,875 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1998) (preliminary results of antidumping duty admin, rev.) [hereinafter <em>\u201cPreliminary Results\u201d]. </em>Questionnaires sent to seven of the companies were returned as undeliverable. <em>Id. </em>These firms received the \u201call others\u201d rate of 6.93 percent, which was established in the less than fair value (\u201cLTFV\u201d) investigation. <em>Id. </em>Those firms that did not respond to the questionnaire, or whose submissions were substantially deficient, were given an adverse margin of 10.67 percent, the highest rate from the LTFV investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 53,875-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Gourmet provided a timely response to Commerce\u2019s questionnaire on December 23, 1997. <em>Questionnaire Response </em>(Dec. 23, 1997), ER. Doc. 13, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 8. Commerce sent Gourmet a supplemental questionnaire requesting audited financial statements and additional information in order to reconcile the costs and sales reported in Gourmet\u2019s questionnaire response with its audited financial statements. <em>Supplemental Questionnaire </em>(Feb. 11,1998), at 1, P.R. Doc. 17, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 9, at 3. Gourmet responded that its financial statements for the POR had not been audited, and that although the statements provided to the Taiwanese government as tax returns were prepared with an outside accountant, there was no independent auditor\u2019s statement and at that point Gourmet could not submit one. <em>Supplemental Questionnaire Response </em>(Mar. 9, 1998), at 1, F.R. Doc. 24, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 10, at 8. Commerce perceived a discrepancy in Gourmet\u2019s responses and asked Gourmet to explain why it had audited accounting records in previous reviews and not in the sixth review. <em>Supplemental Questionnaire </em>(Mar. 31, 1998), at 1, F.R. Doc. 28, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 16, at 3. The Department also asked Gourmet to explain why a verification in this POR would lead to a different result from previous reviews. <em>Id. </em>Gourmet explained that the confusion arose from an translation error, confusing the distinction in English between an auditor and an accountant. <em>Supplemental Questionnaire Response </em>(Apr. 3, 1998), at 2, F.R. Doc. 29, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 12, at 2. Although an accountant prepared Gourmet\u2019s tax returns, Gourmet did not conduct an audit of its financial statements. <em>Id. </em>Gourmet stated that such an audit was not required of it under Taiwanese law. <em>Id. </em>Because its tax returns were prepared with the assistance of an outside accountant, Gourmet had previously incorrectly stated that its financial statements were audited on a yearly basis. <em>Id. </em>Gourmet asserted that a verification in this review would differ from past reviews because Gourmet had hired the accounting firm of Diwan, Ernst &amp; Young (\u201cDE&amp;Y\u201d) to conduct a special audit of its accounting records, and that DE&amp;Y\u2019s findings would constitute independent substantiation of the data Gourmet had submitted. <em>Id. </em>at 4; <em>see Letter from DE&amp;Y to Gourmet </em>(Mar. 17, 1998), at Ex. S-1, C.R. Doc. 4, P.R. Doc 26, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 16, at <em>6-7; Letter from DE&amp;Y to Gourmet </em>(May 18, 1998), at Ex. 1, C.R. Doc. 9, P.R. Doc. 42, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 18, at 7. Despite these responses by Gourmet to Commerce\u2019s questionnaires and the work performed by DE&amp;Y, Commerce determined that it could not reconcile the data Gourmet submitted in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>questionnaire responses to its financial statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Final Results, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 17,316. Commerce determined that Gourmet\u2019s responses were unverifiable and applied the highest available rate of 10.67 percent to Gourmet based on total adverse facts available. <em>Id. </em>at 17,316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">I. Verification</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">On the basis of information on the record, Commerce determined that Gourmet\u2019s accounting system and the information submitted in its questionnaire responses were unreliable. <em>Final Results, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 17,316. Commerce further determined that because Gourmet\u2019s submissions were not reconcilable to its financial statements, the information submitted was unverifiable and applied facts otherwise available. <em>Id. </em>Gourmet now challenges this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Commerce\u2019s statutory mandate is to calculate antidumping duty margins as accurately as possible. <em>Rubberflex SDN. BHD. v. United States, </em>59 F. Supp.2d 1338, 1346 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 1999) (citation omitted). In order to satisfy this requirement, it is essential that a respondent provide Commerce with accurate, credible, and verifiable information. Where Commerce determines that information submitted in a questionnaire response is unverifiable, 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677e(a)(2)(D)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> authorizes Commerce, subject to 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677m(d) (1994)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, to substitute facts otherwise available. The use of facts available provides the \u201conly incentive to foreign exporters and producers to respond to Commerce questionnaires\u201d in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings. Statement of Administrative Action, accompanying H.R. Rep. No. 103-826(1), at 868, <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3773, 4198 (\u201cSAA\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Gourmet argues that Commerce erred in determining that its questionnaire responses were unverifiable, based solely on the fact that Gourmet did not provide Commerce with audited financial statements. Gourmet insists that Commerce could have conducted a verification of its bank statements and tax returns, which it had allegedly independently substantiated, in place of audited financial statements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Gourmet insists that Commerce\u2019s practice is to accept sources other than audited financial statements. In <em>Collated Roofing Nails from Taiwan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>62 Fed. Reg. 51,427 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1997) (notice of final determination of sales at LTFV) [hereinafter <em>\u201cCollated Roofing Nails\u201d] </em>Commerce stated that when a respondent does not have audited financial statements, the Department \u201cmay use the company\u2019s tax return as an independent source to substantiate the company\u2019s questionnaire responses.\u201d 62 Fed. Reg. at 51,427. The independent source, however, must be proven reliable and useable. In <em>Collated Roofing Nails, </em>Commerce was unable to reconcile one respondent\u2019s unaudited financial statement to its tax return, and therefore determined that the unaudited financial statements were unreliable and unusable, and therefore unverifiable. <em>Id. </em>at 51,427. For another respondent, the Department was able to reconcile unaudited financial statements with a tax return and determined that the information in the financial statements was reliable. <em>Id. </em>at 51,437. The Department had also stated in <em>Fresh Cut Flowers from Mexico, </em>60 Fed. Reg. 49,569, 49,570 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1995) (final results of antidumping duty admin, rev.) that respondents may be permitted to submit tax returns as independent substantiation of their questionnaire responses in the absence of audited financial statements. In that determination, Commerce found that without an explanation reconciling the data in respondent\u2019s tax returns with its financial statements, the tax returns could not be used to independently substantiate the reported sales and costs, rendering the entire questionnaire responses unusable. <em>Id. </em>The Department explained its practice in this review, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Any\">The Department does not reject questionnaire responses simply because the respondent does not have an audited financial statement. In such situations, the Department looks to other financial records, <em>prepared for purposes independent of the antidumping proceeding, </em>such as tax statements, which attest to the veracity of a respondent\u2019s accounting system and information submitted to the Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APbC\"><em>Final Results, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 17,316 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"Ald\">Gourmet contends that it did independently substantiate the information in its questionnaire responses by hiring the outside accounting firm, DE&amp;Y, to conduct a special audit of its financial system. Gourmet submits that DE&amp;Y\u2019s findings constitute acceptable independent substantiation of the data Gourmet submitted. <em>See Supplemental Questionnaire Resp., </em>(Apr. 3, 1998), at 4, P.R. Doc. 29, Def.\u2019s App., Tab 6, at 4. DE&amp;Y\u2019s \u201cspecial audit,\u201d however, does not provide substantiation independent of the antidumping proceedings, which is what Commerce is seeking. Under the facts of this case, it was reasonable for Commerce to find that the audit done solely for the purposes of the antidumping proceeding was not sufficiently independent for the Department to be confident that it would be reconciling the cost and sales data.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, DE&amp;Y qualified its review of Gourmet\u2019s records by stating that, \u201cWe did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>carry out an audit of Gourmet\u2019s management accounts or general ledger in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.\u201d <em>Letter from DE&amp;Y to Gourmet </em>(Mar. 17, 1998), Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 16, at 6. Furthermore, DE&amp;Y stated that \u201c[i]n conducting our work we have relied on the Corporation\u2019s management accounts, general ledger and supporting documentation obtained from Gourmet. We therefore make no representation regarding the accuracy or completeness of such information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As Commerce suggests, DE&amp;Y simply took the information Gourmet provided it at face value.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Commerce determined that Gourmet failed to demonstrate that the information which it placed on the record accurately reflected all of the relevant sales made by the company during the period of review and its cost of production. <em>Final Results, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 17,316. As DE&amp;Y admitted, the work it performed did not constitute an audit of Gourmet\u2019s accounting system. <em>Letter from DE&amp;Y to Gourmet, </em>at Ex. S-l, Pl.\u2019s App., Tab 16, at 6. Its work was not itself substantiation prepared for purposes other than antidumping purposes nor was it an analysis of a reliable accounting system or records prepared for such purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Commerce\u2019s determination that the alleged independent substantiation by DE&amp;Y fell short of rendering Gourmet\u2019s questionnaire responses verifiable is reasonable and is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Certain Preserved Mushrooms from Chile, </em>63 Fed. Reg. 56,613, 56,616-17 (Dep\u2019t Commerce 1998) (notice of final determination of sales at LTFV) (where vast majority of respondents information was accurate and verifiable, and discrepancies were \u201cspecific and quantifiable,\u201d Department was able to reconcile reported costs to financial statements). In this case, there was no substantiation of Gourmet\u2019s data independent from the antidumping investigation. Therefore, Commerce\u2019s resort to facts otherwise available pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(D) was in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">II. Application of Total Adverse Facts Available</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Gourmet also argues that Commerce\u2019s resort to adverse facts available is not supported by substantial evidence on the record and is not otherwise in accordance with law because Commerce failed to adhere to the statutory standard for applying adverse facts available. Following a determination that the use of facts available is authorized pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>19 U.S.C. \u00a71677e(a), subsection (b)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> further permits Commerce to apply an adverse inference if Commerce makes the additional finding that \u201can interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677e(b); <em>see also Borden, Inc. v. United States, </em>4 F. Supp.2d 1221, 1246 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 1998). In making its determination that a respondent has been uncooperative, Commerce is to consider the extent to which a party may benefit from its own lack of cooperation. SAA at 870, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4199. Commerce is required to articulate the reasons for its conclusion that a party failed to act to the best of its ability prior to applying adverse facts available. <em>Mannesmannrohren-Werke AG v. United States, </em>77 F. Supp.2d 1302, 1313-14 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 1999). Commerce cannot simply repeat its facts available finding under 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677e(a) to support its use of adverse facts available under 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677e(b). <em>Ferro Union, Inc. v. United States, </em>44 F. Supp.2d 1310, 1329 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">In this case Commerce stated that the basis for the adverse finding was Gourmet\u2019s continued failure to provide verifiable data. <em>Final Results, </em>64 Fed. Reg. at 17,316. Commerce stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">We believe that Gourmet has had sufficient notice of the Department\u2019s requirements for verifiable submissions and ample opportunity to provide information that is amendable to verification. Yet Gourmet has continued to provide unverifiable data. Therefore, we determine that Gourmet has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability, and thus we are using an adverse inference in our application of facts available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\"><em>Id. </em>Unlike <em>Borden, </em>Commerce determined in this case that Gourmet had the ability to produce verifiable information and failed to do so. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cIn this case, Gourmet possesses relevant * * * financial statements.\u201d) That reasoning supports the Department\u2019s conclusion that Gourmet failed to comply to the best of its ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Gourmet insists that a finding that it failed to comply to the best of its ability because of its continued failure to provide verifiable information relies on an analysis of Gourmet\u2019s behavior in past reviews, which is not generally permitted. <em>See E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>No. 96-11-02509, 1998 WL 42598, at *11 (Ct. Int\u2019l Trade Jan. 29,1998) (\u201cCommerce\u2019s longstanding practice, upheld by this court, is to treat each segment of an antidumping proceeding, including the antidump-ing investigation and the administrative reviews that may follow, as in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>dependent proceedings with separate records and which lead to independent determinations.\u201d) (citation omitted). When Commerce is judging a party\u2019s ability to comply in the context of an administrative review, as opposed to an initial investigation, it is not inappropriate for Commerce to consider that party\u2019s past behavior.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Past participation may be relevant to notice, knowledge and reliance issues. This does not violate the independent nature of the proceedings, rather in the context of this case it acknowledges that Gourmet had participated in the investigation and several reviews and was familiar with Commerce\u2019s requirements.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Normally Commerce may not require a party to change its accounting system or provide information which it simply does not have. <em>See Borden, </em>4 F. Supp.2d at 1246-47. Commerce may, however, require a party to provide financial statements which are usable or suffer the consequences. Under appropriate factual circumstances, the failure to provide such statements can justifiably lead to the conclusion that a party failed to comply to the best of its ability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Gourmet argues, however, that it did not have sufficient notice of what type of information would satisfy Commerce, and that Commerce should have told Gourmet from the outset that in this case only audited financial statements would suffice, so that Gourmet could avoid the expense of hiring DE&amp;Y. Commerce\u2019s initial questionnaire asked for audited and unaudited financial statements. <em>See Questionnaire Response </em>(Dec. 23, 1997), at A-12, P.R. Doc. 13, Def.\u2019s App., Tab 1, at 2. The supplemental questionnaire further stated: <em>\u201cUnless there are compelling reasons not to do so, </em>it is generally the Department\u2019s practice to reconcile questionnaire responses to audited financial statements.\u201d <em>Supplemental Questionnaire </em>(Feb. 11, 1998) at 1, P.R. Doc. 17, Fl.\u2019s App., Tab 9, at 3 (emphasis added). It was in response to this questionnaire that Gourmet informed Commerce of the special audit being performed by DE&amp;Y. <em>Response to Supplemental Questionnaire </em>(Mar. 9, 1998) at 1, P.R. Doc. 24, Fl.\u2019s App., Tab 10 at 8. Gourmet thus incurred the expense of hiring DE&amp;Y prior to presenting Commerce with this alternate form of attempted substantiation. The Department alleges, however, that it could not know whether the special audit would constitute independent substantiation until it saw the results of DE&amp;Y\u2019s work. For its part, Gourmet should have known that Commerce\u2019s preference was to substantiate with audited financial statements, and that \u201cindependent\u201d meant information independent of the antidumping investigation. Because the DE&amp;Y audit was not a full scale audit, and was not sufficiently independent, Commerce found the special audit insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Although Gourmet responded to Commerce\u2019s questionnaires, it did not provide the kind of information Commerce required to verify the questionnaire responses. In light of the fact that it was within Gourmet\u2019s capacity to provide the right kind of information, Commerce\u2019s determination that Gourmet failed to comply to the best of its ability is in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Commerce correctly applied 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(D) and 1677e(b). Accordingly, the <em>Final Results </em>are affirmed in their entirety.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-9\"> Gourmet has acknowledged that it [ ]. Gourmet admits that [ ].
