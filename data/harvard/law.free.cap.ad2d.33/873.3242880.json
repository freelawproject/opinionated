There being sufficient evidence in the record from which appropriate findings may be made, however, we have re-evaluated the proof and make additional findings as follows: Annual gross income $15,400 less annual expenses for taxes $2,020; insurance $400; maintenance and janitor $580; management $450; and heat $1,800; leaving a net annual income of $10,150, of which $2,505 is imputable to land ($41,760 at 6%) and $7,645 is imputable to the building which capitalized at 9% (7% return plus 2% recapture) gives a building value of $85,000.
