The legal services were necessary to oppose defendant\u2019s unsuccessful application to modify the judgment of separation by reducing the permanent alimony therein provided; and plaintiff accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, was entitled to counsel fees for services rendered in the court below and on this appeal. The counsel fees so awarded are to be paid within 20 days after service of a copy entered hereon with notice of entry thereof. Concur \u2014 Stevens, P.
