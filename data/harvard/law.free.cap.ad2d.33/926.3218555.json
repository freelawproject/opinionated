This appeal is from that portion of the order which precludes appellant from raising the issue of \u201c defendant\u2019s mental status at the time of conviction.\u201d Defendant, indicted for murder in the first degree, was examined by two psychiatrists and a psychologist, all of whom reported that he was not mentally defective and that he was <em>\u201c </em>capable of understanding the nature and quality \u201d of his actions. The report of one psychiatrist, a copy of which is set forth in appellant\u2019s appendix, concluded with the opinion that \u201c defendant is not in such state of idiocy, imbecility or insanity as to be incapable of understanding the charge against him or the proceedings, or of making his defense.\u201d On July 26, 1954 defendant pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree and was sentenced to' a term of 35 years to life. At first confined at Clinton Prison, he was transferred to Dannemora State Hospital on August 5, 1954, where he was diagnosed on entry as a schizophrenic catatonic type, and was released back .to \u00a1Clinton Prison in 1962 as having recovered. A <em>coram nobis </em>application premised on his assigned counsel\u2019s alleged improper representation was denied, the determination being affirmed (13 A D 2d 556), and this court also affirmed a denial in another such proceeding in which defendant alleged that he was insane at the time of plea (14 A D 2d 473). Based on the lack of objection by the District Attorney, the court below in 1968 granted leave to defendant to file a notice of appeal from said conviction, with the limitation that defendant shall not raise on the appeal issues of mental status at the time of conviction, coercion or illegality of sentence and experience of counsel, which questions the court found had been previously passed upon and the dispositions approved by said appellate affirmances. A court cannot enlarge appellant\u2019s time to appeal (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 521; <em>People </em>v. <em>King, </em>273 N. Y. 646; <em>Matter of Pugach </em>v. <em>Tierney, </em>28 A D 2d 665; <em>People </em>v. <em>James, </em>23 A D 2d 859; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kling, </em>19 A D 2d 750, affd. 14 N Y 2d 571; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marchese, </em>19 A D 2d 728, affd. 14 N Y 2d 695). Furthermore, the order purportedly appealed from, being neither a judgment nor an order denying a motion to vacate a judgment of conviction, was not appealable under section 517 of the Code of 'Criminal Procedure. Appeal dismissed. Herlihy, P. J., Reynolds, Staley, Jr., Greenblott and Cooke, JJ., concur in memorandum by Cooke, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
