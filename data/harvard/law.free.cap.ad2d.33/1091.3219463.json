Appellant denied the paternity charge and the hearing was set for May 8, 1969. On May 7, 1969 appellant\u2019s attorney informed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>Assistant County Attorney to whom the matter had been assigned that because of other engagements it was his intention to request an adjournment when the matter was reached the following day. Appellant\u2019s attorney was detained the next morning in the City Court on a criminal case and did not contact the Family Court until one and a half hours after the opening of that court and was informed that a default had been entered against his client. On the following day a motion to vacate the default was denied and a support order was entered. The circumstances here presented require that appellant be given an opportunity to defend. It would have been better practice for appellant\u2019s attorney to have notified the court of his inability to be present when the matter was reached, but having given prior notice to respondent\u2019s attorney of his conflicting engagements and the need of an adjournment, and having acted within a matter of hours to correct the situation, the denial of the motion to open the default was an improvident exercise of discretion. The order of filiation should be reversed and the matter placed upon the Brie County Family Court Calendar for a hearing on the issue of paternity. (Appeal from order of Brie County Family Court, in paternity proceeding.) Present \u2014 Goldman, P. J., Del Vecchio, Gabrielli, Moule and Bastow, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
