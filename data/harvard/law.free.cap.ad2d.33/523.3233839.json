J.</author>\n<p id=\"As-0\">Appeal from an award of death benefits in a heart case, appellants contesting the finding of industrial accident. After 10 years\u2019 employment as a setup man in appellant employer\u2019s gear manufacturing plant in the United States, decedent was sent to Argentina to assist in the installation of gear grinding machines in the employer\u2019s Buenos Aires plant. The work involved, among other things, the leveling of machines, weighing between 1,000 pounds and 12 tons, by setting leveling screws with a wrench or hand crank. Decedent was obliged to work on his knees to adjust the screws, to rise to cheek the levels and in each instance to return to the screw should further adjustment be required. He also had to lift and move machine parts weighing between 3 and 20 pounds. Although this work, which w\u00e1s that to which decedent was primarily assigned, might seem sufficiently strenuous to support the board\u2019s findings \u201c that the work activities of the deceased were strenuous and arduous and beyond the ordinary wear and tear of life \u201d, the circumstance that deliveries of the gear grinding machines were behind schedule resulted in decedent\u2019s being assigned also to the substantially more arduous work of leveling engine or motor block machines, to which most of his time in Buenos Aires was devoted. These machines were larger than those he was accustomed to work on, weighing from 12 to 16 tons, and the task of leveling them required the use of heavy wrenches ranging in length from 12 to 36 inches, to which was sometimes added a length of pipe to obtain increased leverage. Decedent\u2019s wife testified that decedent told her that the work was much harder, more difficult, and that \u201che would be glad when he could get back to transmissions, the motor line was too strenuous.\u201d Claimant\u2019s cardiologist testified that the work on the last day of decedent\u2019s life, with the contributory effect of his prior \u201c continuous strenuous physical efforts \u201d, led to an acute coronary injury, presumably in the afternoon of that day, \u201cin the nature of a crack in an arteriosclerotic plaque and was the cause of an acute occlusion a few hours later\u201d and of his death at that time. Although initially denying causal relationship, appellants\u2019 medical expert conceded that the work factors involved \u201c may have \u201d accelerated the progress of decedent\u2019s underlying coronary artery disease. In the light of this record and of the board\u2019s findings thereon, appellants\u2019 argument respecting occupational disease is irrelevant, as is their discussion of emotional stress. Appellants seem, also, to misread the record in attributing to claimant\u2019s expert an opinion of causality predicated solely on the work effort exerted on the last day of decedent\u2019s life, and to overlook the witness\u2019 previously quoted reference to the contributory effect of decedent\u2019s continuous strenuous work effort prior to that day. The record presents no more than issues of fact which the board resolved upon substantial evidence and in accordance with well-recognized authority. (See, e.g., <em>Matter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>of Carrasquillo </em>v. <em>Santini Bros., </em>13 N Y 2d 245; <em>Matter of B\u00f3mbala </em>v. <em>Lark Mfg.

Decision affirmed, with costs to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. Gibson, P. J., Herlihy, Reynolds, Anlisi and Greenblott, JJ., concur in memorandum by Gibson, P.
