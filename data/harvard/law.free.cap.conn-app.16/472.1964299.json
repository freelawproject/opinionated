On September 29, 1984, at approximately 3 a.m., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the defendant was driving his motor vehicle in an easterly direction on Shaker Road in Enfield. The defendant crossed the center line and collided with a vehicle driven by Leslie Daniel, who was proceeding in the opposite direction. The victim was rendered unconscious for several days and suffered serious physical injuries as a result of the impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Officer Patrick Droney of the Enfield police department observed the defendant at the scene of the accident and testified that the defendant was swaying, that he was slurring his words, that he was emitting a moderate odor of alcohol, and that the defendant was unable to perform balance and coordination tests administered. Sergeant Raymond Bouchard, another officer at the scene, testified that there was a strong odor of alcohol emanating from the defendant and that the defendant had slurred speech and glassy eyes. Bouchard confirmed that the defendant was unable to pass the field tests administered by Droney. The defendant consented to an intoximeter test after admitting that he had \u201chad a few.\u201d The intoximeter test resulted in an alcohol blood level reading of .215 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">At trial, Abraham Stolman, chief state toxicologist, testified to the effects of alcohol upon a person\u2019s physical and mental capacities and, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the state law presumed that a person who registered an alcohol blood level reading of .10 or higher on the intoximeter was legally intoxicated. The trial court in its charge to the jury instructed that it could consider the prima facie provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (d) in determining whether the state had proven the element of intoxication beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could use the prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>evidentiary provisions of \u00a7 14-227a (d), particularly when the state had not complied with the procedural safeguards, in determining whether the state had established that the defendant caused the victim\u2019s serious physical injuries \u201cin consequence of his intoxication while operating a motor vehicle.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-60d. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We first consider the state\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s claim is unreviewable because he failed to raise it at trial with sufficient clarity to alert the trial court to his true position. \u201cThe failure of the defendant to state distinctly the matter being objected to immediately after the conclusion of the charge ordinarily renders the claim of error unreviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>198 Conn. 386, 396, 503 A.2d 576 (1986). The requirements of counsel in preserving his client\u2019s claim for appeal are abundantly clear and have been spelled out on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u201cThe defendant is required to raise a claim distinctly at trial. Practice Book \u00a7 4185 (formerly \u00a7 3063). Exceptions to a trial court\u2019s ruling must be distinct and specific to preserve the claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>197 Conn. 50, 53 n.2, 495 A.2d 1044 (1985), rev\u2019d, 479 U.S. 523, 107 S. Ct. 828, 93 L. Ed. 2d 920 (1987). \u2018The requirement that the claim be raised \u201cdistinctly\u201d means that it must be \u201cso stated as to bring to the attention of the court the <em>precise </em>matter on which its decision is being asked.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>75 Conn. 679, 682, 55 A. 167 (1903).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>198 Conn. 386, 396, 503 A.2d 576 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>11 Conn. App. 80, 101, 525 A.2d 1353 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">In this case, the defendant objected to the admissibility of the intoximeter results on the grounds that the results were inapplicable to this offense<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>state failed to follow the procedural guidelines.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defense counsel also objected to the testimony of Stolman regarding the prima facie evidence of a .10 blood alcohol level reading.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, counsel specifically requested a charge excluding any reference to \u201cunder the influence.\u201d During the trial, the trial court indicated that it intended to discuss \u201cunder the influence.\u201d The trial court informed counsel that: \u201cI think it is relevant in view of what my charge on intoxication would be, I do intend to use the word[s] operating under the influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ence.\u201d Finally, the record clearly indicates that counsel duly excepted to the trial court\u2019s failure to delete the phrase in its charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">This court has recently held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>12 Conn. App. 294, 302, 530 A.2d 653 (1987), that where the defendant objected to the incorporation, in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, of the provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (d) without the protective procedural requirements of \u00a7 14-227a (c), the defendant\u2019s claim of error was properly preserved for appeal. Likewise, in this case we can confidently state that the defendant\u2019s claim was made with sufficient clarity and that it was understood by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">We turn, therefore, to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim. We conclude that the provisions of \u00a7 14-227a (d) do not apply to a prosecution of assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle while intoxicated in violation of \u00a7 53a-60d (a), on the basis of the rationale as expressed by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>supra. The statutory language specifically referring to the violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a) and (b) must, therefore, be read to exclude its applicability to other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u201cOn the basis of our conclusion that the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a do not apply to a prosecution under General Statutes [(Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-60d (a)], we must decide whether the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury regarding the effect of the prima facie provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (d) on its determination of whether the defendant was intoxicated within the meaning of General Statutes [(Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 53a-60d (a)] requires reversal. \u2018The question of whether reversal is required because of this error depends on the likelihood that it influenced the jury. We have stated that in cases involving constitutional error, the test is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>169 Conn. 683, 687-88, 363 A.2d 1077 (1975).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. Shifflett, 199 Conn. 718, 754, 508 A.2d 748 (1986). Since our conclusion rests on statutory grounds, and is not of constitutional magnitude, it must be determined whether it was reasonably probable that the jury was misled.\u201d Id., 302-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">It is clear from the record that the jury was well aware of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level and the statutory presumption flowing from a blood alcohol level of .10 percent. Stolman testified that the result of the test of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level was .215 percent, and explained that the law presumed that all persons with a blood alcohol level of .10 percent or more are adversely affected. The jury was presented with the damaging expert testimony of Stolman, which was buttressed by the weight that the law itself lent to such evidence. The state, in its closing argument, reiterated Stolman\u2019s recitation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a by stating that \u201cat .10 you\u2019re presumed to be under the influence and you\u2019re unfit to operate a motor vehicle safely . . . well, we have a defendant that at 4:07 [a.m.] was .215.\u201d The state ended its discussion of intoxication by pointing out that \u201cunder the law you\u2019re presumed, prima facie, under the influence at .10 and it\u2019s been that way since 1971, .10. This defendant was well over two times that limit.\u201d The trial court added the weight of the statutory presumption to the jury\u2019s determination of whether the defendant was intoxicated, which reinforced the state\u2019s argument that the law itself deemed the defendant to have been intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In its charge, the trial court offered the following definition of intoxication: \u201cWhen it is apparent that a person is under the influence of liquor when his manner is unusual or abnormal or is reflected in his walk or conversation, when his ordinary willpower temporarily is suspended, when these or similar symptoms result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>from the use of liquor and are manifest a person may be found to be intoxicated.\u201d The court also informed the jury, however, that: \u201cThe operating under the influence statute makes certain provisions in the event there is evidence of the amount of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood. Now, our statute provides that evidence that the defendant\u2019s blood contained ten-hundredths of 1 percent or more of alcohol by weight is prima facie evidence that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor within the meaning of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We note that the critical issue at trial was whether the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the accident. In determining whether a jury instruction was misleading, it is appropriate to consider how it bears on the issue of the case. In this case, while the state\u2019s evidence was strong, as set out previously, the issue of the defendant\u2019s intoxication was nonetheless in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Ralph Adamczyk, an eyewitness to the accident, testified that he did not believe that the defendant was drunk, that he found nothing odd in the defendant\u2019s demeanor, and that he did not see the defendant fall or stumble. Additionally, Adamczyk did not smell alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath and did not consider the defendant\u2019s speech to be slurred. Moreover, Droney, who had testified on direct examination that the defendant was staggering, swaying, and unable to perform the balance and coordination tests, admitted on cross-examination that these observations were not recorded in his police report. Droney testified that the defendant was not belligerent or combative, and had no impairment of his mental facilities. Moreover, Bouchard, the shift supervisor, testified that while the defendant failed various field sobriety tests, the defendant fully understood the questions posed to him and gave appropriate answers. Bouchard additionally testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>defendant was not staggering, stumbling or swaying, and that there was no indication of a distorted sense of time and memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We reject the state\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s instruction was neither incorrect nor misleading because it referred the jury, not only to the statute, but to \u201call other evidence in the case\u201d in determining whether the defendant was intoxicated. The critical error in the court\u2019s charge was not that it permitted the jury to find the defendant guilty solely on the basis of the test results, but that it added to the effect of the other evidence the weight of the law\u2019s presumption as to the effect of a blood alcohol level of .10 percent or more. Under these circumstances, we conclude that it was reasonably probable that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instruction. 0</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">There is error, the judgment of conviction is set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-60d provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle while intoxicated when, in consequence of his intoxication while operating a motor vehicle, he causes serious physical injury to another person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (d) provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvidence admitted under the provisions of subsection (c) shall have the following force and effect: ...
