Our Supreme Court has decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>this question. The statute in effect when the grand jury was authorized governs. <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation by Judge John M. Alexander, </em>207 Conn. 98, 107, 540 A.2d 49 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In this case, an investigative grand jury was authorized on December 20, 1984. On October 1, 1985, General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 54-47 was repealed and replaced by Public Acts 1985, No. 85-611, codified as General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-47a through 54-47h. The grand jury\u2019s report was issued on April 24, 1987. The petitioner, the board of police commissioners of the borough of Naugatuck, sought disclosure of the report pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 54-47. The trial court ruled that the new statutory procedure governed and dismissed the petition for disclosure. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
