The sole issue presented is one of first impression: Whether the trial court erred in finding that the defendants\u2019 good faith requests for repairs did not successfully invoke the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-20 because the requested repairs were minor in nature. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. In October, 1976, the plaintiff purchased an apartment building located at 149 Barbour Street in Hartford. The defendants, Clifford Cody and Elsie Cody, were tenants in the building at that time. The plaintiff and the defendants entered into an oral agreement for a month-to-month tenancy by the defendants, to begin on November 1, 1986. Clifford Cody testified that he first asked the plaintiff to perform specific repairs on the apartment in October of 1986, when the plaintiff first assumed ownership, and requested additional repairs at various times thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">On April 14, 1987, the plaintiff caused a notice to quit, based on lapse of time, to be served on the defendants, advising them to quit possession of the premises on or before April 30, 1987. When the defendants did not vacate the apartment, the plaintiff, on May 12, 1987, initiated this summary process action. The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>answered on June 4, 1987, raising a special defense, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-20,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the summary process action was commenced within six months of the defendants\u2019 requests for repairs, and therefore, the action was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The evidence at trial, adduced through the testimony of both the plaintiff and Clifford Cody, was that the defendants had made several requests for work to be done in their apartment and that the plaintiff had responded to these requests. The plaintiff testified that, at the defendants\u2019 request, he bled the bathroom radiator, tightened the bedroom windows and replaced the sash cords, weatherstripped the front door to eliminate drafts, fixed some loose tiles on the bathroom floor and provided paint to the defendants so that they could repaint the kitchen. On the basis of this evidence, the trial court determined that the protection afforded by General Statutes \u00a7 47a-20 had not been \u201ctriggered,\u201d because the requested repairs did not \u201crelate to defects which materially affect health and safety.\u201d From this judgment, the defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The defendants claim that the trial court erred in requiring them to prove more than a good faith request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>for repairs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The interpretation of \u00a7 47a-20 propounded by the defendants is that <em>any </em>good faith request for a repair, no matter how minor, invokes the provisions of the protective statute, effectively insulating the tenant from eviction for the next six months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We cannot agree with such a broad reading of this particular provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Although we are cognizant of the principle that \u201c[c]ourts must interpret statutes as they are written; <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 730, 433 A.2d 1009 (1980)\u201d; <em>Lucarelli </em>v. <em>State, </em>16 Conn. App. 65, 70, 546 A.2d 940 (1988); we are also bound by our duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u201c \u2018avoid a consequence which fails to attain a rational and sensible result which bears most directly on the object which the legislature sought to obtain.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984), quoting <em>La Providenza </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 23, 29, 420 A.2d 905 (1979). We do not believe that a literal definition of the word \u201crepairs,\u201d as urged by the defendants, yields a \u201crational and sensible result\u201d when viewed in context with the other statutory provisions of our landlord and tenant law embodied in title 47a of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 47a-7 sets forth the responsibilities of a landlord to his tenants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As well as complying with all applicable building and housing codes of the state or any political subdivision thereof, a landlord is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>mandated to \u201cmake all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47a-7 (a) (2). The remedies available to a tenant in the event of the landlord\u2019s dereliction of these statutory duties are various: the tenant may withhold his rental payment, \u00a7 47a-4a;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the tenant may initiate an action to compel the landlord to perform his legal duties, \u00a7 47a-14h;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or the tenant may interpose the landlord\u2019s noncompliance as a defense in a summary process action, \u00a7\u00a7 47a-20 and 47a-33.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>With regard to the first two forms of relief, the tenant\u2019s ability to recover is not automatic once he has alleged a breach of the landlord\u2019s statutory duty. For example, before a tenant can initiate an action pursuant to \u00a7 47a-14h, he must allege that within the previous twenty-one days he lodged a complaint concerning the condition of the premises with a municipal agency. General Statutes \u00a7 47a-14h (b) (5); see generally <em>Dugan </em>v. <em>Milledge, </em>196 Conn. 591, 494 A.2d 1203 (1985). Similarly, for a tenant to make a successful claim that he had the right to withhold payment of rent, he must show that the landlord\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 47a-7 (a) \u201cmaterially affects his safety\u201d; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 67, 69, 457 A.2d 666 (1982); or has rendered the premises \u201cuninhabitable.\u201d <em>Steinegger </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 151, 156, 402 A.2d 1 (1979). Furthermore, to establish uninhabitability, the tenant needs to do more than assert a unilateral, self-serving statement that the premises are untenantable. <em>Evergreen Corporation </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 549, 552, 396 A.2d 146 (1978) (suggesting that a tenant \u201cutilize the broad range of municipal boards, agencies, and commissions\u201d to remedy defects).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In light of the fact that \u201cthe sanctions in these sections are not triggered until and unless evidence is adduced at trial establishing that there is a substantial violation or series of violations of housing and health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>codes creating a material risk or hazard to the occupant,\u201d P. Marzinotto, Connecticut Summary Process Manual, p. 118, citing <em>Evergreen Corporation </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra; <em>Arroyo </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Housing Session, Docket No. SPWA-00076 (December 9, 1982); the defendant\u2019s assertion that a good faith request for <em>any </em>repair invokes the application of \u00a7 47a-20 is overly simplistic.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">If we were to adopt the defendants\u2019 argument, we would have to acknowledge a greater duty to make repairs as set forth in \u00a7 47a-20 than that which is specified in \u00a7 47a-7 (a). The latter obliges a landlord to maintain his leased premises in a fit and habitable condition; the former, under the defendants\u2019 construction, would also oblige the landlord to make any cosmetic or aesthetic repairs, solely at the tenant\u2019s good faith behest. This is not to say that a tenant does not have the right to request aesthetic repairs; rather, the tenant cannot avoid eviction, using \u00a7 47a-20 as a shield, on the grounds that he requested such repairs in good faith. Any other result would effectively prevent a landlord from recovering possession of his property based on a possible defect in the leased premises which he had no statutory duty to repair, and would, therefore, be anomalous indeed. We must not look at the single word \u201crepairs\u201d in isolation, to the exclusion of the remainder of that provision or to the exclusion of interrelated legislation. \u201cWhat appears to be clear statutory language should not be read to arrive at an \u2018ambiguous or unreasonable result\u2019 or to \u2018defeat a legislative intent which becomes evident when the statute is read in the light of its history and purpose.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>[185 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Conn. 517, 522, 441 A.2d 158 (1981)]. Statutes should be considered as a whole, reconciling their separate parts so that a reasonable overall interpretation is achieved..Dukes v. <em>Durante, </em>[supra, 214]. Furthermore, the meaning of a particular phrase in a statute is to be determined by reference to the use of that phrase in other parts of the same statute. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 57, 392 A.2d 491 (1978); Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands) \u00a7 46.05. A meaning should not be ascribed to it which would render the meaning of those other uses difficult or bizarre; <em>State </em>v. <em>Campell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 563, 429 A.2d 960 (1980); <em>Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation </em>v. <em>DPUC, </em>1 Conn. App. 1, 4, 467 A.2d 679 (1983); and it must be construed with common sense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Privitera, </em>1 Conn. App. 709, 721, 476 A.2d 605 (1984).\u201d <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Della Ghelfa, </em>3 Conn. App. 432, 438, 489 A.2d 398 (1985), aff d, 200 Conn. 630, 513 A.2d 52 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In <em>Alteri </em>v. <em>Layton, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 261, 408 A.2d 18 (1979), the trial court, in a well reasoned opinion, rejected the defendant tenant\u2019s claim of retaliatory eviction, holding that the repair requested had to be one \u201crequired to conform a dwelling unit to basic structural, mechanical and housing code regulations . . . .\u201d Id., 267, citing <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Diamond Housing Corporation, </em>463 F.2d 853, 865 (D.C. Cir. 1972); see also <em>Friske </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain, Housing Session at New Britain, Docket No. SPN-7907-512-BE (September 11, 1979). The <em>Alteri </em>court reasoned that \u201c[t]o enforce properly the statute in a meaningful manner requires a balancing of the interests of both landlord and tenant .... To accept the literal interpretation propounded by the defendant could effectively negate the summary process proceedings of Connecticut statutes. The legislature could not have intended, in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>an indirect fashion, to emasculate substantially a landlord\u2019s statutory right to the possession of his property.\u201d <em>Alteri </em>v. <em>Layton, </em>supra, 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We agree with the focus of the <em>Alteri </em>court on the delicate balance of the rights of tenants and landlords. On one hand, we must weigh the statutory right given to the landlord to regain possession of his property; on the other hand, we weigh the right of the tenant to remain in possession after requesting that defects in the premises be remedied. Unlike the <em>Alteri </em>court, however, we do not believe the repair at issue must be of a substantial code violation. An adequate and fair balancing of the rights involved may be achieved by requiring the requested repair to be one \u201cnecessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47a-7 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We conclude that this interpretation of \u00a7 47a-20 will further the intent of the legislature without giving an unfair advantage to either tenants or landlords. If we were to construe \u201crepairs\u201d as meaning any repair, no matter how minor, we would encourage the inequitable scenario where month-to-month tenancies are unilaterally transformed into six month tenancies on the basis of a request, albeit in good faith, for the replacement of a light bulb or the tightening of a washer in a leaky faucet. What had then been intended as a shield for the benefit of tenants would be metamorphosed into a sword to deprive landlords of their property. Conversely, if we were to adopt the standard enunciated in <em>Alteri, </em>a tenant would be forced to always report a defect first to a municipal agency in order to prove that a substantial code violation exists. Not only would this rule discourage tenants from attempting to rectify defects by dealing directly with their landlord, under less volatile circumstances than an official complaint, but it would also meld two separate provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>of \u00a7 47a-20, creating a redundancy. See General Statutes \u00a7 47a-20 (1) and (3). We cannot assume that this was the intent of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In conclusion, we hold that the protection afforded by \u00a7 47a-20 (3) is not invoked unless the repair requested is one which is necessary to maintain the leased premises in a fit and habitable state. This conclusion both advances the policy considerations underlying the enactment of the retaliatory eviction statute, \u201ci.e., [the] protection of tenant attempts to secure safe, sanitary and decent housing\u201d; R. Schoshinski, American Law of Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 12.9, p. 738 n.3; and it enables us to construe the statutory scheme of our landlord and tenant laws as a consistent whole; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>TJlichny, </em>185 Conn. 145, 149, 440 A.2d 885 (1981); creating a \u201charmonious body of law.\u201d <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Tonken, </em>192 Conn. 581, 589, 473 A.2d 782 (1984). Whether or not the defect complained of goes to the tenantability of the property is a question of fact to be determined by the trier. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>190 Conn. 552, 461 A.2d 988 (1983); <em>Shipman </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 393, 449 A.2d 187 (1982). Under the facts of this case, we cannot say that the trial court erred in determining that the repairs requested by the defendants were not necessary to keep the premises in \u201ca fit and habitable condition.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47a-7 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 47a-20 (Formerly Sec. 19-375a). retaliatory action by landlord prohibited.

See <em>Alteri </em>v. <em>Layton, </em>35 Conn.
