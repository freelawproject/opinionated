The plaintiff alleged that a deed was <em>signed </em>\u201cunder undue influence,\u201d because of a \u201cconfidential relationship,\u201d because of \u201ccoaxing\u201d and as a consequence of \u201cfradulent misrepresentation.\u201d The court found that the deed was <em>never signed </em>and that the alleged grantor was <em>\u201ccompletely lacking in mental capacity\u201d </em>(emphasis added) to execute a deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The variance between the pleadings and the proof was material and no amended complaint conforming the allegations to the proof was filed. A party may not recover on a theory or cause of action not pleaded. See, e.g., <em>Reciprocal Exchange </em>v. <em>Altherm, Inc., </em>142 Conn. 545, 551, 115 A.2d 460 (1955); <em>Spitz </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>128 Conn. 121, 123, 20 A.2d 616 (1941); <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Erdmann, </em>122 Conn. 626, 632, 191 A. 521 (1937); <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Hollauer, </em>1 Conn.
