The defendants claim that the court erred (1) in finding that the plaintiff is entitled to recover interest in the amount of $6327.34, (2) in employing the contract price of $70,200 as a starting point for its computation of damages, (3) in not awarding the defendants a per diem penalty for the plaintiff\u2019s failure to complete the dwelling by the contract deadline, (4) in excluding evidence concerning the defendants\u2019 claim for loss of rental income arising from the plaintiff\u2019s failure to complete the subject dwelling on schedule, (5) in excluding the defendants\u2019 evidence concerning their claim for damages resulting from a defective roof and defective windows, and (6) in excluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the defendants\u2019 evidence concerning attorney\u2019s fees. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The defendants\u2019 first claim of error concerns the court\u2019s award of interest. It is rudimentary that an award of interest is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Crest Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. </em>v. <em>DiLoreto, </em>12 Conn. App. 468, 478, 531 A.2d 177 (1987). An examination of the record in the present case does not disclose an abuse of this discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The second and third claims of error relate to factual findings of the trial court. \u201cOur review of the trial court\u2019s factual findings is limited solely to the determination of whether they are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, they are clearly erroneous .... The function of an appellate court is to review, and not retry the proceedings of the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Petti </em>v. <em>Balance Rock Associates, </em>12 Conn. App. 353, 357, 530 A.2d 1083 (1987). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are adequately supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Claims of error four and five arise from a counterclaim filed by the defendants. The counterclaim did not, however, make a claim for loss of rental income (claim four), or for damage sustained as a result of a defective roof and windows (claim five). Accordingly, the court was correct in excluding evidence concerning those matters. A defendant on a counterclaim \u201cmust be restricted in his offer of proof to evidential facts within the range of the case which his [counterclaim] fairly discloses. The [counterclaim] must be definite enough to mark out these limitations with reasonable certainty.\u201d B. Holden &amp; J. Daly, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 68a, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The defendants seek relief from their failure to include these matters in their counterclaim on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ground that the plaintiff had annexed the original contract to its complaint and thus made it an exhibit in the case. See Practice Book \u00a7 141.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This rule of practice, however, does not excuse a party from pleading his case as clearly and precisely as possible. The rules of pleading \u201care designed to clarify and fix the issues and to confine the judicial inquiry necessary to decide the issues within reasonable and relevant limits.\u201d <em>Salem Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>149 Conn. 141, 144, 176 A.2d 571 (1961); see Practice Book \u00a7 108.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is clear that many contracts that are the subject of litigation are lengthy and complex documents. Precision in issue framing, the goal of effective pleading, however, would be rent asunder if this court held that any and all parts of an annexed contract could be attacked merely by general reference, despite the failure of the pleadings to refer to the particular contract provision in question. Such a theory would allow a party to circumvent the winnowing process inherent in the ordinary pleadings system, which normally enables the parties to contest the sufficiency of the complaint and revise its content, before being required to respond thereto. We decline to expose litigants and trial courts to such an open arena of judicial confusion. The trial court properly excluded the evidence addressed in the defendants\u2019 third and fifth claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The defendants\u2019 final claim of error pertains to their claim for counsel fees. The record indicates that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>claim for attorney\u2019s fees was contained in the counterclaim. In fact, the counterclaim made no claim for relief whatsoever,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as it failed to contain an ad damnum clause. Moreover, the defendants failed to pursue their claim for attorney\u2019s fees at trial by means of an offer of proof, an attempt to introduce evidence through another attorney, or any other means. The trial court succinctly stated that \u201c[t]he question of attorney\u2019s fees [was] not \u2018denied\u2019 by the undersigned; [it was] just not considered for the reason that no claim or proof [of] attorney\u2019s fees [was] presented at the trial before me.\u201d We conclude the trial court\u2019s ruling concerning attorney\u2019s fees was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\"> The Smiths are referred to as the defendants in this opinion because other defendants named in the writ are not involved in the issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 141 provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhere the plaintiff desires to make a copy of any document a part of his complaint, he may, without reciting it or annexing it, refer to it as Exhibit A, B, C, and etc., as fully as if he had set it out at length; but in such case he shall serve a copy of such exhibit or exhibits on each other party to the action forthwith upon receipt of notice of the appearance of such party and file the original or a copy of such exhibit or exhibits in court with proof of service on each appearing party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 108 provides in pertinent part: \u201cEach pleading shall contain a <em>plain and concise statement </em>of the material facts on which the pleader relies . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b93-17\"> The lack of an ad damnum clause in the counterclaim furnishes an additional ground for finding no error on claims four and five.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
