From two summary judgments rendered in favor of the defendant physician, Joseph Welna,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff has appealed. The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred (1) in granting the motion in limine precluding an expert witness, and (2) in granting the summary judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The action against the defendants was commenced by complaint dated August 12, 1985. The defendant filed interrogatories dated November 1, 1985, which included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>interrogatory number 23,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a request for disclosure and production of the names and addresses of all experts expected to testify. The plaintiff, who was granted until March 3, 1986, to respond, neither responded nor filed an objection to interrogatory number 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">On July 8, 1986, the defendant filed a motion in limine barring the plaintiff from presenting any expert testimony, or, alternatively, seeking an order compelling the plaintiff to answer the interrogatory. Although the plaintiff later stated that he thought he had supplied the name of the expert, he failed to conform to the rest of the interrogatory, namely, to supply the proposed subject matter, the factual basis of the opinion, and the substance of facts and opinions. On September 8, 1986, the trial court ruled that unless the plaintiff complied within ten days, the motion in limine would be granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The matter was marked over to September 29, 1986, and was subsequently granted on that date because the plaintiff failed to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On February 19, 1987, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis that the plaintiff lacked expert testimony as to the standard of care and the proximate cause of the death of the decedent, and the plaintiff appealed. Thereafter, that motion was vacated in part and, on June 18, 1987, granted, as amended, on the same ground as the Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>ary 19 decision. From the judgment rendered on that motion, the plaintiff filed a second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 220 (a) (1)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides that a party may submit an interrogatory to discover certain limited information about an opponent\u2019s expert witness. Under Practice Book \u00a7 224, any such interrogatories must be answered within thirty days after the filing unless the court allows for a longer time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This court has recently restated the law of a party\u2019s responsibility to answer an opponent\u2019s interrogatory. \u201c \u2018The discovery rules are designed to facilitate trial proceedings and to make a \u201ctrial less a game of blindman\u2019s buff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practical extent.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Proctor &amp; Gamble, </em>356 U.S. 677, 682, 78 S. Ct. 983, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1077 (1958). \u201cThe court\u2019s decision on whether to impose the sanction of excluding the expert\u2019s testimony concerning causation rests within the sound discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Sturdivant </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>[2 Conn. App. 103, 107, 476 A.2d 1074 (1984)]. Unless the trial court has abused a legal discretion, its action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>should not be disturbed; in making this analysis, we must afford the decision of the trial court great weight and allow every reasonable presumption to be made in favor of its correctness. <em>Timm </em>v. <em>Timm, </em>195 Conn. 202, 206, 487 A.2d 191 (1985); <em>Dudas </em>v. <em>Ward Baking Co., </em>104 Conn. 516, 518, 133 A. 591 (1926). \u201cIn determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d <em>Timm </em>v. <em>Timm, </em>supra, 207; <em>E.M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>146 Conn. 608, 611, 153 A.2d 463 (1959); <em>Sturdivant </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>supra, 108. \u201cThe court\u2019s conclusion that the consequences of the plaintiff\u2019s failure fully and fairly to disclose, despite being given ample opportunity to do so . . . should fall upon the plaintiff rather than upon the defendants, was not an abuse of discretion.\u201d \u2019 <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>7 Conn. App. 514, 519, 509 A.2d 552 (1986).\u201d <em>Caccavale </em>v. <em>Hospital of St. Raphael, </em>14 Conn. App. 504, 507-508, 541 A.2d 893 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in ruling that the plaintiff failed to answer interrogatory number 23, and, therefore, correctly precluded the plaintiff from bringing forward an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s second claim of error is that the trial court erred by granting the defendant\u2019s motions for summary judgment. The standard of review for a case involving a summary judgment is abundantly clear from the rich case law in this area. Recently, in <em>DiMaggio </em>v. <em>Makover, </em>13 Conn. App. 321, 536 A.2d 595 (1988), this court restated the standard of review that was articulated in <em>Desnoyers </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>4 Conn. App. 666, 667-68, 496 A.2d 237 (1985). \u201c \u2018 \u201cA trial court may appropriately render summary judgment when the documents submitted demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining between the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ties and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Practice Book \u00a7 384; <em>Yanow </em>v. <em>Teal Industries, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 262, 268, 422 A.2d 311 (1979); <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>158 Conn. 364, 377-78, 260 A.2d 596 (1969).\u201d . . . Once the moving party has presented evidence in support of the motion for summary judgment, the opposing party must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue.\u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>192 Conn. 451, 455, 472 A.2d 1257 (1984). \u2018 \u201cWhen a motion for summary judgment is supported by affidavits and other documents, an adverse party, by affidavit or as otherwise provided by [Practice Book] \u00a7 380, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial, and if he does not so respond, the court is entitled to rely upon the facts stated in the affidavit of the movant.\u201d \u2019 <em>Kakadelis </em>v. <em>DeFabritis, </em>191 Conn. 276, 280-81, 464 A.2d 57 (1983).\u201d <em>Desnoyers </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>supra; <em>DiMaggio </em>v. <em>Makover, </em>supra, 323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In this action alleging malpractice, the plaintiff did not produce an expert witness. It is well settled in Connecticut case law that a plaintiff \u201ccannot prevail unless there was evidence of an expert nature from which the jury could reasonably conclude that the defendant was negligent, except where there is manifest such gross want of care or skill as to afford, of itself an almost conclusive inference of negligence that the testimony of an expert is not necessary.\u201d <em>Puro </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>188 Conn. 301, 305, 449 A.2d 176 (1982); see also <em>Console </em>v. <em>Nickow, </em>156 Conn. 268, 270 A.2d 895 (1968); <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Mt. Sinai Hospital, </em>supra, 520. Where no expert evidence was presented, the trial court was correct in granting the defendant\u2019s motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\"> The named plaintiff, Kathleen Guzze, subsequently died and the plaintiff, William Guzze, her husband, who had originally sued for loss of consortium, was named executor of his wife\u2019s estate.
