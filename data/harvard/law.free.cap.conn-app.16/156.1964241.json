J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak1\">The defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction, rendered upon his conditional plea of nolo contendere,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of operating a motor vehicle while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the results of breath tests administered at the time of his arrest. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Certain facts are pertinent. On December 31, 1986, Officer Adam Stuart of the Old Saybrook police department stopped the defendant after observing him operating his vehicle in an erratic manner. Stuart observed that the defendant showed signs of intoxication and administered a roadside sobriety test. The roadside sobriety test confirmed Stuart\u2019s suspicions of intoxication, and the defendant was placed under arrest at approximately 11 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The defendant was then transported, handcuffed and in the rear of the police cruiser, to the Old Saybrook police headquarters. Upon arrival, the defendant was brought by Stuart into a room where a breathtesting device, known as an intoximeter, was located. An intoximeter tests the level of a subject\u2019s blood alcohol content by breath analysis. At this time, Stuart checked the calibration of the intoximeter for accuracy and found it to be outside acceptable limits. As a result of the malfunction, Stuart did not use that intoximeter to measure the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The defendant was then placed in the rear of a police cruiser and transported to the state police barracks in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Westbrook. Stuart tested the intoximeter located there and found its accuracy to be within an acceptable range. The first intoximeter test was administered to the defendant at 11:25 p.m., and showed the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content to be above the allowable limit set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Following this first intoximeter test, Stuart processed the necessary paperwork, during which time the defendant remained in the presence of the officer. At 11:57 p.m., a second intoximeter test was performed on the defendant. That test also showed the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level to be above the allowable limit. After administering the second breath test, Stuart, once again, tested the intoximeter for accuracy, and concluded that the intoximeter readings were accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because (1) the accuracy tests performed by Stuart did not comply with either the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (4) or \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a-8 (d) and 14-227a-10 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies applicable to the department of health services, and (2) because he was not under continuous observation for the fifteen minute period prior to the administration of each intoximeter test as required by \u00a7 14-227a-10 (b) (1) (A) of those regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The issue to be resolved is whether the results of the tests were obtained in compliance with the governing statutory and regulatory requirements for insuring that such tests are accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) sets forth six elements which must be satisfied for the admissibility of the results of chemical analysis tests of a defendant\u2019s blood, breath or urine in a criminal prosecution for violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a) or (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s challenge relates to the fourth element, which provides that chemical analysis results are inadmissible unless the testing device was tested for accuracy \u201cat the beginning of each workday and no later than the end of each workday by a person certified by the department of health ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>vices.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (4). The requirements of testing set forth in the department of health services regulations \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a-8 (d) and 14-227a-10 are essentially identical to the mandates set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (4), in that they both require that the alcohol testing device be checked for accuracy by a certified operator at the beginning and no later than the end of the workday or shift.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">It is uncontested that Stuart was certified as an operator of the intoximeter at the time of the defendant\u2019s breath tests. The defendant argues that, given the penal nature of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a, the requirement that accuracy tests be performed at the beginning and before the end of the workday or shift must be strictly and literally construed. The defendant contends that because the accuracy tests were performed immediately before and after the breath analysis tests, a manner not expressly authorized by statute, the breath analysis results should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The state concedes that the intoximeter used to take the defendant\u2019s breath sample was not checked for accuracy at the beginning of the workday or shift. In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court found, however, that the procedure used by Stuart, namely, checking the intoximeter for accuracy immediately before and after the defendant\u2019s breath tests, achieved greater accuracy than that required by the statute and regulations and, thus, was in total compliance with them. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>In interpreting the meaning and requirements of a statute or regulation, we rely on the traditional rules of statutory construction. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>194 Conn. 312, 320, 481 A.2d 31 (1984). It is a fundamental principle of construction that a statute such as \u00a7 14-227a, which imposes criminal liability, is to be strictly construed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 151, 460 A.2d 26 (1983). The rule of strict construction, however, does not require that the most narrow, technical and exact meaning be given to the language of a statute in frustration of an obvious legislative intent. Id. The application of common sense to the language of a penal statute should not be excluded so as to result in absurdity or frustration of the evident design of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>7 Conn. App. 326, 334, 509 A.2d 518, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 807, 512 A.2d 231 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">It is evident from the language of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a that the purpose of testing the intoximeter for accuracy is to ensure that the device reliably reflects the actual blood alcohol level of the subject tested. This purpose is implemented by \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a-8 (d) and 14-227a-10 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">An accuracy test performed at the beginning of the workday or shift, hours before a subject test is performed, raises the possibility that the intoximeter has malfunctioned during the period between the accuracy test and the subject test. It is evident that the closer the temporal proximity between the subject test and the accuracy check, the greater the reliability of the subject test. See 2 R. Erwin, Defense of Drunk Driving Cases (3d Ed.) \u00a7 22.04 (3) (h), p. 22-35 (verification of instrument accuracy should be performed for each set of subject tests); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>200 Conn. 615, 623-24, 513 A.2d 638 (1986) (where intoximeter is checked for accuracy immediately before adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>tering test to a subject, evidence of the test results is admissible under General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (6), which mandates that such evidence demonstrate \u201cthat the test results . . . accurately reflect the blood alcohol content at the time of the alleged offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (4) and the accompanying regulations provide a minimum standard of accuracy testing in order to admit the test results of a device into evidence against a defendant in a criminal prosecution. The accuracy requirement provides a safeguard against inaccurate or unreliable results being used against a defendant. It would be anomalous to hold the intoximeter results in this case inadmissible because the device was tested for accuracy closer in time to the defendant\u2019s actual breath test than is required by the statute or regulations. Testing the intoximeter immediately before and after the defendant\u2019s breath tests is a more rigorous accuracy procedure than is required by law and therefore constitutes compliance with the statute and regulations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The defendant also claims that the breath analysis results should have been suppressed because he was not under \u201ccontinuous observation\u201d for at least fifteen minutes prior to each of the breath analysis tests, as required by the department of health services regulations; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 14-227a-10 (b) (1) (A). That regulation provides that \u201cthe breath sample shall be collected only after the subject has been under continuous observation for at least fifteen minutes prior to the collection of each sample. During this observation period, the subject must not have ingested any alcoholic beverages or food, regurgitated or smoked.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The defendant was arrested at approximately 11 p.m. The first breath test was performed at 11:25 p.m., and the second test was performed at 11:57 p.m. The defendant does not contest the fact that at least fifteen minutes had elapsed prior to each test. The defendant argues, rather, that during those periods he was not \u201cunder continuous observation\u201d as required by the regulation. Specifically, the defendant contends that during the observation period, when Stuart was operating the police cruiser, preparing the intoximeter for use, and processing the paperwork, the defendant could not have been \u201cunder continuous observation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The language of \u00a7 14-227a-10 (b) (1) (A) of the regulations, which requires \u201ccontinuous observation,\u201d must be interpreted with reference to the purpose of the regulation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>supra, 151. The regulation, read in its entirety, indicates that the purpose is to determine whether the subject to be tested has ingested food, beverages, regurgitated or smoked. These activities adversely affect the accuracy of alcohol breath analysis. See 2 R. Erwin, supra, \u00a7 22.05 (4) (a), p. 22-42.18 (64). They are activities which do not require observation without cessation in order to determine if they have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">During the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, Stuart testified that at all times prior to the administration of the breath analysis, the defendant was in his presence. Stuart further testified that he was able to determine that the defendant had not engaged in any of the behaviors prohibited by the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In light of the regulation\u2019s purpose, we do not interpret \u00a7 14-227a-10 (b) (1) (A) to require that an officer fix his unswerving gaze upon a subject during each fifteen minute interval prior to administration of a breath test. Such an interpretation would not only be practically impossible to perform but would allow a subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>to thwart compliance with the regulation simply by turning his head away from the observing officer. Where, as here, evidence shows that a defendant was in an officer\u2019s presence for at least a period of fifteen minutes and that the defendant did not ingest food or beverages, regurgitate or smoke, the requirement of \u201ccontinuous observation\u201d -under \u00a7 14-227a-10 (b) (1) (A) has been complied with. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of the breath analysis tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\"> The defendant appeals pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (b). Section 4003, which became effective October 1, 1986, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAPPEALS OF RULINGS ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS OR SUPPRESS FOLLOWING JUDGMENTS ENTERED UPON CONDITIONAL PLEAS OF NOLO CONTENDERE . . . . (b) With the approval of the court, after a hearing to consider any objections thereto, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right, on appeal from the judgment, to review of the adverse determination of any motion made prior to the close of evidence, which motion must be specified in such written reservation. If the defendant prevails on appeal, the judgment shall be set aside and the defendant shall be allowed to withdraw the conditional plea of nolo contendere after the case has been remanded to the trial court. The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere pursuant to this subsection where the adverse determination of the specified motion would not have a significant impact on the disposition of the case in the trial court. The court shall also decline to accept such a nolo contendere or guilty plea where the record available for review of the ruling upon the specified motion is inadequate for appellate review of the court\u2019s determination thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a allows a defendant to enter a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search and seizure or from the denial of a motion to dismiss. That section provides: \u201cWhen a defendant, prior to the commencement of trial, enters a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search or seizure or motion to dismiss, the defendant after the imposition of sentence may file an appeal within the time prescribed by law. The issue to be considered in such an appeal shall be limited to whether it was proper for the court to have denied the motion to suppress or the motion to dismiss. A plea of nolo contendere by a defendant under this section shall not constitute a waiver by the defendant of nonjurisdictional defects in the criminal prosecution.\u201d See also Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">In this case, the ground for the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, namely, that the results of the breath alcohol tests were obtained without compliance with all applicable state statutory and regulatory requirements, \u201cis not included within the statutory language [of General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a] allowing appeals from an illegal search or seizure in violation of the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>amendment. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>[198 Conn. 92, 99, 503 A.2d 136 (1985)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 43, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987).
