We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">This case involves the following facts. On December 20, 1985, Trooper Donald M. Barbour stopped an automobile driven by the defendant for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. Barbour administered field sobriety tests to the defendant, which the defendant failed. Barbour placed the defendant under arrest at about 12:40 a.m. The defendant was then placed in the passenger side of a police vehicle and transported to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">At the police barracks, Barbour tested the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level with a breathalyzer device <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>known as an intoximeter. The first test was administered at 1:15 a.m., yielding a blood alcohol ratio of .199. A second test was given to the defendant at 1:53 a.m., yielding a blood alcohol ratio of .184. Both of these ratios indicated blood alcohol levels above the legal limit set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Barbour checked the intoximeter\u2019s accuracy before and after each test. These checks indicated that the calibrations were accurate and that the intoximeter was functioning properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Barbour placed the printouts of the checks on the intoximeter\u2019s accuracy together with the measurements of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level in a log book kept in the police barracks, and mailed copies of the same to the defendant. On April 19, 1986, the log book was discovered to be missing. It had not been located by the time of the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of the breath alcohol tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In his first claim of error, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the results of the breathalyzer tests (1) because the instrument was not checked for accuracy at the beginning of each day of use in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (4),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or at the beginning of each shift <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>in accordance with the department of health services regulations; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a-8 (d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 14-227a-10;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (2) because the defendant was not <em>under </em>\u201ccontinuous observation\u201d for at least fifteen minutes prior to the collection of the breath samples in accordance with the department of health services regulations. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 14-227a-10 (b) (1) (A).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These issues of statutory and regulatory interpretation have been fully addressed in the companion case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>16 Conn. App. 156, 547 A.2d 69 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 163, we held that a check of the intoximeter\u2019s accuracy prior to the subject test, as opposed to the beginning of each day of use or shift, complies with the requirements for admissibility set forth in the statute and regulations. Further, the trial court found that \u201cas far as humanly possible the trooper kept the defendant under continuous observation for the requisite period.\u201d That finding is supported by the record, and is all that is required under the regulations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra. The trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the loss of the log book, which contained a copy of his test results and accuracy determinations of the intoximeter, violated his constitutional right to due process under the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The state acknowledges the loss of the log book. The maintenance of a log book is required by the department of health services regulations. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 14-227a-10 (b) (2) (B).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant does not argue that the violation of the regulation constituted sufficient support for his motion to suppress the results of the breath alcohol tests. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>14 Conn. App. 108, 552 A.2d 815 (1988). The defendant argues, rather, that the alleged violation of his constitutional rights constituted sufficient support for his motion to suppress. We note in the first instance that a prosecutor has a constitutional duty to disclose exculpatory evidence which is known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). It is apparent that this case does not involve the unintentional loss or nondisclosure of <em>Brady </em>material but, at most, involves the loss or nondisclosure of potentially exculpatory material. This is also so because the defendant had received copies of the printouts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the checks on the intoximeter\u2019s accuracy and a copy of the measurements of his blood alcohol level by mail, which were items recorded in the log book.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The seminal case regarding a state\u2019s constitutional duty to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence is <em>California </em>v. <em>Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 104 S. Ct. 2528, 81 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1984) (state\u2019s failure to preserve a defendant\u2019s breath alcohol sample does not violate the federal constitution).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Trombetta </em>held that the failure to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence does not result in a violation of the constitution unless such failure deprives a defendant of <em>\u201ca </em>meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u201d Id., 485. <em>Trombetta </em>delineated two inquiries for discerning whether a defendant has had <em>\u201ca </em>meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u201d The first inquiry is whether the authorities were \u201cacting \u2018in good faith and in accord with their normal practices.\u2019 \u201d Id., 488, quoting <em>Killian </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U.S. 231, 242, 82 S. Ct. 302, 7 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1961). The second inquiry is whether the evidence was material in that it (a) \u201cpossess[es] an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed [and (b) is of] such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Trombetta, </em>supra, 489; see also <em>Chaussard </em>v. <em>Fulcomer, </em>816 F.2d 925, 931-32 (3d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 845, 108 S. Ct. 139, 98 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1987) (loss of a tape recording did not constitute material evidence and therefore its absence did not result in a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">As to the good faith element of the <em>Trombetta </em>standard, the trial court found no evidence showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the log book was purposely lost, or destroyed intentionally. \u201cThe record contains no allegation of official animus towards [the defendant and indicates] no conscious effort to suppress exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Trombetta, </em>supra, 488. Accordingly, the first <em>Trombetta </em>inquiry is satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">As to the materiality elements of the <em>Trombetta </em>standard, we conclude that the second inquiry is also satisfied in this case. First, the defendant cannot demonstrate that the log book\u2019s exculpatory value was \u201capparent before the evidence was destroyed.\u201d Id., 489. The defendant speculates that had the missing log book showed that the machine used to sample the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level previously malfunctioned and was not subsequently calibrated, an accuracy reading prior to the taking of the defendant\u2019s breath sample may have been \u201ctainted.\u201d We find such speculation to be unsupported by the record. The evidence indicates that the machine used to test the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level was in fact tested for accuracy and calibrated by Barbour immediately prior to and following each breath test. The log book\u2019s exculpatory value was therefore not \u201capparent\u201d to the authorities when it was lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Second, the evidence is not \u201cof such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u201d Id. The defendant had comparable evidence available, in addition to the log book, by which to impeach the accuracy capabilities of the intoximeter used to sample his blood alcohol level. General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (2) requires that \u201ca true copy of the report of the test result [be] mailed to or personally delivered to the defendant within twenty-four hours or by the end of the next regular business day\u201d in order for the test results to be admitted into evidence. The record indicates that the defendant received a copy of the test results that contained the two determinations of the defendant\u2019s blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>alcohol content, and numerical indications that the machine had been checked for accuracy. This copy was admitted into evidence at the suppression hearing. Because the record indicates that the log book contained an identical copy of the foregoing information, the fact that it was missing did not deprive the defendant of comparable evidence. Furthermore, the copy contained in the missing log book, identical to that received by the defendant, was inculpatory in that it demonstrated that the instrument was calibrated, accurate at the time the defendant was tested, and that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level was above the legal limit. The regulations require no more information to be recorded in the missing log book; see footnote 9, supra; than that shown by the copy of the test results admitted into evidence at the suppression hearing. The defendant was not foreclosed from calling upon expert testimony to impeach the intoximeter results. The defendant could have obtained \u201ccomparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Trombetta, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The defendant claims, however, that he was deprived of an opportunity to obtain additional, comparable evidence because the trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection to the production of certain items enumerated in his subpoena duces tecum. The items requested were copies of the manufacturer\u2019s operational instructions for the intoximeter, copies of all recertifications from October 8, 1985, through March 4, 1986, on the machine which was used to sample the defendant\u2019s breath and copies of all repair or recalibration orders for the intoximeter.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">This claim is subsumed under Trombetta\u2019s materiality inquiry. The defendant requested a copy of the manufacturer\u2019s operational instructions for the intoximeter. This evidence does not have any apparent exculpatory value with respect to impeaching the accuracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>of the machine, and is reasonably available elsewhere. The defendant also requested evidence of the recertification and repair or recalibration orders for the machine used to sample the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level. Although this evidence may have shown that the machine had malfunctioned in the past, the undisputed evidence admitted at the suppression hearing demonstrated that the machine was accurate on the day that the defendant\u2019s breath samples were taken. Even if there had been evidence that the machine malfunctioned previously, that evidence does not have apparent exculpatory value with respect to impeaching the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol tests. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s subpoena duces tecum.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss by failing to find a violation of the court\u2019s sequestration order which allegedly deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to due process and statutory rights under General Statutes \u00a7 54-85a.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">This issue involves the following facts. The hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was conducted on two different days. On the first day, after Trooper Barbour had testified, the trial court ordered him not to discuss his testimony with Trooper Steven Fields, who was scheduled to appear as a witness at the later date. Prior to the commencement of the continued hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the defendant\u2019s attorney had observed Barbour and Fields talking with the prosecutor. The defendant subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>moved to dismiss the charges against him on the ground that the trial court\u2019s sequestration order had been violated. The prosecutor denied that Barbour\u2019s prior testimony had been discussed. The prosecutor represented that he had told Fields to expect to be called as a rebuttal witness and informed the troopers that the hearing would likely conclude on that day. The defendant acknowledged that he did not know what the prosecutor and the troopers discussed. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and Fields was allowed to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Sequestration orders may be implemented by statute; General Statutes \u00a7 54-85a; or by an order of the court which may impose a broader prohibition than that provided by the sequestration statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 322, 331, 363 A.2d 72 (1975). The \u201cprimary concern [is] the \u2018fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 27, 444 A.2d 213 (1982), quoting <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Philips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982). The defendant urges this court to adopt a rule holding that a conference among a state\u2019s attorney and witnesses subject to a sequestration order constitutes a per se violation of that order. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The \u201cobvious purpose of sequestering a witness . . . is to prevent the one sequestered from shaping his testimony to corroborate falsely the testimony of the other.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 200, 187 A.2d 442 (1962). A per se rule would prevent inquiry into whether the underlying purpose of the sequestration order had been served. That purpose primarily ensures that the defendant will receive a fair trial. An inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each case is necessary to ascertain whether the purpose of a sequestration order has been thwarted.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>We deem it necessary, therefore, to examine the testimony of Fields, which took place after the alleged violation of the sequestration order, for evidence of possible complicity. There is no indication that Fields fabricated his testimony to comport with that of Barbour. Fields\u2019 testimony concerned his signature on the defendant\u2019s consent form, the validity of which is not at issue in this case. In addition, the substance of Fields\u2019 testimony indicated that he did not recall much about what took place that evening, whereas Barbour\u2019s testimony focused on the events surrounding the defendant\u2019s arrest in great detail. Any consistency in the testimony of the troopers is wholly explainable by reference to other factors such as standard police operating procedures. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Sullivan, 11 Conn. App. 80, 85, 525 A.2d 1353 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Moreover, the defendant had the opportunity to question Fields to expose any potential taint resulting from the conference between the state\u2019s attorney and the troopers since Fields took the stand after the alleged violation of the sequestration order. \u201cThe failure of trial counsel to attempt ... to show any harm that may have flowed from the violation of the sequestration order is strong evidence that he did not deem it to be prejudicial.\u201d Id., 86. We conclude, accordingly, that any violation of the court\u2019s sequestration order did not deprive the defendant of his constitutional or statutory rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\"> The defendant appeals pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (b). Section 4003, which became effective October 1, 1986, provides: \u201cAPPEALS OF rulings ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS OR SUPPRESS FOLLOWING JUDGMENTS ENTERED UPON CONDITIONAL PLEAS OF NOLO CONTENDERE .... (b) With the approval of the court, after a hearing to consider any objections thereto, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right, on appeal from the judgment, to review of the adverse determination of any motion made prior to the close of evidence, which motion must be specified in such written reservation. If the defendant prevails on appeal, the judgment shall be set aside and the defendant shall be allowed to withdraw the conditional plea of nolo contendere after the case has been remanded to the trial court. The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere pursuant to this subsection where the adverse determination of the specified motion would not have a significant impact on the disposition of the case in the trial court. The court shall also decline to accept such a nolo contendere or guilty plea where the record available for review of the ruling upon the specified motion is inadequate for appellate review of the court\u2019s determination thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a allows a defendant to enter a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search and seizure or from the denial of a motion to dismiss. That section provides: \u201cWhen a defendant, prior to the commencement of trial, enters a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search or seizure or motion to dismiss, the defendant after the imposition of sentence may file an appeal within the time prescribed by law. The issue to be considered in such an appeal shall be limited to whether it was proper for the court to have denied the motion to suppress or the motion to dismiss. A plea of nolo contendere by a defendant under this section shall not constitute a waiver by the defendant of nonjurisdictional defects in the criminal prosecution.\u201d See also Practice Book \u00a7 4003 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">In this case, the grounds for the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, namely, that the results of the breath alcohol tests were obtained without compliance with all applicable state statutory and regulatory requirements, and that the loss of the log book violated his federal constitutional right to due process of law under the fourteenth amendment, are \u201cnot included within the statutory language [of General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a] allowing appeals from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>... an illegal search or seizure in violation of the fourth amendment.
