We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The following facts are pertinent to this appeal. In 1977, the defendant planning and zoning commission approved an application for subdivision submitted by Marianne E. Ward, the owner of the property at that time. The approval resulted in the subdivision of a 94 acre parcel of land into three parcels: parcel A was set out as 46.4 acres; parcel B was 36.2 acres; and parcel C was 2 acres.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At this time, Ward included a notation on the subdivision map that \u201cparcel B shall not be resubdivided into more than 2 parcels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">In 1979, Ward applied to the defendant for a resubdivision of parcel B into three lots: two lots of 14 acres <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>each and an additional lot of 8.2 acres which was to be added to the previously created parcel A. When the defendant approved this application, it required that the subdivision map bear a notation that \u201cLots 1 and 2 shall not be resubdivided at any future time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Ward subsequently conveyed the two 14 acre lots to the plaintiff. In March, 1985, the plaintiff applied to the defendant to resubdivide the 28 acres into six residential building lots.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a public hearing was held, the defendant denied the application. The defendant\u2019s stated reasons for its denial of the plaintiffs application was the existence of the restrictive notation on the 1979 subdivision map, and its determination that there had not been a \u201csufficient change in circumstances\u201d to warrant removal of the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, contending that the map restriction was unenforceable and that the defendant had acted illegally, arbitrarily and in abuse of its discretion. The defendant countered with the argument that the imposition of the restrictive notation was no more than a \u201cconditional approval\u201d of the 1979 resubdivision application, that such conditional approvals have been found to be permissible under recent state case law, and that any challenge to the validity of the imposition of the condition should have been made in 1979. The trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, finding that the defendant\u2019s actions were beyond the power granted to it by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-25 and 8-26,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and ordered that the case be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>remanded to the defendant for approval of the application if the plaintiff has met all of the relevant zoning and subdivision regulations. From this judgment, the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant did not have the authority in 1979 to impose a condition restricting future subdivisions and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>fore, that condition was void ab initio and could not provide sufficient grounds for the denial of the plaintiffs application.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">It is axiomatic that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[a]s a creature of the state, the . . . [town . . . whether acting itself or through its planning commission,] can exercise only such powers as are expressly granted to it, or such powers as are necessary to enable it to discharge the duties and carry into effect the objects and purposes of its creation.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>152 Conn. 312, 314, 206 A.2d 428 [1965], and cases cited therein; <em>Bredice </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>152 Conn. 287, 292, 206 A.2d 433 [1964]; <em>State ex rel. Sloane </em>v. <em>Reidy, </em>152 Conn. 419, 423, 209 A.2d 674 [1965]. In other words, in order to determine whether the [condition] in question was within the authority of the commission to [impose], we do not search for a statutory prohibition against such an [action]; rather, we must search for statutory authority for the [action].\u2019 <em>Avonside, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning &amp; Planning Commission, </em>153 Conn. 232, 236, 215 A.2d 409 (1965); <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>203 Conn. 14, 19, 523 A.2d 467 (1987).\u201d <em>Builders Service Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 267, 274-75, 545 A.2d 530 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">We begin our analysis with General Statutes \u00a7 8-26 which, inter alia, authorizes a municipal planning commission to consider and act upon proposed subdivision applications. Simply stated, \u201c[n]othing in the subdivision approval statute, \u00a7 8-26, allows for the imposition of conditions upon the planning and zoning commission\u2019s approval of a subdivision plan; the statute merely provides for the commission to \u2018approve, modify and approve, or disapprove\u2019 a subdivision application.\u201d <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>176 Conn. 581, 592, 409 A.2d 1029 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A planning commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>sion, therefore, is only authorized to take one of three courses of action when considering a subdivision application: it can approve the application exactly as it was submitted; it can make changes to the application to ensure compliance with the subdivision regulations and compatibility with the municipality\u2019s comprehensive plan, and then approve the application as so modified; or it can disapprove the application outright. Any other action taken by a planning commission necessarily falls outside the statutory delegation of powers contained in the enabling act and cannot stand. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 596, citing <em>Wine </em>v. <em>Council of City of Los Angeles, </em>177 Cal. App. 2d 157, 2 Cal. Rptr. 94 (1960); <em>State ex rel. Strother </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>42 Mo. App. 343 (1890); <em>Midtown Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Township of Madison, </em>68 N. J. Super. 197, 172 A.2d 40 (1961); see also 4 R. Anderson, American Law of Zoning (3d Ed.) \u00a7 25.18, pp. 319, 323; 3 A. &amp; D. Rathkopf, Law of Zoning and Planning \u00a7 42.07 [4] [b] n.65; 7 P. Rohan, Zoning and Land Use Controls \u00a7 45.01 [5]; T. Tondro, Connecticut Land Use Regulation \u00a7 IV-B-3, p. 110; 2 E. Yokley, Zoning Law and Practice (3d Ed.) \u00a7 12.7, p. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The defendant attempts to justify its actions by referring us to cases where \u201cconditional approvals\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have been imposed by planning commissions and upheld by the courts. See, e.g., <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>179 Conn. 650, 427 A.2d 1346 (1980); <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Nicoli </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>171 Conn. 89, 368 A.2d 24 (1976); <em>Crescent Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>148 Conn. 145, 168 A.2d 547 (1961); <em>Langbein </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>145 Conn. 674, 146 A.2d 412 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Of the cases relied on by the defendant, however, only two concern the review of subdivision plans; <em>Nicoli </em>and <em>Crescent Development; </em>both of which are clearly distinguishable from the case now before us. First, the defendant is incorrect in its statement that these cases upheld the imposition of conditional subdivision approvals. In <em>Crescent Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>supra, where a planning board had approved a subdivision application \u201csubject to\u201d changes in the proposed roads and accessways, our Supreme Court noted that \u201cthe practical effect of the defendant\u2019s action was to approve the plan after modifying it.\u201d Id., 148. The court noted that the power to modify was given by statute; General Statutes \u00a7 8-26; and concluded that both the New Canaan subdivision regulations and General Statutes \u00a7 8-25 supported the commission\u2019s actions. Id., 149, 152-53. In <em>Nicoli </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, our Supreme Court was presented with a factual scenario almost identical <em>to </em>that in <em>Crescent Development. </em>Again, relying on the provisions regarding traffic safety and adequate thoroughfares contained in both \u00a7 8-25 and the municipality\u2019s subdivision regulations, the court found sufficient authority for the modifications ordered by the planning commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Lest we be accused of being more concerned with semantics than substance, we must note that it is the <em>nature </em>of the underlying action taken by the planning commission that will determine its legality, not whether it is phrased in terms of a \u201cmodification\u201d or \u201cconditional approval.\u201d The commissions in <em>Crescent Development </em>and <em>Nicoli </em>were found to possess the authority to require alterations in the planned road layouts submitted to them on the basis of their legitimate concerns with traffic flow. In contrast, the imposition of the restrictive notation by the defendant in this case is neither a \u201cmodification,\u201d within the generally understood meaning of that term, nor does it bear a rational relationship to the enumerated health, safety and public welfare considerations set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 8-25.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We conclude that a blanket prohibition on future subdivisions, without reference to a relevant provision in either the local subdivision regulations or the enabling statutes, is an impermissible expansion of the powers wielded by a planning commission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As an administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tive body, a municipal planning commission performs ministerial functions. T. Tondro, supra, IV-B-3, p. 113. \u201cIf the plan submitted conforms to [the] regulations, the council has no discretion or choice but to approve it.\u201d (Citations <em>omitted.) RK Development Corporation </em>v. Norwalk, 156 Conn. 369, 375-76, 242 A.2d 781 (1968). By placing the restrictive notation on the 1979 map, the commission empowered itself to deny any future applications even if the future applications fully complied with the regulations. This it cannot do.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The defendant next claims that because there was no appeal taken from the original imposition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>notation in 1979, the trial court erred in allowing the plaintiff to challenge the restriction on its merits. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u201cWe have frequently stated that when a party has a statutory right of appeal from the decision of an administrative agency, he may not, instead of appealing, bring an independent action to test the very issue which the appeal was designed to test. The only relevant exception to this rule is where the administrative action is void.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 598. The case now before us falls within that exception. We have already concluded that the imposition of the restrictive notation by the commission in 1979 was an impermissible expansion of the powers delegated to it by our statutes. As such, the act of the commission was without statutory authorization and, therefore, the planning commission was without jurisdiction to impose that condition. Where the challenge raised is to the power of the agency to act, the failure to appeal immediately does not deprive the challenger of his right to bring the claim at a later date. See, e.g., <em>DiCamillo </em>v. <em>Clomiro, </em>174 Conn. 351, 387 A.2d 560 (1978) (jurisdictional claim entertained one year after grant of variance); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co., </em>142 Conn. 88, 111 A.2d 552 (1955) (jurisdictional claim filed one month after grant of variance); <em>Hutchison </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>138 Conn. 247, 83 A.2d 201 (1951) (jurisdictional claim brought three years after change in zone boundaries); <em>National Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Toquet, </em>123 Conn. 468, 196 A. 344 (1937) (jurisdictional claim entertained two years after change in zone); <em>Ribeiro </em>v. <em>Andover, </em>19 Conn. Sup. 438, 116 A.2d 769 (1955) (jurisdictional claim raised three years after amendment to zoning regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Just as the planning and zoning commissions in these cases were acting without jurisdiction due to their fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>ure to comply with statutory prerequisites, the defendant herein acted without jurisdiction when it overstepped the bounds of its statutory authority. A cause of action will be allowed when \u201c[t]he allegations of the complaint clearly show that [the] purpose in bringing suit [is] not to seek a review of what the board did or of the reasons on which it relied [when taking action], but rather to ascertain whether, in doing what it did do, the board had jurisdiction to act at all.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co., </em>supra, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on our recent decision in <em>Spectrum of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, 13 Conn. </em>App. 159, 535 A.2d 382 (1988), is misplaced. In that case, a condition was imposed on the granting of a special permit to run a video arcade that required the plaintiff to control loitering and nuisances in the vicinity of the arcade. When the plaintiff sought a renewal of the special permit, its application was denied on the ground that the condition had not been fulfilled. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court claiming, inter alia, that the condition imposed was an \u201cunauthorized semi-policing obligation.\u201d The court sustained the appeal finding that the commission could not impose this type of condition on a special permit applicant. On appeal to this court, we determined that the trial court erred in permitting the plaintiff to attack the validity of the condition and directed judgment to be rendered in favor of the defendant commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Rather than furthering the defendant\u2019s claim, <em>Spectrum </em>exemplifies the traditional rule favoring immediate appeals set out in <em>Carpenter, </em>supra. The plaintiff in <em>Spectrum </em>was not challenging the power of the planning and zoning board to impose conditions on a special permit; that authority is specifically granted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>board in its enabling statute, General Statutes \u00a7 8-2.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, the plaintiff in <em>Spectrum </em>sought a determination of whether the particular condition imposed was the <em>type </em>of condition envisioned by the statute and the applicable zoning regulations. The difference between a challenge to an agency\u2019s jurisdiction and a challenge to the agency\u2019s proper exercise of its jurisdiction is significant. A successful suit on the former renders the action void and, therefore, may be brought at any time. A successful suit on the latter renders the action merely voidable and, therefore, must be instituted within the statutory period. See <em>Cavallaro </em>v. <em>Durham, </em>190 Conn. 746, 748, 462 A.2d 1042 (1983); <em>Misinonile </em>v. <em>Misinonile, </em>190 Conn. 132, 136, 459 A.2d 518 (1983); <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 598-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the failure to appeal immediately from the commission\u2019s action in 1979 does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>not bar the plaintiff from challenging that restriction now. Indeed, \u201c[her] rights were unaffected by that action, wherein the planning board had no jurisdiction. <em>Keifer </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>[68 Conn. 401, 36 A. 801 (1896)]. [Her] appeal in the present proceeding from the action taken by the planning board in [1979] involves no collateral attack upon its earlier action but a direct attack upon its later action, which was clearly void and contrary to law. The appeal in no way challenges the validity of the [subdivision] regulations but brings in question, incidentally, only the validity of the action attempted by the planning board thereunder.\u201d <em>Hutchison </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 252; see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co., </em>supra; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>135 Conn. 489, 495, 66 A.2d 359 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In light of our foregoing conclusions, the defendant\u2019s final claim merits little discussion. In essence, the defendant contends that the plaintiff should be estopped from now challenging the restrictive notation because she accepted title to the parcel with full knowledge of the existence of this restriction. This argument is a non sequitur. A party cannot be prevented from contesting the validity of any action taken by a zoning or planning board simply because it occurred prior to her taking of title to property affected by that act. Whether the challenge proves ultimately successful is another matter entirely. Moreover, as we concluded, supra, an attack focused on the power of the municipal commission to act may be brought at any time. As the cases cited in part II indicate, a landowner is not estopped from pursuing a legal remedy solely because he had prior knowledge of the commission\u2019s actions. See, e.g., <em>Hutchison </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra (\u201cThe fact, as found by the court, that the plaintiff had knowledge for more than three years prior to [the initiation of his suit], that the purported change of zone had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>been made did not affect his rights.\u201d). The defendant does not refer us to any case law that holds differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Indeed, the defendant\u2019s briefing of this claim contains no citation to case law whatsoever; rather, it relies solely on public policy considerations. A recurring theme in this portion of the defendant\u2019s argument is the possible reliance of developers and neighboring landowners on the subdivision restriction placed on the plaintiff\u2019s property. Although we acknowledge that this is an important consideration; see <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>112 Conn. 236, 152 A. 297 (1931); due to the defendant\u2019s failure to pursue this aspect in the trial court by introducing evidence regarding the existence and extent of prejudice to the property rights of others in the community, we are powerless to grant the defendant the relief it now seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u201cThe broad language of <em>[Coombs </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>supra,] must be read in the light of the situation which the court had just outlined. Estoppel is necessarily based upon prejudice and in the absence of prejudice does not exist. <em>Tradesmens National Bank of New Haven </em>v. <em>Minor, </em>122 Conn. 419, 424, 190 Atl. 270 [1937]; <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Keene, </em>85 N.H. 147, 157, 155 Atl. 195 [1931], ... In the absence of anything in the record upon which we could hold that the rights of anyone had been prejudiced by the conduct of the plaintiff subsequent to the [action taken], there is no basis for a finding of such prejudice as would create an estoppel.\u201d <em>National Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Toquet, </em>supra, 477-78; see also <em>State ex rel. DeGregorio </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>135 Conn. 31, 35-36, 60 A.2d 653 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-10\"> The remaining 9.4 acres were designated as open space.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> The parcel is located in a \u201cZone A\u201d district which allows single family-residences occupying lots of 80,000 square feet or approximately 2 acres.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 8-25.

The court also noted in passing that this type of \u201cconditional approval\u201d was <em>not </em>a modification within the meaning of \u00a7 8-26. Id., 593 n.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b327-10\"> Although \u00a7 8-25 permits preliminary approvals conditioned on the completion of work ordered by a commission or the issuance of a bond securing the completion of such work; see footnote 3, supra; there is no claim that this type of \u201cconditional approval\u201d is at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\"> Although <em>Nicoli </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>171 Conn. 89, 368 A.2d 24 (1976), does not contain a clear expression of its interpretation of the commission\u2019s actions in light of the three avenues of action available, the factual similarity of the changes ordered by the commissions in <em>Nicoli </em>and <em>Crescent Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>148 Conn. 145, 168 A.2d 547 (1961), as well as the favorable citation in <em>Nicoli </em>to the decision in <em>Crescent Development, </em>lead us to conclude that the <em>Nicoli </em>court also treated the commission\u2019s orders as a modification and approval pursuant to \u00a7 8-26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b329-6\"> For example, \u00a7 8-25 mandates that subdivision regulations provide for water, drainage and sewerage; flood controls; harmonious street plans; safe intersections; and soil erosion and sediment control. In its discretion, the commission may provide for such things as the dedication of land for parks and playgrounds; the grading of streets; the installation of public utilities and services; and the encouragement of energy efficient patterns of development. See footnote 3, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> We find the fact that Ward, the applicant in 1977, first suggested the imposition of the notation is of no significant consequence. If Ward had desired a perpetual restriction on this piece of land, she easily could have included a restrictive covenant in the deed that she conveyed to the plaintiff. Her power to limit the future use of those parcels was not a power she could transfer to the planning commission. Nor is it a power that the planning commission has authority to possess. In fact, it has been said that a planning commission cannot base its denial of subdivision approval on the existence of a deed restriction if the application otherwise meets the regulations. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>63 Pa. Cmwlth. 335, 437 A.2d 1308 (1981); see also <em>Board of Commissioners </em>v. <em>Haslett, </em>69 Pa. Cmwlth. 1, 450 A.2d 298 (1982); 4 R. Anderson, American Law of Zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>(3d Ed.) \u00a7 25.18, p. 323. The responsibility of enforcing restrictive covenants in deeds is allocated to neighboring landowners, not to a municipal commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\"> We are also mindful of the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the nature of the restrictive covenant. When the defendant denied the plaintiff\u2019s subdivision application, it stated that no \u201csignificant change of circumstances\u201d had yet occurred to warrant removal of the notation. This statement clearly indicates that the defendant is of the belief that, having imposed the restriction unilaterally, it can also lift the restriction whenever it chooses; in fact, the defendant states as much in its brief. The difficulty raised is that the defendant\u2019s eventual decision to remove the notation would, of necessity, be arbitrary and subject to challenge by neighboring landowners on that ground. Without the existence of provisions in the subdivision regulations to guide the commission to the ultimate decision to lift the restriction because of a \u201cchange in circumstances,\u201d the commission\u2019s determination would be bereft of the support necessary for the decision to be upheld by the courts. Furthermore, the plaintiff, or her successors in title, would have no way of knowing <em>when </em>a sufficient change in circumstances had occurred which would result in a successful subdivision application.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">On the basis of these considerations, we believe that if the restriction were to be upheld by this court, the prohibition against future subdivisions must exist in perpetuity. Not only would this allow the defendant to exercise powers over the future use of specific lots of land usually invested in the owners of the parcels; see footnote 9, supra; but it would also create a curious dichotomy in the authority possessed by a planning commission as opposed to other municipal decision making boards, which ordinarily do not make permanent, irreversible decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 provides in pertinent part: \u201cREGULATIONS. The zoning commission of each city, town or borough is authorized to regulate, within the limits of such municipality, the height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures; the percentage of the area of the lot that may be occupied; the size of yards, courts and other open spaces; the density of population and the location and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes, and the height, size and location of advertising signs and billboards. Such zoning commission may divide the municipality into districts of such number, shape and area as may be best suited to carry out the purposes of this chapter; and, within such districts, it may regulate the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration or use of buildings or structures and the use of land. All such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of buildings, structures or use of land throughout each district, but the regulations in one district may differ from those in another district, <em>and may provide that certain classes or kinds of buildings, structures or uses of land are permitted only after obtaining a special permit or special exception </em>from a zoning commission, planning commission, combined planning and zoning commission or zoning board of appeals, whichever commission or board the regulations may, notwithstanding any special act to the contrary, designate, <em>subject to standards set forth in the regulations and to conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience and property values.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
