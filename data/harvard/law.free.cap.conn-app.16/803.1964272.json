No interrogatories were submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\">The plaintiff raises two claims of error: (1) the evidence indicates that one of the individual defendants was negligent as a matter of law; and (2) the trial court committed plain error in its instructions to the jury concerning the issue of the negligence of the individual defendants. Under these circumstances, the general verdict rule applies to preclude review of the plaintiff\u2019s claims, because the verdicts could reasonably have been rendered on any one or all of the special defenses, which we must assume the jury found in favor of the defendants. <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. 190, 202, 520 A.2d 208 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-10\"> The first count claimed negligence against the four individual defendants, who were officials of the city of Hartford.

The third count, also against the four individual defendants, was based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.
