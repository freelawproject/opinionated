The defendant Connecticut Inter-local Risk Management Agency (CIRMA) was the borough\u2019s compensation insurance carrier at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>In response to the plaintiffs notice of claim filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b), CIRMA, in its status as the borough\u2019s insurer, filed a disclaimer, via a workers\u2019 compensation commission form 43-67 entitled \u201cNotice to Compensation Commissioner and Employee of Intention to Contest Liability to Pay Compensation.\u201d The pertinent disclaimer set forth as follows: \u201cEmployee did not sustain accidental injury as defined by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We deny the injury, any disability and causal relation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Thereupon, the plaintiff filed a motion to preclude alleging that the disclaimer was insufficient as a matter of law because it failed to disclose specific substantive grounds adequately to apprise him of the reasons why the defendants were contesting his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Following the receipt of the parties\u2019 briefs, the commissioner granted the motion to preclude, thereby preventing the defendants from contesting the plaintiff\u2019s claim for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The defendants appealed the commissioner\u2019s decision to the compensation review division which, by opinion dated April 8, 1988, affirmed the decision of the commissioner. From this decision of the compensation review division, the defendants have taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The sole claim of error before us is whether the disclaimer filed by the defendants sufficiently complies with the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b) to allow the defendants to defend on the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. We agree with the commissioner and the review division that the language employed in the defendants\u2019 purported disclaimer is inadequate and falls to conform to the mandates of \u00a7 31-297 (b) as enunciated in <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>165 Conn. 338, 341-48, 334 A.2d 452 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>In <em>Menzies, </em>the alleged disclaimer, in part, stated: \u201c[W]e deny a compensable accident or injury.\u201d Id., 341. Although, in the present case, the defendants\u2019 attempted disclaimer contains more words, it, in essence, is nothing more than a general denial that the court in <em>Menzies </em>deemed inadequate to raise a contest. Therefore, we affirm the decision of the compensation review division.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
