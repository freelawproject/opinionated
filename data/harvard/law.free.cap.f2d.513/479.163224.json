ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b552-26\">Appellant City National Bank filed suit in the District Court challenging the preliminary approval by appellee Comptroller of the Currency of a national bank charter for appellee Meadowbrook National Bank. The court denied City\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment for the Comptroller and Meadowbrook.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> City urges reversal on the grounds that misrepresentations by Meadowbrook\u2019s organizers precluded approval of the application,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the Comptroller failed to investigate adequately and neglected to decide the misrepresentation issue<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the Comptroller did not explain his decision sufficiently to permit effective judicial review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-27\">I. THE APPLICATION PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b552-28\">The National Bank Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> empowers the Comptroller to issue charters for national banks.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The dual purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the chartering process is to regulate entry into the banking industry on the basis of economic considerations and to assure that national banks are competently and honestly operated. These objectives are reflected in the topics subject to investigation prior to approval of applications for charters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">(1) The adequacy of the proposed banks structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">(2) The earning prospects of the proposed bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">(3) The convenience and needs of the community to be served by the proposed bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">(4) The character and general standing in the community of the applicants, prospective directors, proposed officers, and other employees, and other persons connected with the application or to be connected with the proposed bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">(5) The banking ability and experience of those officers and other employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">On July 17, 1972, a group of businessmen applied for a charter authorizing organization of Meadowbrook National Bank in the eastern section of Fort Worth; Texas. The Regional Administrator of National Banks initiated an investigation, including a four-day field examination. He also notified the 40 existing banks in the county in which Mea-dowbrook would be located that the application had been filed and invited written comments. City responded in opposition to the proposed charter, expressing the view that there was no economic necessity for a new bank in the area.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Later City requested, and was granted, a public hearing on the application<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> at which it might defend that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-19\">At the hearing Meadowbrook presented evidence of the need for a new bank in east Fort Worth. The testimony of witnesses called by City was directed solely towards the economic considerations generated by the application. Mea-dowbrook offered further testimony in rebuttal concerning the economic desirability of favorable action on the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-20\">In closing argument, following Mea-dowbrook\u2019s summation, City\u2019s counsel raised a question regarding a possible lack of full disclosure in the application. This charge had not surfaced in the pre-hearing communications nor had it been the subject of any testimony offered at the hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> City suggested that Mea-dowbrook\u2019s organizers had concealed the identity of an interested party,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and Meadowbrook vigorously denied this allegation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>After the hearing intradepartmental recommendations were submitted to the Comptroller to assist the final decision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Regional Administrator\u2019s report noted the concealment claim, but concluded that \u201cownership distribution appears satisfactory.\u201d The Comptroller approved the application conditionally and stated the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">Population of area adequate to support this new entry. Only bank in area is undoubtedly of sufficient size (32 million) to stand competition, the addition of which should redound to the benefit of the consuming public. Subject to aggregate capital of at least one million.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The applicants were notified that the Comptroller had granted preliminary approval subject to a number of conditions, including acceptability of initial management personnel and submission of financial and biographical data by each person who subscribed for 5% of Meadowbrook\u2019s shares.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The distribution of shares was, as it apparently is in all cases, subject to the Comptroller\u2019s approval of the subscribers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">City then filed suit against the Comptroller to invalidate approval of the application, and Meadowbrook was granted leave to intervene. The primary ground for relief stated in City\u2019s amended complaint related to the alleged misrepresentation by Meadowbrook\u2019s organizers in the application. The Comptroller submitted the full administrative record,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and all parties moved for summary judgment. The District Court concluded that \u201cthe Comptroller\u2019s decision to grant preliminary approval of the charter application of Meadowbrook National Bank is both rationally and substantially supported by the record and the record does not support plaintiff\u2019s charge of fraud, misrepresentation, or concealment, and this charge was reasonably and properly rejected by the Comptroller\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">II. THE MISREPRESENTATION CHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">The Meadowbrook application represented, in the standard form prescribed by the Comptroller, that its organizers were not acting in behalf of any person \u201cundisclosed to the Comptroller\u201d and that there was no \u201cagreement or understanding\u201d providing for purchase of Meadowbrook shares by any person.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> City claims that the organizers had an understanding with Dee J. Kelly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>principal shareholder of another area bank, that Kelly would be a stockholder and that this understanding suggests that they were acting on his behalf, as well as their own, in filing the application. City contends that the failure to disclose this arrangement \u2014 variously termed by City \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d \u201comission of material facts\u201d and \u201clack of candor\u201d \u2014 invalidated the Comptroller\u2019s approval of the application.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The standard for judicial review of the Comptroller\u2019s action in granting or denying a charter application was recently set by the Supreme Court in Camp v. Pitts.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The test is whether the Comptroller\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By this standard, the District Court was clearly justified in rejecting the misrepresentation charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The evidence offered by City to substantiate its allegations was, to say the least, far from compelling. On the other hand, there was a good deal of evidence indicating that Kelly\u2019s proposed participation in Meadowbrook was disclosed to the Comptroller\u2019s office, even if the application was not literally accurate in all particulars.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Before the filing of the application, the applicants told the Deputy Regional Administrator, in a meeting with Kelly present, that Kelly intended to become a stockholder in the proposed bank. This intention was reaffirmed at the hearing by Meadowbrook\u2019s counsel, who also stated that Kelly had recognized throughout the application proceedings that the Comptroller reserved the prerogative of final approval of the stockholders. The field examiner was informed that Kelly intended to subscribe for 5% of the shares, and this fact was contained in the examiner\u2019s report, which was a part of the record submitted to the Comptroller. Finally, in a post-hearing letter, Kelly asserted that he always intended to invest in the bank, that he never had any agreement with the organizers and that he realized that any purchase of shares was subject to authorization by the Comptroller. On this record, the approval of the application was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion, and the District Court\u2019s rejection of the misrepresentation charge must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">III. THE ADEQUACY OF THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">City also asserts that the evidence revealed at the hearing mandated a post-hearing investigation by the Comptroller\u2019s office to resolve questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>that were yet unanswered. The Comptroller\u2019s discretion in the area of investigations and hearings relating to charter applications is plain.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although the Comptroller might have been justified in exercising his discretion in favor of further investigation, City\u2019s presentation was not so forceful that he was required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Additionally, the purported concealment was not a major issue in the administrative proceedings, which focused mainly on the need for a new bank in east Fort Worth. Although City has placed great emphasis on that issue in the District Court and on appeal, it was not mentioned at all prior to the hearing \u2014 despite ample opportunity to do so \u2014 and City did not include any reference to nondisclosure in its presentation of evidence at the hearing.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Nor did City question any of the organizers at the hearing, although five of the six were present and one was called by Mea-dowbrook to testify concerning the need factor. Besides, a \u201cconclusion\u201d filed by City after the hearing listed six reasons for denial of the application but completely ignored the misrepresentation charge. If the record revealed that the Comptroller had not conducted a sufficient inquiry into an important facet of the application, we might be disposed to remand the case for reconsideration.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> From the manner in which City presented its case prior to seeking judicial review, however, we can conclude only that City itself regarded the misrepresentation claim as a matter of little moment in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">A related argument posited by City is that the Comptroller\u2019s failure'to advert to the misrepresentation allegation in his final decision demonstrates that he neither decided nor was aware of the issue. But although the Comptroller did not expressly mention the charge, it was clearly disclosed by the administrative record. Neither the field examiner nor the Regional Administrator, whose reports reflected awareness of the problem, regarded the question as significant enough to merit reference in the summaries of their recommendations. The Comptroller is not obliged to comment personally on every issue, however insignificant, raised in an application proceeding,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and in the circumstances presented here we deem the omission inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">IV. THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE COMPTROLLER\u2019S DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">Finally, City argues that the Comptroller\u2019s decision does not contain a sufficient contemporaneous explanation of its basis<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and therefore frustrates effective judicial review.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Undoubtedly, judicial review would be a much simpler task were the Comptroller to report his conclusions, and briefly indicate his supporting rationale, on all issues raised in application proceedings. We again note, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>however, that City\u2019s misrepresentation charge was neither compelling nor strongly urged prior to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"A1O\">The contention that the Comptroller must make formal findings was flatly rejected by the Supreme Court in Camp v. Pitts.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> What is required is only a contemporaneous explanation of the decision indicating \u201cthe determinative reason for the final action taken.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> If the record before us raised a substantial doubt as to whether the Comptroller considered a material issue, we would not permit the approval to stand.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Here the alleged concealment was only a minor issue; the agency proceedings centered pivotally on economic factors, which were resolved in Meadowbrook\u2019s favor and about which there is no present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"AxE\">City tries to distinguish <em>Pitts </em>by noting that the Comptroller\u2019s regulations applicable in that case did not require a hearing, and arguing that the present administrative provision for a hearing mandates formal findings on the record. This argument overlooks the clear language of the Administrative Procedure Act, which calls for formal findings<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> in adjudicative proceedings only when a <em>statute </em>mandates a hearing be held on the record.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The current hearing requirement for charter applications is stated in the Comptroller\u2019s regulations <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and is not embodied in the National Bank Act.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"asa-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-15\">.
