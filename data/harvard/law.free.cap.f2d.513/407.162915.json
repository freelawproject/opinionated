ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The Madison Hotel, Inc. (Madison) and Marshall B. Coyne, its president, appeal from a judgment awarding damages to Camalier &amp; Buckley-Madison, Inc. (Ca-malier) on account of Madison\u2019s termination of a lease into which it had entered with Camalier. The judgment rests upon a verdict directed by the trial judge on the issue of liability, and the amount of damages set by the jury following submission of that issue to it. Presented for review are questions of construction and operation of key provisions of the lease, and of the propriety of some of the instructions given the jury on damages. We find that the direction of the verdict was erroneous, and that the error fatally infected the verdict on damages also. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for a full retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">I. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">By an instrument dated July 7, 1967, Madison leased to Camalier a portion of the main lobby of Madison\u2019s hotel building, together with furnishings and equipment, for use by Camalier as a gift shop and newsstand. The lease specified a term of five years from March 1, 1967, renewable at Camalier\u2019s option for an additional five-year period, and incorporated two other features which were to assume great importance in this litigation. Paragraph 21 authorized Madison to relocate the demised premises in similar-sized space on the main lobby floor of either the hotel building or Madison\u2019s adjacent office building on a sixty-day notice of intention by Madison and at its expense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Paragraph 16 provided that in the event of nonperformance by Camalier of any obligation of the lease for a period of five days after written notice thereof by Madison, the latter could terminate the lease and reenter the premises on a five-day notice of its intention to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">On February 3, 1971, Coyne telephoni-cally informed Camalier\u2019s president that the shop would have to be moved from the hotel lobby and relocated in the lobby of the office building. Coyne then received an acknowledgment of Camalier\u2019s obligation to comply if Madison provided equivalent space. By May, 1971, the new location was ready for occupan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>cy but Camalier refused to accept it, asserting that the area was smaller than the original site and that the fixtures were inadequate for storage and display of its wares. Negotiations between the parties, over a period of several months ensuing, failed to achieve a mutually satisfactory adjustment of those objections.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">By letter dated June 1, 1971, Coyne confirmed the February 3 telephone conversation and referred to Paragraph 21 of the lease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That letter was followed by another, dated June 23, in which Coyne, again citing Paragraph 21, indicated a desire to terminate the lease but suggested renegotiation of a new lease clarifying their differences.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a conference between Coyne and Camalier failed to achieve that goal,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Coyne, by letter dated August 4,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> advised that \u201c[sjince Article Twenty-One of your lease gives me the absolute right to require you to relocate your business and since the sixty day notice period will expire August 23, 1971,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we shall expect you to complete your moving into the relocated space by the last mentioned date, failing which, we shall consider you in default and will take such further action as we deem appropriate to the circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Then followed another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>letter, dated September 3, in which Coyne stated that \u201con Tuesday, September 7th, I will close the space you occupy currently and I request that you remove all merchandise forthwith.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That missive brought the final episode near.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">On the night of September 6 \u2014 7, an employee of Madison broke off a key in the lock securing the shop in the hotel building. Madison\u2019s night manager informed a Camalier employee of the lock; the employee retained a locksmith, regained entry, and business was conducted on September 7 and 8. On the night of September 8-9, Madison had the lock on the shop door changed, and on the next morning Madison's night manager told Camalier\u2019s employee that Coyne had informed him that Camalier had broken the lease and was not to reopen for business. When the employee nonetheless attempted to do so, he was unable to open the door, and it was then that Ca-malier turned to courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The complaint which Camalier filed in the District Court alleged wrongful eviction, trespass and breach of contract, and sought damages from Madison and Coyne. At trial before a jury, the judge directed a verdict for Camalier on the question of liability, and the jury assessed compensatory and punitive damages in its favor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Madison\u2019s motion for a new trial, or in the alternative for remittitur, was denied and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">II. THE OPTION TO RELOCATE</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">Camalier\u2019s motion for direction of the verdict summoned attention to three notice provisions of the lease. The first was -the sixty-day notice of intention specified in Paragraph 23 as a precondition to exercise of Madison\u2019s right to relocate Camalier\u2019s shop.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The second was the five-day notice of default, and the third the five-day notice of intention, which Paragraph 16 made prerequisite to termination of the lease and reentry by Madison upon the leased premises.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial judge ruled that as a matter of law Madison did not comply with the third provision, and that the omission to do so entitled Camalier to a judgment establishing Madison\u2019s liability on all three causes of action stated in the complaint. With that, the judge deemed it unnecessary to determine whether Madison observed the other two notice requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-15\">In this court, the parties have debated the effects, upon the issues presented for review, of each of the three notice provisions. Since we disagree with the trial judge\u2019s ruling, it is essential that we con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>sider them all.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the interest of orderly analysis, we start with the one associated with Madison\u2019s attempts to relocate the premises leased to Camalier.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We then consider those related to Madison\u2019s bid to terminate the lease.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Paragraph 21 conferred upon Madison \u201cthe right to relocate the demised premises to another location on the main lobby floor of the hotel building, or office building immediately adjacent thereto,\u201d upon satisfaction of three conditions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> One was \u201cthat the substituted area . be similar in size to the premises [originally] demised . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Another was that Madison give Camalier \u201csixty (60) days notice of its intention thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Still another was that \u201c[a]ny and all costs incurred by such relocation ... be borne by [Madison] and rental payments abate during any period in which [Cama-lier] shall be unable to operate its business.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The last condition does not tender any question for decision on this appeal, but the other two very much do.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">Camalier refused to move its business into the office building on grounds that the facility there offered was smaller in floor, storage and display areas.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Like Camalier, we think the lease fairly contemplated substantial comparability in these respects,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and we agree with Madison that the conflicting evidence introduced on these subjects raised substantial issues of fact for resolution by the jury if Paragraph 21 was otherwise properly invoked.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Our im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>mediate concern, however, is whether the notice requirement of Paragraph 21 was met, for if not the relocation provision by its own terms never became operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The evidence demonstrated more than ample communication to Camalier of Madison\u2019s desire that the shop be moved from the one building to the other. As early as February 3, Coyne telephoned Camalier\u2019s president to tell him just that;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the message was repeated in Coyne\u2019s letters of June 1 <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and 23,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> both of which made specific reference to Paragraph 21. Each of these communications was more than sixty days in advance of the date \u2014 September 7 \u2014 on which Madison first sought to oust Ca-malier for noncompliance with Paragraph 21. What Madison had in mind\u2014 as distinguished from legal validity of the thought, in view of the substituted space and fixtures offered Camalier-\u2014 was indisputably to invoke that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">It is contended, however, that these messages were ineffective because none unequivocably established a time for the relocation Madison wished. More particularly, the argument is that neither of the communications transmitted more than sixty days prior to September 7 designated a date from which the sixty-day period for relocation was to run, or a date on which the period was to expire, and that for that reason each was fatally defective. We cannot agree. Paragraph 21 required notice by Madison merely \u201cof its intention\u201d to relocate Ca-malier; <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> it did not call for notice specifying a day certain on or before which relocation was to take place.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The evident purpose of this notice provision was to inform the lessee of the lessor\u2019s plan in time to permit the lessee an opportunity to prepare to move. Any communication clearly informing Camalier of the action demanded would suffice, then, after a minimum period of sixty days for preparation and compliance was afforded.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We have said that Madison\u2019s communications between February 3 and June 23 imparted the necessary information.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We now add that at least by August 23<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Madison was entitled to insist upon relocation of the shop if the new quarters met applicable specifications of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">III. THE OPTION TO TERMINATE</p>\n<p id=\"b486-16\">The' lease into which Madison and Ca-malier entered generated more than a contractual status; <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> for both it created new interests in the leased realty.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It conferred upon Camalier an estate therein for a five-year term, and an option to prolong the estate for another five years, an option which Camalier eventually exercised.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Thus Camalier was endowed not only with the rights which the lease as a contract extended to it, but also with a form of ownership of the shop premises, at the original or a relocated site, for the aggregate term of the lease.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> These were the interests which in time Madison sought to liquidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Paragraph 16 conferred upon Madison the option to terminate the lease and reenter the leased premises \u201cif [Camalier] shall fail to comply with any provision ... or agreement of this lease on its part to be kept and performed . . ..\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Paragraph 21, pertaining to relocation, was of course a provision within the compass of Paragraph 16. But exercise of the option on account of any such failure was expressly conditioned upon rendition of two notices by Madison to Camalier. One was a written notice of default, after which the default would have to persist for five days before the option could be utilized.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The other was a five-day notice of intention to terminate the lease because of the default.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Paragraph 16 expressly provided that the term of the lease would cease upon the expiration of the five-day period following the second notice, and that thereupon Madison could reenter and repossess the leased premises.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Thus Paragraph 16 of the lease erected a procedure for ending, at Madison\u2019s option, the lease arrangement upon the happening of specified contingencies.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Furthermore, one of the contingencies may have occurred \u2014 nonperformance of Camalier\u2019s duty to relocate its shop if the new site satisfied the conditions of the lease.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> But even if Camalier did default in that respect, it was incumbent upon Madison to observe the procedural prerequisites to dissolution of the parties\u2019 relationship on that account. Camalier\u2019s noncompliance with an obligation of the lease, while enabling suit for breach of contract,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> did not alone authorize termination of its estate;<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> only the Paragraph 16 option offered that course.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> That option could be asserted only on the terms it prescribed,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> including the notice requirements it specified;<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and unless and until the option was properly exercised, the lease and Camalier\u2019s estate thereunder remained unaffected.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">\n<em>Notice of Default</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">Camalier could not possibly have defaulted in its obligation to relocate the shop prior to readiness of a new site for its occupancy, or prior to expiration of a sixty-day notice by Madison to relocate<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> As we have stated, by early May there were new quarters in the office building for Camalier\u2019s shop, which at least in Madison\u2019s view were comparable to those in the hotel building;<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and as we have held, there was notice to relocate considerably more than sixty days before Ca-malier\u2019s eviction actually took place.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> And Coyne\u2019s letter of August 4 informed Camalier of Madison\u2019s \u201cunderstanding that notwithstanding the notice [of relocation] <footnotemark>51</footnotemark> given to you, it is not your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>intention to make the relocating move,\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">Since Article Twenty-One of your lease gives me the absolute right to require you to relocate your business and since the sixty day notice period will expire August 23, 1971, we shall expect you to complete your moving into the relocated space by the last mentioned date, failing which, we shall consider you in default and will take such further action as we deem appropriate to the circumstances.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We think that letter satisfied the requirement of notice of default which Paragraph 16 of the lease imposed. The letter was written after the parties were in dispute as to equivalence of the new shop site to the old, and after Camalier had manifested reluctance to relocate. The letter set forth unequivocably Madison\u2019s position that Camalier was under a duty to relocate its shop on or before August 23, when the sixty-day period of notice therefor expired,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and that failure to do so would be deemed a default. The plain purpose of the requirement of notice of default was to alert Camalier to the possibility of eviction unless it brought itself into compliance. That is precisely what the letter of August 4 did,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and we are unable to read into Paragraph 16 a responsibility on Madison\u2019s part to do more.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> And Madison unquestionably waited for more than the necessary five days from August 23 before undertaking to oust Camalier from the location in the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">\n<em>Notice to Terminate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">These conclusions leave Madison confronted, however, with the further need to show proper notice of its intention to terminate the lease \u2014 a notice conformable with Paragraph 16, including its explicit demand for a notice period of five days.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> We are unable to discern from the record any notice of that character during the negotiations between the parties from June through August. Neither the letter of June 1 nor the letter of June 23 called upon Camalier to quit the premises; on the contrary, both recognized an on-going tenancy.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Likewise, the letter of August 4, which urged relocation by August 23, and admonished that \u201cfailing [that], we shall consider you in default and will take such further action as we deem appropriate to the circumstances,\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> clearly envisioned continuation of Camalier\u2019s tenancy if it would but relocate its shop.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\"> It thus becomes pivotal to determine whether Madison\u2019s final communication to Camalier \u2014 Coyne\u2019s letter of September 3 \u2014 gave the notice of termination which Paragraph 16 prescribed. The relevant part of the letter was the sentence in which Coyne stated that \u201con Tuesday, September 7th, I will close the space you occupy currently . . ..\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The letter was sent on September 3 by certified mail, and by the terms of the lease a notice so mailed was to be treated as given on the date of mailing; <footnotemark>62</footnotemark> but even counting September 3, the five-day period did not expire until September 8. By the rule now entrenched in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the District of Columbia, the requirement of five days\u2019 notice meant notice over five full days,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> which could be made out only by counting the whole of September 7.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Put another way, a five-day notice given on September 3, though counting that day, would not run its course until midnight of September 7-8.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Thus the key sentence of the September 3 letter \u2014 that \u201cthe space you occupy currently\u201d could be \u201cclose[d]\u201d \u201con Tuesday, September 7th\u201d \u2014 undertook to designate a terminal date one day too early to satisfy the notice command of Paragraph 16.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">That, however, does not end the matter, for there are other considerations bearing on the problem. Notwithstanding the erroneous terminal date specified in the notice, and despite the abortive attempt to lock Camalier out of the premises on the night of September 6-7,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Madison did not succeed in evicting Camalier until the morning of September 9,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> well outside the five-day notice period. And Paragraph 16, after stating the requirement of a five-day notice, further provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">upon the giving of such notice, the term of this Lease shall cease and terminate at the expiration of said five (5) days period and from thenceforth it shall be lawful for the Landlord to re-enter into or upon the demised premises without or with legal process and repossess the same as of the former estate of the Landlord, and expel the Tenant . . . ,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">In sum, what this provision says is that the lease would terminate, and that Madison could dispossess Camalier, upon expiration of the five-day period following notice, which actually occurred before Camalier\u2019s eviction. Moreover, it is settled with us that a timely notice to terminate a tenancy need not specify the terminal date.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Madison thus has faced difficulty only because the notice designated September 7 as the terminal date, a blunder which the trial judge deemed sufficient to vitiate the notice entirely. In reviewing that ruling, we must decide whether Madison\u2019s otherwise valid notice of termination was rendered nugatory merely because it unnecessarily stated a terminal date earlier than the date on which the five-day notice would expire, or whether the notice was effective to terminate the lease on the day next following \u2014 the date on which it properly might have been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">In Merritt v. Thompson,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> a landlord served notice on July 1, 1922, ordering month-to-month tenants, whose terms began on the first day of each calendar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>month, to vacate their apartments on the following July 31. By statute, the tenancies were terminable only by thirty days\u2019 notice expiring on the day of the month from which the tenancies commenced to run.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> This court held that the notice did not comply with the statute, and consequently would not sustain actions for possession, because \u201c[njeither the tenancy nor the 30 days expired until midnight on July 31st, while the notice was to vacate, remove from, and quit the apartments on that date.\u201d <footnotemark>73</footnotemark> During the course of the opinion, it was stated that \u201c[wjhile [the landlord] was not required to specify in the notice the date of the termination of the lease, having done so, he was bound by that date.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> On the surface, that statement might seem to support the argument that Madison was equally bound by the terminal date its notice specified, with the result that the notice, like the notice in <em>Merritt, </em>did not terminate Camalier\u2019s tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">That such reasoning would be faulty plainly appears, however, from this court\u2019s subsequent decision in All States Service Station v. Standard Oil Company.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> A motor fuel sales contract provided that it was terminable by the seller \u201cat any time on giving Buyer ten (10) days\u2019 written notice of intention so to do.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> By letter, the seller advised the buyer that it was exercising the right to terminate the contract, and stated that \u201csuch termination [was] to be effective ten days from the date of this letter.\u201d <footnotemark>77</footnotemark> This designation of effective date was deficient because the buyer did not receive the letter until the day after it was written and dated, and so the ten-day period from the letter\u2019s date did not afford the buyer ten full days from the date of receipt.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> It was held, nevertheless that \u201c[t]he legal effect of the [seller\u2019s] letter . . . should be that the contract came to an end ten days after its receipt by the [buyer].\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The court elucidated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">The legal effect of the [seller\u2019s] letter should be that the contract came to an end ten days after its receipt by the [buyer]. By giving the letter this effect, the [buyer] received fully the protection to which it agreed, the period of notice is determined by the appropriate contract provision, and the [seller\u2019s] definite, meaningful act is not an empty gesture. To hold that the letter had no effect because it mistakenly set a period short of that required would make a modern application of the brittle fifteenth century common law. The rule which we adopt, that a notice, good in all other respects, such as being definite rather than a mere statement of future intention, is not made totally ineffective because it states a period shorter than the contract requires, is in accordance with the authorities.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">And the court explained away any antithetic which <em>Merritt </em>might superficially have indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">[In that case], a monthly tenancy was involved. Inasmuch as the statute provided that the notice was to expire on the day of the month from which the tenancy ran . . ., the situation is quite different from h'-re where the contract could cease at any time after ten days\u2019 notice.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">It is clear enough that <em>All States </em>is the precedent for the case at bar. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>statutory limitation on terminating periodic tenancies which <em>Merritt </em>confronted \u2014 notice congruent with one of its units of duration<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> \u2014 has no application to the fixed-term tenancy involved here;<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> but for the exercise of some option of the lease enabling premature ending of Camalier\u2019s tenancy,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> no notice to terminate would ever have been needed.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> By the same token, the role of notice in this case, as in <em>All States, </em>was only what the parties gave it, and that was simply the mechanistic function of setting in motion a period at the expiration of .which the parties\u2019 relationship would cease.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Like the contract in <em>All States, </em>the lease before us provided that after a designated time following notice, the relationship would end without more;<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> <em>All States </em>held that that result would not be affected by designation of an earlier terminal point in the notice, and we perceive no basis in precedent or logic to apply a different rule here.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> We hold that the notice of termination which Madison gave Camalier, if in fact soundly premised on Camalier\u2019s refusal to relocate in similar quarters,<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> ended the lease and Camalier\u2019s contractual and property rights thereunder at midnight of September 7-8.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">The verdict on liability directed for Camalier is inconsistent with our analysis of the notice-to-terminate problem and the conclusion we reach upon the applicable law. The direction proceeded on the ground that the too-short notice period stripped the notice of all vitality, and thus rendered it incapable of terminating Camalier\u2019s tenancy at any point in time. The error pervading that theory necessitates a retrial of the issue of Madison\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">IV. THE VERDICT ON DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">Madison additionally advances three separate challenges to the instructions which the trial judge gave to the jury on the question of the damages which it might assess in Camalier\u2019s favor. One impugns an instruction stating that profits which Camalier might have earned from its shop during the unexpired term of the lease following eviction comprised an element of damages which the jury could consider.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Another assails the denial of a requested instruction to the effect that Camalier was under a duty to mitigate the damages flowing from any unauthorized termination of the lease and the leasehold estate arising thereunder.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> Still another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>contests the judge\u2019s action in permitting the jury to include in its verdict a sum representing punitive damages.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> We do not rest the fate of the verdict on damages upon the validity of these claims, for we find that in any event the case must be retried as to damages as well as to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">To be sure, in suitable circumstances the scope of a new trial may be limited to less than all of the issues raised in the case.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> That course is appropriate where error requires a new trial on some issues but leaves the verdict on completely separate issues unin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>fected.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> However, as the Supreme Court has cautioned, the power to grant a partial new trial \u201cmay not properly be resorted to unless it clearly appears that the issue to be retried is so distinct and separable from the others that a trial of it alone may be had without injustice.\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> And so, as the Court has held, where \u201cthe question of damages ... is so interwoven with that of liability that the former cannot be submitted to the jury independently of the latter without confusion and uncertainty, [a separation] would amount to a denial of a fair trial.\u201d <footnotemark>97</footnotemark> That is the situation confronting us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Having ruled favorably to Camalier on its motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge instructed the jury that \u201cthe issue of liability has been decided by the Court as a matter of law in favor of [Camalier],\u201d and that this meant \u201cthat [Madison\u2019s] conduct breached [Camalier\u2019s] rights . . . since [Madison] failed to give an adequate five-day termination notice.\u201d \u201c[Therefore,\u201d the judge continued, \u201c[Madison\u2019s] conduct constitutes a trespass, a wrongful eviction, and breach of contract.\u201d The judge then informed the jury that \u201c[accordingly . . . there is no need for you to consider the other questions which have been raised concerning liability, such as whether the substituted space . . was similar in size to the original space; [or] whether [Madison] ever gave an adequate or proper 60-day notice of relocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">We think these instructions, albeit inadvertently, may have so distorted the postural image of the litigation in the jury\u2019s mind that its verdict cannot safely be accepted as a proper award of damages should Camalier prevail on retrial of the issue of liability. The unelucidat-ed statement that Madison\u2019s \u201cconduct breached [Camalier\u2019s] rights\u201d may well have led the jury to erroneously believe that the dispute over relocation of Cama-lier\u2019s shop had been legally resolved against Madison, and that Camalier was inexorably entitled to remain in its quarters in the hotel building;<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> and that false notion, in turn, could have imper-missibly influenced the jury\u2019s award of damages. It could have aggravated the amount which the verdict included for lost profits;<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> it could have settled for the jury Camalier\u2019s bona fides in renewing the lease for a second five-year term;<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> it could have dictated the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>conclusion on mitigation of damages,<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> and as well on punitive damages.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> In calling attention to the more conspicuous probabilities of prejudice, we do not suggest that the list is exhaustive.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Whether these or other possible consequences actually followed the handling of the matter is something we will never know. It is enough, however, that one or more may have; and viewing the situation realistically, we cannot confidently say that none did. In other words, we lack reasonable assurance that Madison did not suffer injustice through misapprehension of the jury as to something material to the verdict. Our duty, then, is to afford Madison a new trial on damages as well as liability.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In brief summary, the direction of the verdict on liability was erroneous.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> There must be a new trial, by a jury unless waived, for the purpose of resolving the question whether the quarters which Madison offered Camalier in the office building were spatially similar to those which it had in the hotel lobby.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> If the jury answers that question in the negative, it will then proceed to reassess Camalier\u2019s damages on the whole of its case.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> If, on the other hand, the question is answered in the affirmative, the jury will proceed to establish the amount of the damages flowing only from any trespass on the night of September 6-7 which it may find,<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> and a new judgment in Camalier\u2019s favor for the amount thereof will then be entered.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">.

This letter is not understood as a waiver of any rights under the lease, any of which I may pursue. I am hopeful that we can agree quickly upon the terms of a new lease to supercede [sic] the existing agreement. In this way, we can avoid all differences of opinion.

An additional consideration is that Camalier argues that the directed verdict must be sustained if Madison failed to observe the requirements of either of the three provisions. <em>See, e. g., </em>Laughlin v.

Camalier\u2019s evidence tended to show that the floor footage was perhaps as much as 10% less; and that the display space was 51 square feet and the storage space 36 cubic feet as compared with 158.9 square feet and 73.4 cubic feet, respectively, at the original location, or something less than half. By Madison\u2019s computations, the combined display and storage\u2019 areas, expressed in square footage, were 264 at the new location and 241 at the old. There was testimony that Camalier would have accepted the substituted site in the office building had the shelving been carried upward, but that Coyne refused Camalier\u2019s request therefor on the ground that \u201c[i]t will ruin the looks of my office building.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b485-14\">. The premises subject to the lease were described therein as a portion of the main lobby floor of the hotel designated on an attached drawing, \u201ctogether with the store fixtures, equipment and furnishings provided and installed by [Madison].\u201d Display and storage capacity were important because fl 1(E) of the lease bound Camalier to \u201cmaintain in the demised premises a complete line of merchandise usually carried by the operator of a \u2018news stand and gift shop\u2019 in a first class downtown hotel, and at all times during the term hereof, [to] keep the premises reasonably stocked with merchandise. . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-18\">That Madison bore the prime responsibility for display and storage facilities appears from other provisions of the lease. Paragraph 2(C) required Madison to furnish \u201c[a] reasonable amount of storage space ... in one of the four (4) garage levels of the [hotel] building, for storage purposes.\u201d Additionally, the lease denied Camalier an unqualified right to install fixtures of its choice for any purpose. Paragraph 6(A) empowered Camalier \u201cto place or install in said leased premises such fixtures and equipment as it may deem desirable for the conduct of business therein,\u201d but only \u201csubject to approval of [Madison]\u201d; that paragraph specifically provided \u201cthat any fixtures or equipment installed by [Camalier] must first be approved by [Madison] in writing before the installation thereof.\u201d In other words, Ca-malier was powerless to duplicate, over objections by Madison, the display and storage facilities of the old location at the new location, even at Camalier\u2019s own expense. Very importantly, nothing in the lease indicates contemplation that substantially inferior premises could be thrust upon Camalier in the event of a substitution. Camalier could be assured of premises of the character for which it had bargained only if the U 21 conditions \u201cthat the substituted area ... be similar in size to the premises herein demised\u201d meant similarity in the facilities for display and storage as well as in floor area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b485-19\">.

Each of Madison\u2019s several objections to this ' instruction stems from the fact that the judge did not also submit to the jury the question whether Camalier had itself .violated the lease by failing to relocate the shop in the office building. The central theme of Madison\u2019s argument is that even if Madison broke the contract and wrongfully evicted Camalier, any injury to its possessory rights must be measured and limited by the consideration that it was entitled to remain on the premises only for five days after rendition- of a notice of termination. See text <em>supra </em>at notes 75-90. Another theme is that the directed verdict on liability may have led the jury to believe that Camalier had been exonerated of the charge that it unjustifiably refused to relocate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"92\">\n<p id=\"b491-19\">.

There was, of course, the new shop site in the office building, but its, equivalence to the original site has not yet been determined, and an injured party is at liberty to reject an alternative dissimilar to the original.

We note initially that the instruction attacked was authored and requested by Madison\u2019s trial counsel (not his counsel on appeal), with the result that Madison is hardly in position to complain.

More fundamentally, Madison\u2019s argument ignores trespass and wrongful eviction as additional causes of action, see Part I, <em>supra- </em>\u2014 torts for which punitive damages may be allowed.

See Part II, <em>supra. </em>Because the case must be retried, we pass over two additional contentions urged. One stems from a ruling by the trial judge excluding the testimony of a witness for Madison and Coyne. Their trial counsel did not include the witness on his list of pretrial witnesses and did not proffer what the witness was expected to testify to. These problems can be avoided on retrial if the testimony of the witness is still desired. The other contention is that Coyne was not a party to the lease between Madison and Camalier, and for that reason could not properly be held liable for breach of contract. We perceive no barrier, however, to Coyne\u2019s liability on the counts of trespass and wrongful eviction if warranted by the evidence, and we note that there was testimony that Coyne instructed Madison\u2019s employees to lock Camalier out of the shop. In any event, we leave the ruling as is pending the outcome of the new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"106\">\n<p id=\"b494-16\">. See Part IV, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"107\">\n<p id=\"b494-17\">. Since the evidence shows that Camalier managed to restore the lock to working order and to reopen for business on September 7 and 8, an award of compensatory damages for this incident would be limited to the expense of putting the lock back into working order and any loss from delay in reopening on the 7th. See note 68, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"108\">\n<p id=\"b494-18\">.
