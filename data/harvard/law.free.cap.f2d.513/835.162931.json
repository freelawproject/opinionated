In 1969 Tufts University purchased the building but continued to lease the premises to Parlane. In 1971 and 1972 the National Institutes of Health, a subsidiary division of HEW, awarded substantial grants to Tufts under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 281 et seq. and \u00a7\u00a7 291 et seq. for personnel, equipment, alterations and renovations to expand Tufts\u2019 medical teaching facilities and to establish a Cancer Research Center. Upon receipt of the grants Tufts undertook to evict Parlane from 57 Kneeland Street in order to use the space occupied by Parlane, whose lease had expired, to fulfill the purpose of the grants. By agreement Parlane vacated one of the three floors it occupied, and in May 1973 Tufts obtained a judgment for possession of the two remaining floors and is currently occupying them for purposes of the grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-16\">In August 1971 Parlane first sought relocation assistance from HEW under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4601 et seq., but was refused such aid. It then sought a judicial declaration that it was entitled to benefits under the Act but the court dismissed its complaint and Parlane appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-17\">The statute extends assistance to persons displaced by the acquisition of real property \u201cfor a program or project undertaken by a Federal agency,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4622(a). HEW\u2019s regulations refer to \u201cdirect projects of the Department,\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.5(a), and deny aid to persons displaced by federally assisted projects of private entities, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no compelling indica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>tions that HEW\u2019s contemporaneous construction of the statute is wrong. New York Dept. of Social Services v. Dublino, 413 U.S. 405, 421, 93 S.Ct. 2507, 37 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973). The committee report states that the statute is aimed at alleviating the hardships of displacement for \u201cpublic works projects\u201d and \u201cpublic improvement programs,\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1656, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 5850, 5851\u201452; and none of the examples furnished therein (highways, reservoirs, public buildings, facilities or services, urban renewal projects, hospitals), approximate the arrangement here, which Tufts initiated and administers. <em>Cf. </em>Wahba v. New York University, 492 F.2d 96, 100 &amp; n. 3 (2d Cir. 1974). Parlane contends that the phrase \u201cfederal financial assistance\u201d appearing in the statutory definition of displaced persons, \u00a7 4601(6), and statement of policy, \u00a7 4621, demonstrates an intent to include all such projects. But we are satisfied, especially in light of the committee report, that this phrase was intended to cover only such assistance to State agencies. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1656, <em>supra </em>at 5853, 5865. Finally, Representative Ryan criticized the Act shortly before it was enacted because it \u201cdoes not cover displacement arising from construction by private institutions \u2014 such as schools and hospitals \u2014 even though they, too, may be receiving federal financial assistance,\u201d 116 Cong.Rec. 41254-55 (1970); his own bill, H.R. 609, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), which would have covered such displacement, was allowed to die in committee. Although statements of opponents of a bill may not be authorita-five, they are nevertheless relevant and useful, especially where the proponents make no response to the opponents\u2019 criticisms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Arizona v. California, 373 U.S. 546, 583 n. 85, 83 S.Ct. 1468, 10 L.Ed.2d 542 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">We might add that the interpretations sought for by appellant could lead to many difficult situations, if, for example, the federal assistance was merely supplementary to the grantee\u2019s own funds and contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-12\">. More than a year after rejecting Parlane\u2019s application HEW amended its regulations to except from this denial private entities acting as agents or contractors of the Department. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.6 (1974). The regulation unfortunately leaves these terms undefined. The term \u201ccontractor\u201d may sometimes signify any party to a contract (although there is some indication that HEW may regard the grant as a \u201cconditional gift,\u201d <em>see </em>Wahba v. New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>University, 492 F.2d 96, 100 (2d Cir. 1974)), but here it was seemingly used in a sense similar to that in the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 270a(a) (1970), to signify a person awarded a construction or repair contract for a public building or public work. The committee report indicates, H.R.Rep. No. 1656, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), <em>reprinted, in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 5850, 5853-54, that it is immaterial that a private person actually acquires, builds or holds title to the site if the facility \u201cserves the public and is regarded by the public as a public building.\u201d We think the regulation\u2019s exception is addressed to such a situation and is inapplicable here. Compare the definition of \u201cagent\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4628.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b909-17\">. Parlane cites language in a committee report made three years after enactment to the effect that HEW\u2019s failure to provide relocation assistance to it violated the original intent of the Act, H.R.Rep. No. 747, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1973) but the views of one Congress as to the meaning of statutes enacted by an earlier Congress are entitled to little if any weight. United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U.S. 157, 170, 88 S.Ct. 1994, 20 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
