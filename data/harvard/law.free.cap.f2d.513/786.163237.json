Appellants were tried for and convicted of attempted escape. Proof of and pros-ecutorial comment on the failure of the appellants from the time of apprehension to the time of trial, to apprise any official that all but one claimed to have been kidnapped by that one was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-28\">On March 9, 1973, an inspector at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia, was making his final inspection of a railroad boxcar about to exit the sally port in the prison wall when his suspicion was aroused by scratches and markings on the underside of the car. He ordered it back to the loading dock for inspection. When the doors were opened and personnel began unloading the car\u2019s cargo of mattresses packed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>cardboard boxes, ten men,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including appellants, came out from an opening in the bottomside of the car. A penitentiary officer crawled into the opening and discovered that several of the cardboard cartons on the bottom of the car had been stacked initially to form an igloo-like space over the hole. In the igloo, he found a hand saw and other saw devices, two chisels, two pocket knives, three handmade knives, a hammer, a hand drill, two flashlights, two one-dollar bills, clothing, and two remarkably authentic-looking hand guns made of wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">At the trial for attempted escape in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a), defendants Harrelson, Orsini and Chapman testified that only Chapman intended to escape.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Their collective story was that he alone arranged the mattress boxes to form the den at the inception of the boxcar\u2019s loading and he alone cut the access way in the car\u2019s bottomside. When Chapman returned to enter his hiding place just prior to the car\u2019s departure from the sidetrack loading dock, he found that the other inmate defendants had secreted themselves under the boxcars in the loading dock pit to drink some illegally brewed beer. Chapman, hearing the switch engine approaching, fearing his escape plan was about to be thwarted, and realizing that he had built a hideaway large enough for the whole group, brandished the real-looking wooden hand guns, and forced those present to precede him into the boxcar so that they couldn\u2019t reveal his plan. Two testifying \u201ckidnap victims\u201d claim that all victims entered the boxcar because they thought Chapman, known to be a violently unstable man, would shoot them if they didn\u2019t. In his testimony Chapman supported the kidnapping story but contended he was insane.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The various arguments of the individual appellants present a number of overlapping points: Harp, Haddock, Martin, Orsini, and Chapman, individually and variously, argue that the evidence was largely circumstantial and such evidence was insufficient to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, especially as to the elements of wilfulness and intent; appellants Breaux and Harp assign as error inadequate proof as to the chain of custody and condition of the items as-sertedly discovered inside the boxcar, which were admitted as government exhibits; Harp argues that the trial subjected him to double jeopardy since he had received administrative punishment at the hands of prison administrators for the same conduct; Haddock urges that the court abused its discretion in admitting, for impeachment purposes, the number and types of convictions of the defendant prisoners and their fellow prisoner witnesses; Chapman complains that the government failed to prove his sanity at the time of the attempt, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to pursue the insanity defense until it was-too late, and that the court erroneously failed to grant him a new trial on his own pro se motion; and Harp, Haddock, and Orsini complain that their constitutional right to remain silent was violated by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument comments on the defendants\u2019 failure to ever assert their innocence at any time between arrest and trial. In the context of this case, all of these contentions, save the last, are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>The point which warrants discussion is the claim of error in the prosecutor\u2019s closing comments on the inconsistency between the we-were-kidnapped defense and the failure of any defendant to even mention this condition to any official pri- or to trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Harp and Haddock, who did not testify, and Orsini, who did, argue that the trial court committed plain error in failing to grant a mistrial or severance because such comments constituted a breach of their Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Haddock further asserts that since the proof against him was largely circumstantial, the right infringed constitutional, and the evidence not overwhelming, the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The government responds that its proof and comments \u2014 that no one involved mentioned kidnapping prior to trial \u2014 were permissibly directed at the impeachment of those defendants, Har-relson, Orsini and Chapman, who took the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In this respect the government\u2019s position is correct. A defendant who elects to take the stand to explain his presence at, or participation in, the asserted criminal conduct, subjects that testimony to the impeaching effect of proof of a prior inconsistent action. McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 28 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971). Such impeachment may include proof of silence or a failure to disclose prior to trial the presently asserted explanation, where such silence or failure is clearly inconsistent with the explanation tendered. <em>See </em>Raffel v. United States, 271 U.S. 494, 496-497, 46 S.Ct. 566, 567-568, 70 L.Ed. 1054 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">In striking the balance between protecting the self-incrimination bar of the Fifth Amendment and allowing a full testing of the truth of trial testimony, this circuit has opted for a rule which reconciles both values without allowing either to exclude the other. In United States v. Ramirez, 441 F.2d 950 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 869, 92 S.Ct. 91, 30 L.Ed.2d 113, reh. den., 404 U.S. 987, 92 S.Ct. 445, 30 L.Ed.2d 371 (1971), and United States v. Quintana-Gomez, 488 F.2d 1246 (5th Cir. 1974), we interpreted the rule of Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in a manner which would permit the use of defendants\u2019 silence to impeach Harrelson, Orsini and Chapman, who testified. The Third Circuit has adopted the same view. United States ex rel. Burt v. State of New Jersey, 475 F.2d 234 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 938, 94 S.Ct. 243, 38 L.Ed.2d 165 (1973) (Douglas, Brennan, and Marshall, JJ., dissenting.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\"> The right to remain silent is a safeguard against self-incrimination. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) and Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), teach that prosecutorial comment on the exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>cise of this right violates the Constitution. However, when a defendant sponsors a defense at trial to the accusation laid against him, which common sense and good reason assert is totally inconsistent with pretrial silence of the testifying defendant or his witness, the pursuit of truth may allow penetration of what is otherwise shielded, to test the credibility of the defense he offers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">We are aware that the District of Columbia and Tenth Circuits have adopted a contrary rule. United States v. Anderson, 162 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 498 F.2d 1038 (1974); Johnson v. Patterson, 10 Cir., 475 F.2d 1066, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 878, 94 S.Ct. 64, 38 L.Ed.2d 124 (1973).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the words of Judge Breitenstein, dissenting in <em>Johnson, </em>epitomize the reasoning which supports our different view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">My position is that when a defendant testifies he may be impeached like any other witness. The use of pre-trial silence for impeachment depends on whether, in the circumstances presented, there is such inconsistency between silence and testimony as to reasonably permit the use of silence for credibility impeachment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">475 F.2d at 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Because this prosecutorial tactic makes collateral use of a constitutionally protected right, it is subject to strict scrutiny. However, in the bright, cool light of appellate hindsight this was a case in which its use was reasonably permissible. Accepting the proof in a light most favorable to conviction, as we must on our review, the jury could have found that a group escape plan was foiled by an alert guard. This elaborate escape attempt from a maximum security penitentiary required planning and execution over a long period of time in areas which were frequented by numerous prisoners. The government proved, in capsule, that several men were apprehended as they were about to ride their boxcar version of a Trojan horse through the walls of the prison. The combination kidnap-insanity defense was ingenious, but patently absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Pragmatically, we recognize that an aura of guilt is popularly associated with an accused\u2019s exercise of the right to remain silent. Therefore, this cautionary note is apropos: it is the rare and exceptional case where comment on silence is permissible. Total inconsistency is the criterion. If any rational explanation for the defendant\u2019s invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege exists, the prosecution\u2019s impeachment use of a failure to speak would be error. This safeguard assures that collateral use is for the purpose of impeaching matter the defendant has put in dispute, and not for subtly encouraging a jury to infer guilt from silence. In the peculiar circumstances of this case, the prosecutor\u2019s comment which called to the jury\u2019s attention that sound reason and common sense indicated that the testimony offered was totally inconsistent with the witnesses\u2019 prior conduct was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">The jury in this case decided that truth was not always stranger than fiction. The evidence here provided more than ample support for that conclusion. The convictions appealed from are</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-5\">. Each of the ten was individually named in a separate count of a ten-count indictment. Only six remain before the court on this appeal. The count against one defendant met with a declaration of mistrial; a second with a directed verdict of acquittal; and a third with a jury verdict of not guilty. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on the remaining counts against the other seven defendants, and all those convicted appealed. The appeal of one, Bobby Joe Harrelson, was dismissed for want of prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-10\">. Only these three of the defendants took the stand. (The appeal of Harrelson was dismissed. <em>See </em>n. 1.) Other defense testimony was elicited from non-defendant inmates of the penitentiary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b860-11\">.

United States, 472 F.2d 117 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\">. Shortly after saying that if the jury believed the duress defense then its \u201cfeeling about Santa Claus and Easter Bunny and the Good Fairy and all that . . [would be] equally acceptable,\u201d the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-9\">Now doesn\u2019t it make sense that if the facts had been like the defendants said they had been, that they would have told somebody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-10\">\u201cWarden Henderson, I had no part of this. I was forced in a boxcar by Mr. Chapman,\u201d and don't you know right down the list that they would have gotten together and said,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8o\">\u201cWarden, we didn\u2019t have anything to do with that; Mr. Henry, F.B.I. man, I had nothing to do with that. Don\u2019t prosecute me for this. I was frightened slap to death by this man Chapman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-12\">Did that happen? No, it didn\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t you know that anywhere along the line, these people 'could have gotten somebody at the prison and said,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-17\">\u201cLook, don\u2019t prosecute me for this, I was forced up in the box car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-18\">Did that happen? No, it didn\u2019t happen. When was the first time that any of that was talked about? Right in this courtroom. Right in this courtroom is when that was first talked about.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b861-19\">. Recently elaborated in Oregon v.
