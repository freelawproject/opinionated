He held that because petitioner had submitted no \u201cadequate and well-controlled\u201d studies in support of its NDA, the application was deficient on its face. Therefore there could be no genuine and substantial issue of fact outstanding which required a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">Petitioner contends that it met the threshold evidentiary requirement to entitle it to a hearing on the approvability of its NDA before final action was taken by the Commissioner. It asks this Court to order the Commissioner to hold a hearing on its NDA for Cothyrobal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">The Court grants petitioner\u2019s request. We set aside the final order of the Commissioner and remand this case to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a hearing on the approvability of petitioner\u2019s NDA 16 \u2014 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as amended<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (the Act), and the Regulations issued pursuant to the Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> establish, <em>inter alia, </em>a product pre-clearance system under which a new drug<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> may not be marketed interstate until it has been approved by the Commissioner as \u201csafe and effective\u201d for its intended use. The burden is on the sponsor of the drug to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-18\">Section 505 of the Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and pertinent Regulations <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> set forth the procedure by which a drug manufacturer can have a new drug approved for marketing in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-19\">Section 505(b)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> requires an NDA to be submitted to FDA. This application must include reports of investigations regarding safety and effectiveness, a statement of the composition and components of the drug, a description of the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of such drug, samples of the drug, and specimens of labeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-20\">Section 505(d)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> sets forth the grounds on which the Commissioner can refuse to approve an NDA. One of these grounds, on which Cothyrobal\u2019s NDA was determined to be deficient,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is that the sponsor has failed to submit \u201csubstantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-21\">The section further defines \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">A Regulation issued by FDA<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> defines the form such investigations should take. This form includes a \u201cplan or protocol\u201d setting forth the objective of the study, an adequate method of selecting appropriate subjects, an explanation of the methods of observation and steps taken to minimize bias, a provision for comparison by one of four \u201crecognized\u201d methods of the results of treatment or diagnosis with a control, and a summary of the methods of analysis, including any appropriate statistical method. Provision is made for the waiver of any or all of these requirements, if justified, upon petition for waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">Three of the four \u201crecognized\u201d methods of comparison for testing the effectiveness of a new drug consist of comparing the results of patients treated with the new drug with other patients (1) not receiving any treatment, or (2) receiving placebos, or (3) receiving non-drug therapy. The fourth method, used in testing the effectiveness of a new drug for diseases of high and predictable mortality, involves comparing the progress of the disease in patients treated with the new drug with \u201cprior experience historically derived from the adequately documented natural history of the disease or condition . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">The Regulation also states that \u201cuncontrolled studies or partially controlled studies are not acceptable as the sole basis for the approval of claims of effectiveness.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-12\">On May 19, 1969, Edison submitted to FDA an NDA for its drug, Cothyrobal,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which is a combination of thyroid extract (levothyroxine) and vitamin B12 (cyano-cobalamin) and recommended for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, and for patients who became thyro-toxic with other types of thyroid medication. Petitioner claims that by combining thyroid extract with vitamin B12, the toxic effect of large doses of levothyroxine is overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-13\">By letter dated December 1, 1969, the Commissioner denied the NDA on the ground that the information submitted in its support was inadequate under Section 505(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-14\">On December 24, 1969, Dr. Murray Israel, the inventor of Cothyrobal, and petitioner Edison Pharmaceutical Company filed an antitrust suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> against Baxter Laboratories, Travenol Laboratories (a subsidiary of Baxter), Dr. David Kritchevsky, a consultant to FDA who was associated with Baxter, and Dr. Marion Finkel, an employee of FDA. The complaint alleged that defendants had conspired to keep Cothyrobal off the market and out of competition with Choloxin, a similar drug sold by Baxter and Travenol pursuant to an approved NDA, by influencing FDA to deny fair consideration to the NDA for Cothyrobal filed by plaintiffs. The District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that this case was exempt from the antitrust laws <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>On appeal<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> this Court held in a prior opinion that the complaint, on its face, stated a cause of action,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and we remanded all issues to the District Court. We directed that Court to remand the question of safety and efficacy of Cothy-robal to the FDA since it has primary jurisdiction over the approval of drugs for interstate sale. But we instructed the Court to retain jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action so that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-4\">if . plaintiffs do not then obtain full and fair consideration by the FDA as to the safety and efficacy of their drug Cothyrobal for interstate sale, they may obtain a full hearing in the District Court on all their allegations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">This Court made it clear that \u201c[t]he essential is that the plaintiffs have a full and fair presentation of all their contentions before an impartial tribunal.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">Thereafter petitioner requested that its NDA for Cothyrobal be reactivated. It submitted no additional information in support of its application. After review by FDA personnel unconnected with the initial review of petitioner\u2019s NDA in 1969,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the application was again found not approvable by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-15\">Edison requested an opportunity to file its NDA over protest. The effect of this was to have the NDA re-examined by still another group of FDA personnel.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Again it was found not ap-provable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-16\">On June 28, 1973, the Commissioner published in the Federal Register<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This Notice stated the Commissioner\u2019s intention to deny petitioner\u2019s NDA, the grounds for the decision, and petitioner\u2019s opportunity for a hearing \u201con the question of whether such application is ap-provable\u201d before the final order would be issued. The Notice warned that \u201ca request for a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that a genuine and substantial issue of fact requires a hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Without such showing, the Commissioner may deny an NDA without a hearing.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-17\">In response to this Notice a written appearance and request for a hearing was submitted by Edward \u201cWhitey\u201d Ford, a member of the Board of Directors of the Vascular Research Foundation on behalf of himself and over two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>hundred other individuals, together with letters of a testimonial nature relating to Cothyrobal from each of these individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">A written appearance and request for a hearing was also submitted by Edison. The request was accompanied by no new data. It consisted of medical and legal arguments as to why data previously submitted met the requirements for approval of NDA 16 \u2014 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">Upon review the Commissioner decided and stated in his final order of October 26, 1973, that the requests contained no new data which would in any way correct any of the deficiencies which had been noted in the Federal Register.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">Accordingly the Commissioner concluded that there was a lack of substantial evidence that Cothyrobal has the effect it purports or is represented to have for its intended use; that the legal arguments were insubstantial; and that petitioner had failed to set forth specific facts showing that there was a genuine and substantial issue of fact in dispute requiring a hearing. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">Petitioner is not challenging the validity of the procedure for approving NDA\u2019s. Nor is it challenging FDA\u2019s summary judgment procedure whereby an NDA may be rejected without a hearing if it does not contain the information required by Section 505(b). Instead petitioner contends that its submission more than meets what it characterizes as the \u201cthreshold evidentiary requirement\u201d established by Hynson, Westcott and Dunning v. Richardson, 461 F.2d 215 (4th Cir. 1972), affirmed as modified on another issue<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> sub nom. Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, 412 U.S. 609, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973), thereby entitling it to a hearing on the approvability of its NDA.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-12\"><em>Hynson </em>involved the drug, Lutrexin,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> which had been approved by FDA in 1952 when the Act required only a showing of safety. After the Act was amended in 1962 to require a showing of effectiveness as well as safety, Hynson\u2019s NDA was withdrawn<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> without a hearing because the clinical studies submitted to demonstrate Lutrexin\u2019s effectiveness were not \u201cadequate and well-controlled.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Thus the Commissioner held in <em>Hynson, </em>as he has held here, that since the clinical studies were not \u201cadequate and well-controlled,\u201d substantial evidence of effectiveness was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>lacking, and the NDA was deficient on its face. Therefore there could be no genuine issue of fact in dispute requiring a hearing before denying the NDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\">The Fourth Circuit reversed the Commissioner, however, holding that the standard of proof required to secure the right to a hearing is less than that required to prove effectiveness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-5\">Neither due process nor the Administrative Practice (sic) Act permits an arbitrary denial in any case where it can be fairly said there are \u201cgenuine and substantial issues of fact\u201d in dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-6\"># :}: * * <em>% </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-7\">Only if it can be fairly said that the clinical tests and medical studies and investigations submitted by the applicant, <em>if credited and accepted </em>(emphasis added), will not support a finding that they provide \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of effectiveness was it proper for the Commissioner to deny the appellant a hearing <em>before </em>entering a final order of withdrawal.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">The Court then noted that \u201cno qualified expert has given an opinion that Lutrexin is ineffective for the uses intended,\u201d and that the Commissioner, in pointing out the deficiencies in the investigations submitted by Hynson, \u201cdid not impugn the competency or qualifications of the scientists and medical experts whose investigations were cited by the appellant in support of its claim.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Therefore</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-16\"><em>[ajssuming that all the objections by the Commissioner </em>to these clinical studies, conducted as they were by competent medical authorities, <em>may have some validity </em>(emphasis added), they do not justify a final conclusion, made <em>ex parte, </em>without a hearing, that it \u201cclearly appears\u201d that there is no genuine issue of fact on the effectiveness of Lutrexin, which is the test under the Commissioner\u2019s own regulation for denial of a hearing; at most they merely create a genuine question of fact to be resolved at a hearing upon proper evidence.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-17\">On certiorari, the Supreme Court upheld FDA\u2019s summary judgment procedure for NDA\u2019s.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> It more precisely defined those circumstances in which it might be determined that it \u201cclearly appears\u201d that there is no genuine issue of fact in dispute as being occasions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-18\">where it is apparent at the threshold that the applicant has not tendered <em>any evidence </em>which <em>on its face </em>meets the statutory standards as particularized by the regulations. . . .We cannot impute to Congress the design of requiring, nor does due process demand, a hearing when it appears conclusively from the applicant\u2019s \u201cplead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>ings\u201d that the application cannot succeed.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">The Court then set forth the scope of review of an order denying a hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqfD\">In reviewing an order of the Commissioner denying a hearing, a court of appeals must determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s findings accurately reflect the study in question and if they do, whether the deficiencies he finds conclusively render the study inadequate or uncontrolled in light of the pertinent regulations.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">But then the Court, without any discussion of the studies submitted by Hyn-son or the question of how accurately the Commissioner had discussed the studies in his findings, affirmed the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision that Hynson\u2019s submission was sufficient to warrant a hearing.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus the Supreme Court, like the Fourth Circuit, said that even granting the validity of the Commissioner\u2019s objections to Hynson\u2019s investigations, Hynson\u2019s NDA would still survive \u201csummary judgment\u201d and be entitled to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">In the case at bar, petitioner submitted five clinical studies in support of its NDA for Cothyrobal. Like the submission in <em>Hynson, </em>these studies were deemed deficient by the Commissioner because none was \u201cadequate and well-controlled\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">Three of these studies the Commissioner characterized as anecdotal, and therefore insufficient by themselves to demonstrate effectiveness. At best they might provide corroboration for well-controlled studies.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The two remaining studies were found to contain several major deficiencies. Neither study verified any of its subjects as hypothyroid, even though one of the problems for which Cothyrobal was recommended was hypothyroidism; subjects received oral thyroid as well as injections of Cothyro-bal, thereby making the evaluation of the effects of Cothyrobal difficult; and there was no control group employed. In the Commissioner\u2019s words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-11\">There are no well-controlled studies using blind and double-blind cross-over and randomnization techniques or any other kind of control specified in 21 CFR 130.12(a)(5)(ii), so that neither the clinical nor statistical significance of the reported results can be evaluated.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-12\">Petitioner contended in his request for a hearing as it has contended before us that such studies comparing the use of Cothyrobal, levothyroxine, and cyanoco-balamin in separate groups of subjects would involve a \u201crisk of death to patients\u201d already taking the thyroid extract, levothyroxine. Thus even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>its studies may have been technically deficient under Section 505(d), they were \u201cas scientifically sound and objective as it was humanly possible to make.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\">In his final order the Commissioner dismissed petitioner\u2019s claim that double-blind studies might be dangerous to subjects by saying that \u201ctextbook medicine\u201d demonstrates \u201cthat the L-thyroxine dosage contained in Co-Thyro-Bal is not ordinarily toxic.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Petitioner does not deny that the amount of levothyroxine in Cothyrobal could be safely administered to a control group. But it points out that most patients taking injections of Cothyrobal are also taking oral thyroid. Therefore the amount of levothyroxine which a control group would take would equal the sum of levothyroxine in Cothyrobal <em>and </em>the oral thyroid already being taken.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> It is this amount of thyroid extract which petitioner claims would be toxic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">This illustrates the inability of the parties to come to grips with the essential issue in this case. If the petitioner had been given a hearing, it is at least more likely that it could have made its point more clearly. At least it could have been given the attention it deserves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">The Commissioner did not consider the toxicity of this combined amount of levo-thyroxine in his final order. Instead he attempted to circumvent the issue by saying that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-13\">it should be stressed . . . that whether such toxicity exists or not and <em>whether a study of the L-thyroxine alone would be dangerous or not is in part irrelevant, </em>since the Commissioner finds that not even an adequate and well-controlled study comparing <em>Co-Thyro-Bal itself with a placebo has been </em>performed<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1143-15\">From this statement, repeated four times in FDA\u2019s brief<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and at oral argument, we inferred that if Edison had conducted a test comparing Cothyrobal with a placebo, and the test had demonstrated effectiveness, it would have been sufficient to at least entitle petitioner to a hearing. For then it could not be said, under <em>Hynson, </em>that Edison had not \u201ctendered <em>any evidence </em>which <em>on its face </em>(met) the statutory standards.\u201d <footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Upon questioning, however, government counsel informed us that such a test would not have been enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-16\">Thus it appears to us that the factual question of whether the double-blind tests comparing levothyroxine and Cothyrobal are too dangerous to perform is still \u201crelevant.\u201d Indeed, we deem this a sufficiently material fact in dispute to require an evidentiary hearing on Edison\u2019s NDA before the Commissioner may issue a final order. The Commissioner cannot have it both ways. Either the double-blind tests comparing Cothyrobal with a placebo would be sufficient so that the question of whether levothyroxine <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> alone is toxic is irrelevant, or such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>tests would not be sufficient, in which case whether tests comparing Cothyrobal and levothyroxine are \u201chumanly possible\u201d becomes not only relevant, but also an issue of material fact in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Therefore, for the aforementioned reasons, we hold that the threshold question whether it is \u201chumanly possible\u201d to acquire evidence which meets the statutory standards (as interpreted by FDA regulations) requires a full evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">We also find it appropriate to re-, quire the Commissioner to hold a full evidentiary hearing on <em>all </em>relevant issues relating to the approvability of petitioner\u2019s application, whichever way he decides the threshold issue. In so doing we are not establishing a new requirement for a full hearing whenever only a threshold issue is in dispute. We are mindful of the fact, noticed by the Supreme Court in Hynson'<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> that if FDA were required automatically to hold a hearing on every NDA it would not have time to carry out its statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">We make an exception here only because of the facts of this case. Petitioner first filed NDA 16-865 over six years ago. In the interim its application has been denied on three separate occasions without an opportunity for hearing despite direction to the contrary from this Court.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> By requiring the Commissioner to hold a full evidentiary hearing on all relevant issues relating to petitioner\u2019s NDA, even if he decides against petitioner on the threshold issue, we enable this Court on review finally to bring this proceeding to a close.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-12\">We are re-enforced in our decision by the fact that between May 8, 1970, when FDA\u2019s summary judgment regulations went into effect, and April 4, 1973, when the government submitted its reply brief in <em>Hynson, the Commissioner had not granted a single request for a hearing on an NDA.</em><footnotemark><em>50</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Even after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hynson, </em>which was cited by petitioner in its request for a hearing,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> the Commissioner still denied Edison\u2019s request for a hearing. In our eyes this failure to grant a hearing to any applicant<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> casts doubt upon the good faith we would ordinarily impute without question to a decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">.

Were we required to reach these issues, there might well be serious doubt whether the Commissioner\u2019s rigorous threshold specifications as to proof of \u2018adequate and well-controlled investigations,\u2019 coupled with his restrictive summary judgment regulation, go beyond the statutory requirements and in effect frustrate the congressional mandate for a prewithdrawal \u2018opportunity for hearing.\u2019 \u201d 412 U.S. at 638, 93 S.Ct. at 2487.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">. 412 U.S. at 620-621, 93 S.Ct. at 2479. The Court added in a footnote that \u201c[t]his applies, of course, only to those regulations that are precise. For example, the plan or protocol for a study must include \u2018[a] summary of the methods of analysis and an evaluation of data derived from the study including any appropriate statistical methods.\u2019 21 CFR \u00a7 130.-12(a)(5)(ii)(a)(5). A mere reading of the study submitted will indicate whether the study is totally deficient in this regard. Some of the regulations, however, are not precise, as they call for the exercise of discretion or subjective judgment in determining whether a study is adequate and well controlled. For example, \u00a7 130.12(a)(5)(ii)(a)(2)(i) requires that the plan or protocol for the study include a method of selection of the subjects that provide <em>\u2018adequate </em>assurance that they are suitable for the purposes of the study.\u2019 The qualitative standards \u2018adequate\u2019 and \u2018suitable\u2019 do not lend themselves to clear-cut definition, and it may not be possible to tell from the face of a study whether the standards have been met.
