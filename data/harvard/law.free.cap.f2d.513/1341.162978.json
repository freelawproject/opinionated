Skarstrom for his \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Fractionating Gasseous Mixtures by Adsorption.\u201d Skarstrom came upon his method by some clever experimenting and modification of the apparatus he was using for a similar purpose when it broke down.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-17\">Admirable as Dr. Skarstrom\u2019s work may have been, it was done without knowledge of prior similar work of a German physicist named Kahle. We agree with Judge Blumenfeld that Kahle\u2019s work, not cited to the Patent Office at the time of Skarstrom\u2019s application, contains substantially all the elements of Skarstrom\u2019s device, both individually and in combination. For that reason, Skarstrom\u2019s patent does not satisfy the requirement of nonobviousness established by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. See Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). We therefore affirm on the thorough and well-reasoned opinion of Judge Blumen-feld reported at 379 F.Supp. 205 (D.Conn.1974).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
