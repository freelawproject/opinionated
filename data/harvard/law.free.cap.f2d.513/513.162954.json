The government appeals suppression by the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we believe that facial insufficiency in this case was an insubstantial violation of the Act, we reverse the district court\u2019s order and remand the case for consideration of other grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>for suppression not yet reached by. the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The district court for the Western District of Pennsylvania approved wiretap applications on December 9, and December 23, 1971. The applications submitted by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Justice Department were accompanied by authorization orders for electronic surveillance signed by Henry Petersen. Petersen was then Acting Assistant Attorney General.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A series of later applications dated January 18, 25 and February 9, 1972 showed authorization by Petersen who had subsequently been confirmed as Assistant Attorney General by the Senate.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">As a result of information derived from this surveillance, Anthony Aeon and three other defendants were indicted for conspiracy to conduct illegal gam-blings, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1955, and Aeon and five other defendants were indicted for conspiracy to obstruct the enforcement of Pennsylvania criminal laws, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1511. Defendants moved to suppress the evidence derived from the wiretaps on various grounds, only-one of .which was addressed by the district court\u2019s narrowly drawn opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-14\">At the suppression hearing, the government presented affidavits and inter-office memoranda from both Petersen and former Attorney General John Mitchell. A March 4, 1973 affidavit from Mitchell states that although the authorization order was signed by Petersen, Mitchell had in fact given the authorization. A series of memoranda dated prior to each wiretap application, initialed by Mitchell, and giving approval for the wiretap, was introduced at the suppression hearing in support of Mitchell\u2019s more recent affidavit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Henry Pet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ersen also submitted an affidavit which stated that, although he had reviewed the supporting papers, Mitchell had in fact given approval in each case. Petersen\u2019s signature was affixed only after Mitchell\u2019s approval of each application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Although defendants challenged the allegedly institutional character of Mitchell\u2019s approval under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i), the district court did not reach this issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The suppression order was based solely on grounds of facial insufficiency under \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(ii).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Congress set out detailed procedures for obtaining electronic surveillance approval in Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(1)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides that the Attorney Genera! or a specially designated Assistant Attorney General must authorize every wiretap application submitted for approval to the district court. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518, in turn, sets out the information which must be contained in the application. \u00a7\u00a7 2518(1)(a) and 2518(4)(d), for example, specifically require that the identity o'f the authorizing officer be stated in the application. Suppression of evidence derived from electronic surveillance is allowed when the communication has been unlawfully intercepted, \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i), or when the order of authorization or approval is insufficient on its face, \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(ii).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Defendants assert that an <em>acting </em>assistant attorney general cannot be designated specially under \u00a7 2516(1) to authorize wiretaps. With this point, we agre\u00e9. Defendants argue further that any authorization order <em>signed </em>by an improper person is facially insufficient and, therefore, subject to suppression under \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(ii). They assert that suppression for facial insufficiency is required even if authorization was actually given by a person properly qualified under \u00a7 2516(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">In light of the technical nature of this facial insufficiency, we cannot agree that suppression is required under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">DESIGNATION TO AUTHORIZE UNDER \u00a7 2516(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 40 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974), the Supreme Court held that only the Attorney General and the nine assistant attorneys general who were \u201cresponsive to the political process . . \u201d could authorize wiretaps under \u00a7 2516(1). 416 U.S. at 520, 94 S.Ct. 1820 citing S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2nd Sess. 96-97 (1968), 2 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News, p. 2185 (1968). \u201cPolitical responsiveness\u201d in the Court\u2019s view, was achieved by presidential appointment and Senate confirmation, 416 U.S. at 520 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. 1820. In <em>Giordano, </em>improper authorization by the attorney general\u2019s executive assistant rendered the interception unlawful and subject to suppression under \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i). According to the Court, Congress sought to restrict the use of electronic surveillance by restricting the power to authorize wiretaps to a small group of senior Justice Department officials. Violations of the significant provision, therefore, were sufficient to warrant suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">In the present case, the government argues that an acting assistant attorney general is not the same as the attorney general\u2019s executive assistant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although for other purposes this may be true, we cannot agree in this context. Congress has created a very narrow and specific authorization power. An acting assistant attorney general is not mentioned in the statute. Neither does an acting assistant attorney general meet the Supreme Court\u2019s test of political responsiveness. As such, an acting assistant attorney general who has not been appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, may not be designated specially to authorize wiretaps under \u00a7 2516(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">FACIAL SUFFICIENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">In the instant case, however, we are not dealing with an <em>authorization </em>by an acting assistant attorney general. We are dealing with a <em>signature </em>on the authorization order placed there by an unqualified person.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-17\">In United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S. 562, 94 S.Ct. 1849, 40 L.Ed.2d 380 (1974), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the Supreme Court held that where the attorney general had authorized a wiretap, suppression was not required merely because the authorization was signed by someone else. The Court in <em>Chavez </em>clearly distinguished between suppression under \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i) and (10)(a)(ii). Neither (i) nor (ii) supplied grounds for suppression in <em>Chavez. </em>The Court held that misidentification of the authorizing officer violated the identification requirements of \u00a7 2518(l)(a) and \u00a7 2518(4)(d). Because the purpose of these sections was merely to fix responsibility, they did \u201cnot establish a substantive role to be played in the regulatory system.\u201d <em>Chavez, </em>416 U.S. at 578, 94 S.Ct. at 1857. As such the violation was technical; the interception was not unlawful and suppressable under (10)(a)(i) since the authorization had been given by a person qualified under \u00a7 2516(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The Court also specified that the authorization order was sufficient on its face since the signatory, assistant attorney general, Will Wilson, could have been designated specially to authorize under \u00a7 2516(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The instant case is clearly distinguishable from <em>Chavez, </em>however. Here the defendants attack not misidentification under (10)(a)(i) but the facial sufficiency under (10)(a)(ii) of an order signed by an improper person.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\"><em>Giordano </em>and <em>Chavez </em>recognize that suppression under (10)(a)(i) is not required for every technical violation. Only \u201cwhere there is failure to satisfy any of those statutory requirements that directly and substantially implement the congressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures,\u201d <em>Giordano, </em>416 U.S. at 527, 94 S.Ct. at 1832, is suppression required under \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i). Defendant-appellees argue that \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(ii), in contrast, applies irrespective of whether substantial limitations of the Act are violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">In support of this point, they cite language from <em>Giordano: </em>\u201cParagraphs (ii) and (iii) [of \u00a7 2518(10)(a)] must be deemed to provide suppression for failure to observe some statutory requirements that would not render interceptions unlawful under paragraph (i).\u201d 416 U.S. at 527, 94 S.Ct. at 1832. This language does imply that paragraphs (ii) and (iii) must reach violations of some provisions of Title III which do not directly and substantially implement the congressional intent to limit use of wiretaps. Despite this intention to extend (10)(a)(ii) further than (10)(a)(i), we do not conclude that suppression is required for every minor facial insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-17\">There is a distinction in the kinds of information which must be supplied to the approving judge. Clearly, the name of the authorizing officer is less important than statements of fact which must be submitted under \u00a7 2518(l)(b). Unless the judge is properly apprised of the facts, he cannot make an appropriate probable cause determination as required by \u00a7 2518(3). In contrast, the name of the authorizing officer is not as likely to affect the judge\u2019s determination that a wiretap is or is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-18\">In <em>Giordano </em>and <em>Chavez, </em>the Supreme Court examined affidavits which varied the submitted identification information. Clearly, an aggrieved party may impeach the information submitted by the government to the approving court. In <em>Giordano, </em>this occurred. In <em>Chavez, </em>however, the government was allowed to vary the identification information after it had been shown by the party- attacking the wiretap that the signatory had not in fact given approval. The government was then allowed to show that a proper party, then Attorney General Mitchell, had approved the wiretap. That the government was allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>vary the identification information submitted to the approving court, supports our conclusion that this requirement is less important than others. The government certainly would not be allowed to amplify the facts presented on the face of the affidavit to the district court in order to improve the district court\u2019s finding of probable cause, United States v. Ceraso, 467 F.2d 647, 653 (3d Cir., 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">We perceive a distinction between information which the government may vary by subsequent affidavit and information which must stand on the four corners of the affidavit. Based on this difference, we conclude that suppression is not required for facial insufficiency relating to less critical requirements which may be varied by subsequent affidavits. The identification directives in our opinion fall within this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Although the identification requirements were designed to fix responsibility on the person actually authorizing the wiretap,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Justice Department practice regrettably has frustrated this purpose. During Mitchell\u2019s tenure as Attorney General the person signing the authorization order had rarely authorized the wiretap; and quite often even the person whose name appeared on the order had not actually signed it. Instead anonymous assistants affixed a name in what had become a purely ministerial act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In United States v. Ceraso, 467 F.2d 647, 649 (3d Cir., 1972), for example, this court did not disapprove an order to which the assistant attorney general\u2019s name had been affixed by an underling. Thus, if Petersen had signed Mitchell\u2019s name rather than his own, earlier cases would mandate rejection of a (10)(a)(ii) suppression motion. We do not feel that a different result should obtain merely because Petersen signed his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Support for our view that (10)(a)(ii) suppression is not required for every minor insufficiency is derived from a recent Second' Circuit case. In United States v. Cirillo, 499 F.2d 872 (2nd Cir., 1974), cert. denied 419 U.S. 1056, 95 S.Ct. 638, 42 L.Ed.2d 653 (1974),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>state and federal law enforcement officials joined to investigate an organization of narcotics dealers. Wiretap approval was secured from a New York state court. Despite the fact that the New York wiretap statute requires minimization directive to be included in every wiretap order, the Second Circuit refused to overturn a federal conviction based on wiretap evidence derived from an order failing to include such a directive. The court accepted affidavits from officers who executed the order stating that minimization had occurred despite the absence of a minimization order. Although the wiretap order was facially insufficient, suppression was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The court, in an opinion by Judge Mansfield, concluded that the defect was technical since there had been substantial compliance with the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 499 F.2d at 880 citing Smith v. United States, 360 U.S. 1, 79 S.Ct. 991, 3 L.Ed.2d 1041 (1959) (deficiencies are technical where no substantial rights are involved.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In this case we believe the facial insufficiency was technical for two reasons. Mitchell had actually approved the wiretap so that there was substantial compliance with the statute. Only the less crucial identification requirements were actually breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">For the foregoing reasons the district court\u2019s order of suppression will be reversed and the case remanded for consideration of the other grounds for suppression not yet reached by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-18\">. United States v. Acon, 377 F.Supp. 649 (W.D., Pa. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">. The district court did not reach suppression motions alleging an absence of probable cause to approve the initial wiretap application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\">. On the December 9 authorization, Henry Petersen\u2019s title was improperly given as Assistant Attorney General rather than <em>Acting </em>Assistant Attorney General. The government argues that because he was called an Assistant Attorney General in the December 9 order, that order was not facially insufficient. We decline to make any distinction on the basis of what Petersen was called. He was an acting officer and the sufficiency of the order will be judged accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\">.

Petersen\u2019s sworn affidavit, dated March 15, 1973, describes a procedure whereby special units of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Justice Department requested wiretaps. The requests were processed through various levels of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department. The affidavit states, based on staff recommendations, the Attorney General approved each wiretap. Petersen then signed the order submitted to the district court at the Attorney General\u2019s request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b587-10\">.

The government argues that unless vacancies can be filled by fully qualified persons, the government will grind to a halt while Senate approval is pending. This argument ignores the fact that there are nine assistant attorneys general and the fact that this statute is very specific in its limitations. The logic of Title III need not necessarily apply to all activities by an acting assistant attorney general. Several district court opinions have held that an acting officer is outside the scope of \u00a7 2516(1). United States v. Narducci, 341 F.Supp. 1107 (E.D.Pa., 1972), United States v.

United States v. Robertson, 504 F.2d 289 (5th Cir., 1974). The Court in <em>Robertson </em>considered only the issue of misidenti-fication as a suppression ground under (10)(a)(i). Suppression for facial insufficiency under (10)(a)(ii) was not raised in that opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b590-6\">. In <em>Chavez, </em>the Supreme Court explored the purposes of the identification requirements. Although made in the context of (10)(a)(i), the analysis is also relevant to (10)(a)(ii).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">Requiring identification of the authorizing official in the application facilitates the court\u2019s ability to conclude that the application has been properly approved under \u00a7 2516; requiring identification in the court\u2019s order also serves to \u201cfix responsibility\u201d for the source of preliminary approval. This information contained in the application and order further aids the judge in making reports required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2519. That section requires the judge who issues or denies an interception order to report his action and certain information about the application, including the \u201cidentity of . . . the person authorizing the application,\u201d within 30 days, to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, \u00a7 2519(l)(f). An annual report of the authorizing officials designated in \u00a7 2516 must also be filed with that body, and is to contain the same information with respect to each application made as is required of the issuing or denying judge, \u00a7 2519(2)(a). Finally, a summary of the information filed by the judges acting on applications and the prosecutors approving their submission is to be filed with Congress in April of each year by the Administrative Office, \u00a7 2519(3). The purpose of these reports is \u201cto form the basis for a public evaluation\u201d of the operation of Title III and to \u201cassure the community that the system of court-order[ed] electronic surveillance ... is properly administered. . . . \u201d S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 107. While adherence to the identification reporting requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 2518(1)(a) and (4)(d) thus can simplify the assurance that those who Title III makes responsible for determining when and how wiretapping and electronic surveillance should be conducted have fulfilled their roles in each case, they do not establish a substantive role to be played in the regulatory system.
