It is the successor in interest to a prior corporation of the same name which operated the steamship business in 1962 (both corporations are referred to herein as plaintiff or taxpayer).</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-23\">Plaintiff originally filed suit to recover an alleged overpayment of its Federal income tax for tax years 1958 through 1962. The claims for the years 1958 through 1961 were settled by the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>and dismissed by a stipulation filed with the court on February 8, 1974. The settlement also disposed of all issues raised by the taxpayer with respect to its tax liability for 1962, other than the single issue presented here for resolution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">The specific issue presently confronting us is whether certain vessels constitute property \u201cthe construction * * * of which is completed by the taxpayer after December 31, 1961\u201d in accordance with section 48(b)(1) so that plaintiff is entitled only to a limited tax credit, or whether the investment credit for these ships should be measured by plaintiff\u2019s entire basis in the vessels pursuant to section 48(b)(2). Since we find that the vessels in question were not constructed \u201cby the taxpayer\u201d within the purview of section 48(b)(1) and instead were property \u201cacquired after December 31, 1961\u201d under section 48(b)(2), plaintiff wag entitled to compute its investment tax credit based on the entire basis in the vessels. It may, therefore, recover on its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-6\">There is little, if any, dispute as to the facts which are material to the resolution of the legal issues. Plaintiff operates a' fleet of 21 vessels of the Gulf Pride class built under the construction-differential subsidy (CDS) program established by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, ch. 858, \u00a7\u00a7 501-09, 49 Stat. 1995, as amended, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151-1161. The CDS program has been administered at various times by the Federal Maritime Board (FMB) and the Maritime Administration (MARAD), and these agencies are sometimes collectively referred to herein as Maritime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The program was designed to put American shipowners on equal footing with their foreign counterparts. The Government subsidy covers the difference between the amount it costs an American operator to get his ship built in the United States and what its foreign competitors would have to pay for a similar ship constructed by a foreign shipbuilder. At the time of the construction of the vessels in question, the subsidy normally totaled 50-55 percent of the actual construction costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-10\">In return for the payment of the construction subsidy, the Government exercises certain controls over the construction projects. Prior to the award of a construction subsidy, Government approval of the design of the new vessels and its determination, among other, things, that such new vessels will aid in the promotion of the foreign commerce of the United States are required. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(a). A Government finding that the vessels will be suitable for use in national defense, if required, is also a prerequisite to the subsidy award. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(b). Maritime maintains an Office of Ship Construction, which reviews the financial, economic, and technical data and presentations that are submitted by prospective shipowners in support of CDS applications. To discharge these functions, the Office contains a qualified and competent technical staff, including architects and engineering specialists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-11\">This case involves four vessels, the <em>Leslie Lykes, </em>the <em>Brinton Lykes, </em>the <em>Shirley Lykes, </em>and the <em>Marjorie Lykes, </em>which were constructed under the CDS program. The circumstances leading to the construction of these vessels began in the early 1950\u2019s. At the start of the Korean War, the American Merchant Marine was composed primarily of ships built prior to or during World War II. Anticipating that the nation\u2019s fleet would soon be obsolete, Maritime began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>various programs to replace and modernize the fleet. In 1950, the Government began construction of a number of cargo vessels under the designation known as the \u201cMariner.\u201d These vessels had the largest cargo designation (C4) and were capable of surface speeds of 20 knots or more. After the ships were built by the Government, they were ultimately sold or leased. Shortly thereafter, Maritime\u2019s staff devised and prepared plans, specifications, and designs for a number of cargo vessels, including a designation called the \u201cClipper,\u201d which was to be the replacement for the medium-sized C2 and C3 class vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-4\">Starting in 1954, Maritime asked plaintiff and other shippers to comment on the suitability of the \u201cMariner\u201d and the \u201cClipper\u201d as replacement vessels for their fleets. Plaintiff advised Maritime that neither design was satisfactory and countered with a suggestion for a more acceptable replacement vessel. Although the counterproposal was of the same general character as the Maritime \u201cClipper\u201d proposal, it differed from it in nearly every respect except for the type of machinery and the number of passengers it could hold. The major differences were in the beam, the horsepower, and the normal sea speed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s initial proposal (as well as the ship finally constructed) was essentially a different vessel from that originally suggested by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\">While not rejecting plaintiff\u2019s proposal out of hand, Maritime informed plaintiff in mid-1955 that the data and specifications presented on the proposed vessel lacked the detail necessary for a decision on plaintiff\u2019s application for CDS. Maritime recommended that plaintiff obtain expert assistance for this purpose, whereupon plaintiff retained Gibbs and Cox as its naval architects to prepare the necessary design and specification work. In December 1955, plaintiff applied to Maritime for CDS and supported the application by an \u201coutline specification\u201d which had been prepared by Gibbs and Cox. Although these plans did not contain sufficient detail for bids or construction by a shipyard sufficient data was provided to define the type and quality of ship suitable for plaintiff\u2019s needs and to enable Maritime to determine whether such a vessel was acceptable to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s proposed vessel had 8,500 horsepower, with a maximum sustained speed capability of 16.7 knots. In February 1956, Maritime and plaintiff met in Washington, D.C. to discuss this portion of plaintiff\u2019s proposal. At this meeting Maritime continued to adhere to its original 18-knot speed requirement by invited plaintiff to offer further submissions demonstrating that 18 knots was not a necessary requirement for plaintiff\u2019s particular trade. In November 1956, on the basis of facts submitted by plaintiff, a compromise was made in which Maritime agreed to a vessel with a 17.5-knot speed capacity and 9,000 horsepower. In a letter to plaintiff dated November 30, 1956, Maritime supplemented a recitation of the terms of the speed and horsepower agreement with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1417-9\">* * * [I]t is to be understood that the said action does not constitute approval of the basic design in its entirety, but is limited to the speed question. It remains incumbent upon you to have your design agent submit 12 sets of a complete preliminary design at the earliest possible date in order that the Office of Ship Construction and Repair may advise the Federal Maritime Board, from an engineering standpoint, with respect to the adequacy of the revised design on an overall basis in relation to the needs of the service, and so that the appropriate other Offices of the Maritime Administration may furnish their comments to the Federal Maritime Board with respect to said revised design.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>After a compromise was reached concerning the speed and horsepower requirement, Maritime approved the application for CDS for five vessels, subject to further approval of the bidding or contract plans and specification to be developed by Gibbs and Cox. When the contract plans and specifications were submitted, Maritime critically reviewed them through various interdepartmental committees, and this examination generated almost 400 adverse comments. These comments were the subject of further discussions resulting in compromises which were ultimately approved by Maritime. Thereafter, the contract plans and specifications were used to invite construction bids from domestic shipyards, and Maritime determined the eligibility and responsibility of each bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">The construction contracts for the four ships involved in this case were awarded to the Bethlehem Steel Company and its subsidiary, the Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard, Inc. (hereinafter collectively referred to as Bethlehem) for construction in the shipyard located at Sparrows Point, Maryland. The vessels were constructed under two contracts: one entered into in 1958 (FMB-83), for the <em>Leslie Lykes, </em>and the other signed in 1960 (FMB-122) covering the other three vessels. Both contracts were three-party arrangements among the United States, represented by the Federal Maritime Board, taxpayer, and the shipbuilder. Under the contracts, Bethlehem undertook to furnish all labor and materials and to perform all work necessary to construct, complete and deliver (at its own risk and expense) the vessels called for in the contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The contract \u201cSpecifications\u201d approved by Maritime defined the vessel\u2019s performance characteristics and the type of materials to be used for construction. The \u201cPlans\u201d found in the approved contract set forth the approximate layout of the ships\u2019 hulls, decks, and compartments. However, the \u201cPlans and Specifications\u201d were insufficient to enable the shipyard employees actually to construct the vessels; instead, Bethlehem was required to rely on \u201cworking plans\u201d in the actual building of the vessels. The \u201cworking plans\u201d provided the specific directions to the shipyard\u2019s workmen for the task of physically assembling the vessels. While the \u201cworking plans\u201d are a direct outgrowth of the contract plans and specifications, they often require basic design and engineering judgments. In this case, Bethlehem was able to use the detailed \u201cworking plans\u201d that had been developed by the Ingalls shipyard in constructing a prior group of vessels in the Gulf Pride classifications.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bethlehem also selected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>the suppliers for the materials to be used in the ships\u2019 construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-4\">\u25a0 In sum, the detailed design, engineering, and construction work was left to the employees of Bethlehem. Throughout the construction process, the vessels were in the physical possession of Bethlehem and its employees. During the construction period, plaintiff had no right to control or make any use whatsoever of the four vessels for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">After construction and prior to delivery to plaintiff, each of the vessels underwent dock and sea trials conducted by the Maritime Administration Trial and Guarantee Survey Board, which determined whether the vessel conformed to the requirements of the construction contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The vessels could not be delivered to plaintiff without having passed these trials. The four vessels at issue were actually delivered and made available to plaintiff for use in its business at various times during 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">On its Federal income tax return for calendar year 1962, plaintiff claimed an investment credit in the amount of $1,080,128.99. A portion of this claimed credit was attributable to plaintiff\u2019s share of the cost of construction of the four vessels. On January 13, 1967, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed plaintiff\u2019s claim for full investment credit with respect to plaintiff\u2019s entire cost of these vessels, relying in part on the ground that the portions of the vessels constructed prior to December 31, 1961, were not eligible for investment credit under section 48(b)(1) of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-7\">After paying the income tax deficiency relating to this claim, plaintiff, on March 24, 1969, filed a timely claim for refund of Federal income taxes for calendar year 1962 in the amount of $998,-290.50, plus interest, disputing the partial disallowance of investment credit for these vessels as well as other items. Plaintiff\u2019s claim for refund was denied in full by a statutory notice of disallowance dated May 1, 1969, and plaintiff timely filed its petition in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-11\">The investment tax credit provisions were initially added to the 1954 Code by section 2 of the Revenue Act of 1962, Pub.L. No. 87-834, 76 Stat. 962. This Act authorized the allowance of a tax credit for investment in certain deprecia-ble property. The vessels in this case are property within this category. <em>See </em>\u00a7 48(a)(2)(B)(iii). The 1962 Act authorized the taxpayer to claim a credit equal to seven percent of the basis of a \u201cqualified investment.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 46(a)(1). In section 46(c)(1)(A) \u201cqualified investment\u201d was defined, in part, as the \u201capplicable percentage of the basis of each new section 38 property (as defined in section 48(b)) placed in service by the taxpayer during such taxable year.\u201d We are concerned here with the transitional rules in section 48(b) relating to the extent to which particular items could be treated as \u201cnew section 38 property\u201d and hence eligible for credit. Section 48(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-12\">(b) <em>New section 38 property. </em>\u2014 For purposes of this subpart, the term \u201cnew section 38 property\u201d means section 38 property\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-13\">(1) the construction, reconstruction, or erection of which is completed by the taxpayer after December 31, 1961, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-14\">(2) acquired after December 31, 1961, if the original use of such property commences with the taxpayer and commences after such date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-15\">In applying section 46(c)(1)(A) in the case of property described in paragraph (1), there shall be taken into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>account only that portion of the basis which is properly attributable to construction, reconstruction, or erection after December 31, 1961.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">Under this section, the credits for investments in property described in category (1) are limited to that portion of the taxpayer\u2019s basis in the property that is attributable to costs during the period after the statutory cut-off date, December 31, 1961. There is no such limitation for credit claimed on property classified in category (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">In interpreting section 48(b), Treasury Regulations section 1.48-2(b) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-6\">(1) Property is considered as constructed, reconstructed, or erected by the taxpayer if the work is done for him in accordance with his specifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-8\">(6) Property shall be deemed to be acquired when reduced to physical possession, or control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1420-9\">Plaintiff rests its case primarily on the argument that it is entitled to the tax credit measured on the entire basis of the four vessels in issue because these vessels were \u201cacquired\u201d after December 31, 1961, in accordance with section 48(b)(2) of the Code and Treasury Regulation section 1.48-2(b)(6). Plaintiff argues that the availability of the full credit under section 48(b)(2) does not depend on the unavailability of the restricted credit under section 48(b)(1). In this regard, plaintiff emphasizes that section 48(b)(1) was designed to serve a limited purpose of allowing partial credit in situations which were not already subject to section 48(b)(2); and that even if the vessels in issue could be classified within both sections 48(b)(1) and 48(b)(2), plaintiff is entitled to the benefits of section 48(b)(2). In addition, plaintiff contends that the four vessels in issue were not constructed \u201cby the taxpayer\u201d within the meaning of section 48(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-12\">Defendant, for its part, maintains that the vessels were constructed \u201cby the taxpayer\u201d under section 48(b)(1) of the Code, because the vessels were built for plaintiff in accordance with its plans and specifications within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.48-2(b)(1). The defendant also raises what has been termed the \u201cmutual exclusivity\u201d argument, that is, that sections 48(b)(1) and 48(b)(2) were intended to apply to different types of situations. Defendant\u2019s argument follows that since the vessels in question were constructed \u201cby the taxpayer,\u201d they are not \u201cacquired\u201d property within the meaning of section 48(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-13\">Defendant\u2019s position ultimately rests on its contention that the vessels <em>were </em>constructed \u201cby the taxpayer\u201d under section 48(b)(1). Since we do not agree with this argument, we need not deal with two alternative arguments of the parties. Solely for the purpose of deciding this case, we assume (as the Government argues) that section 48(b)(1) and \u25a0section 48(b)(2) apply to different categories and that if the property in this case falls within section 48(b)(1), plaintiff will receive only a limited credit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-15\">The main question is whether the four vessels in issue constitute property constructed \u201cby the taxpayer\u201d within the meaning of section 48(b)(1). Giving the words \u201cby the taxpayer\u201d their ordinary meaning, plaintiff would have to be the maker of the property or the one with control over the details of the construction of the vessels before section 48(b)(1) would apply. The legislative history of this section does not specifically define the phrase \u201cby the taxpayer,\u201d and the legislative background does not contain anything which would lead us to depart from the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>In implementing the credit, Congress chose the December 31, 1961, cut-off date and adopted basically the same transition rules which were added to the Internal Revenue Code in 1954 in section 167(c) to deal with the application of the newly liberalized depreciation provisions. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.No.1447, 87th Cong.2d Sess. 10 (1962); S.Rep.No.1881, 87th Cong.2d Sess. 15 (1962), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 1962, p. 3304. But the legislative history of section 167(c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> like that of section 48(b), does not provide much aid in defining the scope of section 48(b). The language of the statute itself is the best indication of the legislative intent. Congress often expresses its will in the customary meaning of the language it uses, and when, \u201c[t]he requirements of the [statute] are detailed and specific, * * * [they] must be applied with precision.\u201d Commissioner v. Gordon, 391 U.S. 83, 91-92, 88 S.Ct. 1517, 1523, 20 L.Ed.2d 448 (1968); <em>see, e. g., </em>Braunstein v. Commissioner, 374 U.S. 65, 69-73, 83 S.Ct. 1663, 10 L.Ed.2d 757 (1963); Hanover Bank v. Commissioner, 369 U.S. 672, 687, 82 S.Ct. 1080, 8 L.Ed.2d 187 (1962); First Nat\u2019l Bank of Chicago v. United States, 38 F.2d 925, 931, 69 Ct.Cl. 312, 325 (1930), aff\u2019d, 283 U.S. 142, 51 S.Ct. 378, 75 L.Ed. 913 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-10\">Defendant bases its interpretation of section 48(b)(1) largely upon Treasury Regulation 1.48-2(b)(l), which provides that \u201c[p]roperty is considered as constructed * * * by the taxpayer if the work is done for him in accordance with his specifications.\u201d Basically, defendant argues that the vessels were built exclusively for the taxpayer in accordance with contract plans and specifications which were attributable to plaintiff, and consequently, under the regulation, the vessels were constructed \u201cby the taxpayer.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-12\">This regulation seeks to provide a standard for determining the extent, to which property constructed <em>for </em>the taxpayer will be considered to have been constructed <em>by </em>him within the meaning of section 48(b)(1). It is significant that the statute itself does not include property constructed <em>for </em>the taxpayer \u2014 it merely speaks of the construction, recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>struction, or erection of property <em>by </em>the taxpayer. The implication that the word \u201cby\u201d is not intended to mean \u201cfor\u201d is strengthened by looking at the larger statutory phrase \u201cwhich is completed by the taxpayer.\u201d The words \u201ccompleted by\u201d connote an active participation by the taxpayer in the completion of construction and hence in the construction itself. Thus, taken literally, the regulation could expand the coverage of section 48(b)(1) beyond its statutory language, and it is well established that a regulation which \u201coperates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity.\u201d Manhattan Gen. Equip Co. v. Commissioner, 297 U.S. 129, 134, 56 S.Ct. 397, 400, 80 L.Ed. 528 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">However, we recognize that Treasury Regulations should normally be given great weight in our determinations and must be upheld unless they cannot be interpreted in line with the statutory language they seek to explain. Commissioner v. South Texas Lumber Co., 333 U.S. 496, 501, 68 S.Ct. 695, 92 L.Ed. 831 (1948); Fawcus Mach. Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 375, 378, 51 S.Ct. 144, 75 L.Ed. 397 (1931); Wills v. Commissioner, 411 F.2d 537, 543 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1969). Furthermore, we are presently confronted with a situation where Congress delegated specific authority to the Commissioner, in section 38(b), to formulate regulations dealing with the investment credit. As we stated in Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. United States, 487 F.2d 528, 532, 203 Ct.Cl. 18, 26 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-5\">[Sjection 1.48-l(b) of the Treasury Regulations is entitled to even more than the usual great weight accorded Treasury Regulations * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1422-9\">From our study of the regulation presently in issue, we find that it is susceptible to a construction consistent with the terms . of the statute. We, therefore, need not find that regulation invalid in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-10\"> The regulation implies that the taxpayer must have control over the project before it will be considered to be constructed, reconstructed, or erected by him, but the scope of the term \u201cspecifications\u201d is unclear. General or limited control over the contract plans and specifications is, in and of itself, insufficient to establish the degree of control necessary to find that the property was constructed \u201cby the taxpayer.\u201d If plaintiff has such control over the details of the work that it is the maker of the property, or constructs the property itself, then there is a sufficient nexus between the construction and the taxpayer for the construction to be \u201cby the taxpayer\u201d within the meaning of section 48(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-12\">This is not the first time this regulation has been interpreted by the courts. In Public Service Co. of New Mexico v. United States, 431 F.2d 980 (10th Cir. 1970), the Tenth Circuit was faced with a similar problem of determining whether the restricted credit provisions of section 48(b)(1) applied. In that case, the taxpayer, a utility company, was engaged in the business of furnishing electrical energy and water. In 1960, the taxpayer entered into a contract with Stearns-Rogers Manufacturing Company for the construction of a plant to contain a 66,000-kilowatt hydrogen-cooled turbine generator. The contract provided that Stearns-Rogers would supply \u201cthe required engineering design, drafting, accounting, purchasing and expediting of materials and the furnishing of supervision, labor, and other requirements necessary for the construction of the 66,000 kilowatt No. 3 Unit.\u201d 431 F.2d at 982. The turbine-generator was to be constructed on taxpayer\u2019s property, and Public Service specified the technical data and performance expectations required from the turbine-generator. The new generator plant was not tested until after December 31, 1961, and Public Service did not gain actual control of the plant until mid-1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-13\">The Internal Revenue Service, as in the present case, ruled that section 48(b)(1) applied to the transaction. In reversing this ruling, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-14\"><em>Right of control is the touchstone in this suit. </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.48-2(b)(l) states: \u201cProperty is considered as constructed, reconstructed, or erected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>the taxpayer if the work is done for him in accordance with his specifications.\u201d It is apparent that the purpose of this regulation is to distinguish between work done by independent contractors and mere employees. <em>With that dichotomy in mind, we note that the regulation would defeat the investment credit if \u201cspecifications\" refers to the control and supervision which every owner has the right to exercise over the general work.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1423-4\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1423-5\">It would be patently absurd for a utility company to only generally describe the yet-to-be constructed plant and expect the contractor to fill in all the technical data and performance details. <em>Manifestly, Public Service was free to enumerate technical specifications for the power plant and at the same time remain free to claim an investment credit on the entire cost of acquisition. </em>Only if it had <em>authoritative control </em>with respect to the manner and means in which and by which the details of the work were to be performed would the Company be limited to a credit on the basis of construction costs after December 31, 1961. 431 F.2d at 983. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1423-7\">We agree with the Tenth Circuit that the right of control is the most important factor to be considered in determining whether the work is done for the taxpayer \u201cin accordance with his specifications.\u201d However we need not go so far as to hold that the taxpayer is entitled to recover upon a finding, without more, that the Bethlehem Steel Company filled the role of an independent contractor in the construction of the Lykes Bros, ships. There are important factual differences between the cases. In <em>Public' Service Company of New Mexico, </em>the construction agreement was a two-party contract between Public Service and Stearns-Rog\u00e9rs. The taxpayer owned the land upon which the plant was constructed. It purchased the major plant components from a supplier and furnished them to a contractor, and the taxpayer also enumerated certain technical specifications for the power plant. There was no third party who had the right to control any portion of the design or construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-11\">By contrast, the case before us involves three contracting parties: the plaintiff, the Government represented by the Federal Maritime Board, and the contractor. The question as to whether plaintiff had the necessary control over the construction of the four vessels must, to a very large, extent, be answered by the degree of supervision and control which the Government was authorized to exercise from the initiation of the project until the completion and delivery of the vessels. This significant factor was not present in the <em>Public Service Company </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-14\">On the facts of this case, plaintiff did not exercise sufficient control over the construction of the vessels to bring the property within the provisions of section 48(b)(1) or Treasury Regulation 1.48-2(b)(l). While the parties dispute whether the contract plans and specifications can be deemed to belong to the taxpayer for purposes of determining the investment credit, it is clear that in accordance with the requirements of the construction-differential subsidy program, the Government exercised a large degree of control over the contract at all stages from the beginning to the final completion of the project. Maritime had the right to control the design specifications in every detail.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Maritime examined the \u201coutline specification\u201d submitted with the application for subsidy in 1955 and found it lacking in the horsepower requirement. After negotiations, a compromise was reached, increasing the horsepower of the vessel from plaintiff\u2019s suggested 8,500 to 9,000. When plaintiff later submitted the proposed contract plans and specifications, Maritime \u201ccritically reviewed\u201d them, and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>detailed examination generated almost 400 adverse comments. The comments ranged from the location of the captain\u2019s quarters to the size of bolts for the ventilation system. After additional negotiations, the contract plans and specifications were approved by Maritime. Maritime supervised the awarding of the construction contracts. Under the terms of the contracts, the Federal Maritime Board had the final word (short of resort to the courts) as to whether the specifications should be amended after the contracts were awarded. The Maritime Administration Trial and Guarantee Survey Board determined whether the vessels were built consistently with the contract requirements. Thus, plaintiff\u2019s right of control over the construction of the vessels was remarkably less than that of an ordinary buyer who contracts to have a building or a machine constructed by another company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">It is not enough to say that the vessels were designed to a large extent to make them satisfactory for plaintiff\u2019s commercial needs. Nor is it important that Maritime did not change a great percentage of the proposed contract plans and specifications submitted to it. Defendant concedes that Maritime had the authority to condition the grant of CDS upon the building of a vessel entirely different from that desired and requested by the applicant, and Maritime exercised that control in numerous instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">Maritime\u2019s control was far greater than that which prevails in a situation where a construction project has to conform to few minor requirements of a regulatory body.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">In addition to the Government\u2019s control over the project, there are other factors which demonstrate plaintiff\u2019s lack of control of Bethlehem\u2019s construction operation. The ships were not built on plaintiff\u2019s property. They were constructed in Bethlehem\u2019s shipyard at Sparrows Point, Maryland, far removed from Louisiana, plaintiff\u2019s state of incorporation. At all material times'during construction of the vessels, Bethlehem maintained physical possession and control over the vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">Bethlehem\u2019s relation to the other contracting parties was that of an independent contractor. Under the construction contract, Bethlehem was required to furnish the labor and materials, to perform all the work, and to deliver the vessels at its own risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-9\">The contract plans and specifications, which plaintiff participated in formulating, were insufficient to enable the shipyard employees to construct the vessels. The vessels were built by the shipyard\u2019s employees from detailed working plans. While Bethlehem had a contractual obligation to prepare such working plans, it was able to utilize the working plans developed by the Ingalls Shipyard for construction of a prior group of Gulf Pride vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-10\">The contract required Bethlehem to submit the working plans to plaintiff and the Federal Maritime Board for approval, and until approved, all such work would be at the shipyard\u2019s own risk. Also, the working plans were tailored to the contract requirements, and inspectors representing Maritime, Gibbs and Cox, and plaintiff were present at the construction site during the construction of the vessel. While these two provisions tend to support defendant\u2019s position, they must be evaluated against many other factors, including the Government\u2019s right of control and Bethlehem\u2019s overall responsibility for construction of the vessels. When so considered, we think the balance tilts in favor of a conclusion that the vessels were not constructed \u201cby the taxpayer\u201d within the meaning of section 48(b)(1) or \u201cin accordance with [its] specifications,\u201d as that phrase in the regulations should be interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-11\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-12\">One of defendant\u2019s principal contentions is that the \u201cspecifications\u201d regulation distinguishes between items which are built to order according to the taxpayer\u2019s individual requirements (\u201ccus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>tom-built\u201d) and property which can be supplied out of ordinary stock or \u201coff the shelf.\u201d To support this distinction, defendant argues that the limitation \u201cby the taxpayer\u201d was used because of the administrative problem which could arise in determining the construction status on the cut-off date of property manufactured or built by someone other than the taxpayer, such as in the case of a manufacturer of standard items which can be purchased off-the-shelf or from a catalog. Defendant concludes that the \u201cspecifications\u201d regulation properly treats custom-built property as that constructed \u201cby the taxpayer,\u201d and excludes off-the-shelf items.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-4\">The weakness of this argument lies in the fact that there is no support for it in the language or background of section 48(b) or in its forerunner, section 167(c). The examples given in the committee reports and in the Treasury Regulations do not suggest this distinction. If Congress intended to make such a distinction, there is no indication of it. The fact that the Senate committee, when considering the House version of section 167(c), noted that the House limitation for construction in process on January 1, 1954, created a difficult administrative problem in determining the portion of the cost incurred after December 31, 1953 (S.Rep.No.1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1954), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, 1954, p. 4629), does not show that the limitation to construction by the taxpayer was made to simplify the administrative burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">Moreover, in the same report, the Senate committee noted that the limitation for property constructed by the taxpayer would discriminate against the taxpayer who \u201cconducted the construction himself\u201d as compared with a taxpayer who purchased a \u201cnew building\u201d after December 31, 1953. Thus, the Senate committee did not treat the House bill as one distinguishing between custom-built and off-the-shelf items; rather the committee recognized it as a distinction based on who performed the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">In rejecting defendant\u2019s contentions, we are influenced by the manifest purpose of Congress to stimulate economic development by means of the investment credit. While sections 48(b)(1) and 48(b)(2) establish a cut-off date for the extension of investment credit, these sections must be read in conjunction with the general purpose for allowing investment credit. The credit was designed to encourage the modernization and expansion of the Nation\u2019s production facilities by immediately reducing income taxes, with the result, <em>inter alia, </em>of increasing the capital funds available for investment. It was hoped that the credit would improve the country\u2019s economic potential, increase job opportunities, and better the country\u2019s competitive position in the world economy. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.No.1447, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1962); S.Rep.No.1881, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 11 (1962), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 1962, p. 3304. In view of this objective, we do not think that Congress intended for the investment credit provisions, including the transitional rules, to be applied as restrictively as defendant would apply them in this case. It is generally recognized that remedial legislation should be construed liberally in order to effectuate its purpose. <em>See, e. g., </em>Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967); Piedmont &amp; N. Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, 286 U.S. 299, 311-12, 52 S.Ct. 541, 76 L.Ed. 1115 (1932). In applying various sections of the investment credit statute, this court and other courts have noted that the Act should be interpreted liberally in keeping with its purposes, Alabama Displays, Inc. v. United States, 507 F.2d 844, 205 Ct.Cl. 716 (1974); Minot Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan v. United States, 435 F.2d 1368, 1372 (8th Cir. 1970); Northville Dock Corp., 52 T.C. 68, 73 (1969), and this ease is no exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-7\">The Government\u2019s position that section 48(b)(1) applies to all custom-made items would reduce the economic effect of the credit during transitional years. Such an interpretation would give widespread <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>application to the limitation of the tax credit on property which defendant would classify under section 48(b)(1) and thereby reduce the amount of credit which otherwise might be available to taxpayers under section 48(b)(2). Furthermore, because custom-built items are normally more expensive than off-the-shelf items, the Government\u2019s interpretation would have the effect of restricting the credit available for the expensive custom-built items, while allowing it on the cheaper items. We believe that our reading of the phrase \u201cby the taxpayer\u201d in section 48(b)(1) is more consistent with the statutory objective of encouraging economic development than the interpretation proposed by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">Finally, we must determine whether the property at issue was \u201cacquired\u201d by the plaintiff after December 31, 1961, pursuant to section 48(b)(2). In this regard, we are guided by Treasury Regulation 1.48-2(b)(6), which states that \u201cProperty shall be deemed to be acquired when reduced to physical possession, or control.\u201d Our inquiry regarding the time of physical possession is simplified in this case, since Bethlehem was required under the contract to make an actual tender of delivery of the completed vessels to plaintiff.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is established that the actual delivery dates of the four vessels were as follows: the <em>Leslie Lykes, </em>February 2, 1962;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the <em>Brinton Lykes, </em>June 29, 1962; the <em>Shirley Lykes, </em>August 31, 1962; and the <em>Marjorie Lykes, </em>November 16, 1962. On the delivery dates, the certifying documents for each vessel issued by the Coast Guard, the American Bureau of Shipping, the Public Health Service, and others were delivered to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-12\">In addition, plaintiff did not act in a manner consistent with possession or control of the vessels until after the vessels were actually delivered. It was not until after delivery and acceptance that plaintiff was able to place the vessels into service, for prior to such delivery, plaintiff had no right to make any use of the ships whatsoever.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For example, plaintiff placed its crews on board the ships for the first time after delivery, when the vessels were removed from the shipyard as required by the contract. Prior to delivery, the vessels could be manned only by personnel employed by Bethlehem. Similarly, plaintiff was first obligated to buy insurance coverage for the vessels after delivery. Prior thereto, while the vessels were in the possession and under the control of Bethlehem, the shipyard was obligated, under the contract, to maintain full insurance coverage for the ships. Thus, by taking delivery of the vessels during 1962 and by placing the new vessels in service for the first time thereafter, plaintiff \u201cacquired\u201d the vessels after December 31, 1961, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>within the plain meaning of section 48(b)(2) and Treasury Regulation 1.48-2(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">Since plaintiff\u2019s vessels qualify for the investment credit under section 48(b)(2), and not under section 48(b)(1), plaintiff is entitled to recover on its claim, and we remand the case to the trial judge for a determination of the amount of its recovery pursuant to Rule 131(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1415-13\"> We agree with the result reached by Trial Judge Lloyd Fletcher but have modified and expanded the grounds upon which his conclusion is based.
