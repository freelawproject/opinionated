Smith, an aerospace engineer, required a \u201cSecret\u201d security clearance from the Department of Defense to begin his employment at Dunlap &amp; Associates of Santa Monica, California. Smith had held a \u201cSecret\u201d clearance at his two previous places of employment. On April 11, 1966, one week before Smith was to begin his work with Dunlap &amp; Associates, the Industrial Security Clearance Review Office (ISCRO) of the Department of Defense advised Smith that his \u201cSecret\u201d clearance had been immediately suspended because of Smith\u2019s failure to meet Criterion R, Part IV of DOD Directive 5220.6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Criterion forbids the grant of any security clearance to a person suffering from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-14\">[any] illness, including any mental condition, of a nature which, in the opinion of competent medical authority, may cause significant defect in the judgment or reliability of the employee, with due regard to the transient or continuing effect of the illness and the medical findings in such case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">The Statement of Reasons accompanying the ISCRO letter of April 11 identified Smith\u2019s illness as a mental condition variously diagnosed as \u201cschizophrenic reaction, unclassified\u201d, \u201cparanoid schizophrenic reaction\u201d and \u201cmanic depressive reaction, mixed.\u201d Of these diagnoses, more will be said below.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">Pursuant to procedures established in Part VII of Directive 5220.6, Smith was given an administrative hearing before a Hearing Examiner of the Central Industrial Personnel Access Authorization Board. On June 1, 1967, Hearing Examiner Joseph Sacks determined that Smith\u2019s mental condition did not meet the requirements of Criterion R and that Smith was therefore entitled to his \u201cSecret\u201d clearance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Previously, on November 16, 1966, Dunlap &amp; Associates began employment of Smith on a special interim basis. The Department of Defense counsel appealed the Examiner\u2019s decision to the Appeal Section of the Central In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>dustrial Personnel Access Authorization Board. On November 8, 1967, the Appeal Board reversed the Hearing Examiner and revoked Smith\u2019s \u201cSecret\u201d clearance originally granted in 1958.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On November 27, 1967, Dunlap &amp; Associates terminated Smith\u2019s interim employment. On October 23, 1969, Smith sought reconsideration of this decision by again applying to ISCRO for a \u201cSecret\u201d clearance. On November 2, 1970, Smith was notified that this request was denied. Smith did not attempt to obtain the benefit of the hearing procedures of Directive 5220.6 in regard to this denial of reconsideration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Smith alleges that he has been unable to gain employment in his chosen profession, from November 27, 1967, to date, as a result of the denial of a \u201cSecret\u201d security clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">On November 17, 1970, Smith filed suit in the federal district court for the District of Columbia charging that the denial of his security clearance in particular and Directive 5220.6 in general were unconstitutional, were not authorized by statute and were otherwise arbitrary and capricious. In the course of pre-trial proceedings, Smith moved for production under Fed.R.Civ.P. 34 of the investigative file compiled by ISCRO staff personnel in formulating the initial decision to deny the security clearance. The Department of Defense objected to this request, arguing that since the court could not review the decision to deny Smith\u2019s clearance except on the basis of the administrative record, the investigative file, allegedly not in the administrative record, was legally irrelevant to the court\u2019s review task. Smith joined issue on this point. The District Court ordered the Department of Defense to produce the investigative file for <em>in camera </em>inspection. The Department then interposed a claim of Executive Privilege and refused to produce the file. The District Court again ordered the Department to produce file for <em>in camera </em>inspection. The Department again declined to produce the file, sought reconsideration of the second order to produce and moved the District Court to certify the question for interlocutory appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The District Court denied reconsideration but certified the question to this Court, which on January 26, 1972, denied leave to file the interlocutory appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Upon Smith\u2019s motion, the District Court then imposed sanctions' under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2) on the Department for its refusal to comply with the discovery order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Upon subsequent cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court on May 25, 1972, granted Smith\u2019s motion and entered judgment in his favor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Department of Defense appeals from this order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">The District Court granted Smith\u2019s motion for summary judgment upon a finding that Smith\u2019s denial of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>security clearance was arbitrary and capricious, holding that there was no evidence in the formal record of any relationship between Smith\u2019s mental condition and a defect in his judgment or reliability. This finding was based upon Smith\u2019s allegations in his Complaint at H 23(f) which, under the Rule 37(b)(2) sanctions imposed upon it, the Department could neither deny nor contradict through introduction of evidence. The imposition of these sanctions, assuming for the moment the validity of order upon which they were based, was a permissible exercise of discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It surely follows from the imposition of the sanctions that Smith is entitled to summary judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Department\u2019s main contention on this appeal is that the order requiring <em>in camera </em>inspection is itself invalid and not authorized by Rule 34 which, by reference to Ped.R. Civ.P. 26(b), permits only the discovery of \u201cany matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action . . The Department contends both that the investigative file is not relevant to Smith\u2019s suit and that the file is privileged. Since the discovery order here was only for <em>in camera </em>inspection, the Department further contends that Smith has not shown the degree of necessity it argues is required in order to subject a claim of privilege to <em>in camera </em>scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">In its initial decision, the District Court failed to state reasons to support its determination that the ISCRO investigative file could be relevant to Smith\u2019s suit and of sufficient necessity to order <em>in camera </em>inspection despite the claim of Executive Privilege. Therefore, on January 9, 1975, this Court remanded the record of the case for supplementation as to the District Court\u2019s reasons for a finding of relevancy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The District Court duly has advised us of his reasons and they are as follows:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">a. That the departmental counsel representing the Government at the hearing posed questions to witnesses that had their basis in information to which plaintiff had been denied access.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">b. That witnesses at the hearing were allowed access to information in the investigative file to which plaintiff had not been allowed access, and that these witnesses testified to conclusions based on that information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">c. That the investigative file contains prior statements of witnesses who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>testified at the hearing which related to their testimony and that he was denied access to these statements and therefore he could not effectively cross-examine those witnesses with respect to their testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">d. That the investigative file contains material that is favorable to the plaintiff and the non-production of that material prejudiced plaintiff in the presentation of his case, thus violating principles of fundamental fairness and due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">e. That the administrative proceedings were brought in bad faith and for purposes other than his alleged mental illness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We affirm. We initially set out in detail the administrative proceedings which led to the denial of Smith\u2019s clearance. On the basis of this discussion, we proceed to analyze the District Court\u2019s reasons, for the determination of relevancy. We conclude these reasons are sufficient to support the order requiring <em>in camera </em>inspection. Our mandate affirming default judgment against the government will issue in the regular course, twenty days from the date of this opinion, unless the government complies with the order requiring <em>in camera </em>inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">I. <em>The Administrative Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The Department\u2019s case against Smith consisted entirely of the reports of five doctors and the testimony under oath, subject to cross-examination, of three of those doctors. Of these five doctors, one was a general practitioner not trained in psychiatry and the other four were trained in psychiatry but were not certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. Smith presented no expert witnesses on his behalf and conducted his own defense, stating on the record that he could not afford an attorney.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">We consider first the reports of the doctors who did not testify. The first is Dr. James S. L. Jacobs. Smith consulted with Dr. Jacobs in 1950 while he was in attendance at the California Institute of Technology. Smith complained of fears of people, headaches, speech difficulty, and inability to awake in the morning. He was hospitalized twice in 1950 under Dr. Jacob\u2019s care at Veterans Administration hospitals in the Los Angeles area where he received insulin coma therapy and attendant psychotherapy. Smith testified that the pressure of his graduate work caused these symptoms.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Dr. Jacobs diagnosed Smith as \u201cschizophrenic reaction, unclassified.\u201d Dr. Jacobs did not state an opinion concerning the effect of this mental condition upon Smith\u2019s judgment or reliability. The second report was that of Dr. Bryce R. Bednar. Smith consulted Dr. Bednar between August and October of 1964, twice a week. Dr. Bednar noted the following symptoms: lack of interest, slowing down of ability, increased irritability and suspicion coupled with a depressed and agitated mood. Dr. Bednar\u2019s diagnosis was depressive reaction associated with a paranoid state. However, in Dr. Bed-nar\u2019s opinion, this mental condition would <em>not </em>cause a serious defect in Smith\u2019s judgment or reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">The general practitioner who testified for the Department was Dr. John D. Granzella, whom Smith consulted in January of 1964 in regard to an intestinal disorder. Dr. Granzella did not conduct a psychiatric examination of Smith but nevertheless diagnosed acute paranoid schizophrenia<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> on the basis of two facts. The first did not relate to Smith at all but rather was contained in a hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>report which the Hearing Examiner found belonged to one Robert <em>L. </em>Smith and which Granzella mistakenly attributed to applicant Robert P. Smith.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The other fact was Smith\u2019s statement in a telephone conversation with Granzella to the effect that Smith intended to move because he thought someone was following him. In his written report, Granzel-la also mentions the fact that Smith believed someone had been giving him an involuntary dose of LSD but does not state this was a basis for his diagnosis. Despite this diagnosis, Granzella did not recommend hospitalization because he thought Smith was engaged in psychotherapy, although he was not sure at the time of this fact and never consulted the psychiatrist whom Smith was in fact consulting. In his written report Gran-zella did not state an opinion on the effect of this diagnosed mental condition on Smith\u2019s judgment or reliability but under cross-examination did state that Smith fell within the intendment of Criterion R.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This opinion was based on the symptoms previously discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The two main witnesses for the Department were Dr. Raymond C. Spaulding and Dr. George J. Prastka. We consider first the testimony and report of Dr. Prastka whom Smith consulted in March and April of 1964. The major complaint Smith related to Dr. Prastka was his belief that someone was covertly drugging him with LSD. Smith also gave Prastka a type-written list of \u201csymptoms\u201d.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On the basis of these complaints, Dr. Prastka diagnosed Smith as an acute paranoid schizophrenic, severe but in partial remission. Dr. Prast-ka also felt that this mental condition would cause a significant defect in Smith\u2019s judgment or reliability. However, Dr. Prastka did not think that Smith should be hospitalized and believed he was responsible enough to take his own medicine. This course of action was inconsistent with Prastka\u2019s written statement that Smith was not \u201ccapable of assuming any degree of responsibility.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The heart of the Department\u2019s case was the testimony of Dr. Spaulding whom Smith consulted once on October 1, 1965, at the request of the Department of Defense. Dr. Spaulding diagnosed Smith as suffering from manic depressive reaction, mixed, with a tendency to remission and recurrence. His mental condition in Dr. Spaulding\u2019s opinion could cause a serious defect in Smith\u2019s judgment or reliability. Spaulding testified that Smith was largely in remission at the time of his examination and that a diagnosis could not be made on the basis of one visit.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> He furthermore did not conduct physical or mental tests on Smith, such as an EEG, IQ test or the normal battery of psychological tests. Dr. Spaulding\u2019s diagnosis then rests solely upon his examination of Smith\u2019s psychiatric record and Smith\u2019s statement of symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">From this history, Dr. Spaulding identified certain characteristics in Smith\u2019s personality. At times of depression, Smith would \u201close interest in things, he had a lack of ability to initiate goals, his ability to concentrate was poor, he had a lowered sexual drive, he had some disturbance of his sleep pattern and appetite . . . .\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> At times of \u201chyperactivity\u201d, Smith \u201cacted in an aggressive, hostile sort of fashion; he was associating with a group of individuals that were different from his usual friends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>. and they were engaged in antisocial, or types of behavior which is not ordinarily looked upon in favor by the rest of the community.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Dr. Spauld-ing also noted Smith\u2019s belief that someone had been giving him an involuntary dose of LSD. Dr. Spaulding relied most heavily on this \u201chyperactive\u201d stage in his opinion that Smith\u2019s mental condition could cause a serious defect in his reliability of judgment:<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">[In] the hyperactive period in particular the individual usually utilizes very, very poor judgment with regard to the conduct of his life and in his associations, in his activities and in his use of monies .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In regard to the probability that Smith would again have another hyperactive period, Dr. Spaulding stated: <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">I have no opinion; I left my crystal ball at home. I do not like to predict the future for anybody. I can only tell you about the normal cause of the illness, and that this illness is prone to recurrences of both low and high periods. He may go for a hundred years and never have a deviation of either variety, but I cannot predict that he won\u2019t have one next week either. So I do not know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">There is no other testimony in the record on the probability of a recurrence of Smith\u2019s \u201chyperactive\u201d period.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">Dr. Spaulding was not sanguine about the possibility of treatment ensuring against recurrence but did state that then recent <em>(circa </em>1966) literature highly praised the potential of lithium carbonate treatment.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Since that time lithium carbonate has received a great deal of favorable attention in medical journals.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Other than Dr. Spaulding\u2019s statements there is no other discussion in the record of the possibilities of lithium carbonate treatment for Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">Smith in his own defense did not seriously rebut Spaulding\u2019s list of symptoms but rather sought to establish that these symptoms and whatever mental condition they represented would not cause a significant defect in his judgment and reliability. To that end he introduced a number of letters from co-workers and examined at the hearing a few other co-workers. With the exception of some discussion of Smith\u2019s tardiness in arriving for work, all those who sent letters or testified stated that during Smith\u2019s hyperactive and depressed periods, his work was not affected. The Department did not attempt to rebut this presentation. Smith also sought to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>what he perceived to be an implied assertion that he was not loyal to the nation. The basis for this apparent perception was Government Exhibit 9 which consisted of a fairly lengthy interview between one Valerio Cortinovis, a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigation (OSI) of the Air Force, and Smith. This interview reveals the Department\u2019s in depth knowledge of Smith\u2019s associations, many of which were decidedly \u201cleft-wing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The Hearing Examiner found in favor of Smith. He relied heavily on the testimony of Dr. Spaulding, holding that it was more comprehensive and that Dr. Spaulding displayed \u201ca more expert knowledge of mental disorders and the Applicant\u2019s illness than did Dr. Prastka, in his testimony, or the other psychiatrists whose analyses are recorded in their written reports.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As this statement and others indicate, the Hearing Examiner did not give weight to the testimony of Dr. Granzella. The Hearing Examiner also found that Smith had not demonstrated certain symptoms often associated with a schizophrenic reaction. Largely following Dr. Spaulding\u2019s testimony, the Hearing Examiner further found that (1) Smith was in remission and would not experience defects in judgment or reliability while in that state; (2) the dominant period in Smith\u2019s psychosis was the depressive; (3) Smith had experienced only one delineated hyperactive period; (4) a defect in judgment or reliability is more likely to occur in the hyperactive than in the depressive period; and (5) \u201cit cannot be accurately determined how long Applicant may remain in a state of remission, and it is possible that he may remain in such state for the rest of his life.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> While the Hearing Examiner concluded that Smith had a mental condition which could cause a significant defect in his judgment or reliability, an \u201cover-all common sense evaluation of all the evidence is still required in order to reach the ultimate determination of whether ... a grant is clearly consistent with the national interest.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> On that basis the Hearing Examiner concluded after mentioning eight considerations <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> that clearance of Smith at \u201cSecret\u201d level would be clearly consistent with the national interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">The Appeal Board reversed. The Board noted that \u201cstripped of its non-essentials\u201d the fact remains that Smith suffered from a mental condition. This was, of course, conceded by Smith. The Board described in a number of points that the illness was \u201cchronic\u201d not \u201cacute\u201d, relying on Dr. Granzella\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Board appears to assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>chronicity from the fact that Smith had been consulting psychiatrists since 1950, apparently \u2022 concluding that the term \u201cchronic\u201d is not a medical term of art.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It should be noted that Dr. Prastka diagnosed Smith as \u201cacute\u201d and Dr. Spauld-ing, Dr. Bednar and Dr. Jacobs did not mention the issue. While the Board throughout refers to Smith\u2019s \u201cdefective judgment\u201d, it specifies only the incident involving LSD and the fact that Smith had experimented with LSD and marijuana while knowing that such experimentation was in the Board\u2019s view dangerous and against the law. The Board agreed with the Hearing Examiner that Smith\u2019s mental condition was within the intendment of the Criterion but disagreed that any further common sense inquiry could be made. It thus implicitly concluded that the diagnosis was the central evidentiary fact weighing against Smith on the record.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">II. <em>The Potential Relevancy of the Investigative File ~</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">The Department\u2019s central argument is that review of administrative decisions regarding security clearances is limited to the administrative record.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Since the Department is willing to prove that neither the Hearing Examiner nor the Screening Board considered the investigative file in decision of Smith\u2019s case and that the file is not in the administrative record, the file is perforce irrelevant to review of the decision revoking Smith\u2019s clearance. We, of course, have no quarrel with this general principle, but it does not end our inquiry for two reasons. First, the test of relevancy for purposes of discovery under Fed.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Civ.P. 26(b)(1) is broader than the test for admissibility at trial, as the Rule specifically provides.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Hence, a party may discover information which is not admissible at trial if such information will have some probable effect on the organization and presentation of the moving party\u2019s case.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The issue, therefore, is not whether the investigative file is irrelevant simply because it is inadmissible, but rather whether it could be relevant to the presentation of Smith\u2019s case based on the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Second, Smith\u2019s action in the District Court encompasses more than a review of the Department\u2019s decision to revoke his clearance. It concerns also an attack on the authorization and constitutionality of the procedures whereby that clearance was denied. As to this, judicial review must of necessity consider more than the formal administrative record. The Department argues that prior cases<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> have established the authority and constitutionality of Directive 5220.6. However, we think that these prior cases do not eliminate all potential questions of authorization or constitutionality, particularly when a clearance is denied on the basis of an alleged mental condition. As discussed below, we do not think that these remaining questions are so plainly frivolous that exercise of discovery in pursuit of Smith\u2019s claims would not be justified.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In our determination of both the substantiality of Smith\u2019s claims and the potential relevance of the investigative file to his case, we defer to the reasoned judgment of the District Court, since we conclude that judgment is neither arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Turning first to the potential relevancy of the investigative file in the preparation of Smith\u2019s defense that the record is inadequate to sustain the denial of a clearance, we think the District Court reasonably concluded that the file might well be relevant to Smith\u2019s assertion that his dismissal was on the basis of \u201cdisloyalty\u201d and not mental illness. In the record is the lengthy interrogation by Special Agent Cortinovis. The investigative file might well explain the basis for those questions and help provide the District Court with the necessary gloss to fully understand their significance in a military context. The fact that Smith himself introduced the Cortinovis interrogation is no reason for reaching a different result, since the introduction was Smith\u2019s response to what he perceived as an attack on his loyalty. This perception might, after examination of the investigatory file, turn out to be founded in fact. Furthermore, even if the Hearing Examiner and Appeal Board did not consider Smith\u2019s loyalty in mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ing their determinations, the fact that the ISCRO screening board may have considered evidence of disloyalty in initially revoking Smith\u2019s clearance and in prosecuting that decision before the Access Authorization Board may itself be sufficient to taint the proceeding.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> If the Department revoked Smith\u2019s clearance in part for reasons other than those presented to Smith, then under the Department\u2019s own regulations and under established doctrine, the revocation must be set aside.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">This potential issue of administrative \u201cbad faith\u201d folds into a more general issue, <em>viz. </em>that of distinguishing between a medical judgment of a mental illness and a social judgment about the desirability and acceptability of an individual\u2019s life style and associations. There are constitutional overtones to personal choices of associations and beliefs.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> It is certainly arguable that Criterion R should not be construed to infringe upon this protected area of personal liberty absent a specific showing of an over-rid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ing governmental interest.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The issue thus becomes whether Smith\u2019s alleged mental illness was less a medical judgment than a social judgment about his beliefs and associates. Indeed, the Appeal Board appeared to rely heavily on Smith\u2019s associations as evidence of his mental illness.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Beyond the evidence of Smith\u2019s associations, the Board appeared to rely only upon the medical opinion present in the record. Evidence in the investigatory file possibly bearing on Smith\u2019s associations might well help Smith prepare an argument that the Appeal Board finding of mental illness was fatally infected with a social judgment about his associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The District Court\u2019s other reasons concerned a potential right of discovery in the administrative proceedings that led to the revocation of Smith\u2019s clearance. This right of discovery encompasses both an interest in proper preparation of a defense and an interest in fair treatment of an accused party, the latter interest being analogous to the principle of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The investigative file would be the potential subject of such a right of discovery and its production would aid the District Court in determining whether, assuming such a right, its violation in Smith\u2019s case was prejudicial to his defense, and also whether as a general matter a failure to provide the file in administrative proceedings is either unauthorized or unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">We do not think such a right of discovery is defeated by present-doctrine.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Indeed, we think the case law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>concerning the procedural protections in clearance revocation proceedings demonstrates an admirable sensitivity which could encompass a right of discovery.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Furthermore, the peculiar circumstances of a revocation based on an alleged mental illness, we think, requires special attention to procedural rights. As the record in this case and others like it<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> strongly suggest, conclusory psychiatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>opinion tends to dominate the Criterion R determination. We have criticized this expert dominance in other contexts and see no reason for not extending this concern to the present circumstances: in both cases, psychiatric judgments may disguise, wittingly or unwittingly, political or social biases of! the psychiatrist; and excessive reliance/on diagnoses will pre-empt the primary role of legal decision-makers.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> For these reasons, there is a special need for procedural rules designed to promote the adversary process and to ensure that the factual basis of expert opinion is clearly and precisely delineated on the record.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Administrative discovery of investigative files arguably is a step in that direction. A further reason for providing more stringent procedural safeguards in cases involving mental illness is that a finding of mental illness is unfortunately seen by many as a stigma; thus to that extent such a finding deprives the individual of a greater degree of liberty than mere loss of employment.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The enlightened view is that mental illness is a disease similar to any physical ailment of the body and a condition for which there should be no blame or stigma. But we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that at present, despite lip service to the contrary, this enlightened view is not always observed in practice. We thus conclude that the District Court was reasonable in determining that the investigative file was relevant to Smith\u2019s action within the intendment of Rule 26(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The Department\u2019s assertion of Executive Privilege makes its case more plausible, \u25a0 but not by much. The showing of relevancy discussed above is the \u201cpreliminary showing of necessity\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> which permits at least an <em>in camera </em>review to determine the propriety of the claim. The District Court after an <em>in camera </em>inspection is, of course, authorized to uphold the claim of privilege if proper under the applicable precedents. It may even deny discovery of the investigative file if the privilege is not appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>cable, upon a showing that the protective order considerations of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) should apply. However, we cannot prejudge these issues without <em>in camera </em>inspection or, indeed, without any representation at all as to the contents of the investigative file. We thus conclude that the District Court acted within the bounds of discretion in ordering disclosure for <em>in camera </em>inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">There is nothing in Moore v. Administrator, Veterans Administration, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 475 F.2d 1283 (1973) which is inconsistent with our holding. That case affirmed the dismissal of certain nursing assistants for mistreating a patient and failing to report the incident. The court rejected the assertion that the Administrator\u2019s failure to call two investigators as witnesses at the dismissal hearing was grounds for reversal since the investigators had witnessed none of the events and could give only hearsay testimony and since all the witnesses who did have first hand knowledge of the relevant facts were called as witnesses. The Court rejected the claim for the report prepared by the investigators on the same ground, also noting that the request was in the context of the administrative hearing and that no provision for pre-trial discovery in administrative proceedings was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">A concluding word is in order. This is our first exposure to the use of mental conditions to disqualify an individual from either government employment or a government license for private employment. There is every reason to believe that consideration of mental illness for government employment is a daily occurrence. In the area of security classifications alone, evidence in this record indicates that in 1969 6ne hundred and forty one individuals were officially presented with a Statement of Reasons denying a clearance on the basis of a mental condition.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Statistics compiled in 1971 by the National Institute of Mental Health indicate that 4 million Americans received mental health treatment in a private or organization setting.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Furthermore, the most reliable estimates are that more than 20 million citizens, 10 per cent of the population, suffer from some behavioral disorder. Use of behavioral science knowledge to ascertain those not qualified for government service thus raises issues of extremely wide impact. Our discussion in this opinion should not be interpreted as expressing or intimating any opinion on the merits of these issues or on the propriety of judicial intervention into agency attempts to confront them. We hold only that the investigative file in this case is sufficiently relevant to the issues described above to justify the District Court\u2019s order for <em>in camera </em>inspection. We thus affirm the entry of default judgment against the government, unless it complies with the District Court\u2019s order prior to the issuance of our mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-11\">. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.5(r) (1974).

Mr. Smith used the words \u201ckook crowd\u201d, as he referred to them, and that was put in quotes in my report because I did not wish to be associated with formulating a value judgment about his friends.

Our experience in this country strongly suggests that a forensic psychiatrist\u2019s testimony and recommendations may be influenced both by his professional orientation . . . and by his personal and political preferences. * * * We may not ignore the possibility of bias in favor of the government by state-employed psychiatrists, whether they be Americans or Russians. * * * An exclusive concern with the protection of society would seem to deprive the forensic psychiatrist of the objectivity claimed for him. . . . When a law-and-order fever sweeps the country as a political issue, for example, there is no way to confer immunity on psychiatrists. They are vulnerable both as men and as practitioners of a profession that is inherently concerned with socially defined norms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">The reality of these dangers may be seen in Seebach v. Cullen, 338 F.2d 663 (9th Cir. 1964) and Peterson v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, 392 Mich. 68, 219 N.W.2d 34 (1974). To be sure, recent advances in somatic learning may eliminate the uncertainty surrounding the overlap of social and psychiatric judgments. <em>See </em>Kety, From Rationalization to Reason, 131 Am.J.Psychiat. 957 (1974). There is no evidence in the administrative record of tests designed to locate somatic symptoms or causes of Smith\u2019s alleged manic depressive illness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b547-18\">. We do not think the broad <em>dictum </em>in Moore v. Administrator, Veterans Administration, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 475 F.2d 1283, 1286 (1973) to the effect that it \"is well established that no right to a preliminary investigative file exists in administrative law\u201d prevents consideration of a potential claim that Smith is entitled to view his investigative file prior to administrative proceedings. The authority for this <em>dictum </em>is Professor Kenneth Davis who in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>cited work attacks the few cases which have denied access to an investigative file or denied discovery at the administrative level. His view that discovery should be permitted in administrative proceedings was followed by the Administrative Conference of the United States, K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 8.15, at 392 (1970 Supp.), and other distinguished commentators. <em>See </em>Kaufman, Have Administrative Agencies Kept Pace with Modern Court-Developed Techniques against Delay? \u2014 A Judge\u2019s View, 12 Admin.L.Bull. 103, 115 (1959); Berger, Discovery in Administrative Proceedings: Why Agencies Should Catch Up With the Courts, 46 A.B.A.J. 74 (1960). For a discussion of the recommendations of the Administrative Conference, <em>see </em>Tomlinson, Discovery in Agency Adjudication, 1971 Duke L.J, 89, 125-33. <em>See also </em>Developments in Administrative Law \u2014 Discovery, 1970 Duke L.J. 149, 238-45. The liberal attitude toward discovery is represented in the more recent cases dealing with that subject. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Rex Disposables Div., 494 F.2d 588, 592 (5th Cir. 1974) and cases cited; Shively v. Stewart, 65 Cal.2d 475, 55 Cal.Rptr. 217, 421 P.2d 65 (1966). <em>But see </em>NLRB v. Interboro Contractors, Inc., 432 F.2d 854 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 915, 91 S.Ct. 1375, 28 L.Ed.2d 661 (1971). <em>Compare </em>FCC v.

Other cases concerning clearance revocations have assumed the validity of present procedures and did not concern revocation on the basis of mental illness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">. <em>See </em>Linn, <em>supra </em>note 38, at 649-51; Part I <em>supra. </em>There is almost no evidence in the record correlating Smith\u2019s symptoms allegedly indicating mental illness with specific failures of judgment which might lead to security breaches. There is no evidence of the sort of information Smith might be expected to safeguard or the types of risk of disclosure to which he would be subject. Dr. Spaulding alone gives some explanation of the manner in which manic depressive illness can affect one\u2019s judgment or reliability. The two types of errors he identifies are profligate expenditure of money (of which there is no evidence in the record) and bad judgment in one\u2019s associates. I Hearing Tr. at 35-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">We, of course, have no disagreement with the proposition that the Department of Defense need not wait until an individual has already violated security regulations in order to find that individual unfit for security clearance. It need not even prove there is a clear and present danger that the individual \u201cwould\u201d use confidential information in derogation of national security. Adams v. Laird, 136 U.S.App.D.C. 388, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039, 90 S.Ct. 1360, 25 L.Ed.2d 650 (1970). However, this does not mean that there need be no proven relationship between the conduct held to be disqualifying and the duties which the individual must perform in a manner consistent with the national security. The foregoing discussion should not be viewed as an approval of the view that the absence of prior security breaches has no material relevance to the issue of whether an individual is entitled to a security clearance. <em>See generally </em>Gayer v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Schlesinger, 160 U.S.App.D.C. 172, 490 F.2d 740, 749-50 (1973); Norton v.
