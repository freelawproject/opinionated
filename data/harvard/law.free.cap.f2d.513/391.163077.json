Witte, to alter his method of reporting gain derived from sale of certain real estate properties. The Tax Court held that since the taxpayer had been improperly reporting his gain he could correct his error without seeking permission from the Commissioner. The Commissioner contends that valid regulations and applicable case law require a taxpayer to secure approval of changes in accounting methods even when the taxpayer proposes to adopt the only correct method. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the decision of the Tax Court and remand the case for further proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A37\">The facts underlying the Commissioner\u2019s determination of deficiencies in ap-pellee\u2019s federal income taxes for calendar years 1962-64 are fully developed in the decision of the Tax Court. Herbert S. Witte, P-H Tax Ct.Mem. 1 72,232, at 1187-90 (1972). A brief overview of the basic dispute should provide sufficient background for the limited issue presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">In 1956 and 1957, appellee Witte and Robert C. Monroe acquired approximately 960 acres of unimproved real estate. After the land was subdivided, thirty parcels of approximately 20 acres each were sold under sales contracts providing for a 10% down payment and monthly principal and interest payments equal to 1% of the sales price.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Witte, a cash receipts and disbursements method taxpayer, reported gain derived from these sales under the \u201ccost recovery\u201d or \u201cdeferred payment\u201d method.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under that method, he initially treated income received from a sales contract as recovery of his basis in the property. Witte reported all income in excess of his basis as long-term capital gain in the year of receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s deficiency determination rested on his finding that the amounts reported in 1962-64 as long-term capital gain should be taxed as ordinary income since such amounts were in part interest income and in part income from the sale of property held primarily for sale. <em>See </em>Herbert S. Witte, <em>supra, </em>at 1191. In the Tax Court, appel-lee argued that the land sales were completed transactions when made and that the entire gain from the sales was properly reportable in 1956 \u2014 57 rather than upon receipt of monthly payments under the sales contracts. <em>See id. </em>at 1190-91. The Commissioner agreed that the cost recovery method was improperly invoked since the contracts had an ascertainable fair market value when entered into in 1956-57.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, he argued that the income was reportable in 1962-64 since appellee could not alter his long-standing method of reporting gain without obtaining consent under section 446(e) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Court concluded that the taxpayer could shift to the proper completed transaction method without the Commissioner\u2019s consent and therefore did not reach the other issues posed by the deficiency determination. <em>Id. </em>at 1193-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">II. MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">The Commissioner contends that the Tax Court erred in finding section 446(e) inapplicable. That section provides that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, a taxpayer who changes the method of accounting on the basis of which he regularly computes his income in keeping his books shall, before computing his taxable income under the new method, secure the consent of the Secretary or his delegate.\u201d The applicability of the consent requirement turns on two issues \u2014 (1) whether the change from \u201ccost recovery\u201d to completed transaction treatment of the land sales constitutes a change in appellee\u2019s \u201cmethod of accounting\u201d and (2) whether the consent requirement applies when the taxpayer substitutes a proper accounting method for an improper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The taxpayer\u2019s proposed shift from the cost recovery approach to completed transaction treatment constituted a \u201cchange in the method of accounting\u201d within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations. That term is specifically described as including \u201ca change in the overall plan of accounting\u201d or \u201ca change in the treatment of any material item.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.446-l(e)(2)(ii)(a) (1957). This case involves a \u201cchange in the treatment of [a] material item.\u201d The Tax Court opinion reveals that gain from payments for the 1962 \u2014 64 period totalled more than $88,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Taxpayer\u2019s proposed shift to completed transaction treatment \u201cinvolves the proper time for the inclusion of the item in income\u201d and thereby satisfies the definition of \u201cmaterial item\u201d set forth in the regulation. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.446-1(e)(2)(ii)(a), T.D. 7073, 1970 \u2014 2 Cum.Bull. 99. Accordingly, the threshold requirement for the applicability of the consent provision has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The principal question presented by this appeal concerns the validity of the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the taxpayer\u2019s. change in accounting method \u201cwas not precluded by section 446(e).\u201d Herbert S. Witte, <em>supra, </em>at 1193. That section states that consent is required \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter.\u201d The Tax Court made no reference to any section of the Code which \u201cexpressly\u201d sets forth an exception to the consent requirement. Counsel for appellee does not direct us to any such provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The Tax Court relied on Underhill, 45 T.C. 489 (1966), for the proposition that no consent is required when the taxpayer seeks to change from an improper to a proper accounting method. <em>See </em>Herbert S. Witte, <em>supra, </em>at 1193. Although the <em>Underhill </em>decision is distinguishable from the present controversy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it contains dicta suggesting that section 446(e) does not govern changes from an im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>proper to a proper accounting method. 45 T.C. at 497. We reject that approach as contrary to the applicable Treasury regulations and subversive of the underlying purpose of section 446(e)\u2019s consent requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Regulation 1.446-l(e)(2)(i) states that \u201c[c]onsent must be secured\u201d to change an accounting method \u201cwhether or not such method is proper or is permitted under the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder.\u201d T.D. 7073, 1970-2 Cum.Bull. 98. Two of the examples set forth in the regulations indicate that the Commissioner\u2019s consent to switch accounting methods is necessary \u201c[although [the present] method is not a proper method.\u201d Treas.Reg. 1.446-l(e)(2)(iii) (examples 7 &amp; 8), T.D. 7073, 1970-2 Cum.Bull. 100. Supreme Court decisions mandate that \u201cTreasury regulations must be sustained unless unreasonable and plainly inconsistent with the revenue statutes.\u201d Commissioner v. South Texas Lumber Co., 333 U.S. 496, 501, 68 S.Ct. 695, 92 L.Ed. 831 (1948); <em>see </em>United States v. Catto, 384 U.S. 102, 113, 86 S.Ct. 1311, 16 L.Ed.2d 398 (1966). The Tax Court made no finding that it would be unreasonable or inconsistent with the statute to require taxpayers to obtain consent before shifting from an invalid to a valid accounting method.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The purpose of the consent requirement is to enable the Commissioner to prevent distortions of income that often accompany changes in accounting methods by conditioning consent on the taxpayer\u2019s agreement to make correcting adjustments in his income tax payments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The danger of distortion of income detrimental to governmental revenues exists regardless of whether the change in method is from one proper method to another or from an improper method to a proper one.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The consent requirement has as much vitality in the latter case as in the former. A prescribed method of accounting is not an</p>\n<p id=\"ARr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ing that \u201cclearly reflects income.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And so it is that the Tax Court decisions subsequent to <em>Underhill, </em>which seem not to have caught the attention of the Tax Court in this case, have recognized that the purpose of the section 446(e) requirement demands its application <em>\u201ceven where the taxpayer\u2019s prior accounting method was improper.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And this is the view of the circuit courts of appeals.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> end in itself but rather a means toward fulfilling the statutory goal of account-</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The present case illustrates the salutary function of the consent requirement. Under the approach of the Tax Court opinion under review, the taxpayer might well avoid taxes on the gain from .the land sales by claiming that he was no longer required to report the payments received on the contracts as gain because that income was reportable in 1956-57, years now barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The consent provision serves to prevent such distortion of income by requiring that the taxpayer either make a correcting adjustment prior to abandoning the cost recovery reporting of his gain on the sales or continue to employ that method thereby assuring that the gain does not escape taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">There is language in decisions relied on by the Tax Court, and the taxpayer, saying that a taxpayer is entitled to correct an error.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Of course he is, but he is not entitled to do so in a way that may distort income. If the Commission-</p>\n<p id=\"AUq\">er had insisted on an adjustment that put an excessive condition on the correction of an error, it might well be held that he had abused his discretion to withhold approval of a change in accounting method. But that is not the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Our analysis of the statutory provisions, relevant regulations, and available precedents indicates that the Tax Court erred in finding section 446(e) inapplicable to this controversy. We remand the case for further proceedings with respect to the Commissioner\u2019s deficiency determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\">. The sales contracts contained an unconditional promise to pay the full purchase price and provided for 6% annual interest on the unpaid balance. Herbert S. Witte, <em>supra, </em>at 1188.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">. <em>See </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.453-6(a)(2) (1958).

Carlson, P-H Tax Ct.Mem. fi 67,116, at 583, 585 (1967), Dorr-Oliver, Inc., 40 T.C. 50, 54 (1963), the real estate sales at issue here come within the tests adopted in prior decisions. Several courts have relied on comparable dollar amounts to find materiality. <em>See </em>Commissioner v. O. Liquidating Corp., 292 F.2d 225, 230 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 898, 82 S.Ct. 177, 7 L.Ed.2d 94 (1961) ($114,000 insurance dividend deemed a material item); DorrOliver, <em>supra, </em>at 53, 55 (rejecting a percentage test of materiality in a case involving a corporation with approximately $1,000,000 net income and finding a $25,000 change in the treatment of a $87,000 vacation and holiday pay item to be material). Other courts have combined dollar amount with percentage of taxable income in determining materiality. <em>See </em>Broida, Stone &amp; Thomas, Inc. v. United States, 204 F.Supp. 841, 843 (N.D.W.Va.), aff\u2019d, 309 F.2d 486 (4th Cir. 1962) ($6,660 personal property tax item which would add 10% to taxable income found material); George C. Carlson, <em>supra, </em>at 585 ($6,920 in license fees constituting 8.5% of taxable income deemed material).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\">. <em>Underhill </em>involved an assessment of a deficiency based on payments received by the taxpayer on debt' obligations which he had purchased at a discount. Prior to the year in question, the taxpayer had reported a pro rata portion of the payments as income. In 1961, he changed to a cost recovery method of reporting without seeking or obtaining the consent of the Commissioner. The Tax Court stated that the \u201cissue before us is the extent to which payments received by the petitioner are taxable or nontaxable \u2014 i. e., the character of the payment \u2014 not the proper method or time of reporting an item the character of which is not in question.\u201d 45 T.C. at 496. The Third Circuit in Poorbaugh v. United States, 423 F.2d 157, 163 (3d Cir. 1970), cited this passage in support of its conclusion that <em>Underhill </em>provided \u201cno authority for the proposition that because an erroneous accounting method was adopted by the taxpayer he should not be subject to the tax consequences resulting from that method absent a consent to change it.\u201d Moreover, the court in <em>Underhill </em>ventured that in any event section 446(e)\u2019s consent requirement would not apply because there was no danger of \u201ca distortion of income \u2018to the detriment of the Government.\u2019 \u201d 45 T.C. at 496, <em>quoting </em>Commissioner v. O. Liquidating Corp., 292 F.2d 225, 230 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 898, 82 S.Ct. 177, 7 L.Ed.2d 94 (1961). The danger of distortion presented in this case provides a principled distinction of <em>Underhill </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>which the Tax Court overlooked. <em>See </em>discussion at text accompanying notes 7-12 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The other cases cited by the courts below are also distinguishable, In Perelman, 41 T.C. 234, 241-42 &amp; n.10 (1963), the Tax Court found that the Commissioner could \u201cfind no support in section 446(e) for his determinations since he was the one who caused the change to be made\u201d and noted that the deficiency would be incorrect \u201c[e]ven assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that petitioners did change their method of accounting without first seeking the permission of the Commissioner.\u201d Thompson-King-Tate, Inc. v. United States, 296 F.2d 290, 294-95 (6th Cir. 1961), found that a taxpayer which had previously elected the completed contract method of reporting income from long-term construction contracts could not deviate from that method without permission from the Commissioner. The Sixth Circuit concluded that, since no consent to change methods had been obtained by the taxpayer and the Commissioner had not exercised his authority to order a change in accounting method, the taxpayer erred in departing from his elected method and could correct his error. By contrast, the instant case involves the taxpayer\u2019s retroactive attempt to deviate from his long-standing albeit erroneous accounting method without obtaining permission from the Commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\">. <em>See </em>Commissioner v.

One assumes that the Commissioner could properly have denied a request to make such a change since the elected installment method clearly reflects income. Alternatively, the Commissioner could have conditioned the change on a correcting adjustment that would prevent appellee from avoiding tax on his gain from the land sales. We are hard pressed to understand why appellee\u2019s improper choice of the more advantageous cost recovery method should negate the consent provision and require the Commissioner to invoke the Code sections mitigating the statute of limitations in an attempt to correct the distortion of appellee\u2019s income.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">.
