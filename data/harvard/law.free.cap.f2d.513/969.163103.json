Young\u2019s petition herein represents the ninth chapter of a continuing legal saga wherein he has attempted to overturn a murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-20\">Young was convicted by a jury of murder on March 21, 1961. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on March 31, 1961. The Government\u2019s case was materially predicated on the testimony of Norma Sue Littlefield, who was an eyewitness when Young shot and killed her fianc\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-21\">Young alleged that he was denied a fair trial: (a) because of prejudicial and inflammatory remarks made by the prosecutor, (b) because the jury was improperly instructed, and (c) because the burden of proof was placed on him. In dismissing the application the Trial Court observed that it was Young\u2019s second habeas petition, that the first two allegations of error had been previously presented and determined adversely to him, and at that time they had not been presented to the State Courts of Oklahoma. The Trial Court found that the first two contentions of error were later presented to the Oklahoma State Courts which \u201clikewise ruled that no constitutional violations existed.\u201d The- Trial Court also held that the evidence proffered by Young was not supportive of his third alleged violation, i.e., that the burden of proof had been placed on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-22\">On appeal Young contends that the Trial Court erred in: (1) permitting the prosecutor to express his personal opinion of Young\u2019s guilt; (2) instructing the jury on reasonable doubt; and (3) in refusing to \u201corder in the trial records requested in appellant\u2019s Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Duces Tecum in which he complained about unconstitutional pre-trial investigations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>i.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Young contends that the Trial Court erred in permitting the prosecutor to express his personal opinion of Young\u2019s guilt during his summation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnX\">MR. SIMMS (The Prosecutor):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-7\">Gentlemen, I could go over this evidence, but I don\u2019t desire to repeat or take any more of your time, because I believe in my own mind and in my own heart to a moral certainty that Young is guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-8\">MR. McARTHUR (Defense Counsel): Now, Your Honor, we are going to object to that statement, invading the province of the jury, request the Court to admonish the jury not to consider it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-9\">THE COURT: You should tell the jury that\u2019s based entirely upon this evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-10\">MR. SIMMS: Yes, sir, based on the evidence, that\u2019s the way it seems to me. _ _</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">We have held that statements expressing an advocate\u2019s personal belief in the merits of the case are to be deplored. Devine v. United States, 403 F.2d 93 (10th Cir. 1968), cert. denied 394 U.S. 1003, 89 S.Ct. 1599, 22 L.Ed.2d 780 (1969). This holding was clearly enunciated in United States v. Martinez, 487 F.2d 973 (10th Cir. 1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-12\">we caution prosecuting attorneys that in their closing argument they should not, in an effort to bolster the credibility of a Government witness, place their own integrity, directly or indirectly, on the scales. Such is improper, and in the proper case may well result in a reversal which could have been easily avoided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-13\">487 F.2d at 977.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-14\">See also United States v. Ludwig, 508 F.2d 140 (10th Cir. 1974), wherein we reversed a conviction because the prosecuting attorney, during closing argument, emphatically and personally vouched for the integrity of the state police force.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-15\">The standard has been recently treated by the United States Supreme Court in Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). In that case the prosecuting attorney stated during summation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-16\">[they] hope that you find him not guilty. I quite frankly think that they hope that you find him guilty of something a little less than first-degree murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-17\">There, as here, the jury was instructed to disregard comments of counsel that were not in evidence. In holding that the remarks did not give rise to constitutional error, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-18\">. not every trial error or infirmity which might call for application of supervisory powers correspondingly constitutes a \u201cfailure to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice.\u201d Lisenba v. California, 314 U.S. 219, 236, 62 S.Ct. 280, 86 L.Ed. 166 (1941).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-19\">416 U.S. at 642, 94 S.Ct. at 1871.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-20\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-21\">The \u201cconsistent and repeated misrepresentation\u201d of a dramatic exhibit in evidence may profoundly impress a jury and may have a significant impact on the jury\u2019s deliberations. <em>Isolated passages of a prosecutor\u2019s argument, billed in advance to the jury as a matter of opinion not of evidence, do not reach the same proportions. </em>Such arguments, like all closing arguments of counsel, are seldom carefully constructed <em>in toto </em>before the event; improvisation frequently results in syntax left imperfect and meaning less than crystal clear. While these general observations in no way justify pros-ecutorial misconduct, <em>they do suggest that a court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-22\">416 U.S. at 646-647, 94 S.Ct. at 1873.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>Applying this standard, we hold that, under the facts of this case, the prosecutor\u2019s comment did not give rise to constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Young contends that the Trial Court committed reversible error when it defined \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d The instruction provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-6\">When all the evidence in the case, carefully analyzed, compared and weighed by you, produces in your minds a settled conviction or belief of the defendant\u2019s guilt, such' a conviction as you would be willing to act upon in matters of highest importance relating to your own affairs, when it leaves your minds in an abiding conviction amounting to a moral certainty of the truth of the charge, then, and in that event you would be free from a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">Young cites Templer v. State, 494 P.2d 667 (Okl.Ct.Crim.App.1972), decided eleven years following his conviction, for the proposition that instructions defining reasonable doubt should not be given and that such an instruction can give rise to reversible error. Other cases are cited supportive of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">In determining whether a particular instruction submitted to the jury gives rise to reversible error, we must view such instruction <em>as part of a totality </em>of the entire instructions given. United States v. Smaldone, 485 F.2d 1333 (10th Cir. 1973), cert. denied 416 U.S. 936, 94 S.Ct. 1934, 40 L.Ed.2d 286; (1974) United States v. Fletcher, 444 F.2d 619 (10th Cir. 1971); Devine v. United States, <em>supra. </em>The necessity of avoiding an isolated review of a particular instruction was recently discussed in Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeVu\">In determining the effect of this instruction on the validity of respondent\u2019s conviction, we accept at the outset the well-established proposition that a single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. Boyd v. United States, 271 U.S. 104, 107, [46 S.Ct. 442, 443, 70 L.Ed.2d 857] (1926). While this does not mean that an instruction by itself may never rise to the level of a constitutional error, see Cool v. United States, 409 U.S. 100, [93 S.Ct. 354, 34 L.Ed.2d 335] (1972), it does recognize that a judgment of conviction is commonly the culmination of a trial which includes testimony of witnesses, argument of counsel, receipt of exhibits in evidence, and instruction of the jury by the judge. Thus not only is the challenged instruction but one of many such instructions, but the process of instruction itself is but one of several components of the trial which may result in the judgment of conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ahn-dedup-0\">414 U.S. at 146-147, 94 S.Ct. at 400.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aoz-dedup-0\">In <em>Cupp </em>the Court further cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aif\">Before a federal court may overturn a conviction resulting from a state trial in which this instruction was used, it must be established not merely that the instruction is undesirable, erroneous, or even \u201cuniversally condemned,\u201d but that it violated some right which was guaranteed to the defendant by the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-11\">414 U.S. at 146, 94 S.Ct. at 400.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aaw-dedup-0\">Young has not shown that the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d instruction herein complained of violated a right guaranteed him by the Fourteenth Amendment. We thus hold that the State Trial Court did not commit reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-13\">Young contends that the Trial Court erred in refusing to \u201corder in the Trial records requested in appellant\u2019s Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Duces Tecum in which he complained about unconstitutional pre-trial investigations.\u201d Since there were no factual issues alleged in the habeas application which would render it necessary for the Federal Trial Judge to examine the State trial transcript, constituting allegations giving rise to any federal constitutional violations, we hold that the Trial Court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>not err in refusing to order in the transcripts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">The relevancy and materiality of evidence are matters within the sound discretion of the Trial Court. That judgment will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is a clear showing of abuse of discretion. United States v. Ray, 488 F.2d 15 (10th Cir. 1973); United States v. Twilligear, 460 F.2d 79 (10th Cir. 1972). The bald allegations of alleged \u201cunconstitutional\u201d pre-trial investigations are here presented in a vacuum, rising no higher than possible, conjectural or speculative prejudice, none of which warrant reversal, where, as here, the evidence of guilt is strong. United States v. Harpel, 493 F.2d 346 (10th Cir. 1974); United States v. Jackson, 482 F.2d 1167 (10th Cir. 1973), cert. denied 414 U.S. 1159, 94 S.Ct. 918, 39 L.Ed.2d 111 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">. Under proper circumstances we have held that defendants making a direct appeal and not a collateral, habeas attack, are entitled to free transcripts of prior trials. See United States v. Acosta, 495 F.2d 60 (10th Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1045-6\">HOLLOWAY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"a9g-dedup-0\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">I concur in parts II and III of the court\u2019s opinion. As to Part I, I concur in the result but wish to add these brief comments on the issue of the prosecutor\u2019s argument which has troubled me.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">The trial record shows no instruction that closing arguments are not evidence for the jury to consider, as in Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 641, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431. Nor do we have any argument transcript showing that counsel made such a statement, except as the prosecuting attorney\u2019s statement, quoted in the court\u2019s opinion, may so indicate. (Casemade, 347A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have the trial court\u2019s admonition (following the comment and objection) that \u201cYou should tell the jury that\u2019s based entirely upon this ' evidence . . . \u201d and counsel\u2019s response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-12\">Yes, sir, based on the evidence, that\u2019s the way it seems to me. And Young, even in spite of the fact that he is a murderer, is a very fortunate man in a lot of ways, as compared to Dale. Because there he sits, two court appointed attorneys to talk for him. He is entitled to have his guilt or innocence, the question of whether he should live or die, passed on by you twelve jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">The appellant\u2019s petition alleged that the argument quoted in the Court\u2019s opinion and other argument violated his constitutional right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and other rights, and the issue is troublesome on this record. However, I agree with the conclusion that constitutional error is not shown, considering the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">Instruction 13 told the jurors, among other things, that they were the judges of the facts, and that they should not let sympathy, sentiment or prejudice enter into their deliberations, and lastly that they should \u201creturn such verdict as the evidence warrants when measured by these instructions.\u201d (Casemade, 344). Instruction 15 charged, among other things, that the jury should apply the instructions to the evidence in the case and \u201cin so doing endeavor to arrive at a just and true verdict under all the instructions and all the evidence in this case, and return such verdict into court.\u201d (Casemade, 345).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-15\">Lastly I note that when the trial judge overruled a motion for a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s statement of opinion of guilt, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-16\">As the matter stands before the jury now, I just told them he expresses that opinion based upon the evidence in this case. And I am certain that the jury understands that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>try to connote that he had any information that they do not have. (Case-made, 348).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Under the circumstances I agree that we should not hold that such comment constituted a denial of due process, as did the First Circuit in dealing with such an issue. See DeChristoforo v. Donnelly, 473 F.2d 1236, 1238.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">. This court has been furnished the original record or \u201cCasemade\u201d by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. It does not contain a transcription of the full arguments and apparently the only portion transcribed was that where the objection occurred to the comment containing the prosecutor\u2019s opinion of guilt.
