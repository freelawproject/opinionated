I. In January 1974 the Internal Revenue Service filed a tax lien on all Warren\u2019s property. In June the service levied on and took possession of the garage, denying Eric access to the premises and certain of his own personal property located thereon. This levy was released two days later when Warren agreed to make payments satisfying his outstanding tax liabilities. In July Eric brought suit to obtain a declaration that the government had no right to seize property held jointly with his son or owned outright. He also sought an injunction restraining the United States from levying on these interests to satisfy Warren\u2019s tax deficiencies. The district court dismissed on jurisdictional grounds and Eric appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-23\">It is well settled that the United States may not be sued absent \u2022 a waiver of its sovereign immunity. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>e. <em>g., </em>Honda v. Clark, 386 U.S. 484, 501, 87 S.Ct. 1188, 18 L.Ed.2d 244 (1967). Nickerson claims to have found such a waiver in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which he alleges should be construed to permit such suit whenever there has been a levy even if, as in the present case, the levy has been released and is no longer outstanding. While the wording of the statute does not specifically foreclose such a construction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at least one court has refused to enjoin a threatened first levy noting that the statute reaches only \u201cexisting\u201d levies, American Pacific Investment Corp. v. Nash, 342 F.Supp. 797, 799 (D.N.J.1972), and no other court has exercised jurisdiction absent such a levy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This construction derives support from the fact that the exclusive remedies of subsection (b) seem to contemplate an existing levy. Mindful of the principle that waivers of sovereign immunity are to be strictly construed, McMahon v. United States, 342 U.S. 25, 27, 72 S.Ct. 17, 96 L.Ed. 26 (1951), we believe the district court correctly held \u00a7 7426 inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Nickerson also adverts to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(a)(1) providing that the United States may be named a party in a civil action to quiet title to property in which it claims a lien, but the lien against Warren\u2019s property does not encumber Eric\u2019s joint interest, so this section is inapplicable. Shaw v. United States, 331 F.2d 493, 497-98 (9th Cir. 1964).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, does not confer jurisdiction but merely grants an additional remedy in cases where jurisdiction already exists. Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950). Hence it does not avail Nickerson.</p>\n<p id=\"Al0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-6\">. \u201c(a) <em>Actions </em>Permitted.\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">(1) <em>Wrongful levy. </em>\u2014 If a levy has been made on property or property has been sold pursuant to a levy, any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in or lien on such property and that such property was wrongfully levied upon may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States. Such action may be brought without regard to whether such property has been surrendered to or sold by the Secretary or his delegate.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\">. The last sentence of the subsection is intended to preserve jurisdiction even after the levy has been executed and the property sold. It does not support the contention that an action may be brought after a levy has been released.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\">. In United Pacific Insurance Co. v. United States, 320 F.Supp. 450 (D.Ore. 1970), the court held that a notice of lien entitled \u201cTax Levy\u201d was in fact the equivalent of a levy for purposes of this section. If this was the correct result it is obviously confined to the specific circumstances in question. The court acknowledged that it had no jurisdiction when there had been no levy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b105-23\">. In Shaw a tax lien against the husband\u2019s joint interest was held not to encumber the wife\u2019s joint interest in the same property, and the court held that she had no cause of action under \u00a7 2410. Pettengill v. United States, 205 F.Supp. 10 (D.Vt. 1962) is distinguishable in that it involved a tax lien against the husband\u2019s interest in property owned by the entireties with but a single title and not liable under local law for his sole debts. Moreover, the court held that the government had waived its jurisdictional objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
