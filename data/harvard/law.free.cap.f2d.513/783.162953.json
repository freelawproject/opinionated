Careful examination of the record shows that the trial judge\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous. As to the claim of appellant that any award of damages in excess of $20,000 was foreclosed by Grubbs\u2019 failure to cross-appeal and complain of the initial award in this amount (which was specifically denied by the trial judge by order dated February 26, 1974, but not mentioned in his memorandum of decision dated July 18, 1974, and which is the basis of our affirmance) we need only point to the language of this court on remand of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-16\">Needless to say, we cannot accept the trial court\u2019s award of $20,000 as a blanket recovery for \u201cdestruction of Grubbs\u2019 business.\u201d . . . On remand Grubbs\u2019 recovery is to be limited to (1) credit for \u201ctrust receipt\u201d merchandise which was not credited to him when trust receipts financing was terminated, (2) Grubbs\u2019 losses on accounts which he had the sole right to collect, caused by the mailing of the \u201cdirect pay\u201d notices, and (3) credit for merchandise wrongfully repossessed from Grubbs\u2019 customers and sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-18\">. [W]e reverse the award of $20,000 in damages on Grubbs\u2019 counterclaim, and remand for a precise determination of damages on his counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-19\">478 F.2d 53, 58-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
