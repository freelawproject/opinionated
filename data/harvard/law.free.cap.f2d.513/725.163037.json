In ' May, 1972, the Department notified plaintiff that, pursuant to \u00a7 12-12 of the Illinois Mental Health Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he owed the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>$50 per month, effective November, 1971, for treatment afforded his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">After receiving an administrative hearing, after which the imposition of the $50 charge was reaffirmed, plaintiff commenced this suit as a class action,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging that \u00a7 <em>12 </em>\u2014 12 was unconstitutional <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and seeking to enjoin the defendant from bringing suit against plaintiff and other members of the class to collect such charges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff noted in his complaint that the case appeared to be an appropriate one for the convening of a three-judge court, and subsequently so moved. Defendant moved to dismiss for, <em>inter alia, </em>failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">On June 5, 1974, in an unreported Memorandum Opinion and Order, District Judge McGarr denied plaintiff\u2019s motion to convene a three-judge court and granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. In so ruling, the district judge concluded that plaintiff\u2019s attacks on the constitutionality of \u00a7 12-12 were \u201cobviously without merit.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because we determine that at least one of plaintiff\u2019s constitutional arguments has sufficient substance to meet the standards set forth in Goosby v. Osser, 409 U.S. 512, 93 S.Ct. 854, 35 L.Ed.2d 36, we conclude that the district court erred in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to convene a three-judge court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">In <em>Goosby, </em>the Supreme Court repeated the tests to be applied by a single district judge in deciding whether the convening of a three-judge district court is necessary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281 does not require the convening of a three-judge court when the constitutional attack upon the state statutes is insubstantial. \u201cConstitutional insubstantiality\u201d for this purpose has been equated with such concepts as \u201cessentially fictitious,\u201d Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U.S. [31], at 33, 82 S.Ct. 549 [7 L.Ed.2d 512]; \u201cwholly insubstantial,\u201d <em>ibid.; </em>\u201cobviously frivolous,\u201d Hannis Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, 216 U.S. 285, 288, 30 S.Ct. 326, 327, 54 L.Ed. 482 (1910); and \u201cobviously without merit,\u201d Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 32, 54 S.Ct. 3, 4-5, 78 L.Ed. 152 (1933). The limiting words \u201cwholly\u201d and \u201cobviously\u201d have cogent legal significance. In the context of the effect of prior decisions upon the substantiality of constitutional claims, those words import that claims are constitutionally insubstantial only if the prior decisions inescapably render the claims frivolous; previous decisions that merely render claims of doubtful or questionable merit do not render them insubstantial for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281. A claim is insubstantial only if \u201c \u2018its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the questions sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\u2019 \u201d Ex parte Poresky, <em>supra, </em>at 32, 54 S.Ct. 3, quoting from Hannis Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, <em>supra, </em>216 U.S. at 288, 30 S.Ct. 326; see also Levering &amp; Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, 289 U.S. 103, 105-106, 53 S.Ct. 549, 77 L.Ed. 1062 (1933); McGilvra v. Ross, 215 U.S. 70, 80, 30 S.Ct. 27, 31, 54 L.Ed. 95 (1909).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Goosby v. Osser, 409 U.S. 512, 518, 93 S.Ct. 854, 858, 35 L.Ed.2d 36. If a plaintiff raises at least one constitutional issue that is not \u201cessentially fictitious,\u201d \u201cwholly insubstantial,\u201d \u201cobviously frivolous,\u201d or \u201cobviously without merit,\u201d a single district judge does not possess the jurisdiction to rule on the merits of any of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">We believe that the plaintiff has met that burden in this case when he argues that the requirement that children of indigent parents receiving treatment from the Department of Mental Health pay up to $50 per month for support of such parents, while children of indigent parents receiving assistance from the Department of Public Aid need not, denies him equal protection of the laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">There is no common law requirement, apart from statute, in Illinois that children support their indigent parents. People v. Hill, 163 Ill. 186, 189, 46 N.E. 796, 797 (1896); Robertson v. White, 11 Ill.App.2d 177, 180, 136 N.E.2d 550, 552 (1956); Shaver v. Brierton, 1 Ill.App.2d 192, 195, 117 N.E.2d 298, 299 (1954); Schwerdt v. Schwerdt, 141 Ill.App. 386, 390, aff\u2019d, 235 Ill. 386, 85 N.E. 613 (1908). Illinois did, however, require such support by statute for many years. <em>See </em>Rogers v. Rogers, 51 Ill.App. 683, 686 (1893). Until 1967, the Public Assistance Code required children to support their parents who were receiving public assistance. With the enactment of the Public Aid Code in that year, however, children were dropped from the definition of \u201clegally responsible relatives\u201d who could be required to provide such support. <em>See </em>Ill.Rev.Stats.1973, ch. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 2-11, 10 \u2014 2. Thus, it is only the children of indigent mental patients who are singled out for liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">Where no \u201csuspect classification\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or \u201cfundamental right\u201d is involved, the test for determining whether a legislative classification scheme is consonant with the Fourteenth Amend-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>merit\u2019s equal protection guarantee is whether the line drawn by the legislature bears \u201csome rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose.\u201d Weber v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 406 U.S. 164, 172, 92 S.Ct. 1400, 1405, 31 L.Ed.2d. 768; McDonald v. Board of Election Commissioners, 394 U.S. 802, 809, 89 S.Ct. 1404, 22 L.Ed.2d 739; McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393; Estelle v. Dorrough, - U.S. -, 95 S.Ct. 1173, 43 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975). While we do not wish to suggest that a rational explantion for the aforementioned differing treatment does not exist, no such explanation is clear upon the face of the statutes involved. Counsel for defendant has not yet provided one. As the Memorandum Opinion of the district court did not address this particular contention of the plaintiff, it contains no explanation for the disparate treatment either.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given the fact that this disparity has existed only since 1967, this does not appear to be a case where reform is occurring \u201cone step at a time\u201d or where the legislature has \u201cselect[ed] one phase of one field [to] apply a remedy there, neglecting the others,\u201d as discussed in Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S.Ct. 461, 465, 99 L.Ed. 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Nor is this a case where prior decisions of the Supreme Court \u201cforeclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the questions sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\u201d There does not appear to be any directly analogous Supreme Court precedent. And, although we recognize that state statutes of the kind here challenged are common<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and have been held valid in the face of numerous constitutional challenges,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> none of the decisions surveyed involved a constitutional attack similar to that raised by the plaintiff in this case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">Of course, nothing we say here is intended in any way to intimate a view on the merits of this controversy. We simply hold that, as plaintiff has raised a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 12 \u2014 12 of the Illinois Mental Health Code that cannot be termed \u201cwholly insubstantial\u201d or \u201cobviously frivolous,\u201d the district court erred in not convening a three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">Accordingly, the order of the district court dismissing the complaint is vacated and the order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to convene a three-judge court is reversed. The ' case is remanded to the district court \u201cwith direction to enter an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>appropriate order pursuant to [\u00a7 2281] for the convening of a three-judge court to hear and determine the merits of [appellant\u2019s] constitutional claims.\u201d Goosby v. Osser, 409 U.S. at 522, 93 S.Ct. at 861.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-10\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\">\u201cAn interlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of any State statute by restraining the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such statute or of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under State statutes, shall not be granted by any district court or judge thereof upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute unless the application therefor is heard and determined by a district court of three judges under section 2284 of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-12\">. Section 12-12, codified as Ill.Rev.Stat.1973, ch. 91V2, \u00a7 12-12, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-13\">\"\u2018Each patient receiving treatment in a mental health program of the Department, and the estate of such patient, is liable for the payment of sums representing charges for treatment of such patient at a rate to be determined by the Department in accordance with this Section. If such patient is unable to pay or if the estate of such patient is insufficient, the responsible relatives are severally liable for the paym\u00e9nt of such sums, or for the balance due in case less than the amount prescribed under this Act has been paid. The maximum treatment charges for each patient assessed against responsible relatives collectively may not exceed $50 per month, except that where the patient is placed in a nursing home or other facility outside the Department, the Department may pay the actual cost of treatment, maintenance or residence in such facility and may collect reimbursement for the entire amount paid from the patient, or an amount not to exceed $50 per month from responsible relatives according to their proportionate ability to contribute to such charges. The liability of each responsible relative for payment of treatment charges ceases when payments on the basis of financial ability have been made for a total of 12 years for any patient, and any portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>such 12-year period during which a responsible relative has been determined by the Department to be financially unable to pay any treatment charges must be included in fixing the total period of liability. No child is liable under this Act for treatment of a parent who wilfully failed to contribute to the support of such child for a period of at least 5 years during his minority. No wife is liable under this Act for the treatment of a husband who wilfully failed to contribute to her support for a period of 5 years immediately preceding his hospitalization. Any child or wife claiming exemption because of such wilful failure to support during any such 5-year period must furnish the Department with clear and convincing evidence substantiating such claim. No parent is liable under this Act for the treatment charges incurred by a child after such child reaches the age of majority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The term \u201cresponsible relative\u201d is defined, for purposes of the Mental Health Code, to mean \u201cthe spouse, parent or parents, child or children of patients receiving care and treatment in mental health facilities or programs of the Department.\u201d Ill.Rev.Stat.1973, ch. 91V2, \u00a7 1-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\">. Plaintiff brought this action on behalf of himself and \u201call other persons whose parents are hospitalized in a mental institution and who are subject to a special tax imposed by the Illinois Department of Mental Health pursuant to \u00a7 12-12 of the Illinois Mental Health Code Chapter 91\u2018/2 \u00a7 12-12 Illinois Revised Statute.\u201d First Amended Complaint, para. 1. On April 8, 1974, plaintiff moved for leave to proceed as a class. The record before us does not contain the required Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1) ruling on this motion by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b799-10\">. Plaintiff argues that: (1) he is denied equal protection because, while children of indigent mental health patients are liable for support of their parents, no such liability is imposed on the children of parents receiving benefits from the Department of Public Aid; (2) the statute unreasonably distinguishes between those children who were willfully unsupported by their parents and those children, like the plaintiff, who received no support for other reasons or who were in fact supported by their parents; (3) the statute places a burden on children, like the plaintiff, who do not have other siblings; (4) in making all \u201cresponsible relatives\u201d severally liable, the statute permits the Department of Mental Health arbitrarily to decide against whom to enforce the liability; and (5) because the children of an involuntarily hospitalized parent receive no greater benefits from the commitment than the public at large, it is a violation of equal protection to single them out to bear this expense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b799-15\">. Additionally, plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment as to \u00a7 12-12\u2019s unconstitutionality, restitution of all money illegally seized from the members of the class under \u00a7 12-12, and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b799-16\">. It is undisputed that the other conditions precedent to the convening of a three-judge court under \u00a7 2281 were met. That is, \u201cthe action sought to enjoin a state official from executing statutes of state-wide application [,] and the complaint at least formally alleged a basis for equitable relief.\u201d Gonzalez v. Automatic Employees Credit Union, 419 U.S. 90, 94, 95 S.Ct. 289, 292, 42 L.Ed.2d 249 (1974) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b799-17\">. There is no doubt that an appeal from the district court\u2019s order properly lies in this court. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>supra n. 6 at n. 19, 95 S.Ct. at 295 n. 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\">.

Since we conclude that plaintiff has demonstrated the existence of a not-insubstantial constitutional issue under the less strict \u201crational relationship\u201d test, we need not decide plaintiff\u2019s novel argument that in focusing on children of indigent mental patients, Illinois creates an inherently suspect classification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\">.
