The District Court ordered the United States to pay Appellees $31,661 in compensatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>and punitive damages for wrongfully inducting Clyde Fitch into the Armed Forces. The United States argues that two exceptions to the Act apply, that Appellee Clyde Fitch was contributorily negligent, and that an award of damages is inappropriate even if liability is found. Because we find that the misrepresentation exception to the Act bars liability, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">In November 1969, a national lottery was held to determine the order in which young men would be drafted into the Armed Forces. Clyde Fitch received number 309, which should have guaranteed that he not be drafted. An error at Local Board 69 in Inez, Kentucky resulted in transcription of his number as 132. Eligible men with this number were inducted. Clyde Fitch received his induction notice and, after losing an appeal based on his wife\u2019s pregnancy and financial hardship, he reported for active duty on July 13, 1970. While stationed in Viet Nam, on July 9, 1971, Fitch was informed by an Army sergeant that his induction had been a mistake because of the erroneous assignment of his lottery number. Three months later he was discharged from active duty. Fitch was not relieved of his military obligations, however, because he was induced by Army personnel to sign an Army Reserves agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">The District Court held that the erroneous assignment of Fitch\u2019s lottery number established the United States\u2019 liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. It assessed $11,661 in damages representing lost wages. It also held that Appellees had established \u201ca right to punitive damages and such damages are assessed at $20,000.\u201d Finally, the District Court stated that Fitch\u2019s Reserve agreement \u201cwas obtained by misrepresentation\u201d and held that the agreement \u201cis void and [Fitch] is hereby relieved of the obligations thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">We agree with the District Court that just as citizen owes Government an obligation to aid in its defense, so Government owes citizen the duty of fair, equitable, and just treatment. While we sympathize with Appellees\u2019 plight and cannot condone the negligence which caused Clyde Fitch\u2019s induction, we must reverse the award because the District Court acted beyond the authority Congress has given it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">The Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) and 2671 et seq., is a broad waiver of the federal government\u2019s immunity from liability for the torts of its employees while acting in the scope of their employment. The Act contains various exceptions, however,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in construing the Act the courts must \u201ccarry out the legislative purpose of allowing suits against the Government for negligence with due regard for the statutory exceptions to that policy.\u201d Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 31, 73 S.Ct. 956, 965, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h), Congress has chosen not to allow the courts to consider \u201cany claim arising out of misrepresentation.\u201d We must construe this term according to \u201cthe traditional and commonly understood legal definition of the tort.\u201d United States v. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696, 706, 81 S.Ct. 1294, 1300, 6 L.Ed.2d 614 (1961). It is settled that this exception includes claims arising out of negligent as well as intentional misrepresentation. <em>Neustadt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-12\">Although Appellees cast their complaint in the guise of a negligence action, this does not automatically take the case outside the misrepresentation exception. Courts must \u201clook beyond the literal meaning of the language to ascertain the real cause of complaint.\u201d Hall v. United States, 274 F.2d 69, 71 (10th Cir. 1959), <em>quoted with approval </em>United States v. Neustadt, 366 U.S. at 703, 81 S.Ct. 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-13\">In <em>Hall, </em>the plaintiff sold his cattle at a market loss after Government inspectors mistakenly reported that his cattle were diseased. Hall argued that the inspectors\u2019 negligent testing rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>than the erroneous report had caused his loss and sued the United States under the Act. The Tenth Circuit rejected this attempt to avoid the misrepresentation exception, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s loss came about when the Government agents misrepresented the condition of the cattle, telling him they were diseased when, in fact, they were free from disease. This stated a cause of action predicated on a misrepresentation. 274 F.2d at 71.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">As in <em>Hall,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Appellees\u2019 complaint \u201carose out of\u201d a negligent misrepresentation. It occurred when Government agents misrepresented Clyde Fitch\u2019s obligation to enter the Army, telling him that he was required to serve when, in fact, he was free from that duty. We are under the same obligation to dismiss the complaint as the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Neustadt:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1088-7\">While we do not condone carelessness by government employees in gathering and promulgating such information, neither can we justifiably ignore the plain words Congress has used in limiting the scope of the Government\u2019s tort liability. 366 U.S. at 710-11, 81 S.Ct. at 1302.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1088-12\">Because of our holding, we need not address Appellant\u2019s other contentions. We note, however, that the District Court awarded punitive damages in contravention of the explicit bar of punitive awards stated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. We point out, furthermore, that the District Court had no jurisdiction to relieve Clyde Fitch of his Reserve obligations, recognizing as it did that his Reserve agreement \u201cwas obtained by misrerpresentation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, we observe that our action dismisses Appellees\u2019 complaint for lack of jurisdiction and does not jeopardize their opportunity to secure compensation from Congress for the injustice that befell them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-13\">The Judgment of the District Court is reversed, with direction that an order be entered dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1087-14\">. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">. The Circuits have uniformly applied this analysis in barring actions which arose out of misrepresentations by Government employees. Rey v. United States, 484 F.2d 45 (5th Cir. 1973) (negligent misrepresentation that hogs were diseased, resulting in innoculations which killed several hogs); Reamer v. United States, 459 F.2d 709 (4th Cir. 1972) (misrepresentation that plaintiff could defer active duty until completion of law school semester if he enlisted, resulting in monetary loss upon earlier order to active duty); Mizokami v. United States, 414 F.2d 1375, 188 Ct.Cl. 736, (1969) (negligent misrepresentation that spinach was contaminated, resulting in harm to business); De-Lange v. United States, 372 F.2d 134 (9th Cir. 1967) (communicated misdiagnosis by physician); Vaughn v. United States, 259 F.Supp. 286 (N.D.Miss.1966) (misrepresentation of pipeline placement on Government map, resulting in explosion upon impact of plaintiff\u2019s dragline); Steinmasel v. United States, 202 F.Supp. 335 (D.S.D.1962) (misrepresentation of deadline for requesting veterans benefits, resulting in ineligibility for educational benefits); Anglo-American &amp; Overseas Corp. v.

The Federal Tort Claims Act merely authorizes damage awards for certain claimants and does not give the federal courts the right to exercise the powers of a court of equity to void agreements between the United States and private parties. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). We express no view on the merits of Fitch\u2019s claim that his Reserve contract was improperly obtained, as this complaint should be pressed through proper channels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1088-16\">.
