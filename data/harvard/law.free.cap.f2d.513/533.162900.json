KAUFMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b606-20\">The facts relevant to the convictions of these appellants, defendants in a far-ranging narcotics conspiracy, are set forth in United States v. Bynum, 485 F.2d 490 (2d Cir. 1973), and thus need not be repeated here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequent to its decisions in United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 40 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974), and United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S. 562, 94 S.Ct. 1849, 40 L.Ed.2d 380 (1974), the Supreme Court vacated the judgment of this court and remanded for further consideration in light of those cases. On June 18, 1974, we remanded to the district court for appropriate reconsideration of the admissibility of wiretap interceptions introduced at trial, and after hearing evidence relevant to the procedures followed for authorization, Judge Pollack concluded that <em>Gior-dano </em>and <em>Chavez </em>did not require suppression. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-21\">On this occasion, the appellants claim that Judge Travia\u2019s extension order permitting interceptions to continue over telephone number 212-342 \u2014 6203 until March 3, 1971 was improperly authorized, since neither Attorney General Mitchell nor an Assistant specially designated by him approved the application. We note at the outset that appellants Abraham Wright, Lance Small, Newbry Mitchell, Jacqueline Fuller Dyson, John Coniglio, Angelo Mele, Vincent Altamu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ra, Irving Birnbaum, John Feroldi, Charles Tuzzolino, and Levis Nedd did not participate in the four \u201cextension\u201d conversations here in dispute, nor did any of them have an interest in the premises at 655 Linden Blvd. They are, consequently, not \u201caggrieved persons\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510(11) and 2518(10)(a), and have no standing to contest the admission of the evidence at their trial. United States v. Capra, 501 F.2d 267, 281 (2d Cir. 1974); United States v. Garcilaso de la Vega, 489 F.2d 761, 763 (2d Cir. 1974); 1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2185.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"> Fannie Mae Barnett, as a resident at 855 Linden, would obviously have standing to object to introduction of the four conversations if they provided evidence against her. But none of the calls referred to her directly or indirectly, and it was never claimed that they constituted proof of her participation in the conspiracy. Thus any error as to Garnett was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Although we agree with Bynum\u2019s and Cordovano\u2019s contention that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(5) contemplates an authorization procedure for extensions similar to that required for initial applications,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that the contents of the four extension recordings introduced were merely cumulative as to them. Little was added to the Government\u2019s case against Cordovano by the introduction of calls # # 2312 and 2463 (Govt. Exhibits 75, 85) in which he participated. Both George Stewart and Charles Moody testified about direct narcotics dealings with Cordovano. Moreover, he was arrested in possession of cocaine, and a sub-machine gun described by Moody as belonging to him was found in a neighbor\u2019s house. Finally, the recordings of ten other telephone conversations in which he participated between February 20 and March 6, 1971, all properly intercepted, provided both additional evidence and corroboration of Stewart\u2019s testimony. It is clear to us from \u201cour own reading of the record and what seems to us to have been the probable impact ... on the minds of an average jury,\u201d Harrington, v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S.CT. 1726, 1728, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969), that admission of the extension interceptions against Cordovano was at most harmless error. Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U.S. 371, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 33 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972); Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S. 427, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">We reach a similar conclusion as to Bynum. Stewart not only testified about his own numerous dealings with Bynum, but provided a sample of cut cocaine received from Bynum on January 10, 1971, and the $65,000 in cash delivered to him at Bynum\u2019s request on February 25, 1971. Moody testified concerning Bynum\u2019s part in planning the aborted Washington, D. C. robbery. And By-num himself admitted having been at the places where he had been observed by agents Theodore Handoga and Richard Moser. Finally, an examination of the calls themselves shows that their direct evidentiary and corroborative value was at best minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Affirmed. The judgment of this court vacated June 18, 1974 is reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-22\">. <em>See also </em>United States v.
