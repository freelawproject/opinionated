Clark was awarded $5000 in damages and Travis was awarded $1500.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">As shown by the evidence, at 10:00 p.m. on January 11, 1971, defendant and a fellow police officer responded in their squad car to a radio dispatch providing: \u201cEntry in progress. Three Negro males on the scene across from 3175 North 29th Street\u201d in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. When the officers arrived on the scene, they found the two principal plaintiffs, each 13 years of age, and 14-year-old Joseph French outside 3164 North 29th Street. They had been ringing the front and rear doorbells of the almost unlighted home of Mrs. Emma Schwister, who thereupon called the police. Upon observing the police officers, Clark, Travis and French ran directly to the edge of the lot located at 3160 North 29th Street. Believing that plaintiffs, who were five to ten yards away from defendant when he first observed them, had attempted to commit a burglary, defendant pursued them and ordered them to halt. When defendant gave a second command to halt, the fleeing Travis turned back toward defendant. Travis was wielding a thin 12\" steel blue file which, defendant claims, resembled a long-barreled revolver. At that moment, defendant fired a warning shot over plaintiffs\u2019 heads. When, moments later, Travis again turned toward defendant with the file in his hand, defendant discharged his shotgun, wounding both Clark and Travis. When the shotgun blast that injured them was fired, plaintiffs were approximately 45 feet from defendant in the gangway adjacent to 3160 North 29th Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">At the conclusion of the trial, the district court made certain findings from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the bench. Preliminarily, the court ruled that plaintiffs had the burden of showing by the preponderance of the evidence that there was unreasonable force applied. The court also stated that much of the plaintiffs\u2019 credibility was in doubt. The court then remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201cI also believe that the officers were justified in believing that there was a felony in progress, that all the circumstances of the telephone calls reporting the alleged felony in progress, coupled with finding the three men at about the right place without any apparent justification for their having innocently come upon Mrs. Schwister\u2019s locale, all lead me to believe that the officers were entitled to conclude that there was probable cause to believe that a felony either had been committed or was in progress and that these three men reasonably were ones who had engaged in it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Judge Gordon then remarked that he would have to evaluate whether the circumstances warranted defendant\u2019s use of a gun, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">\u201cOn the one hand, we have a felony in progress; we have probable cause to believe that the three men who were observed were perpetrators of that felony; we have darkness; we have failure to halt, at least by several of the suspected perpetrators. On the other hand, we have great force used \u2014shotgun; we have juvenile perpetrators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">\u201cI think the issue that\u2019s probably going to have to be determinative \u2014 the issues that are <em>going to </em>be determinative are whether Mr. Ziedonis reasonably believed, from the circumstances of either fear, force, own safety or for that of his fellow officers, that there was justification to shoot at the plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">Several weeks later in a decision and order reported in 368 F.Supp. 544 (E.D. Wis.1973), the district court concluded that defendant\u2019s use of \u201cdeadly force\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was unreasonable and excessive under the circumstances. The court entered judgment for plaintiffs on the basis of its findings. On appeal, defendant contends that his use of deadly force was justified because: (1) defendant reasonably believed that the shooting was necessary to protect himself and his partner from imminent threat of death or great bodily harm and (2) as a police officer, defendant was privileged to use deadly force to apprehend plaintiffs whom he reasonably believed to be fleeing felony suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">\n<em>Self-defense and Defense of Partner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">The law has traditionally recognized that a person may employ deadly force against another, if such person reasonably believes such force necessary to protect a third person or oneself from imminent death or great bodily harm, without incurring civil liability for injury to the other.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since this is a suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, federal law determines the adequacy of the defenses asserted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court accepts the traditional principle noted above as a complete defense to an action against a state official under Section 1983. Nevertheless, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the district court erred in finding this defense inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-16\">As to defendant\u2019s contention that he viewed Travis\u2019 first file-wielding move \u201cas a confrontation by someone holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>a long-barreled revolver, and that he feared for his life,\u201d the trial judge noted that the street area was lighted, the distance between the two was short, the file did not resemble a gun, and. defendant only fired over the head of Travis at that time. In concluding that defendant had used unreasonable force in firing his second shot directly at Travis and Clark after a second such confrontation in a darker gangway, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYV\">\u201cWhile the defendant\u2019s testimony as to his frightened state of mind stands unchallenged by any of the testimony of the plaintiffs, I conclude that the defendant\u2019s second shot, which was aimed directly at the suspects, was clearly unreasonable and unjustified. The lighted conditions, the proximity of the actors, the physical appearance of the file, the nature of the wounds, the defendant\u2019s \u2018warning\u2019 shot during a \u2018confrontation\u2019 which he says caused him to fear for his life, the suspects\u2019 retreat, and the defendant\u2019s awareness both of his partner\u2019s presence at the suspects\u2019 only available avenue of escape, and of his partner\u2019s knowledge of the warning shot, represent the circumstances which persuade me that the defendant used excessive force in effecting the arrest.\u201d 368 F.Supp. at 546</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The district court clearly recognized the defendant was privileged to use deadly force in self-defense or in defense of a third person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the court\u2019s rec-\u2019 itation of the factors which made it improbable that defendant could have perceived the file as a source of imminent danger amounts to a finding of fact that defendant could not have reasonably believed his or his partner\u2019s life endangered.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">While, if we were the trier of facts we might have found that defendant reasonably feared for his own or his partner\u2019s safety, Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) does not permit us to upset the district court\u2019s finding \u2018.\u2018unless clearly erroneous.\u201d On this record, for the reasons he stated, it was permissible for Judge Gordon to find that the defendant did not reasonably believe that his or his partner\u2019s life was endangered. Therefore, it would be improper for this Court to set aside the trial court\u2019s finding on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">\n<em>Police Officer's Privilege to Apprehend Escaping Felons Using Deadly Force</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">As <em>amicus curiae </em>advises,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at common law an officer may use deadly force where necessary to apprehend the fleeing perpetrator of any felony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While most states still follow the common law rule, the proliferation of crimes classified as felonies and the reservation of the death penalty for only a very few of .them has lead a small group of states to modify the common law rule. These authorities now limit the privilege to certain felonies,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> apparently including burglary, which are deemed to represent some threat of harm to persons and are variously l\u00e1beled \u201cforcible\u201d, \u201cdangerous\u201d or \u201cserious\u201d felonies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Under either the common law or modified versions of the privilege, an officer may use deadly force only when he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to effect an arrest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The district judge found that defendant did not reasonably believe that his or his partner\u2019s life was in imminent danger. He further found that the suspects were retreating, that defendant was aware of his partner\u2019s presence at plaintiffs\u2019 \u201conly available means of escape,\u201d and\u2019 that defendant knew his partner would be alerted by the warning shot. We think the district court concluded that defendant did not <em>reasonably </em>believe deadly force necessary to effect plaintiffs\u2019 arrest. While this Court might again have been disposed to make different findings, were it the trier of fact, we cannot fault Judge Gordon\u2019s findings on this issue as \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The district court was called upon to make difficult factual determinations. Both of the defenses raised by defendant required the trial court to determine first, whether defendant possessed a certain state of mind and, if so, whether such a state of mind was reasonably possessed under the circumstances.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Great deference must be accorded the finder of fact, who is in a position to view the demeanor of the witnesses, where, as here, resolution of the crucial issues requires a determination as to what a party reasonably believed under all the circumstances of the moment. Therefore, despite our sympathy for the plight of law enforcement officers confronted with criminal suspects, it would be improper for us to set aside the district court\u2019s findings in support of its decision that excessive force had been used in effecting these arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-13\">. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint specifically alleges that \u201cthe defendant Joseph Ziedonis acted wilfully, wantonly, knowingly and purposefully with specific intent to deprive plaintiff Edmund Gordon and plaintiff Edward Travis of their rights to freedom from physical injury, abuse, coercion and intimidation; all of these rights are secured to plaintiffs by the provisions of the Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d The use of excessive force by police officers in effecting an arrest is a well-recognized ground for liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.

However, in drafting the second Restatement, the common law\u2019s \u201cany felony\u201d rule was adopted because no support had been given the original Restatement in the cases.
