The District Court answered this question in the negative. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">On March 24, 1969, Atlanta International Raceway, the bankrupt debtor, executed a promissory note for $1,000,000 to Michigan International Speedway, Inc. A deed to secure debt, to the raceway\u2019s property, was also executed. As to attorney\u2019s fees, the note provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-21\">Should this note, or any part of the indebtedness evidenced hereby be collected by law or through an attorney at law, the holder shall be entitled to collect attorney\u2019s fees in an amount equal to ten per cent (10%) of the principal and interest, and all costs of collection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-22\">On March 30, 1970, the note and deed were transferred and assigned to the Royal National Bank of New York. Security National Bank is that bank\u2019s successor in interest to the note and deed to secure debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-23\">On January 18, 1971, a petition for reorganization of Atlanta International Raceway was filed and approved under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. Under Section 148 of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548, the order approving the petition operated as an automatic stay of mortgage foreclosure proceedings and of any act or proceeding to enforce a lien against the debtor\u2019s property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court, pursuant to Section 116(4) of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 516(4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> immediately entered an injunction prohibiting all creditors and their attorneys from prosecuting any suit or doing any act to enforce claims against the bankrupt debtor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The promissory note for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>$1,000,000 above referred to was not then in default in payments of principal or interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">On August 4, 1972, during the penden-cy of the Chapter X proceedings, attorneys for the bank sent the raceway and the Chapter X trustee a ten-day letter, which declared the note to be in default. The letter demanded payment and stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsX\">This letter is written pursuant to Georgia Code Section 20 \u2014 506 to advise that the principal and interest as stated above may be paid within ten (10) days from receipt of this notice without liability for attorney\u2019s fees. In the event the principal and interest as stated above is not paid within ten (10) days from receipt of this notice, the provisions of said promissory note relative to the payment of attorney\u2019s fees shall be enforced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Under Georgia law a lien for attorney\u2019s fees is not valid until this notice and opportunity to pay have been provided to the debtor. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-506.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">The letter was received by the trustee on August 7, 1972, and on August 11 the bank applied to the bankruptcy court for permission to foreclose. The ten-day period elapsed without payment of the debt. The bank then moved for summary judgment on its claim for attorney\u2019s fees, amounting to,over $120,000, which motion was denied by the District Court. The bank has appealed from this adverse decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">II. Enforceability of the Claim for Attorney Fees in the Chapter X Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\"> The validity of the bank\u2019s lien for attorney\u2019s fees is a question of Georgia law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The enforceability of the lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>in a Chapter X proceeding, however, is a question of federal bankruptcy law. Security Mortgage Co. v. Powers, 278 U.S. 149, 153-154, 49 S.Ct. 84, 85-86, 73 L.Ed. 236 (1928). We conclude that enforcement of the bank\u2019s attorney fee lien in this Chapter X proceeding would frustrate the District Court\u2019s efforts to fulfill its responsibilities under the Act and would be inconsistent with the purposes of Chapter X. The bank does not contend that attorney\u2019s fees of $120,000 have been earned herein. What the bank seeks, therefore, is a $120,000 windfall to be added to its debt, all as a consequence of the debtor being in Chapter X reorganization proceedings in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">A. Conflicts between Enforcement of the Claim for Attorney Fees and the Purpose of Chapter X</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The bank\u2019s ten-day letter was sent despite the federal court injunction clearly forbidding the enforcement of creditors\u2019 rights against the debtor. The sending of the demand letter was an \u201cact or proceeding to enforce a lien upon the property of the debtor,\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 516, and fell within the terms of the District Court\u2019s prohibitory injunction. The court\u2019s injunction was entirely proper,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and was necessary to preserve the court\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and its property, wherever located.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 511. Without'' this protection of the debtor\u2019s assets, the court\u2019s efforts to develop a plan or reorganization would have been in vain.</p>\n<p id=\"Acq\">Thus the trustee was confonted with two restraints against complying with the bank\u2019s demand for payment: first, the District Court\u2019s injunction, which, as the court below specifically found, could not have been changed within ten days to permit the payment, in light of the statutory requirements of notice to other creditors, court approval, etc.; second, the trustee\u2019s responsibility, as well as that of the District Court, to hold all such demands for payment in abeyance lest the bankrupt\u2019s prospects for reorganization be jeopardized by the loss of essential assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">The debtor and its trustee therefore had no opportunity to satisfy the bank\u2019s demand for payment, and avoid incurring an additional $120,000 liability for attorney\u2019s fees. We conclude that it is contrary to the purpose of Chapter X to inflict this added expense on the debtor, and derivatively, on its other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">The bank argues that it was not required to obey the court\u2019s injunction by applying for permission to send its ten-day letter, because its right to make the demand for payment is a substantive right sanctioned by state law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>stated recently, however, in ruling on a utility company\u2019s claim in a Chapter X proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">If a creditor, like the telephone company, could continue to enforce his state law rights after the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, the bankruptcy laws would be meaningless. Their very purpose is to suspend the normal operation of rights and obligations between the debtor and his creditors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In re Fontainebleau Hotel Corporation, 5 Cir., 1975, 508 F.2d 1056, 1059.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">B. Prior Interpretations of the Enforceability of Post-petition Contractual Claims for Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The bank\u2019s answer to the foregoing reasoning is that the present attorney\u2019s fee claim is controlled by two prior decisions, one by the Supreme Court and one by this court. These cases, however, are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">In Security Mortgage Co. v. Powers, 278 U.S. 149, 49 S.Ct. 84, 73 L.Ed. 236 (1928), the Court held that a claim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to a provision in a note similar to the note in this case was enforceable in a bankruptcy proceeding. The creditor\u2019s demand notice was sent, after the petition was filed, to a debtor from whom the bankrupt had purchased the land securing the note. When the creditor filed his claim with the bankruptcy court, the debt (including an amount for attorney\u2019s fees) had already been reduced to judgment in a state court action against the original debtor. <em>Security Mortgage, </em>however, was a straight bankruptcy proceeding rather than a reorganization under Chapter X. The reorganization provisions of the Bankruptcy Act were not enacted until 1934, six years after the <em>Security Mortgage </em>case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that reorganization proceedings are <em>sui generis, </em>and rules appropriate in an ordinary bankruptcy may be inapplicable in a reorganization. <em>See </em>Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, Inc., 417 U.S. 467, 470 n. 3, 94 S.Ct. 2504, 2507, 41 L.Ed.2d 243 (1974); Continental Illinois Nat. Bank &amp; T. Co. v. Chicago, Etc., Co., 294 U.S. 648, 676, 55 S.Ct. 595, 606, 79 L.Ed. 1110 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">No prohibitory injunction was entered by the bankruptcy court in <em>Security Mortgage </em>against enforcement of secured creditors\u2019 liens against the debtor. Under the circumstances of that case there was no need to delay satisfaction of secured claims in contemplation of a reorganization. The purpose of the bankruptcy system was \u201cto convert the assets of the bankrupt into cash for distribution among creditors, and then to relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness . . . .\u201d Maynard v. Elliott, 283 U.S. 273, 277, 51 S.Ct. 390, 392, 75 L.Ed. 1028 (1931), quoting Williams v. U. S. Fidelity Co., 236 U.S. 549, 554, 35 S.Ct. 289, 290, 59 L.Ed. 713 (1915). See Young v. Hig-bee Co., 324 U.S. 204, 210, 65 S.Ct. 594, 597, 89 L.Ed. 890; Kuehner v. Irving Trust Co., 299 U.S. 445, 451, 57 S.Ct. 298, 301, 81 L.Ed. 340 (1937); Kothe v. R. C. Taylor Trust, 280 U.S. 224, 227, 50 S.Ct. 142, 143, 74 L.Ed. 382 (1930). That purpose was not subverted by the enforcement of secured claims against the debt- or because the trustee and creditors were not restrained (as here) by an injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>or by the essential need to preserve the debtor\u2019s assets in a pending reorganization. The trustee\u2019s task was dismantling the debtor enterprise, rather than restructuring it for continued existence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under these circumstances a trustee would have an opportunity to comply with a secured creditor\u2019s demand for payment, and could legitimately be held responsible for additional contractually stipulated attorney\u2019s fees. In the present case, as the court below found, there was no such opportunity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In <em>Security Mortgage </em>the Court did not instruct the District Court to pay the attorney\u2019s fee claim, but rather remanded the case for a hearing on several unresolved issues. The Court stated that if the trustee had not received notice of the bank\u2019s demand for payment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the claim for attorney\u2019s fees could not be enforced. The Court\u2019s discussion of that issue convinces us that for such a claim to be enforceable there must be an opportunity to comply with the creditor\u2019s demand for payment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">For, if he had been notified, the trustee might have arranged to pay the note on or before the return date of the suit against the [debtor]. The purpose of the Georgia statute is clear. It is to protect the debtor, in spite of default, from any liability for attorney\u2019s fees, unless he fails to pay after the lapse of the ten days from receiving notice of intention to sue and such further time as must intervene between commencement of the suit and the return day. [citations omitted] The Legislature cannot have intended that the creditor should be able to impose the additional liability for attorney\u2019s fees without giving the real debtor the notice <em>and opportunity to pay </em>which the statute contemplated that a debtor should have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">278 U.S. at 158, 49 S.Ct. at 87. (emphasis added). <em>See </em>United States v. Hattaway, 5 Cir., 1974, 488 F.2d 55, 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">The Supreme Court has considered the question whether, during a pending reorganization and in the face of an injunction, a trustee has sufficient opportunity to comply with a demand for payment, so as to render claims similar to attorney fees enforceable. In Vanston Bondholders Protective Com. v. Green, 329 U.S. 156, 67 S.Ct. 237, 91 L.Ed. 162 (1946) the bankrupt debtor had issued mortgage bonds pursuant to an indenture agreement that provided for interest to be paid on any overdue interest coupons on the bonds. An equity receiver was appointed by the District Court, which concurrently enjoined the debtor and receiver from paying any pre-appointment debts. Thereafter the indenture trustee, acting on behalf of the bondholders, declared the entire principal due, because of the court-ordered default on the interest payments, and began accruing interest on the overdue interest. In disallowing the claim for interest on overdue interest, the Supreme Court stated;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arr-dedup-0\">[W]hen the equity receivership intervened, these interrelated obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>were drastically changed. The obligation to make prompt payment of simple interest coupons was suspended. In fact both Inland [the debtor] and the receiver were ordered by the court not to pay the coupons on the dates they were, on their face, supposed to have been paid. The contingency which might have created a present obligation to pay interest on interest\u2014 i. e., a free decision by the debtor that it would not or could not pay simple interest promptly \u2014 was prohibited from occurring by order of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">\n<em>[LJegal suspension of an obligation to pay is an adequate reason why no added compensation or penalty should be enforced for failure to pay.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">329 U.S. at 166-167, 67 S.Ct. at 241-242 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Like the attorney\u2019s fees in <em>Security Mortgage, </em>the interest on unpaid interest in <em>Vanston </em>was an additional liability claimed because of a default by the debtor on his obligations to the creditor. Enforcement of both claims was undertaken after the filing of the respective petitions. The difference in result in these cases may be attributed to the difference between the straight bankruptcy proceeding in <em>Security Mortgage </em>and the reorganization proceeding in <em>Vanston, </em>with its attendant injunction against payments to creditors. The present case is like <em>Vanston </em>but unlike <em>Security Mortgage. Compare </em>In re Black Ranches, Inc., 8 Cir., 1966, 362 F.2d 8; Northtown Threatre Corporation v. Mickelson, 8 Cir., 1955, 226 F.2d 212; United States Trust Co. of New York v. Zelle, 8 Cir., 1951, 191 F.2d 822; <em>with </em>In re Maryvale Community Hospital, Inc., 9 Cir. 1972, 456 F.2d 410; Ruskin v. Griffiths, 2 Cir., 1959, 269 F.2d 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">National Acceptance Company v. Zus-mann, 5 Cir., 1967, 379 F.2d 351, also relied on by the bank, is also inapposite. In <em>Zusmann </em>the debtor gave a promissory note to the creditor similar to the note in the present case. When the debtor failed to meet its payments, the creditor sent a ten-day letter demanding payment. Five days later the debtor filed a petition for an arrangement with his creditors under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. The District Court subsequently disallowed the creditor\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the provision in the note, and we reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">The scope of a Chapter XI arrangement is different from that of a Chapter X reorganization. Chapter XI, unlike Chapter X, gives the court no power to alter the rights of secured creditors, such as the bank in the present case. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 616(1); Collier\u2019s Trustees\u2019 and Receivers\u2019 Handbook \u00a7 1.003[2]. Therefore the pressing need to postpone dealing with any individual secured creditor until a comprehensive plan of reorganization could be formulated was not present in <em>Zusmann, </em>because the Chapter XI arrangement eventually adopted there could not include secured creditors, being limited in its effect to unsecured creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">Moreover, in <em>Zusmann, </em>unlike the present case, no injunction was entered against enforcement of creditors\u2019 claims<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and there was no automatic stay provided by the Bankruptcy Act in that Chapter XI case. The trustee in <em>Zusmann </em>was not compelled by an order of the court or by the purpose of the proceedings to refuse the creditor\u2019s demand for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>The cases relied on by the bank, therefore, do not control the question presented here. The bank\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees, under the circumstances of this case, cannot be enforced in this Chapter X reorganization proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">It should be noted, as the bankruptcy court observed, that the denial of this claim does not prejudice the bank\u2019s right to apply for reasonable compensation for attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses incurred in the bankruptcy proceeding itself, as provided in the Bankruptcy Act. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-15\">.

Williams, 1959, 215 Ga. 175, 109 S.E.2d 761, the Supreme Court of Georgia held invalid a lien for attorney\u2019s fees that a creditor tried to enforce after the filing of a petition for the appointment of a receiver under state law to liquidate the debtor\u2019s assets. The state court had entered an injunction prohibiting creditors from \u201cinstituting, filing, or prosecuting any suits, bills, attachments, garnishments or other proceedings of whatever kind against the petitioner or any property or assets of his . .\u201d The creditor subsequently sent substantially the same ten-day letter sent in the present case, which, under Georgia law, is a precondition to the validity of the lien for attorney fees. Ga.Code Ann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u00a7 20-506. The court concluded that, in light of the state court injunction, entered pursuant to the state receivership statute, Section 20-506 could not be interpreted to create a valid lien for attorney\u2019s fees when the preconditions to validity were not satisfied until after the filing of the receivership petition. We must doubt that the Georgia courts would conclude that Section 20-506 creates a valid lien when, as in this case, a similar injunction is entered by a federal court instead of a state court, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act rather than a state receivership statute. Our resolution of the question whether the attorney\u2019s fee lien is enforceable in this Chapter X proceeding, however, makes it unnecessary for us to inquire further into the validity of the lien under Georgia law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">. The Court\u2019s injunction issued pursuant to Section 116(4) of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 516(4), was, as counsel for the bank stated at oral argument, a standard injunction of the sort entered in every Chapter X case.

In re Utilities Power &amp; Light Corporation, 7 Cir., 1937, 91 F.2d 598, presented the question whether a secured creditor could enforce an acceleration clause in a loan agreement after the filing of a Chapter X proceeding. The reason for permitting acceleration in Chapter X proceedings is to present the trustee with the full amounts owing by the debtor to various secured and unsecured creditors, so that he can intelligently undertake a restructuring of the debtor\u2019s capital. Acceleration does not interfere with the reorganization, because the court still retains its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>power to modify the secured creditors\u2019 rights, including their right to immediate payment under an acceleration clause. Thus if the court determines that immediate payment of the full amount of a secured creditor\u2019s claim would be inappropriate, the debt can be \u201cdecelerated\u201d upon adoption of a plan of reorganization. <em>See </em>Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v.

A variety of rights created by state law are commonly suspended by bankruptcy courts in order to serve the policies of the Act. <em>See, e. g., </em>In re Schokbeton Industries, 5 Cir., 1971, 449 F.2d 321 (upholding injunction against termination of bankrupt licensee\u2019s rights under license agreement during period for curing breach of the agreement); In re Thomas J. Grosso Investment, Inc., 9 Cir., 1972, 457 F.2d 168 (upholding injunction against running of redemption period, ordinarily giving foreclosure purchaser clear title); In re Argyle-Lake Shore Bldg. Corporation, 7 Cir., 1935, 78 F.2d 491 (id.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b622-16\">. Act of June 7, 1934, 48 Stat. 911, 912, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">. It is not clear that <em>Security Mortgage </em>has continuing vitality even in straight bankruptcy cases. Under the new Bankruptcy Rules, effective October 1, 1973, the automatic stay provision formerly found only in Chapters X and XII has now been extended to Chapter XI and straight bankruptcy proceedings as well. Bankruptcy Rule 601; Collier\u2019s Trustees\u2019 and Receivers\u2019 Handbook \u00a7 1.002[4].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\">. Contractually stipulated attorney\u2019s fees have been awarded, based on enforcement efforts undertaken after the filing of the petition, in several straight bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See </em>In re Ferro Contracting Co., 3 Cir., 1967, 380 F.2d 116; In re American Motor Products Corporation, 2 Cir., 1938, 98 F.2d 774; In re Kashmir Refinishing Co., 2 Cir., 1938, 94 F.2d 652; Tawney v. Clemson, 4 Cir., 1936, 81 F.2d 300. The bank refers us to only two cases, however, in which contractual claims for attorney\u2019s fees were enforced in Chapter X proceedings. Both cases, unlike the present case, involved defaults declared before the filing of the Chapter X petition, and thus are inapposite. Webster Drilling Company v. Walker, 10 Cir., 1961, 286 F.2d 114; Brown v. Security Nat. Bank of Greensboro, 4 Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 405.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b623-13\">. The creditor had sent the demand letter to the original debtor, from whom the bankrupt had purchased the land, subject to the creditor\u2019s mortgage, described in the deed securing the original debtor\u2019s note. It was unclear whether the bankrupt\u2019s trustee had also received notice of the creditor\u2019s demand for payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">. Counsel for the bank asserted at oral argument, citing Section 428 of the Act, that the same automatic stay that takes effect upon the approval of a Chapter X petition, see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548, is provided for in Chapter XI and was in effect in <em>Zusmann, </em>rendering it indistinguishable from the present case. Section 428, however, is not part of Chapter XI, but rather Chapter XII (Real Property Arrangements), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 828, and has no application to Chapter XI. If a stay or an injunction had been entered in Zusmann, automatically or otherwise, the creditor\u2019s lien would never have become valid, because the running of the ten days would have been suspended. The relevant state law, Georgia Code Ann. \u00a7 20-506, required that the creditor wait ten days after sending his demand letter before instituting legal proceedings. In <em>Zusmann </em>the creditor initiated a foreclosure proceeding three days after giving the debtor notice of the demand for payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
