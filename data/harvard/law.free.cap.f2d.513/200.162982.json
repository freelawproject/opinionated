The Union further stated that, in accordance with its policy, the contract would be submitted to the members for ratification. The Company met the three year demand, thus satisfying all items of mandatory bargaining. The Union decided against submitting the agreement to its members, but the Company refused to execute the agreement unless and until the Union complied with its original plan to submit the plan for ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-19\">The Board held that the Company violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) and (5), by refusing to execute the collective bargaining agreement. 209 N.L.R.B. No. 165, (April 3, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-20\">Upon consideration, the court concludes that the order of the Board is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, and that enforcement is required by the decisions of this court in Houchens Market of Elizabethtown, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 375 F.2d 208 (6th Cir. 1967) and N. L. R. B. v. Big Run Coal &amp; Clay Co., 385 F.2d 788 (6th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 824, 89 S.Ct. 83, 21 L.Ed.2d 95 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">Accordingly, it is ordered that enforcement be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
