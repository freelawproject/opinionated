D. 1932, so construed said Acts, not only as to the contract of purchase sued on herein, but has at all times placed the same construction on said Acts in making various and sundry purchases by said City of Orlando of real estate located in Orange County, without submitting such- purchases to a referendum of the-qualified electors owning real estate in said City, as required by the provisions of Chapter 9864 of the Special Acts of said Legislature of 1923, among which purchases are-included:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b869-4\">\u201cA certain lot adjoining the Main Street Fire Station in Orlando, purchased from one W. C. Rives for a purchase price of $67,000.00 on or about February 13, 1926; also a part of Lot 10 of Fair Oaks and Ivanhoe Subdivision, from North Orange Avenue Properties, Inc., for a purchase price of $33,060.01, on or about March 30, 1927; also that certain tract of land described as the Ej^ of SWj4 andWj-2 of SEjfj of Section 14, Township 22 S. Range 28, containing approximately One Hundred Sixty (160) Acres, from one V. P. Simmons, for a purchase price of $32,000.00. on or about the 12th day of May, A. D. 1926; also a certain parcel of land. known as the \u2018Sink Hole\u2019 property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>from W. P. Gwynne and wife, for a purchase price of $25,000.00, on or about Jarjuary 27, 1927, and such construction of said Acts has been and was acquiesced in by all parties concerned for a period of approximately six years after said purchase, and the said defendant paid each and every installment of interest due on account of said note and mortgage up until May 13, A. D. 1932, and that by reason of such construction of said Acts certain rights, titles and other benefit's have accrued both to the plaintiff and defendant which would be divested should any other construction be placed upon the same, in that there has been-the execution and delivery of said warranty deed by Dr. Phillips and wife, to the defendant, and of said note and mortgage of said defendant to the plaintiff, as aforesaid, also immediately after said purchase as' aforesaid, said defendant went into actual possession of all of said property, had it exempted from taxation, cut down a large, valuable citrus grove growing thereon, razed valuable buildings which the plaintiff had erected thereon, built thereon a city incinerator, stockade, airport and hangar, and began using a large spring-fed lake on said property as a source of water supply for said City; and ever since taking possession as-aforesaid, the defendant has used and is now using said property for- such purposes, and has received, and now enjoys, the use and benefits of said property so conveyed to it by warranty deed as aforesaid, executed and delivered in reliance upon and upon the faith of the promise of performance by said.City of Orlando of its obligation as evidenced by the note and mortgage made payable to the plaintiff as aforesaid; that since the date of said purchase the various Mayors, City Solicitors and governing bodies of said municipality have been fully aware at all times of all the pertinent facts and circumstance surrounding said contract and purchase, and with full knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>edge of same continued to use said property for legitimate, municipal purposes, and to pay all installments of interest due on said indebtedness until the installment of interest in the sum of $12,000.00, on account of said purchase price, covering the period from May 13, A. D. 1932, to May 13, A. D. 1933, became due, but when the plaintiff made demand upon the governing body of said City to pay or cause said installment of interest to be paid, the said Mayor and governing body failed and refused to pay the same, or any part thereof, and the same is now past due and unpaid, after such demand; that it is impossible that the parties to said contract of purchase he placed in <em>statu quo </em>by returning the property so conveyed, and under the principle of common honesty, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff under the terms of the contract of purchase for the agreed compensation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b871-4\">\u201cPlaintiff in and by this action is suing only for that installment of interest which became due on the 13th day of May, A. D. 1932, for the period above named, and does not by this suit waive any right which it might have to bring suit on all future installments of interest or upon the principal as the same shall become due and payable, and further reserves any and all rights or remedies it has or may have to bring any further or other proceedings at law or in equity necessary to protect its interest or right in and about said contract, mortgage or note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b871-5\">\u201cWherefore, plaintiff brings suit and claims damages in the sum of $20,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b871-6\">To each count of the declaration the defendant interposed a demurrer on grounds:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b871-7\">\u201c1. It does not appear in and by said Count that the said property alleged to have been purchased was necessary for a legitimate, legal, municipal purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b872-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number><em>\u201c2. </em>It appears in and by the said Count that the property alleged to have been purchased was situated beyond the territorial limits of the City of Orlando, and no facts are shown giving the City of Orlando power or authority to purchase same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b872-5\">\u201c3. It appears on the face of said Count that the said property was purchased for an illegal and improper purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b872-6\">\u201c4. Because it appears by the said Count that the actions of the Mayor and Commissioners of said defendant City were <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b872-7\">\u201c5. Said Count shows on its face that said purchase was in the amount of $200,000.00, and that the purchase was made pursuant to resolution of the Mayor and Commissioners of City of Orlando, and consequently that the said transaction was in violation of the law requiring the submission to the freeholders of the City of Orlando any purchase of real property above the amount of $10,000.00.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b872-8\"><em>\u201c6. </em>The principle of estoppel does not operate against a municipality.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b872-9\"><em>\u201c7. </em>Mere acquiescence cannot constitute a ratification in lieu of submission to the qualified freeholders as required by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b872-10\"><em>\u201c8. </em>Because the doctrine of common honesty may not be invoked\u2019 for the first time at the termination of a transaction, when not being used to any appreciable extent in the inception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b872-11\">On writ of error taken by the plaintiff to a judgment rendered for the defendant on the demurrer, such judgment is assigned as error.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b872-12\">Whitfield, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKm\">This writ of error was taken to judgment for the defendant upon demurrer, in an action to recover the annual interest payment due May 13, 1932, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>a note executed by the city May 13, 1926, to pay for lands purchased by the city from the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">It is alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-5\">\u201cOn or about the 13th day of May, A.

The Act of 1925 provides- that a purchase or sale of real estate may be made by the city council or other governing body of the City of Orlando, \u201conly upon the unanimous affirmative: vote of the Mayor and all members of the said city council or other governing body.\u201d But if the proposal for purchase or' sale of property shall receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the city council, but not the unanimous vote as provided, then the proposed purchase or sale is to be determined by a majority vote of the qualified electors of the city owning real estate in said city.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Clearly the dominant provisions of the two Acts relate to the same subject, and the provisions of the former Act are inconsistent with the provisions of the later Act. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>conflict by the terms of the later Act operates to repeal the former Act to the extent of the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">Nothing in the later Act indicates an intent to continue in force the provision of the former Act that proposed purchases or sales of any real property for the city \u201cof a value in excess of $10,000.00\u201d shall be ratified by the qualified electors of the city owning real estate therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The provisions of Chapt\u00e9r 10973, Acts of 1925, cover the entire subject of the manner in which any purchase or sale of real estate for the City of Orlando shall be authorized ; and such provisions do not require the approving vote of the qualified electors of the city except where the proposal for purchase or sale of property for the city shall not receive the unanimous affirmative vote of the mayor and all members of the city council or other governing body of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Such provisions of Chapter 10973 being in conflict with the provisions of Chapter 9864, Acts of 1923, on the same subject, the conflicting provisions of the former Act are, by the terms of the later Act, repealed. It is immaterial whether Chapter 10973 is a revision or an amendment of Chapter 9864; the later Act expressly repeals the provisions of Chapter 9864 insofar as they are in conflict with Chapter 10973.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">The declaration alleges and the demurrer admits that a resolution was adopted for the purchase of the property by the governing body of the City of Orlando, \u201cupon which resolution the Mayor and each and every of the City Commissioners voted affirmatively on the proposition,\u201d therefore, the statute does not require the purchase to be approved by the qualified electors of the city, and the demurrer should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Davis, C.
