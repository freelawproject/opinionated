BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">This matter is brought before the Court by both a class action lawsuit and a set of three individual lawsuits. These four lawsuits contain numerous overlapping, though not identical, claims. The purported class plaintiffs consist of private individual and institutional investors who own either preferred or common stock in the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d).

Sept. 20, 2013), ECF No. 1 <em>(\u201cArrowood </em>Compl.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae are government-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> born from statutory charters issued by Congress. <em>See </em>Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1716-1723; Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1451-1459. Congress created the GSEs in order to, among other goals, \u201cpromote access to mortgage credit throughout the Nation ... by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments and improving the distribution of investment capital available for residential mortgage financing.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1716(3). In other words, the GSEs\u2019 shared purpose was to make it easier <em>(i.e., </em>less risky) for local banks and other lenders to offer mortgages to prospective home buyers. The GSEs sought to accomplish this objective by purchasing mortgage .loans from lenders, thus relieving lenders of default risk and \u201cfreeing up lenders\u2019 capital to make additional loans.\u201d <em>See </em>Treasury Defs.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss, or, in the Alternative, for Summ. J. at 6 (D.D.C. Jan. 17, 2014) (\u201cTreasury Mot.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>- In or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>der to finance this operation, the GSEs would, primarily, pool the many mortgage loans they purchased into various mortgage-backed securities and sell these securities to investors. <em>See, e.g., </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n and Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. at 4 (D.D.C. Mar. 21, 2014) (\u201cIndividual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are considered <em>government-sponsored, </em>rather than government-cncweci, because both congressionally chartered entities were eventually converted, by statute, into publicly traded corporations. Housing and Urban Development Act, Pub.L. No. 90-448, \u00a7 802, 82 Stat. 536-538 (1968);-Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, Pub.L. No. 101-73, \u00a7.731, 103 Stat. 432-433 (1989). Yet despite this historically market-driven ownership structure, \u201cthe GSEs have benefit-ted from a public perception that the federal government had implicitly guaranteed the securities they issued; this perception allowed the GSEs to purchase more mortgages and [mortgage-backed securities], at cheaper rates, than would otherwise prevail in the private market.\u201d Treasury Mot. at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">By 2008, the United States economy faced dire straits, in large part due to a massive decline within the national housing .market. <em>See </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 7. \u201cAs a result of the housing crisis, the value of the [GSEs\u2019] assets ... deteriorated and the [GSEs] suffered ... credit losses in their portfolios.\u201d FHFA Mot. to Dismiss, or, in the Alternative, for Summ. J. at 7 (D.D.C. Jan. 17, 2014) (\u201cFHFA Mot.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Given the systemic danger that a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac collapse posed to the already fragile national economy, among other housing market-related perils, Congress enacted the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (\u201cHERA\u201d) on July 30, 2008. <em>See </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 6; Pub.L. No. 110-289, 122 Stat. 2654. HERA established FHFA as an independent agency to supervise and regulate the GSEs. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4511. HERA further granted FHFA\u2019s director the authority to appoint the agency as conservator or receiver for the GSEs. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(a). Of most relevance to the present litigation, HERA empowered FHFA, as conservator or receiver, to \u201cimmediately succeed to \u2014 (i) all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of the [GSE], and of any stockholder, officer, or director of such [GSE] with respect to the [GSE] and the assets of the [GSE].\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A)(i). The statute also set forth a ,\u201c[l]imitation on court action,\u201d noting that, \u201c[e]xcept as provided in this section or. at the request of the Director, no court may take any action to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of [FHFA] as a conservator or a receiver.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(f). Moreover, apparently recognizing that Treasury <em>{i.e., </em>taxpayer) funds may soon be necessary to capitalize the struggling GSEs,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Congress, under HERA, amended the GSEs\u2019 charters to temporarily authorize Treasury to \u201cpurchase any obligations and other securities issued by the [GSEs].\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455\u00a9(1)(A) (Freddie Mac); 12 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00a7 1719(g)(1)(A) (Fannie Mae).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This provision also provided that the \u201cSecretary of the Treasury may, at any time, exercise any rights received in connection with such purchases.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(g)(2)(A). Treasury\u2019s authority to invest in the GSEs expired on December 31, 2009. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(g)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Following the GSEs\u2019 unsuccessful effort to \u201craise capital in the private markets,\u201d FHFA Mot. at 7-8, FHFA placed the GSEs into conservatorship on September 6, 2008. <em>See, e.g., </em>Class Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 7 (D.D.C. Mar. 21, 2014) (\u201cClass Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n\u201d). One day later, Treasury, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(g), entered into Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements (\u201cPSPAs\u201d) with each of the GSEs. Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 8. Under the initial PSPAs, Treasury committed to provide up to $100 billion in funding to each GSE \u201cto ensure that their assets were equal to their <em>liabilities\u201d </em>\u2014 ie., to \u201ccure [the GSEs\u2019] negative net worth\u201d \u2014 at the end of any fiscal quarter. <em>Id.; </em>FHFA Mot. at 11. On May 6, 2009, Treasury and the GSEs, through FHFA, entered into the First Amendment to the PSPAs, whereby Treasury doubled its funding cap to $200 billion for each GSE. Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 11. On December 24, 2009, the parties executed the Second Amendment, which permitted the GSEs to continue to \u201cdraw unlimited sums from Treasury [as required to cure any quarterly negative net worth] until the end of 2012,\u201d and then, as of December 31, 2012, permanently fixed the funding cap for each GSE (at an amount that, in the end, totaled greater than $200 billion per GSE), in accordance with an agreed-upon formula. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12; FHFA Mot. at 12; <em>see also </em>Treasury AR at 190-91,196-97.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">In exchange for its funding commitment, Treasury received senior preferred stock in each GSE, which entitled Treasury to four principal contractual rights under the PSPAs. ' <em>See, e.g., </em>Treasury AR at 14. First, Treasury received a senior liquidation preference<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of $1 billion for each GSE <em>plus </em>a dollar-for-dollar increase each time the GSEs drew upon Treasury\u2019s funding commitment. Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 8-9 (citing Treasury AR at 100, 133). Second, the PSPAs entitled Treasury to dividends equivalent to 10% of Treasury\u2019s existing liquidation preference, paid quarterly.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 9 (citing AR at 32-33, 67-68); Treasury Mot. at 13. Third, Trea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>sury received warrants to acquire up to 79.9% of the GSEs\u2019 common stock at a nominal price. Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 9; <em>e.g., </em>Treasury AR at 15, 43. Fourth, beginning, on March 31, 2010, Treasury would be entitled to a periodic commitment fee \u201cto fully compensate [Treasury] for the support provided by the ongoing [funding] [c]ommitment.\u201d Treasury AR at 22, 56. The amount of the periodic commitment fee was to be determined by mutual agreement, and Treasury reserved the right to waive the fee for one year at a time \u201cbased on adverse conditions in the United States mortgage market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Treasury waived the commitment fee in 2010 and 2011, and later, under the Third Amendment, the fee was suspended. Treasury Mot. at 14,18.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">As of August 8, 2012, Treasury had provided $187.5 billion in funding to the GSEs,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, thus, held a total $189.5 billion senior liquidation preference between both GSEs, including the initial $1 billion liquidation preferences from each GSE. Therefore, \u201cthe GSEs\u2019 dividend obligations to Treasury were nearly $19 billion per year.\u201d Treasury Mot. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">On August 17, 2012, Treasury and the GSEs, through FHFA, agreed to the Third Amendment to the PSPA, which is the focus of this litigation. The Third Amendment \u201creplaced the previous dividend formula with a-requirement that the GSEs pay, as a dividend, the amount by which their net worth for the quarter exceeds a capital buffer of $3 billion. The capital buffer gradually declines over time by $600 million per year, and is entirely eliminated in 2018.\u201d Treasury Mot. at 18. In simpler terms, the amendment \u201crequires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pay a quarterly dividend to Treasury equal to the <em>entire net worth </em>of each Enterprise, minus a small reserve that shrinks to zero over time.\u201d Class Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 3. These dividend payments do not reduce Treasury\u2019s outstanding liquidation preferences. <em>See </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The plaintiffs cite multiple justifications offered publicly by the defendants for this \u201cnet worth sweep.\u201d <em>See </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 16-17. First, Treasury asserted that the amendment will end \u201cthe circular practice of the Treasury advancing funds to the [GSEs] simply to pay dividends back to Treasury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16 (citing Press Release, Treasury Dep\u2019t Announces Further Steps to Expedite Wind Down of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Aug. 17, 2012), <em>available at </em>http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tgl684.aspx); <em>see also </em>Treasury Mot. at 2, 5, 50; FHFA Mot. at 3, 15-16. However, the plaintiffs counter that in 2012, the GSEs were once again profitable and, pertinently, able to pay the 10% dividend without drawing additional funds from Treasury. Id at 14-15; <em>but see Fairholme </em>Compl. at \u00b6 26 (stating that \u201capproximately $26 billion\u201d of Treasury\u2019s current liquidation preference \u201cwere required simply to pay the 10% dividend payments owed to Treasury\u201d). Second, quoting from the same Treasury press release, the plaintiffs note Treasury\u2019s statement that the net worth sweep is consistent with the Obama Administration\u2019s \u201ccommitment ... that the GSEs will be wound down and will not be allowed to retain profits, rebuild capital, and return to the market in their prior form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. Third, according to the press release, the net worth sweep would \u201cmake sure that every dollar of earnings that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac generate will be used to benefit taxpayers for their investment in those firms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Under the Third Amendment net worth sweep, the GSEs paid Treasury nearly $130 billion in 2013.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Treasury AR at 4352. As mentioned above, under the former dividend arrangement requiring payment equivhlent to 10% of Treasury\u2019s existing liquidation preference, the GSEs would have owed nearly $19 billion. Through 2013, the cumulative draws of Treasury funding taken by the GSEs remained $187.5 billion, <em>id. </em>at 4351, and the cumulative dividends paid to Treasury by the GSEs totaled $185.2 billion, <em>id. </em>at 4352.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Notwithstanding the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to downplay the need for a GSE bailout in the first place, <em>see, e.g., </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 6, 10-11, the plaintiffs do not contest the initial PSPA or subsequent two amendments to the PSPA, <em>see, e.g., </em>Class Pls.\u2019s. Opp\u2019n at 11, but rather only challenge the Third Amendment to the PSPA. The class plaintiffs have brought claims of breach of contract, regarding allegedly promised dividends and liquidation preferences, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and an unconstitutional taking, as well as derivative claims of breach of fiduciary duty. The <em>Perry </em>plaintiff has brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). The <em>Arrowood </em>plaintiffs have also brought APA claims, as well as claims of breach of contract, regarding allegedly promised dividends and liquidation preferences, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The <em>Fair-holme </em>plaintiffs have brought the same claims as the <em>Perry </em>and <em>Arrowood </em>plaintiffs with an additional claim of breach of fiduciary duty against FHFA. The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>dispute whether the <em>Fairholme </em>plaintiffs\u2019 fiduciary duty claim is direct or derivative. <em>See infra </em>n.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">On January 17, 2014, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaints against the Third Amendment for lack of jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). In the alternative, the defendants moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56. In their opposition, filed March 21, 2014, the individual plaintiffs presented a cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">II. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"AQqq\">\u201cFederal courts are of limited jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). Under Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that subject matter jurisdiction exists. <em>Khadr v. United States, </em>529 F.3d 1112, 1115 (D.C.Cir.2008). The Court must \u201cassume the truth of all material factual allegations in the complaint and construe the complaint liberally, granting [the] plaintiff[s] the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Am. Nat. Ins. Co. v. F.D.I.C., </em>642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C.Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). But \u201c[b]ecause subject-matter jurisdiction focuses on the [C]ourt\u2019s power to hear the claim ..., the [C]ourt must give the plaintiff[s\u2019] factual allegations closer scrutiny when resolving a Rule 12(b)(1) motion than would be required for a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim.\u201d <em>Youming Jin v. Ministry of State Sec., </em>475 F.Supp.2d 54, 60 (D.D.C.2007). Furthermore, when evaluating a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, \u201cit has been long accepted that the [Court] may make appropriate inquiry beyond the pleadings to satisfy itself on authority to entertain the case.\u201d <em>Haase v. Sessions, </em>835 F.2d 902, 906 (D.C.Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">A motion to dismiss is also appropriate when the complaint fails \u201cto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The Court does not \u201crequire heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Once again, \u201cthe complaint is construed liberally in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor, and [the Court] grant[s] plaintiffs the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged. However, the [C]ourt need not accept inferences drawn by plaintiffs if such inferences are unsupported by the facts set out in the complaint. Nor must the [C]ourt accept legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations. <em>Kowal v. MCI Commc\u2019ns Corp., </em>16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C.Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cIf, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) ..., matters outside the pleadings are presented to and hot excluded by the [C]ourt, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">III.

HERA Bars the Plaintiffs\u2019 Prayers for Declaratory, Injunctive, and Other Equitable Relief against FHFA and Treasury</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">By this Court\u2019s calculation, twenty-four of the thirty-one substantive prayers for relief<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> requested by the plaintiffs across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>their five complaints seek declaratory, in-junctive, or other equitable relief against FHFA or Treasury. <em>See also </em>FHFA Mot. at 22 n.13. Such relief runs up against HERA\u2019s anti-injunction provision, which declares that \u201cno court may take any action to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of [FHFA] as a conservator or a receiver.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">While case law adjudicating HERA-related disputes is generally sparse, \u201c[e]ourts interpreting the scope of [\u00a7 ] 4617(f) have relied on decisions addressing the nearly identical jurisdictional bar applicable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u2018FDIC\u2019) conservatorships contained in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(j).\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. FHFA, </em>815 F.Supp.2d 630, 641 (S.D.N.Y.2011), <em>aff'd sub nom. Town of Babylon v. FHFA </em>699 F.3d 221 (2d Cir.2012). Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (\u201cFIRREA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183, during the savings and loan crisis to enable the FDIC (and, formerly, the Resolution Trust Corporation (\u201cRTC\u201d)) to serve as a conservator or receiver for troubled financial institutions. It was with this backdrop that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in <em>Freeman v. FDIC, </em>explained that the language of \u00a7 1821\u00a9 \u201cdoes indeed effect a sweeping ouster of courts\u2019 power to grant equitable remedies.\u201d 56 F.3d 1394, 1399 (D.C.Cir.1995).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Circuit held that the FIRREA provision precludes courts from granting \u201cnon-monetary remedies, including injunctive relief [] [and] declaratory relief\u2019 that would \u201ceffectively \u2018restrain\u2019 the [agency] from\u201d exercising its statutorily authorized responsibilities. <em>Id. </em>(quoting' 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821\u00a9). As the parties both agree, an equivalent bar on jurisdiction derives from HERA\u2019s substantially identical anti-injunction provision. <em>E.g., </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Like a number of its sister circuits, however, this Circuit has established that, if the agency \u201chas acted or proposes to act beyond, or contrary to, its statutorily prescribed, constitutionally permitted, powers or functions,\u201d then 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(f) shall not apply. <em>Nat'l Trust for Historic Pres. v.

Thus, the question for this Court is whether the plaintiffs sufficiently plead that FHFA acted beyond the scope of its statutory \u201cpowers or functions ... as a conservator\u201d when the agency executed the 'Third Amendment to the PSPAs with Treasury. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(f). If not, the Court must dismiss all of the defendants\u2019 claims for declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>1. Section 4617(f) Bars Claims of Arbitrary and Capricious Conduct, under APA \u00a7 706(2) (A), Which Seek Declaratory, Injunctive, or Other Equitable Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">While there is a \u201cstrong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action,\u201d <em>Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians, </em>476 U.S. 667, 670, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986), that presumption is \u201cdefeated if the substantive statute precludes review.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 843, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(1)). The plaintiffs do not discuss the applicability of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(1) of the APA to the present case in any of their oppositions, except to cite <em>Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., </em>509 U.S. 43, 63-64, 113 S.Ct. 2485, 125 L.Ed.2d 38 (1993), in the individual plaintiffs\u2019 opposition and reply briefs for the proposition that the Court can preclude APA review \u201conly if presented with clear and convincing evidence\u201d of congressional intent to preclude such review. <em>E.g., </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Reply to Defs.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. at 15-16 (D.D.C. June 2, 2014) (\u201cIndividual Pls.\u2019s Reply\u201d). The individual plaintiffs are correct in that the \u201cpresumption of judicial review [under the APA] is, after all, a presumption, and like all presumptions used in interpreting statutes, may be overcome by, <em>inter alia, </em>specific language ... that is a reliable indicator of congressional intent ... to preclude judicial review.\u201d <em>Bowen, </em>476 U.S. at 673, 106 S.Ct. 2133 (internal quotation marks arid citation omitted). HERA\u2019s express anti-injunction provision, which, as explained below, necessarily covers litigation arising out of contracts executed by FHFA in accordance with its duties as a conservator, qualifies as a reliable indicator of .congressional intent to preclude review of non-monetary APA claims brought against both FHFA and Treasury. Importantly, when applying FIRREA\u2019s anti-injunction provision, 12 U.S.C \u00a7 1821(j), this Circuit has only considered whether the FDIC acted beyond \u201cits statutorily prescribed, constitutionally permitted, powers or functions\u201d under FIRREA, specifically, and not whether it acted beyond any of its more general APA obligations under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702(2). <em>See Nat\u2019l Trust, </em>21 F.3d at 472 (Wald, J., concurring and further noting that, \u201cgiven the breadth of the statutory language [of \u00a7 1821(j) ], untempered by any persuasive legislative history pointing in a different direction, the statute would appear to bar a court from acting in virtually all circumstances\u201d); <em>Freeman, </em>56 F.3d at 1398-99; <em>MBIA Ins. Corp. v. FDIC, </em>816 F.Supp.2d 81, 103 (D.D.C.2011), <em>aff'd, </em>708 F.3d 234 (D.C.Cir.2013); <em>see also Leon Cnty., </em>700 F.3d at 1278-79. In other words, this Circuit, like the APA itself, implicitly draws a distinction between acting beyond the scope of the constitution or a statute, <em>see </em>\u00a7 702(2)(B) and (C), and acting within the scope of a statute, but doing so arbitrarily and capriciously, <em>see </em>\u00a7 702(2)(A). This distinction arises directly from the text of \u00a7 4617(f), which prohibits the Court from restraining \u201cthe <em>exercise </em>of powers or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>functions of <em>[FHFA]\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., restraining <em>how </em>FHFA employs its powers or functions \u2014 but does not prohibit review based upon the statutory or constitutional origin of the powers or functions themselves, (emphasis added). Consequently, it does appear that \u00a7 4617(f) bars all declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief stemming from claims of arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking, under APA \u00a7 706(2)(A). Thus, the two counts in each of the <em>Perry, Fairholme, </em>and <em>Arrowood </em>Complaints, and related prayers for relief, that claim APA violations for arbitrary and capricious conduct by both Treasury and FHFA are hereby dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\n<em>2. Section 4617(f) Applies to Treasury\u2019s Authority under HERA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">As a threshold matter, the plaintiffs contend that \u00a7 4617(f) does not bar claims against Treasury because the provision only governs claims against FHFA. However, the defendants\u2019 argument that granting relief against the counterparty to a contract with FHFA would directly restrain FHFA\u2019s ability as a conservator visa-vis that contract is based on sound reasoning. <em>See, e.g., </em>Treasury Reply at 12-13 (collecting cases outside of this Circuit). Conduct by a counterparty that is required under a contract with FHFA does not merely constitute \u201ca peripheral connection to FHFA\u2019s activities as the [GSEs\u2019] conservator.\u201d <em>See </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 29. To the contrary, such interdependent, contractual conduct is directly connected to FHFA\u2019s activities as a conservator. A plaintiff is not entitled to use the technical wording of her <em>complaint </em>\u2014 ie., bringing a claim against a counterparty when the contract in question is intertwined with FHFA\u2019s responsibilities as a conservator\u2014 as an end-run around HERA. Therefore, \u00a7 4617(f) applies generally to litigation concerning a contract signed by FHFA pursuant to its powers as a conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Additionally, when the counter-party to FHFA\u2019s contract \u2014 Treasury\u2014is also a government entity operating based on authority derived from HERA, <em>e.g. </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(g) (temporarily authorizing Treasury to purchase GSE securities), HERA\u2019s anti-injunction provision may be logically extended to that government counterparty. Likewise, if FHFA, as a conservator or receiver, signs a contract with another governmept entity that is acting beyond the scope of its HERA powers, then FHFA is functionally complicit in its counterparty\u2019s misconduct, and such unlawful actions may be imputed to FHFA. Here, as noted above, there can be little doubt that enjoining Treasury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>from partaking in the Third Amendment would restrain FHFA\u2019s uncontested authority to determine how to conserve the viability of the GSEs. Accordingly, the Court must decide whether Treasury acted in contradiction of its temporary power, under HERA, to invest in the GSEs.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The individual plaintiffs argue that Treasury acted beyond the scope of HERA because the Third Amendment constitutes the purchase of new GSE securities after HERA\u2019s December 31, 2009 sunset provision and because Treasury violated the APA by acting arbitrarily and capriciously when entering into the net worth sweep. Here, given \u00a7 4617(f)\u2019s bar on nonmone-tary claims of arbitrary and capricious de-cisionmaking under the APA, the Court must only consider whether Treasury purchased new securities through the Third Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\n<em>3. Treasury\u2019s Execution of the Third Amendment Does Not Constitute the Purchase of New Securities in Contravention of HERA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The individual plaintiffs argue that Treasury violated the sunset provision associated with its authority to purchase GSE securities under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(g) because the Third Amendment was not an \u201cexercise of rights\u201d under the statute and because the Third Amendment was effectively a purchase of new securities after December 31, 2009. Individual Pis/s Opp\u2019n at 37. Both claims are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Asserting that the Third Amendment was not the exercise of a right, as allegedly required for any \u201cmarket participation]\u201d after 2009, the individual plaintiffs state that, \u201c[a]s of 2010, Treasury\u2019s authority as a market participant was limited to \u2018holding], exercis[ing] any rights received in connection with, or sell[ing] any obligations or securities purchased\u2019 \u201d from the GSEs. Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 36-37 (quoting 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(g)(2)(D)). But this contention overreads the provision governing the application of the statutory expiration date to purchased securities. While \u00a7 1719(g)(2)(D) notes that holding securities, exercising any rights under the securities contract, or selling securities are specifically <em>exempt </em>from the sunset provision, the existence of that provision does not therefore preclude other non-security-purchasing activities otherwise permitted under an already agreed-upon, pre-2010 investment contract with the GSEs.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To then say that the purchase authority sunset provision also categorically prohibits any provision within Treasury\u2019s contracts with the GSEs that requires \u201cmutual assent\u201d is to reach too far. <em>Cf </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 38. Thus, whether or not amending the PSPA is a \u201cright,\u201d as understood under \u00a7 1719(g), is irrelevant, as long as the Third Amendment did not constitute a purchase of new securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Here, Treasury purchased one million senior preferred shares in each GSE in exchange for a number of contractual entitlements. <em>E.g., </em>Treasury AR at 21-22 (Fannie Mae PSPA). This \u201cpurchase\u201d of GSE securities required Treasury to provide the GSEs with a funding commitment. While in all three amendments that followed this purchase Treasury never received additional GSE shares, under the first two amendments, Treasury provided the GSEs with an expanded funding commitment. The individual plaintiffs cite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201cAction Memorandum for [Treasury] Secretary Geithner,\u201d which invokes Treasury\u2019s statutory purchasing authority under \u00a7 1719(g) as a justification for the funding expansion, as evidence that the Third Amendment was also a purchase of securities. Individual Pls.\u2019s Reply at 21 (Treasury AR at 181-88). The Court, however, does not accept that a reference to Treasury\u2019s general purchasing authority in a memorandum to Secretary Geithner regarding the Second Amendment means that the Second Amendment (and First Amendment, for that matter) was, in fact, a purchase of new obligations or securities according to \u00a7 1719(g)(1)(a). While Treasury\u2019s funding commitment is the currency by which Treasury purchased shares, which came with additional rights for Treasury, in the original PSPAs, no new shares or obligations were purchased during the first two amendments. Treasury\u2019s receipt of \u201cvaluable <em>consideration\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., the potential for increased liquidation preferences as the GSEs drew more funding\u2014 for these amendments does not, on its own, constitute the purchase of new GSE securities under \u00a7 1719(g)(1)(a).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Reply at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Yet regardless of whether the first two amendments to the PSPAs should be considered a purchase of new securities, the Court finds that Treasury did not purchase new securities under the Third Amendment. Under the Third Amendment \u2014 unlike the first two amendments\u2014 Treasury <em>neither </em>granted the GSEs additional funding commitments <em>nor </em>received an increased liquidation preference. Instead, Treasury agreed to a net worth sweep in exchange for eliminating the cash dividend equivalent to 10% of the GSEs\u2019 liquidation preference. This net worth sweep represented a new formula of dividend compensation for a $200 billion-plus investment Treasury had already made. As FHFA further claims, the agency executed the Third Amendment to ameliorate the existential challenge of paying the dividends it <em>already </em>owed pursuant to the GSE securities Treasury purchased through the PSPA; it did not do so in order to sell more GSE securities. FHFA Mot. at 3 (\u201cThe [GSEs] were unable to meet their 10% dividend obligations without drawing more from Treasury, causing a downward spiral of repaying <em>preexisting obligations </em>to Treasury through additional draws from Treasury.\u201d) (emphasis added). Notwithstanding plaintiffs\u2019 contentions regarding the \u201cfundamental change doctrine,\u201d Treasury\u2019s own tax regulations, or otherwise, the present fact pattern strikes the Court as straightforward, at least in the context of the applicability of \u00a7 1719(g)\u2019s sunset provision.. Without providing an additional funding commitment or receiving new securities from the GSEs as consideration for its Third Amendment to the already existing PSPAs, Treasury cannot be said to have purchased new securities under \u00a7 1719(g)(1)(a). Treasury may have amended the compensation structure of its investment in a way that plaintiffs find troubling, but doing so did not violate the purchase authority sunset provision. \u00a7 1719(g)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\n<em>4. FHFA Acted within Its Statutory Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The individual plaintiffs put forth a number of claims that FHFA violated HERA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>by entering into the Third Amendment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These arguments concern both FHFA\u2019s conduct and the purported reasons <em>for </em>FHFA\u2019s conduct \u2014 the <em>what </em>and the <em>why, </em>so to speak.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">At bottom, the Third Amendment sweeps nearly all GSE profit dollars to Treasury. The result for non-Treasury shareholders is virtually no likelihood of dividend payments (given the lack of profits along with Treasury\u2019s discretion to pay dividends, <em>see, e.g. </em>Treasury AR at 58 (Freddie Mac PSPA \u00a7 5.1)) and a decrease in the potential liquidation preference they would receive if the company liquidated, during a period of profitability. Both parties essentially admit this same depiction in their briefs, biased adjectives aside. Looking past the financial engineering involved in the PSPAs and subsequent amendments, the question for this Court, simply, is whether the net worth sweep amendment represents conduct that exceeds FHFA\u2019s authority under HERA \u2014 a statute of exceptional scope that gave immense discretion to FHFA as a conservator. It is surely true that \u201cFHFA cannot evade judicial scrutiny by merely labeling its actions with a conservator stamp.\u201d <em>Leon Cnty. v. FHFA, </em>700 F.Sd 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2012). Yet construing the allegations in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the Court finds that the plaintiffs fail to demonstrate by a-preponderance of the evidence \u2014 if at all \u2014 that FHFA\u2019s execution of the Third Amendment violated HERA. <em>See, e.g., Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>27 F.Supp.2d 15, 19 (D.D.C.1998) (\u201cThe plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion to establish subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). As such, the plaintiffs cannot overcome \u00a7 4617(f)\u2019s jurisdictional bar on equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">\n<em>a. FHFA\u2019s Justifications for Executing the Third Amendment and, Consequently, the Accompanying Administrative Record, Are Irrelevant for \u00a7 1617(f) Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">The extraordinary breadth of HERA\u2019s statutory grant to FHFA as a conservator or receiver for the GSEs, likely due to the bill\u2019s enactment during an unprecedented crisis in the housing market, <em>Cf. Freeman, </em>56 F.3d at 1398, coupled with the anti-injunction provision, narrows the Court\u2019s jurisdictional analysis to <em>what </em>the Third Amendment entails, rather than <em>why </em>FHFA executed the Third Amendment. <em>See also id. </em>(the anti-injunction provision applies \u201cunless [the conservator] has acted ... beyond, or contrary to, its statutorily prescribed, constitutionally permitted, powers or functions.\u201d). Nevertheless, the individual plaintiffs focus a sizable portion of their opposition and reply briefs on disputing FHFA\u2019s <em>justifications </em>for the Third Amendment. <em>See </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 58-73; Individual Pls.\u2019s Reply at 31-39. Similarly, the individual plaintiffs argue that FHFA violated HERA by not producing the full administrative record. Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 46-51; Individual Pls.\u2019s Reply at 26-29. Both sets of claims ask the Court, directly or indirectly, to evaluate FHFA\u2019s rationale for entering into the Third Amendment \u2014 a request that contravenes \u00a7 4617(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">Claims that FHFA\u2019s varying explanations for entering into the Third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Amendment reveal that the agency\u2019s conduct went beyond its statutory authority under HERA \u2014 which are merely extensions of the individual plaintiffs\u2019 arbitrary and capricious arguments under a differ-\u00e9nt subheading \u2014 share the same fate as the plaintiffs APA arbitrary and capricious claims. Once again, to determine whether it has jurisdiction to adjudicate claims for equitable relief against FHFA as a conservator, the Court must look at <em>what </em>has happened, not <em>why </em>it happened. For instance, the Court will examine whether the Third Amendment <em>actually </em>resulted in a <em>de facto </em>receivership, infra; not what FHFA has publicly stated regarding any power it may or may not have, as conservator, to prepare the GSEs for liquidation, <em>see </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 58-66. FHFA\u2019s underlying motives or <em>opinions </em>\u2014 i.e., whether the net worth sweep would arrest a downward spiral of dividend payments <em>(see also supra </em>n.7), increase payments to Treasury, or keep the GSEs in a holding pattern, Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 66-73 \u2014 do not matter for the purposes of \u00a7 4617(f). <em>Cf. Leon Cnty., Fla. v.

But Congress barred judicial review of the conservator\u2019s actions without making an exception for actions said to be taken from an improper motive.\u201d). Moreover, contrary to the individual plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, <em>id. </em>at 46-51, 113 S.Ct. 2485, and consistent with the Court\u2019s ruling regarding the bar on arbitrary and capricious review under \u00a7 4617(f), <em>supra, </em>the Court need not view the full administrative record to determine whether the Third Amendment, <em>in practice, </em>exceeds the bounds of HERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Generally, \u201c[i]t is not [the Court\u2019s] place to substitute [its] judgment for FHFA\u2019s,\u201d <em>Cnty. of Sonoma, </em>710 F.3d at 993, let alone in the face of HERA\u2019s \u201csweeping ouster of courts\u2019 power to grant equitable remedies,\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>56 F.3d at 1398. <em>See also MBIA Ins.

Requiring the Court to evaluate the merits of FHFA\u2019s decisionmaking each time it considers HERA\u2019s jurisdictional bar would render the anti-injunction provision hollow, disregarding Congress\u2019 express intention to divest the Court of jurisdiction to restrain FHFA\u2019s \u201cexercise of [its] powers or functions\u201d under <em>HERA' </em>\u2014 i.e., <em>how </em>FHFA employs its powers or functions. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(f).

Notwithstanding the plaintiffs\u2019 perspective that the Third Amendment was a \u201cone-sided deal\u201d favoring Treasury, the amendment was executed by two sophisticated parties, and there is nothing in the pleadings or the administrative record provided by Treasury that hints at coercion actionable under \u00a7 4617(a)(7). <em>See </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 51 (citing Treasury AR at 3775-802, 3833-62, 3883-94, 3895-903). Undoubtedly, many negotiations arise from one party conjuring up an idea, and then bringing their proposal to the other party. This claim does not pass muster under either Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\n<em>c: FHFA Has Not Placed the GSEs in De Facto Liquidation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABN\">The individual plaintiffs further contend that the Third Amendment amounts to a <em>de facto </em>liquidation, which exceeds FHFA\u2019s statutory authority as a conservator. By entering into an agreement that sweeps away nearly all GSE profits, they argue, FHFA has forsaken its statutory responsibility to \u201crehabilitate\u201d the GSEs and, instead, has effectively placed the GSEs in receivership. Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 55-58; <em>see </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(a)(2). But FHFA counters that full-scale rehabilitation is not the only possible statutory duty of a conservator \u2014 that the statute also permits a conservator to \u201creorganize\u201d or \u201cwind up\u201d the affairs of a GSE. FHFA Mot. at 30 (citing 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(a)(2)). The Court has no occasion to decide whether the conservator is empowered to wind down the GSEs. It is unnecessary to engage in a lengthy debate over statutory interpretation because the facts, as stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings, belie the individual plaintiffs\u2019 claims of <em>de facto </em>liquidation under receivership authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Here, the Court need not look further than the current state of the GSEs to find that FHFA has acted within its broad statutory authority as a conservator. Four years ago, on the brink of collapse, the GSEs went into conservatorship under the authority of FHFA. <em>E.g., Fairholme </em>Compl. at \u00b6 3. Today, both GSEs continue to operate, and have now regained profitability. <em>E.g., Fairholme </em>Compl at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 60, 63 (\u201cFannie and Freddie are now immensely profitable.\u201d); <em>cf. id. </em>at \u00b6 14 (noting that prior to the Third Amendment, \u201c[t]he conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie achieved the purpose of restoring the Companies to financial health\u201d). Unquestionably, the plaintiffs take great issue with FHFA\u2019s conduct between and since these two bookend facts. However, when the Court is asked to determine whether FHFA acted beyond, or contrary to, its responsibilities as conservator under a statute that grants the agency expansive discretion to act as it sees fit, it is the current state of affairs that must weigh heaviest on this -analysis. If the Third Amendment were really part of a scheme to liquidate the GSEs, then the GSEs would, presumably, be in liquidation rather than still be \u201cimmensely profitable.\u201d <em>See Fairholme </em>Compl. at \u00b6 60. There is no dispute that the Third Amendment substantially changed the flow of profits, directing billions of dollars into Treasury\u2019s coffers.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But that alteration, alone, is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>no way sufficient to reclassify a conserva-torship into a receivership.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The individual plaintiffs cite no precedent stating that a net worth sweep, or some equivalent, is functionally akin to liquidation. The case law cited in their opposition actually supports the position that FHFA is acting as a conservator. Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 52-54 (collecting cases). In sum, these cases stand for the proposition that a conservator should \u201ccarry on the business of the institution,\u201d <em>MBIA Ins. Corp. v. FDIC, </em>708 F.3d 234, 236 (D.C.Cir.2013), and \u201ctake actions necessary to restore a financially troubled institution to solvency,\u201d <em>McAllister v. RTC, </em>201 F.3d 570, 579 (5th Cir.2000). Here, the GSEs maintain an operational mortgage finance business and are, once again, profitable \u2014 two facts indicative of a successful conservatorship.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiffs plead no facts demonstrating that FHFA has exceeded its statutory authority as a conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Given that \u00a7 4617(f) bars subject matter jurisdiction<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> over all declaratory, injunc-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>five, and other equitable relief requested against the defendants that would restrain the conservator\u2019s ability to \u201cexercise [its statutory] powers or functions,\u201d all claims related to these prayers for relief must be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).

An Exception to HERA\u2019s Bar on Shareholder Derivative Claims Would Contravene the Plain Language of the Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The plaintiffs argue that, despite the general bar against derivative suits, they have standing to sue derivatively because FHFA, due to a conflict of interest, would be unwilling to sue itself or Treasury.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Class Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 32-35; Sup. Opp\u2019n at 14-16. In passing, <em>Kellmer </em>notes the existence, among other circuits, of an exception to the equivalent bar on shareholder derivative actions brought against the FDIC under the substantially similar FIRREA provision, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(2)(A), for instances of \u201cmanifest conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Kellmer, </em>674 F.3d at 850. The defendants are right, however, that this Circuit has not adopted such an exception. <em>E.g., </em>Treasury Mot. at 31. While <em>Kellmer </em>concerned a suit against officers and directors rather than, one against FHFA and Treasury, <em>see </em>Class Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 31, the Circuit\u2019s holding puts no limitations on HERA\u2019s rule against shareholder derivative suits. Based on the Circuit\u2019s discussion of the text of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A)\u00ae, it stands to reason that if the <em>Kellmer </em>Court had occasion to consider the purported conflict of interest exception, it would not have found that such an exception exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">The idea of an exception to HERA\u2019s rule against derivative suits comes from two cases, both considering FIRREA \u00a7 1821(d)(2)(A). First, the Federal Circuit held that, notwithstanding the \u201cgeneral proposition\u201d that the FDIC assumed \u201cthe right to control the prosecution of legal claims on behalf of the insured depository institution now in its receivership,\u201d a plaintiff has standing to bring a derivative suit when the FDIC has a \u201cmanifest conflict of <em>interest\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., when the plaintiffs ask the receiver to bring a suit based on a breach allegedly caused by the receiver. <em>First Hartford Corp. Pension Plan &amp; Trust v. United States, </em>194 F.3d 1279, 1295-96 (Fed.Cir.1999). Then, the Ninth Circuit \u201cadopt[ed] the <em>First Hartford </em>exception\u201d in <em>Delta Savings Bank v. United States, </em>265 F.3d 1017 (9th Cir.2001), for instances of conflict of interest between sufficiently \u201cinterdependent entities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1021-23.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">It strikes this Court as odd that a statute like HERA, through which Congress grants immense discretionary power to the conservator, \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A), and prohibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>courts from interfering with the exercise of such power, \u00a7 4617(f), would still house an <em>implicit </em>end-run around FHFA\u2019s conser-vatorship authority by means of the shareholder derivative suits that the statute explicitly bars. \u201cTo resolve this [oddity, however,] we need only heed Professor Frankfurter\u2019s timeless advice: \u2018(1) Read the statute; (2) read the statute; (3) read the statute!\u2019 \u201d <em>Kellmer, </em>674 F.3d at 850 (second internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Henry J. Friendly, <em>Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes, in </em>Benchmarks 196, 202 (1967)). The Circuit tells the Court that HERA, by its unambiguous text, removes the power to bring derivative suits from shareholders and gives it to FHFA. <em>Id. </em>(citing \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A)).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As the <em>basis </em>for its exception to the rule against shareholder derivative suits, the Federal Circuit explained that \u201cthe very object of the derivative suit mechanism is to permit shareholders to file suit on behalf of a corporation when the managers or directors of the corporation, perhaps due to a conflict of interest, are unable or unwilling to do so, despite it being in the best interests of the corporation.\u201d <em>First Hartford, </em>194 F.3d at 1295; <em>see also </em>Class Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 32 (quoting the same). Yet the existence of a rule against shareholder derivative suits, \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A)(i), indicates that courts cannot use the <em>rationale </em>for why derivative suits are available to shareholders as a legal tool \u2014 including the conflict of interest rationale \u2014 to carve out an <em>exception </em>to that prohibition. Derivative suits largely exist so that shareholders can protect a corporation from those who run it \u2014 and HERA takes the right to such suits away from shareholders.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> How, then, can a court base the exception to a rule barring shareholder derivative suits on the purpose of the \u201cderivative suit mechanism\u201d that rule seeks to bar? <em>See First Hartford, </em>194 F.3d at 1295. Such an exception would swallow the rule.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">By looking outside HERA\u2019s statutory language to find an exception to the rule against derivative suits that is based on the reason the judicial system permits derivative suits in the first place, a court would effectively be asserting its disagreement with the breadth of HERA\u2019s text. HERA provides no qualification for its bar on shareholder derivative suits, and neither will this Court. \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A) (the conservator \u201cshall ... immediately suc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ceed to ... <em>all </em>rights, titles, powers, and privileges ... of any stockholder) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It is a slippery slope for the Court to poke holes in, or limit, the plain language of a statute, especially when, as here, the plaintiffs have not asked the Court to weigh in on the statute\u2019s constitutionality. Therefore, the Court finds that HERA\u2019s plain language bars shareholder derivative suits, without exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\n<em>2. Even If the Exception Applies, There Is No Conflict of Interest between FHFA and Treasury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the <em>First Hartford </em>and <em>Delta Savings </em>exceptions to HERA\u2019s prohibition on shareholder derivative suits applied- to HERA \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A)\u00ae, there is no conflict of interest between FHFA and Treasury, and the class plaintiffs\u2019 fiduciary duty claims against Treasury would be dismissed. The <em>First Hartford </em>decision would not apply to the Treasury fiduciary duty claims because the plaintiffs, are not demanding that FHFA sue itself or sue another government entity on account of FHFA\u2019s own breach, 194 F.3d at 1295 \u2014 the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Treasury are due to Treasury\u2019s alleged breach. <em>E.g., In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac </em>Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 177-79. In <em>Delta Savings, </em>the Ninth Circuit\u2019s finding of a \u201cmanifest conflict of interest\u201d was not just based on the presence of two government entities, but rather two sufficiently <em>interrelated </em>government agencies. 265 F.3d at 1023 (\u201cWe do not suggest that the FDIC-as-receiver is faced with a disqualifying conflict every time a bank-in-receivership is asked to sue another federal agency; it is the nature of the [Office of Thrift Supervision (\u2018OTS\u2019) ] \u2014 FDIC fela-tionship that raises the conflict here.\u201d). As the <em>Delta Savings </em>Court explained, the FDIC and the OTS were \u201cinterrelated agencies with overlapping personnel, structures, and responsibilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1021-22. The relationship between FHFA and Treasury fails the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interrelatedness test. The class plaintiffs point to no \u201coperational or managerial overlap,\u201d and the agencies do not \u201cshare a common genesis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1022-23. Unlike OTS, which supervised thrift institutions and retained the ability to \u201cchoose the FDIC to be the conservator,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1023, Treasury plays no role in choosing FHFA to act' as a conservator for the GSEs. While Treasury and FHFA, <em>inter alia, </em>have jointly proposed regulations, <em>e.g., </em>Credit Risk Retention, 78 Fed.Reg. 183 (proposed Sept. 20, 2013), the fact that both entities exist within the financial regulation space cannot, on its own, satisfy <em>Delta Savings\u2019 </em>narrowly applied interrelatedness test. <em>See </em>265 F.3d at 1022-1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Furthermore, the Court understands that Treasury represented the only feasible entity \u2014 public or private \u2014 capable of injecting sufficient liquidity into and serving as a backstop for the GSEs within the short timeframe necessary to preserve their existence in September 2008. There was no other investment partner at FHFA\u2019s disposal. <em>See </em>FHFA Mot. at 7-8. In fact, Congress expressly foresaw the need for a Treasury-FHFA relationship, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>specifically authorizing Treasury to invest in the GSEs. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(g); <em>see also </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(b)(5)(D)(iii)(I) (Congress highlighted Treasury\u2019s potential role as creditor to the GSEs by explicitly creating an exception to FHFA\u2019s authority, as receiver, to disallow creditor claims made by Treasury).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> A relationship-based conflict of interest analysis, <em>see Delta Sav. Bank, </em>265 F.3d at 1023, does not require the Court to ignore the harsh economic realities facing the GSEs \u2014 and the national financial system if the GSEs collapsed\u2014 when FHFA and Treasury executed the PSPAs in 2008. Courts, generally, should be wary of labeling a transaction with an investor of last resort as a conflict of interest.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Thus, the class plaintiffs\u2019 derivative claims, on behalf of the GSEs, for breach of fiduciary duty by FHFA and Treasury, are dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of standing.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">C. The Plaintiffs\u2019 Breach of Contract and Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Claims for Monetary Damages Must Also Be Dismissed</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The plaintiffs further request monetary damages for claims of breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, specifically regarding the dividends and liquidation preference provisions within their respective GSE stock certificates. <em>See In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac </em>Am.

It follows that there can be no loss of a liquidation preference prior to the tim\u00e9 that such a preference can, contractually, be paid. Here, the GSEs remain in conservatorship, not receivership, and there is no evidence of <em>defacto </em>liquidation.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>Section 111(A)(4)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">The question for the Court cannot be whether the Third Amendment diminishes an <em>opportunity </em>for liquidation preferences at some point in the future, but rather whether the plaintiffs have suffered an injury to their right to a liquidation preference in fact and at present. Yet the individual plaintiffs assert that the Third Amendment \u201chas clearly injured Plaintiffs in a direct and personal way\u201d because \u201c[t]heir right to an opportunity to benefit from the liquidation preferences in their preferred stock \u2014 once valuable \u2014 is now worthless.... \u201d Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>36. But, just as there was a Third Amendment, the Court cannot definitively say there will be no Fourth or Fifth Amendment that will transform the current \u201copportunity to benefit from the liquidation preferences in [the plaintiffs\u2019] preferred stock.\u201d A ripeness requirement prevents the Court from deciding a case \u201ccontingent [on] future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.\u201d <em>Texas v.

Pfizer, </em>182 F.3d at 980. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 liquidation preference claims are not fit for a judicial decision until liquidation occurs.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Given that the plaintiffs maintain no current right to a liquidation prefererice while the GSEs are in conservatorship, the plaintiffs are no worse off today than they were before the Third Amendment. Therefore, there is no hardship imposed on the plaintiffs by withholding court consideration until this contingent right matures at the moment of liquidation. Once again, any present injury is, at most, a decrease in share value, which can only be claimed as part of a derivative action that would be barred by HERA. <em>See supra </em>n.39. \u201cMoreover, no irremediable adverse consequences flow from requiring a later challenge to\u201d the Third Amendment with regard to liquidation preferences since, as the defendants acknowledge, FHFA Mot. at 34-35, the right to a liquidation preference can be adjudicated during the statutorily prescribed receivership claims process. <em>Toilet Goods Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 158, 164, 87 S.Ct. 1520, 18 L.Ed.2d 697 (1967); <em>see also </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(K)(i), (b)(3)-(10). Until then, the plaintiffs have no direct claims to liquidation. preference-related damages that are ripe for judicial review, and their existing claims must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>In addition, for largely the same reasons that lead the Court to conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 liquidation preference claims lack ripeness, the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract and breach of implied covenant claims regarding liquidation preferences fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The right to this elevated preference for asset distribution, given to preferred shareholders under GSE stock certificates, is only triggered during liquidation. Consequently, the plaintiffs\u2019 direct breach of contract claims for injuries related to their liquidation preference rights can provide them no \u201cplausible\u201d relief against FHFA \u2014 or against the GSEs, for that matter \u2014 until the agency places the GSEs into receivership and commences the dissolution process. <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955; <em>see also supra </em>n.39 (the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to amorphously straddle the line between direct injury to their contingent right to a liquidation preference and derivative injury to the present \u201cvalue\u201d of their GSE holdings further demonstrates the uncertainty of their claims). The Court\u2019s reasoning requiring dismissal of such breach of contract claims also requires dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, insofar as such claims request monetary relief. \u201cAlthough an implied covenant of good faith and honest conduct exists in every contract, ... such subjective standards cannot override the literal terms of an agreement.\u201d <em>Gilbert v.

The \u201cright\u201d to dividends to which the plaintiffs refer throughout their briefs, then, is, in actuality, wholly dependent upon the discretion of the GSEs\u2019 board of directors. As the individual plaintiffs stress, \u201c[a] contractual \u2018right\u2019 is an entitlement to certain performance from the counter-party, and it is \u2018exercised\u2019 through unilateral action that does not require negotiation or mutual assent-.\u201d Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 38.

FHFA Mot. at 41-42. As Justice Holmes fittingly explained eighty-four years ago, an investment in stock \u201cpresupposes that the business is to go on, and therefore even if there are net earnings, the holder of stock, preferred as well as common, is entitled to have a dividend declared only out of such part of them as can be applied to dividends consistently with a wise administration of a going concern.\u201d <em>Wabash Ry.

Consistent with FHFA\u2019s assumption of the board\u2019s power, FHFA\u2019s director, James Lockhart, stated that \u201cthe common stock and preferred stock dividends will be eliminated.\u201d <em>In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac </em>Am.

The Court has ruled that the plaintiffs fail to demonstrate through their pleadings that FHFA violated its statutory authority under HERA by entering into the Third Amendment with Treasury. <em>See supra </em>Section 111(A)(4).

Since the class plaintiffs do not allege a physical taking, the Court must decide whether they adequately plead a taking as a result of government regulation. Class Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 67-70. Before determining which takings rubric to utilize for its analysis, a court must first evaluate whether a plaintiff has a cognizable property interest protected by the Fifth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Conti v.

Here, the class plaintiffs do not allege a cognizable property interest and, as such, fail to state a claim against FHFA and Treasury for a violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\n<em>1. The Jurisdictional Defect in the Class Plaintiffs\u2019 Pleadings Is Not Dispositive of Their Takings Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AIq\">As an initial matter, the defendants argue that the class plaintiffs\u2019 takings claims belong in the Court of Federal Claims rather than in this Court. Pursuant to the so-called \u201cBig\u201d Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1), the Court of Claims maintains exclusive jurisdiction over claims against the United States that exceed $10,000. Under the \u201cLittle\u201d Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2), the Court of Claims shares concurrent jurisdiction with federal district courts over claims against the United States not exceeding $10,000. In this Circuit, for complaints that include <em>potential </em>claims over $10,000, Little Tucker Act jurisdiction is only satisfied by a \u201cclearly and adequately expressed\u201d waiver of such claims. <em>See Waters v. Rumsfeld, </em>320 F.3d 265, 271-272 (D.C.Cir.2003) (\u201c[F]or a district court to maintain jurisdiction over a claim that might otherwise exceed $10,000, a plaintiffs waiver of amounts over that threshold must be clearly and adequately expressed.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the class plaintiffs argue that \u201cexpressly limit[ing] the prospective takings class to individuals who suffered losses less than $10,000\u201d is an adequate alternative to waiver, and that waiver is \u201cpremature\u201d until the class certification phase. Class Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 53. Yet the plaintiffs\u2019 refusal to clearly and adequately waive claims exceeding $10,000 in either their pleadings or subsequent opposition brief contravenes Circuit precedent. <em>See Goble v. Marsh, </em>684 F.2d 12, 15-16 (D.C.Cir. 1982); <em>Stone v. United States, </em>683 F.2d 449, 454 n. 8 (D.C.Cir.1982) (\u201cGenerally a plaintiffs\u2019 waiver should be set forth in the initial pleadings.\u201d). Nevertheless, the Circuit has also made clear its preference that the District Court should not transfer a case that is defective on Little Tucker Act grounds to the Court of Claims \u201cwithout first giving [the plaintiffs] an opportunity to amend their complaints to effect an adequate waiver.\u201d <em>Goble, </em>684 F.2d at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Thus, while the class plaintiffs\u2019 takings pleading is inadequate for jurisdiction in this Court under the \u201cLittle\u201d Tucker Act, in keeping with the tenor of Circuit case law, the Court would generally provide the class plaintiffs \u201can opportunity to amend their complaints to effect an adequate waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, doing so here is unnecessary, since the Court finds that the class plaintiffs\u2019 takings claims are dismissed on alternative grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\n<em>2. The Class Plaintiffs Fail to Plead a Cognizable Property Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Any property rights that the class plaintiffs claim can only arise from their GSE stock certificates. Yet \u201cexisting rules,\u201d \u201cunderstandings,\u201d or \u201cbackground principles\u201d derived from legislation enacted pri- or to the share purchase inhere in the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the stock certificates and \u201cdefine the range of interests that qualify for protection as \u2018property\u2019 under the Fifth\u201d Amendment. <em>Lucas v.

This enduring regulatory scheme governing the GSEs at the time the class plaintiffs purchased their shares represents the \u201cbackground principle\u201d that inheres in the stock certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The defendants argue that the plaintiffs fail to plead a cognizable property interest, for takings purposes, because the GSEs \u2014 and, therefore, the plaintiff shareholders \u2014 lack the right to exclude the government from their property. Treasury Mot. at 59-60; FHFA Mot. at 60-62; <em>but see </em>Class Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 61-65. The Court agrees. \u201c[T]he \u2018right to exclude\u2019 is doubtless ... \u2018one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.\u201d <em>Yee v. City of Escondido, </em>503 U.S. 519, 528, 112 S.Ct. 1522, 118 L.Ed.2d 153 (1992) (quoting <em>Kaiser Aetna v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 176, 100 S.Ct. 383, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979)). The defendants analogize the \u201cfederal oversight and regulation\u201d to which the GSEs have been subject to that of regulated financial institutions. <em>See </em>Treasury Mot. at 59. Utilizing this analogy, the defendants cite Federal Circuit case law for the proposition that the plaintiff shareholders have no present cognizable property interest in the dividends or liquidation preferences referenced in their stock certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In two cases involving statutorily regulated financial institutions, placed under the authority of either the FDIC or RTC, the Federal Circuit found that the shareholders of these institutions lacked the requisite property interests to support a takings claim. <em>Golden Pac. Bancorp v. United States, </em>15 F.3d 1066 (Fed.Cir.1994); <em>Cal. Hous. Sec., Inc. v. United States, </em>959 F.2d 955 (Fed.Cir.1992).<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> On account- of the existing regulatory structure permitting the appointment of a conservator or receiver, the financial institutions \u201clacked the fundamental right to exclude the government from its property at those times when the government could legally impose a conservatorship or receivership on [the institutions].\u201d <em>Golden Pac., </em>15 F.3d at 1073 (quoting <em>Cal. Hous., </em>959 F.2d at 958) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the result of this \u201cregulated environment\u201d is imputed to the shareholders of the financial institution, who thus hold \u201cless than the full bundle of property rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The Court finds this reasoning to be persuasive. By statutory definition, the GSEs are subject to governmental control at the discretion of FHFA\u2019s director. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(a)(2). Therefore, the GSE shareholders necessarily lack the right to exclude the government from their investment when FHFA places the GSEs under governmental <em>control </em>\u2014 e.g., into conserva-torship.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> This conclusion is especially true since the -statute explicitly grants FHFA the power to assume \u201call rights ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>of the regulated entity, and of any stockholder....\u201d <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(b)(2)\u00ae.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Without disputing the broader analogy that the defendants draw between regulated financial institutions and the GSEs,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> the class plaintiffs seek to distinguish the Federal Circuit decisions based on <em>why </em>FHFA and Treasury entered into the Third Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 63. But motives are irrelevant, for takings purposes, if the plaintiffs possess no cognizable property interests in the first place. <em>Golden Pacific </em>and <em>California Housing </em>stand for the general notion that investors have no right to exclude the government from their alleged property interests when the regulated institution in which they own shares is placed into conservatorship or receivership. <em>See Cal. Hous., </em>959 F.2d at 958 (no right to exclude when a conservatorship or receivership is legally imposed). Whether the defendants executed the Third Amendment to generate profits for taxpayers or to escape a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d of the GSEs seeking funding in order to pay owed dividends back to Treasury, it does not change the fact that it was executed during a period of conservatorship and, thus, after the plaintiffs\u2019 property interests \u2014 whatever they may have been prior to the Third Amendment \u2014 were extinguished. Unless the plaintiffs can demonstrate that FHFA could not legally impose a conservatorship upon the GSEs at the time of the Third Amendment, allegations of mischievous intentions during a conservatorship do not revive already eliminated cognizable property interests. <em>See id. </em>And here, the class plaintiffs only plead that the Third Amendment was inconsistent with FHFA\u2019s responsibilities <em>as </em>.conservator \u2014 not that FHFA lacked any legal right to <em>be </em>a conservator on August 17, 2012. <em>E.g., In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac </em>Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 92-101 (alleging that \u201cthe Third Amendment was inconsistent and in conflict with FHFA\u2019s statutory responsibilities as a conservator\u201d); <em>see also </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(a)(2) (\u201c[FHFA] may, <em>at the discretion of the Director, </em>be appointed conservator or receiver for the purpose of reorganizing, rehabilitating, or winding up the affairs of a regulated entity.\u201d) (emphasis added). Given that the class plaintiffs cannot repair the overarching threshold defect of having no cognizable property interest at stake, their takings claim must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (\u201c[0]nly a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.\u201d).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\n<em>3.

Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393, 415, 43 S.Ct. 158, 67 L.Ed. 322 (1922). The Supreme Court has developed a series of analytical rubrics under which courts are to determine \u201cwhether a regulation \u2018reaches a certain magnitude\u2019 in depriving an owner' of the use of property.\u201d <em>See Dist. Intown Props. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. D.C., </em>198 F.3d 874, 878 (D.C.Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Mahon, </em>260 U.S. at 413, 43 S.Ct. 158). There are two principal \u201cnarrow categories\u201d of <em>per se </em>takings. <em>See Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., </em>544 U.S. 528, 538, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876 (2005). First, \u201ca permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve.\u201d <em>Loretto, </em>458 U.S. at 426, 102 S.Ct. 3164. Here, the government has not physically occupied the plaintiffs\u2019 property.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Second, a government regulation that deprives an owner of <em>\u201call </em>economically beneficial uses\u201d of his property is also a taking. <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 1019, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992). Regardless of whether <em>Lucas </em>only applies to real property, <em>compare </em>Treasury Mot. at 61, <em>with </em>Class Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 67-68, the plaintiffs cannot find relief under a \u201ctotal wipeout\u201d theory. <em>See </em>Class Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 67-68. The plaintiffs maintain \u201ceconomically beneficial use\u201d of their shares, since the stock very much remains a tradable, equity. Indeed, GSE shares are traded daily on public over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>given the Court\u2019s rejection of the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged present rights to dividends and liquidation payments, it is clear that the government has not \u201cseized [the plaintiffs\u2019] private property and kept that property for itself.\u201d Class Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">A regulatory taking, on the other hand, is evaluated under the \u201cad hoc\u201d inquiry set forth in <em>Penn Central Transp.

In view of the unambiguous language of the stock certificate\u2019s dividend provision coupled with Treasury\u2019s discretion to pay dividends under the PSPAs, the plaintiffs cannot show that the Third Amendment rendered their prospects of receiving dividends any less discretionary than they were prior to the amendment.

Hous., </em>959 F.2d at 958.

Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 30-35; <em>In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac </em>Derivative Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 20-2 1. There can be no doubt that the plaintiff shareholders understood the risks intrinsic to investments in entities as closely regulated as the GSEs, and, as such, have not now been deprived of any <em>reasonable </em>investment-backed expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Looking to the character of the governmental action in dispute, the <em>Penn Central </em>Court explained that \u201c[a] \u2018taking\u2019 may more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government than when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.\u201d 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646. Here, the plaintiffs do not plead a physical invasion of their property. Whether the regulatory action taken by FHFA and Treasury when executing the Third Amendment \u201cpromote[s] the common good\u201d or advances a public purpose, however, is in dispute. The Supreme Court in <em>Kelo v. City of New London, </em>a public use case, reaffirmed that courts should take a deferential stance regarding what constitutes a legitimate public purpose. 545 U.S. 469, 487-88, 125 S.Ct. 2655, 162 L.Ed.2d 439 (2005) (\u201cWhen the legislature\u2019s purpose is legitimate and its means are not irrational, our cases make clear that empirical debates over the wisdom of takings ... are not to be carried out in the federal courts.\u201d); <em>see also Hilton Washington Corp. v. D.C., 777 </em>F.2d 47, 49-50 (D.C.Cir.1985) (looking only for a \u201cvalid public purpose\u201d when examining <em>Penn Central\u2019s\u25a0 </em>\u201ccharacter of the governmental action\u201d factor).

To reach this conclusion with certainty, however, the Court would likely need to permit additional fact-finding. Nevertheless, more discovery is unnecessary because <em>Penn Central\u2019s </em>first two factors weigh strongly enough against the plaintiffs\u2019 takings claims that dismissal would be proper in this case. <em>See Monsanto, </em>467 U.S. at 1005, 104 S.Ct. 2862 (\u201c[T]he force of [the reasonable investment-backed expectations] factor [here] is so overwhelming ... that it disposes of the taking question.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\n<em>4. Claims of an Unconstitutional Taking of Liquidation Rights Are Not Ripe</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Moreover, the Court would also dismiss the class plaintiffs\u2019 takings claims, at least in relation to liquidation preference rights, on ripeness grounds. As mentioned above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\u201c[a] claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.\u201d <em>Texas v.

Liquidation preferences only entitle a preferred stockholder to payment in the event of liquidation. Consistent with -the Court\u2019s reasoning discussed <em>supra, </em>Section 111(C)(1), the government cannot take a property right that has not yet matured. This Court\u2019s findings concerning cognizable property interests aside, a claim of an unconstitutional taking of liquidation preference rights may only be brought once a liquidation process has commenced.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">It is understandable for the Third Amendment, which sweeps nearly all GSE profits to Treasury, to raise eyebrows, or even engender a feeling of discomfort. But any sense of unease over the defendants\u2019 conduct is not enough to overcome the plain meaning of HERA\u2019s text. Here, the plaintiffs\u2019 true gripe is with the language of a statute that enabled FHFA and, consequently, Treasury, to take unprecedented steps to salvage the largest players in the mortgage finance industry before their looming collapse triggered a systemic panic. Indeed, the plaintiffs\u2019 grievance is really with Congress itself. It was Congress, after all, that parted the legal seas so that FHFA and Treasury could effectively do whatever they thought was needed to stabilize and, if necessary, liquidate, the GSEs.. Recognizing its role in the constitutional system, this Court does not seek to evaluate the merits of whether the Third Amendment is sound financial \u2014 -or even moral \u2014 policy. The</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Court does, however, find that HERA\u2019s unambiguous statutory provisions, coupled with the unequivocal language of the plaintiffs\u2019 original GSE stock certificates, compels the dismissal of all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Thus, for the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and DENIES the individual plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue this date.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\">. While Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not the only GSEs, <em>see, e.g., </em>Federal Home Loan Banks, for convenience, this Memorandum Opinion will employ the term \"GSE\u201d to refer to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac exclusively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\">. Rather than list each of the numerous dockets on which the briefs in this matter have been filed, this Memorandum Opinion will cite the name of the brief, the date on which it was filed on all relevant dockets, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>short form citation by which the brief will be referenced thereinafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\">. The purpose of HERA\u2019s provision authorizing Treasury to invest in the GSEs was, in part, to' \"prevent disruptions in the availability of mortgage finance\u201d \u2014 disruptions presumably due to the challenges confronting the GSEs in 2008. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455(Z)(1)(B); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(g)(1)(B) (\"Emergency determination required!.] In connection with any use of this [purchasing] authority, the [Treasury] Secretary must determine that such actions are necessary to \u2014 (i) provide stability to the financial markets; (ii) prevent disruptions in the availability of mortgage finance; and (iii) protect the taxpayer.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b256-5\">. Since 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455\u00a9 and 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(g) are identical provisions, this Memorandum Opinion, hereinafter, will refer only to the Fannie Mae provision, \u00a7 1719(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\">. \u201cA liquidation preference is a priority right to receive distributions from the [GSEs\u2019] assets in the event they are dissolved.\u201d Individual Pls.'s Opp\u2019n at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\">. Given the Court's ruling to grant the defendants' motion to dismiss, there is no need to evaluate the merits of the defendants\u2019 decision to execute the Third Amendment instead of selecting other options in lieu of the cash dividend that, under the PSPAs, was equal to 10% of Treasury's liquidation preference. Nevertheless, the Court notes its disagreement with the plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of one purported alternative to the Third Amendment. The plaintiffs claim \u25a0 that the GSEs \"had no obligation to pay the 10 percent dividend in cash,\u201d and instead could simply opt to pay a 12% dividend that would be added to the outstanding liquidation preference rather than be paid in cash each quarter. Individual Pls.'s Opp\u2019n at 9, 66-67. However, the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that paying 10% in cash or adding 12% to the liquidation preference was merely a matter of choice, Class Pls.\u2019s Opp'n at 11, directly contravenes the unambiguous language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>contract. The relevant provisions, which are identical, in Treasury's respective stock certificates with each of the GSEs, state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\" 'Dividend Rate' means 10.0%; provided, however, that if at any time the [GSE] shall have for any reason <em>failed to pay dividends in cash in a timely manner as required by this Certificate, </em>then immediately following such <em>failure </em>and for all Dividend Periods thereafter until the Dividend Period following the date on which the Company shall have paid in cash full cumulative dividends (including any unpaid dividends added to the Liquidation Preference pursuant to Section 8), the 'Dividend Rate\u2019 shall mean 12.0%.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Treasury AR at 33, 67-68 (Treasury Senior Preferred Stock Certificates \u00a7 2(c)) (emphasis added). The provision makes clear that 10% cash dividends were \"required by\u201d the stock certificates, and that 12% dividends deferred to the liquidation preference were only triggered upon a \"failure\u201d to meet the 10% cash dividend requirement. Thus, classifying the 12% dividend feature as a \"penalty,\u201d as Treasury does, is surely more accurate than classifying it as a \"right.\u201d <em>Compare </em>Treasury Defs.\u2019s Reply at 49-50 (D.D.C. May 2, 2014) (\"Treasury Reply\u201d), <em>with </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 9. The plaintiffs cannot gloss over this distinction by repetitively using the phrase \"in kind\u201d to describe the 12% dividend feature. <em>See </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp'n at 9, 66-67,' 80-81; Class Pls.\u2019s Opp.'n at 16. Inclusion of \"in kind\u201d within \u00a7 2(c) would have slightly improved the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the contract expressly permitted the GSEs to simply choose between a 10% cash dividend or 12% dividend deferred to the liquidation preference. But, as plaintiffs are certainly aware, \"in kind\u201d appears nowhere within the stock certificates\u2019 dividends provision. <em>See </em>Treasury AR at 33, 67-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">With regard to the two other hypothetical alternatives presented by the individual plaintiffs \u2014 Treasury accepting lower dividends or allowing the GSEs to use excess profits to pay down the liquidation preference and, thus, the basis for the 10% dividend \u2014 the Court has no occasion to determine whether the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments demonstrate arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking or only amount to second-guessing decisionmakers charged with exercising predictive judgments. <em>Compare </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 79-82, <em>with </em>FHFA Defs.'s Reply at 52-58 (D.D.C.

Whether or not FHFA is \"winding up the affairs of\u201d the GSEs, the Circuit\u2019s interpretation of congressional intent to grant the FDIC enormous discretion to act as a conservator or receiver during the savings and loan crisis of 1989 applies with equal force to the mortgage finance crisis of 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\">. As the Court will explain below, this is true regardless of whether the defendants have levied some of' their non-monetary claims against Treasury instead of FHFA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\">. The class, <em>Arrowood, </em>and <em>Fairholme </em>plaintiffs each present a claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that closely parallels the individual plaintiffs\u2019 APA claims for arbitrary and capricious conduct. <em>See, e.g., In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac </em>Am. Compl. at \u00b6 161 (\"... Fannie Mae, acting through FHFA, acted arbitrarily and unreasonably and not in good faith or with fair dealing toward the members of the Fannie Preferred Class.\u201d). Given the breadth of HERA and this Circuit\u2019s wariness toward evaluating <em>how </em>FHFA carries out its conser-vatorship responsibilities, <em>any </em>claim \u2014 APA- or \u2022 contract-based \u2014 dependent upon allegations of arbitrary and capricious behavior coupled with a request for equitable relief probably should be summarily dismissed under \u00a7 4617(f). Yet regardless of whether the Circuit sees fit to establish a categorical rule, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of breach of the implied covenant which seek equitable relief are still generally dismissed oh \u00a7 4617(f) grounds because the Court finds that FHFA acted within its statutory authority under HERA. <em>See infra </em>Section 111(A)(4). And because some plaintiffs include within their breach of the implied covenant allegations a request for monetary relief, dismissal is also proper on ripeness and failure to state a claim grounds. <em>See infra </em>Section III(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">. While legislative history on this issue is unrevealing, the Court can easily imagine that Congress, with its exclusion from the sunset provision of Treasury\u2019s ability to \"exercise any rights received in connection with ... securities purchased,\u201d was contemplating an investment agreement whereby Treasury maintained future rights to purchase more GSE securities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b264-5\">. Similarly, the fact that Treasury, prior to executing the First and Second Amendments, made \u00a7 1719(g)(1)(B) \u201cemergency determinations\u201d generally required before purchasing new securities does not, alone, signify the purchase of new securities. <em>See </em>Treasury Reply at 37-38 (determinations made \u201cbecause [Treasury] was pledging additional taxpayer funds to the GSEs\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b265-5\">.

This subsection, then, will address all other claims for equitable relief against FHFA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b267-6\">. It is worth noting that Treasury's insistence on receiving cash dividends, as required under the PSPAs, rather than accepting a 12% dividend deferred to the liquidation preference, suggests that Treasury believed there was no intention to imminently liquidate the GSEs. <em>See </em>Treasury Reply at 49-50; <em>see also supra </em>n.7. A belief that there was no planned liquidation \u2014 and thus no forthcoming receipt of liquidation payments \u2014 would mean that adding owed dividends to Treasury\u2019s ever-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>growing liquidation preference would produce increased risk for the taxpayer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\">.The individual plaintiffs specifically argue that the net worth sweep exceeds FHFA\u2019s authority as a conservator because it (1) depletes available capital; (2) \"eliminates the possibility of normal business operations\u201d; and (3) carries an ultimate intent to wind down the GSEs. Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp'n at 56-58. First, the original dividend distribution scheme undfer the PSPAs also depleted the GSEs\u2019 capital. Dividends distributed to security holders, by nature, constitute a depletion of available capital. Second, there is no HERA provision that requires a conservator .to abide by every public statement it has made. To the contrary, HERA permits a conservator wide latitude to flexibly operate the GSEs over time. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(b)(2) Third, even if FHFA has explicitly stated an intent to eventually wind down the GSEs, such an intent is not automatically inconsistent with acting as a conservator. There surely can be a fluid progression from conser-vatorship to receivership without violating HERA, and that progression could very well involve a conservator that acknowledges an ultimate goal of liquidation. FHFA can lawfully take steps to maintain operational soundness and solvency, conserving the assets of the GSEs, until it decides that the time is right for liquidation. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(D) (\u201d[p]owers as conservator\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Moreover, since the Third Amendment remains consistent with FHFA's wide-ranging authority as a conservator, there is no need for the Court to further resolve whether the amendment falls within FHFA\u2019s authority to \"transfer or sell any asset\u201d under \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(G). <em>Compare </em>FHFA Mot. at 27-29 <em>and </em>FHFA Reply at 5-7, <em>with </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 63-66 <em>and </em>Individual Pls.\u2019s Reply at 31-33. The plaintiffs essentially argue that the Third Amendment runs counter to FHFA\u2019s power to transfer assets <em>because </em>FHFA is not seeking to \"rehabilitate\u201d the GSEs when making this transfer. Individual Pls.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 64-66. Yet, as explained,, the Court finds the plaintiffs' premise \u2014 that FHFA\u2019s conduct is inconsistent with a conser-vatorship \u2014 to be lacking. Therefore, whether or not FHFA classifies the Third Amendment as a transfer of assets is of no moment. The breadth of Congress\u2019 grant of authority to FHFA under HERA means that the Court's analysis must center much more on the ends than the means.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b268-11\">. Indeed, the GSE\u2019s current profitability is the fundamental justification for the plaintiffs' prayers for equitable and monetary relief. In other words, this litigation only exists <em>because </em>the GSEs have, under FHFA's authority, progressed from insolvency to profitability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b268-12\">. The Court acknowledges that there appears to be some-confusion over whether Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6) applies to \u00a7 4617(f). This Circuit has framed FIRREA\u2019s substantially identical anti-injunction provision, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(j), as a bar on <em>relief.

As such, there is no requirement for the Court to decide whether such claims are derivative or direct. However, if such a determination were necessary, the Court notes that it would find that the <em>Fairholme </em>plaintiffs' fiduciary duty claim is derivative in nature and, therefore, barred under</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">\u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A)(i) as well. Without resolving whether Delaware and/or Virginia law applies to the <em>Fairholme </em>plaintiffs\u2019 fiduciary duty claim, the Court \u2014 like both parties \u2014 -will briefly utilize the analysis established by the Supreme Court of Delaware in <em>Tooley </em>v. <em>Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, Inc., </em>845 A.2d 1031 (Del.2004). To determine whether a shareholder\u2019s claim is derivative or direct, the Court asks: \"(1) who suffered the alleged harm (the corporation or the suing stockholders, individually); and (2) who would receive the benefit of any recoveiy or other\u2019 remedy (the corporation or the stockholders, individually)?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1033. Regardless of whether the <em>Fairholme </em>plaintiffs plead injuries to both the GSEs and the individual plaintiff shareholders, <em>see </em>FHFA Reply at 23; <em>but see </em>Sup. Opp\u2019n at 12-13, the claim qualifies as derivative, not direct, under Tooley's second prong. Here, recovery or relief will not flow \"directly to the stockholders.\u201d <em>Tooley, </em>845 A.2d at 1036. Instead, the equitable relief <em>Fairholme </em>seeks \u2014 \"namely, vacating the Third Amendment and returning its resulting dividends from Treasury to the Enterprises <em>(Fairholme </em>Compl. \u00b6 146(d)-(e)) \u2014 \u25a0 would flow first and foremost to the [GSEs].\u201d <em>FHFA Reply </em>at 24. That relief will <em>not </em>flow directly to the <em>Fairholme </em>plaintiffs is especially true since, after signing the PSPAs, Treasury effectively maintained discretion over GSE dividend payments, <em>see, e.g., </em>Treasury AR at 24 (Fannie Mae PSPA \u00a7 5.1), and the GSEs, still in conservatorship, are not liquidating assets pursuant to any liquidation preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">Finally, Treasury\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs lack prudential standing, Treasury Mot. at 34-36, does not require consideration here. <em>Cf.
