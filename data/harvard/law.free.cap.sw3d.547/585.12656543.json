Plaintiffs hired attorney Gary Growe (\"Defendant\") to represent them and based upon Growe's advice entered into a settlement agreement with the MREC. Thereafter, the United States brought criminal charges against Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs retained other counsel to represent them in the criminal proceedings and through a plea agreement pled guilty to one of seven counts charged in exchange for the dismissal of the other six counts. Plaintiffs did not appeal or file any post-conviction motions while their sentences were in effect. After serving their sentences, however, Plaintiffs sued Defendant for legal malpractice, alleging Defendant's advice to enter into a settlement agreement with the MREC, which contained facts the United States allegedly used to indict them, led to their criminal charges. Defendant moved for leave to add his law firm, Growe, Eisen &amp; Karlen, LLC (collectively \"Counterclaimants\") as a counter-plaintiff. The court granted leave and Counterclaimants filed a claim for breach of contract against Adewunmi for the money he failed to pay for his representation. The trial court granted summary judgment for Defendant on the malpractice claim and for Counterclaimants on the breach of contract claim. Adewunmi raises five points on appeal, four related to his malpractice claim, and one related to Counterclaimants' breach of contract claim. Juan, acting pro se, raises three points, which go to his malpractice claim. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs worked together on several real estate transactions from 2003 to 2005. In these transactions, Plaintiffs prepared applications for financing on behalf of the buyers which contained false, material statements about the buyer's ability to repay. In 2005, the United States began investigating Plaintiffs' real estate practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2008, the MREC instituted disciplinary proceedings against Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs hired Defendant to represent them. On January 11, 2010, on the advice of Defendant, Plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement with the MREC, agreeing to have their real estate licenses revoked in exchange for the case being dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The settlement agreement contained a joint stipulation of facts and conclusions of law referencing seven counts related to seven separate real estate transactions occurring in St. Louis from August 2003 to August 2005. The stipulation stated Plaintiffs practiced real estate as part of the \"Adewunmi Team,\" and for each count, stated the \"Adewunmi Team\" knowingly assisted the buyer and lender in the preparation of a loan application that included false information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 3, 2010, the United States filed a seven count indictment against Plaintiffs. Count I charged Plaintiffs with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, counts II through VI charged Plaintiffs with mail fraud, and count VII charged Plaintiffs with knowingly making a false statement for the purpose of obtaining a loan to be accepted and guaranteed by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). The indictment alleged Plaintiffs worked on several real estate transactions between September 1, 2003, and September 1, 2005, where Plaintiffs prepared applications for financing on behalf of the buyers which contained false, material statements about the buyer's ability to repay. Specifically, the indictment referenced five transactions in St. Louis, only one of which was listed in the MREC disciplinary proceeding. The conspiracy charge (count I) referenced all five transactions, the mail fraud charges (counts II through VI) applied to each property individually, and the knowingly making a false statement to HUD charge (count VII) only applied to the one property in common with the criminal and MREC charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January 2011, Plaintiffs signed plea agreements in which they agreed to plead guilty to knowingly making a false statement to HUD (count VII) in exchange for the dismissal of counts I through VI. On January 11, 2011, the district court accepted Plaintiffs' pleas upon determining that they were entered knowingly and voluntarily and supported by an independent factual basis. At the plea hearing, Plaintiffs acknowledged that they were under oath and could be prosecuted for making a false statement or perjury. Plaintiffs told the court that, other than the plea agreement, no promises or assurances had been made to them to cause them to plead guilty, no one had tried to force or coerce them into pleading guilty, and they were pleading guilty on their own free will. Plaintiffs agreed with the prosecutor's recitation of the facts he argued would be proven if they went to trial and admitted to committing the acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 7, 2011, Adewunmi was sentenced to three years' probation and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment and restitution of $127,000. On May 20, 2011, Juan was sentenced to one year and one day' imprisonment and to one year of supervised release. Juan was also ordered to pay a $100 special assessment and restitution of $127,000. Plaintiffs were ordered jointly and severally liable for the criminal monetary penalties imposed. Plaintiffs did not directly appeal their convictions or move for post-conviction relief while serving their sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 13, 2014, Juan filed his petition for legal malpractice against Defendant. On January 5, 2015, Adewunmi filed his petition for legal malpractice against Defendant. The court consolidated the cases for discovery and motion rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs alleged they retained Defendant to represent them in the action brought against them by the MREC; that Defendant advised them to enter into a settlement agreement and stipulated facts requiring them to admit they assisted a buyer and lender in the preparation of loan documents that contained false information to ensure that the buyer would secure a home loan; that Defendant advised them that the stipulation could not be used against them in any other legal action; that based upon that advice, Plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement with the MREC; that thereafter they were charged in federal court with fraud and other violations of federal criminal law; that the federal criminal charges were based on the stipulation they signed and the stipulation was admissible as evidence against them in the criminal proceedings; and that their criminal attorneys advised them to enter a plea agreement dismissing six of seven counts but requiring them to plead guilty to one count of knowingly making a false statement to HUD because the stipulation was admissible evidence against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Counterclaimants filed a claim against Adewunmi alleging breach of contract for Adewunmi's failure to pay them the amounts due for the legal representation provided. On May 8, 2015, Defendant filed motions for summary judgment against Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 16, 2015, Juan filed a verified petition for writ of error coram nobis in federal district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Juan alleged his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because his plea counsel concealed a conflict of interest that arose during plea negotiations, misrepresented the government's plea offer to him, and coerced him into pleading guilty. He also alleged the court failed to adequately inform him of the risks associated with dual representation during the hearing on the propriety of joint representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 26, 2016, the federal district court dismissed Juan's petition with prejudice. The court found Juan could have discovered and raised his claims in a direct appeal or in a post-conviction motion before completing his supervised release, and that the plea transcript demonstrated that Juan entered his guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily. Based on Juan's testimony at the plea hearing and because Juan failed to demonstrate his actual innocence, the court concluded he could not show a fundamental error was committed such that circumstances existed compelling action to achieve justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant filed amended motions for summary judgment against Plaintiff. On April 21, 2016, the trial court granted summary judgment for Defendant. Plaintiffs appealed. We dismissed those appeals without prejudice because there was no final, appealable judgment due to Counterclaimants' remaining breach of contract claim against Adewunmi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 31, 2017, Counterclaimants motioned for summary judgment on their claim against Adewunmi. On May 31, 2017, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of Counterclaimants. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The standard of review on appeal regarding summary judgment is essentially\n   de novo.\n   <em>\n    Foster v.

Juan, pro se, raises sufficiently similar arguments made in Adewunmi's first three points as applied to him. Because we find Plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from bringing their malpractice claims against Defendant, we need not address the other points raised by Plaintiffs and the only remaining point we must address is Adewunmi's point five regarding prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Point V is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Determination of the right to prejudgment interest is de novo.\n   <em>\n    Children Int'l v.

Since there was no contractual agreement on prejudgment interest, the only issue here is whether the statutory award of prejudgment interest was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Under section 408.020, parties are entitled to prejudgment interest of nine percent if the amount owed is liquidated or readily ascertainable and a demand for payment, definite on both time and amount, has been made on the debtor party.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8329415\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/215/194/#p202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8329415\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/215/194/#p202\">\n    at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If a demand for payment was not made before a lawsuit was filed, then the filing itself constitutes a demand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711678\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/972/545/#p550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the demand need not be in a certain form, it must be definite on amount and time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711678\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/972/545/#p550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Generally, prejudgment interest is not warranted when the debtor is unaware of the amount owed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711678\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/972/545/#p550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The mere fact that a party denies liability or defends against a claim does\n   not preclude recovery of prejudgment interest.\n   <em>\n    Jablonski v.

App. W.D. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Here, we find Adewunmi's argument is without merit for several reasons. First, Adewunmi did not argue to the trial court that no demand for payment had been made. Thus, Adewunmi failed to preserve this issue for review.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Frame\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11109650\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/41/544/#p550\">\n    41 S.W.3d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550 (Mo. App. E.D. 2001). This is a sufficient reason alone to deny Adewunmi's point V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Second, Adewunmi acknowledges that Counterclaimants' petition filed in February 2015 requesting such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper has been held by this Court to be sufficient to satisfy the demand requirement. See\n   <em>\n    Rois v. H.C. Sharp Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8462596,8462558\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/203/761/\">\n    203 S.W.3d 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767 (Mo. App. E.D. 2006) (stating that a petition need not make a specific request for prejudgment interest and that a petition which prays that the court grant such other relief as may be proper is sufficient). Thus, Adewunmi acknowledges Counterclaimants were at least entitled to prejudgment interest from the time they filed their petition in February 2015. See\n   <em>\n    Nangle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711678\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/972/545/#p550\">\n    972 S.W.2d at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If a demand for payment was not made prior to filing a lawsuit, then the filing itself constitutes a demand.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Third, we find Counterclaimants made several demands before filing their claim. This was admitted by Adewunmi. In Counterclaimants' statement of uncontroverted material facts to support their motion for summary judgment, Counterclaimants alleged Adewunmi was billed $97,843.00 plus $6,016.68 for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, Adewunmi had paid $53,926.29, and Adewunmi had a balance due of $49,933.39 since August 4, 2010, the date of his last payment. This was supported by Defendant's affidavit and copies of the invoices sent to Adewunmi which are definite on amount and time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In his response, Adewunmi admitted he had been billed $97,843.00 plus $6,016.68 for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, he had paid $53,926.29, and he made his last payment August 4, 2010. Thus, Counterclaimants made their demands by sending Adewunmi invoices for payments and Adewunmi admitted as much. See\n   <em>\n    Doe Run Resources Corp. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's London\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093452\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/400/463/#p477\">\n    400 S.W.3d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477 (Mo. App. E.D. 2013) (finding multiple demands made where plaintiff sent invoices and spreadsheets detailing the invoices and costs);\n   <em>\n    Bledsoe Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc. v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9391659\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/66/169/#p173\">\n    66 S.W.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (Mo. App. W.D. 2002) (ordering prejudgment interest to be recalculated to the date that the bill was sent); cf.\n   <em>\n    Nangle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711678\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/972/545/#p550\">\n    972 S.W.2d at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no demand made by attorney to client where he neither requested payment nor sent a bill to client). While Adewunmi denied he owed $49,933.39 based on his argument that the legal services were below the standard set forth by the Missouri Bar, this does not preclude recovery of prejudgment interest.\n   <em>\n    Jablonski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300198\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/291/345/#p350\">\n    291 S.W.3d at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, Adewunmi admits in his brief he has no evidence to dispute he owed $49,933.39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Lastly, without citing to any evidence to support his argument, Adewunmi argues no demand was made because the parties had several communications regarding fees and Defendant at one point offered to take a flat fee in lieu of an hourly rate. Even if this were true, it does not help Adewunmi. The purpose of prejudgment interest is to promote settlement of lawsuits and to fully compensate a party by accounting for the time-value of money.\n   <em>\n    Children Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8329415\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/215/194/#p202\">\n    215 S.W.3d at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That Counterclaimants may have negotiated with Adewunmi trying to settle this claim should not have a negative\n   impact on Counterclaimants' ability to collect the full amount owed when the requirements for prejudgment interest have been met, and Counterclaimants had to file their petition to pursue their damages because an agreement could not be reached. Point V is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Lisa P.
