We hold that it does not, but on grounds different from those expressed by the court of appeals. However, we hold that the reservation's savings clause is ambiguous and affirm the court of appeals' remand on this issue. In addition, we hold that section 91.402 of the Texas Natural Resources Code does not preclude a lessor's common law claim for breach of contract. Finally, we affirm the court of appeals' judgment as to attorney's fees pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 91a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1996, Lois Strieber conveyed, by warranty deed, fee simple title to a 120-acre tract of land in Dewitt County to Lorene Koopmann and her late husband. The deed included the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   RESERVATIONS FROM AND EXCEPTIONS TO CONVEYANCE AND WARRANTY:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. There is EXCEPTED from this conveyance and RESERVED to the Grantor and her heirs and assigns for the term hereinafter set forth one-half (\u00bd) of the royalties from the production of oil, gas ... and all other minerals ... which reserved royalty interest is a non-participating\n   interest and is reserved for the limited term of 15 years from the date of this Deed and as long thereafter as there is production in paying or commercial quantities of oil, gas, or said other minerals from said land or lands pooled therewith. If at the expiration of 15 years from the date of this Deed, oil, gas, or said other minerals are not being produced or mined from said land ... this reserved royalty interest shall be null and void and the Grantor's rights in such reserved royalty shall terminate. It is expressly understood, however, that if any oil, gas, or mineral or mining lease covering said land ... is maintained in force and effect by payment of shut-in royalties or any other similar payments made to the lessors or royalty holder in lieu of actual production while there is located on the lease or land pooled therewith a well or mine capable of producing oil, gas, or other minerals in paying or commercial quantities but shut-in for lack of market or any other reason, then ... it will be considered that production in paying or commercial quantities is being obtained from the land herein conveyed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thus, Strieber reserved a fifteen-year, one-half non-participating royalty interest (the NPRI), which could be extended \"as long thereafter as there is production in paying or commercial quantities\" under an oil and gas lease. The deed was dated December 27, 1996. Lorene Koopmann later executed a gift mineral deed conveying an undivided two-thirds of her mineral interest to her two children (together, the Koopmanns).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2007, Lorene Koopmann entered a three-year lease of the tract with Hawke Enterprises. The lease provided for a three-year primary term ending October 2010, and it gave Hawke the option to extend the primary term an additional two years in exchange for a $24,000 payment. Hawke later assigned the lease to Burlington Resources Oil &amp; Gas Company, L.P.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   No production had occurred in 2009, and that year Burlington tendered the $24,000 payment to the Koopmanns to extend the lease's primary term until October 22, 2012. This tract was pooled with other leases over 600 acres known as \"Lackey Unit A.\" In December 2010, Burlington and the Koopmanns executed an amended lease, which brought the Koopmann children's interests under the Burlington lease along with other amendments. Strieber ratified this amended lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As of August 2011, there still had been no production from the Koopmanns' land and only four months remained on the initial fifteen-year period of Strieber's reserved NPRI. Strieber conveyed to Burlington a 60% interest in her NPRI, presumably as an incentive to motivate Burlington to begin drilling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thereafter, Burlington identified a well site on Lackey Unit A, and on December 7, 2011, Burlington sent a letter to the Koopmanns informing them that a well was anticipated to begin producing oil and gas in the first quarter of 2012. The letter noted that the reservation's savings clause in Strieber's deed required payment of shut-in royalties in order to maintain the NPRI interests, and Burlington included \"shut-in royalty payments,\" explaining that these payments were made \"to ensure that all parties' interest, if any, in the well is maintained.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties do not dispute that there was no well actually producing on December\n   27, 2011, but the parties offered conflicting summary judgment evidence as to whether there was a well\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of producing in paying or commercial quantities as of that date. Actual production was not accomplished on Lackey Unit A until February 2012, about two months after the end of the NPRI's initial fifteen-year term. On February 6, Burlington notified the Koopmanns that because there was a dispute over the royalty interests in Lackey Unit A, Burlington would be \"suspending payments to anyone\" until the matter was resolved. A few days later, the Koopmanns returned the \"shut-in royalty payments\" they had received from Burlington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Koopmanns sought declaratory judgment against Burlington and Strieber to construe the deed, claiming that they were the sole owners of the NPRI as of December 27, 2011. They also asserted non-declaratory claims against Burlington for breach of contract, unjust enrichment (money had and received), conversion, negligence, and negligence per se.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Burlington filed a motion to dismiss the non-declaratory claims under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 91a, asserting that the Koopmanns' claims were barred by section 91.402(b) of the Texas Natural Resources Code, which provides lessees the right to suspend royalty payments when there is a title dispute.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 91a ; TEX. NAT. RES. CODE \u00a7 91.402(b). In the same motion, Burlington argued that the Koopmanns' negligence and negligence per se claims were barred by the common law economic-loss rule. The trial court denied this motion and awarded attorney's fees to the Koopmanns under the loser-pays provision of Rule 91a.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 91a.7 (providing that a court must award the \"prevailing party\" on the motion to dismiss all costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees). Burlington later filed a motion for summary judgment on the same claims asserting similar arguments. The trial court granted summary judgment and ordered that the Koopmanns take nothing as to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As to the declaratory action, the parties filed competing motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the Koopmanns' motion, concluding: (1) on December 27, 2011, there was no well that was actually producing in paying or commercial quantities on Lackey Unit A; (2) accordingly, Burlington's and Strieber's NPRI expired at that time; and (3) the Koopmanns, as sole owners of the royalty interest, were due royalty payments under their lease with Burlington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Both parties appealed. Burlington appealed the declaratory judgment, claiming that Strieber's reservation created a future interest in the Koopmanns that was void under the rule against perpetuities (the Rule) and that Burlington's interest was independently maintained because its activities satisfied the deed's savings clause. Burlington also asserted that the trial court's award of attorney's fees to the Koopmanns under Rule 91a was improper. The Koopmanns appealed the trial court's summary judgment on all of its non-declaratory claims, arguing that section 91.402(b) of the Natural Resources Code does not bar those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court of appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656008\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/643/#p648\">\n    542 S.W.3d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202967689\">\n    2016 WL 2967689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

App.-Austin 1981, no writ), the court concluded that the Rule did not bar the Koopmanns' future interest in the NPRI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 658. The court found that the reservation's savings clause was ambiguous, however, and remanded the case for a jury to determine the proper interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 661. With regard to the non-declaratory claims, the court of appeals upheld the trial court's summary judgment dismissing the Koopmanns' claims for negligence, negligence per se, conversion, unjust enrichment, and money had and received under the economic-loss rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 668. However, it held that section 91.402 of the Natural Resources Code does not bar a claim for breach of contract, and it reversed on that issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 667-68. Finally, although the court of appeals determined that several of the Koopmanns' claims failed as a matter of law, the court of appeals upheld the trial court's award of attorney's fees against Burlington under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 91a.7.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 668.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Burlington asserts four points on appeal to this Court: (1) the court of appeals erred in applying the two-grant theory and holding that the Koopmanns' future interest in the NPRI was not violated; (2) even if the Rule did not bar the Koopmanns' claims, the savings clause is not ambiguous and Burlington's activities maintained its interest in the NPRI after the initial fifteen-year period; (3) the court of appeals erred in reinstating the Koopmanns' breach-of-contract claim; and (4) the court of appeals misapplied Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 91a's loser-pays provision.

When the trial court grants one motion and denies the other, the reviewing court should determine all questions presented and render the judgment that the trial court should have rendered.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190940\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/22/351/#p356\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To grant summary judgment declaring that the Koopmanns own the NPRI, the trial court had to find both that: (1) the Rule did not apply to invalidate the Koopmanns' interest in the NPRI, and (2) the reservation's savings clause did not apply to preserve Strieber's interest in the NPRI. The court of appeals agreed with the trial court's first finding, but it held that the savings clause was ambiguous and reversed and remanded for a jury to determine the proper interpretation. For the reasons stated below, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Strieber's Reservation and the Rule Against Perpetuities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As explained above, Strieber's deed conveyed to the Koopmanns fee-simple title to the tract, and reserved a fifteen-year, one-half NPRI, which could be extended \"as long thereafter as there is production in paying or commercial quantities\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   under an oil and gas lease. In the event there was no production after the fifteen-year term, the reservation included a savings clause. Thus, if on December 27, 2011, there was no production in paying quantities and the savings clause was not satisfied, the NPRI would transfer to the Koopmanns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Burlington asserts that the Koopmanns' future interest in the NPRI violates the Rule and is therefore void. According to Burlington, the \"as long thereafter\" language Strieber used in her reservation created in the Koopmanns a springing executory interest, which is not certain to vest, if at all, within the period required by the Rule: twenty-one years after the death of some life or lives in being at the time of the conveyance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Laddex, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373844\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/476/#p479\">\n    513 S.W.3d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479 (Tex. 2017). Burlington argues that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Peveto v. Starkey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9949623\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/645/770/\">\n    645 S.W.2d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. 1982), in which we held that a royalty conveyance violated the Rule because it was not certain to become effective within the required time period, is controlling in this case. Burlington would have us \"apply the Rule\" by excising the Koopmanns' future interest from the deed and leave \"all remaining interests intact.\" Strieber, who filed a brief in this Court as a respondent, asserts the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Koopmanns characterize their future interest created by Strieber's deed as a \"vested possibility of reverter,\" which vested at its creation for purposes of the Rule, and thus, is valid. There is a decided difference, according to the Koopmanns, between vesting in interest and vesting in possession, and if two constructions are possible, Texas courts favor the construction that saves the validity of an instrument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laddex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373844\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/476/#p479\">\n    513 S.W.3d at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They argue that\n   <em>\n    Peveto\n   </em>\n   is factually distinguishable and actually supports characterizing this interest as a possibility of reverter. Additionally, the Koopmanns argue that the two-grant theory employed by the court of appeals is not necessary for them to win because, here, Strieber \"carved out\" a new fee simple determinable by her reservation, creating a then-vested future interest in the Koopmanns not subject to the Rule. The Koopmanns contend that while the two-grant theory need not apply in this case, it would create a just result by carrying out the parties' intentions. The Koopmanns warn that if we recognize a Rule violation in this case, we would call into question every oil and gas lease that uses similar language, which would be disastrous for the oil and gas industry. Finally, the Koopmanns note that the public policy underlying the Rule-preventing the long-term isolation of property from commerce and development and the creation of bloodline dynasties over property-is not implicated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Texas Constitution prohibits perpetuities: \"Perpetuities ... are contrary to the genius of free government, and shall never be allowed.\" TEX. CONST. art. I \u00a7 26. The constitution does not define \"perpetuities.\" The interpretative commentary states both that \"perpetuity\" as applied to property means an \"everlasting property interest[ ]\" and that \"[f]or purposes of this section, a perpetuity is a restraint or restriction of the power of\n   alienation beyond [the period required by the Rule], and as such would not be constitutionally allowed.\" TEX. CONST. art. I \u00a7 26, interp. commentary (Vernon 2007);\n   <em>\n    see also Perpetuity\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (including among the term's multiple definitions both \"[a]n inalienable interest\" and \"[a]n interest that does not take effect or vest within the period prescribed by law\"). To enforce this prohibition, we have adopted the common law version of the Rule to govern conveyances of real property, which provides that \"no interest is valid unless it must vest, if at all, within twenty-one years after the death of some life or lives in being at the time of the conveyance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Laddex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373844\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/476/#p479\">\n    513 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   479 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TEX.

In their treatise, Simes and Smith note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   It should be pointed out that an executory interest limited on an event certain to happen is likely a much more substantial interest than one which depends upon an uncertain event. Thus ... an executory interest which is certain to vest in enjoyment at the death of a designated person is closely linked with a vested remainder. It may well be, therefore, that they should have the same legal characteristics as their related (but differently named) interests. Rules which are adopted relative to the rather tenuous interests which depend upon uncertain contingencies may be poorly conceived when applied to an interest which bears\n   the same name but is in fact of greater substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   1 THE LAW OF FUTURE INTERESTS \u00a7 223. Powell reaches a similar conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Executory interests can either operate in defeasance of a prior vested fee or can be limited to take effect on a future event uncertain of occurrence. Both types of executory interest violate the common-law rule against perpetuities, when the event on which the executory interest is limited to arise or to shift is not certain to occur within the permissible period. Executory interests limited on an event certain to occur, however, require different consideration. Thus, a grant \"to\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   twenty-five years from date\" involves no contingency except the passage of time. Such an executory interest is not usefully regarded as \"subject to a condition precedent.\" It is, therefore, not subject to the common-law rule against perpetuities. It causes no inconvenient fettering of alienability because of the existence of actuarial techniques for valuing both the preceding and the future interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   10 POWELL ON REAL PROPERTY \u00a7 73.02[3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Koopmanns' interest in the NPRI could be deemed \"vested\" when it was created if that term is taken to mean that the holder of the interest was at all times ascertainable and the preceding estate was certain to terminate.

Because the grantee became a grantor under this fictional construction, the future interest immediately vested in the grantee as a possibility of reverter, thereby avoiding a Rule violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9960035,9959948\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/627/190/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the court of appeals applied the same fiction, concluding that like in\n   <em>\n    Bagby\n   </em>\n   , \"Strieber's reservation of the NPRI creates a future interest in the Koopmanns that does not violate the rule against perpetuities.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656008\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/643/#p648\">\n    542 S.W.3d at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We see several problems with the two-grant theory. First, it ignores the traditional classifications of future interests-primarily, that a possibility of reverter cannot be held by anyone other than the grantor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    El Dorado Land Co., L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094761\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/395/798/#p802\">\n    395 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   802 ;\n   <em>\n    Bradford v.

App.-Texarkana 1978, no writ) ; 3 POWELL ON REAL PROPERTY \u00a7 20.04[1][b]. Second, it is not clear that Strieber intended to reserve rather than except her NPRI interest. The deed uses both words (\"There is EXCEPTED from this conveyance and RESERVED to the Grantor ....\"), as do many modern deed forms. Bruce Kramer,\n   <em>\n    Property and Oil and Gas Don't Mix: The Mangling of Common Law Property Concepts\n   </em>\n   , 33 WASHBURN L.J. 540, 556 (1994). Realistically, it is unlikely Strieber contemplated a distinction between withholding an interest and receiving the same interest from the Koopmanns; it is more likely that she simply intended to convey the tract while retaining her mineral interests by whatever words her lawyers said would be most effective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Earle v.

Finally, the two-grant theory relies on a legal fiction, something that is inherently outcome-oriented to reach a result that would otherwise be barred by the Rule. In holding that Strieber's deed made a reservation rather than an exception, the court of appeals appears to have relied in part on the canon of construction that where the instrument is capable of two constructions, preference is given to the construction that will not violate the Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656008\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/643/#p648\">\n    542 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   657 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bagby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9960035,9959948\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/627/190/\">\n    627 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   194 ).

Our holding does not run afoul of the constitution's prohibition of perpetuities because the future oil and gas interest at issue here does not restrain alienability indefinitely-to the contrary, giving effect to a future interest that is certain to vest in a known grantee actually promotes alienability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cherokee Water Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9945362\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/641/522/#p526\">\n    641 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   526 ; 2 OIL AND GAS LAW \u00a7 335; Burney,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 45.

The Savings Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because we hold in the first part of this opinion that the Rule does not invalidate any part of Strieber's reservation, we must determine who held the interest in the NPRI at the expiration of the fifteen-year period.

The trial court, in finding that Burlington's and Strieber's NPRI expired on December 27, impliedly found that the savings-clause requirements were not satisfied. The court of appeals held that a fact issue existed concerning ownership of the NPRI because the savings-clause language regarding \"other similar payments\" is ambiguous as a matter of law, and it remanded the case to the trial court for a jury to decide its meaning.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656008\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/643/#p648\">\n    542 S.W.3d at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both Burlington and Strieber assert, however, that the $24,000 payment Burlington made to the Koopmanns to extend the primary term of its lease on the tract is \"similar\" to a shut-in royalty and thus meets the third savings-clause requirement. Burlington argues the payment functioned similarly to a shut-in royalty because both would keep alive an existing lease in lieu of actual production. Further, because this was a \"paid-up\" lease, Burlington argues the $24,000 was essentially prepayment of delay rentals for two years and that delay rentals are widely recognized to be a type of payment similar to shut-in royalties. Strieber and the Koopmanns had no way of knowing whether a future lease would provide for rentals on a delayed basis or paid up front, and thus provided a savings clause keyed to payments made by a lessee during that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Koopmanns, on the other hand, argue that the bonus payments cannot be considered \"similar\" to shut-in royalties because the two payments are tied to different parts of an oil and gas lease. Whereas a bonus payment is made to extend the primary term of a paid-up lease, the Koopmanns assert, a shut-in royalty is a payment made as a substitute for actual production. The Koopmanns offer examples of payments \"similar\" to shut-in royalties other than delay rentals or extension payments, arguing that any payment made during the secondary term in lieu of production would satisfy the requirement. Finally, when Burlington made the $24,000 payment, the Koopmanns argue, drilling operations had not even begun, and there was no well in existence necessitating\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As the court of appeals noted, there are both similarities and differences between shut-in royalties, delay rentals, and paid-up leases, depending on the criteria used to compare them.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656008\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/643/#p648\">\n    542 S.W.3d at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The lease requires that the payments be made within sixty days after the end of the month in which production occurred-an earlier payment than required under section 91.402-and requires interest on late payments. The Koopmanns did not assert a claim regarding withheld royalty payments under section 91.404, but they did seek prejudgment interest under section 91.403.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. NAT.

It argues instead that section 91.402\"modified the common law rules that otherwise apply to oil and gas payments under leases, contracts, or deeds.\" The statute covers \"payees\" who are \"legally entitled to payment\" and \"payors\" who \"undertake to distribute oil and gas proceeds\"-both of which arise by virtue of contract-and thus, Burlington argues, the statute was intended to apply when contractual and leasehold rights are at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656008\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/643/#p648\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 91.401 (defining \"payee\" and \"payor\"). Further, by addressing timing of payments, excusing payors from making payments when there is a title dispute, and setting conditions for payment, Burlington asserts that the statute modifies parties' contractual rights and thus removes the Koopmanns' ability to prevail on a common law cause of action when the statute applies. Burlington points out that other parts of the Natural Resources Code explicitly state that those statutes do not override common law causes of action, but section 91.404(c) contains no such provision.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656008\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/643/#p648\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 40.256 (\"The remedies in this chapter are cumulative and not exclusive.\").

Burlington argues that because it made the same arguments against those claims in its motion to dismiss as it did in its later, successful summary judgment motion, the trial court erred in not dismissing the claims earlier. Therefore, Burlington asserts, it was error for the trial court to grant the Koopmanns attorney's fees under Rule 91a because Burlington was the \"prevailing party\" as to those claims. The Koopmanns respond that Burlington's motion to dismiss was filed late as to all but the negligence claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 91a.3 (requiring that a motion to dismiss be filed within sixty days after the first pleading containing the challenged cause of action), and the trial court did not err in its denial because those claims were not \"frivolous.\" Burlington disagrees, asserting that its motion was timely because the Koopmanns' first attempt at alleging these claims was unintelligible. In the alternative, Burlington asserts that the court of appeals should have \"at a minimum ... reverse[d] the fee award against [Burlington] and [ ] remand[ed] the case for an allocation of fees and costs among the prevailing parties\" as to the Koopmanns' negligence claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Rule 91a provides that \"a party may move to dismiss a cause of action on the grounds that it has no basis in law or fact.\" TEX. R. CIV. P. 91a.1. It also requires that, except in actions involving the government, \"the court must award the prevailing party on the motion all costs and reasonable and necessary attorney fees incurred with respect to the challenged cause of action in the trial court.\" TEX. R. CIV. P. 91a.7. Here, the trial court denied Burlington's Rule 91a motion but later rendered summary judgment on the Koopmanns' non-declaratory claims. Apparently, Burlington is not satisfied, because it asks us to hold that the trial court erred in denying its motion to dismiss. We decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   First, Burlington's argument that it is the \"prevailing party\" under Rule 91a because it later won on summary judgment as to these claims is unpersuasive. Rule 91a provides that a party who files a motion to dismiss is due attorney's fees when it prevails \"on the motion\"-not on a later summary judgment motion asserting there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 91a.7; TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a. Further, it is irrelevant that the arguments Burlington made in its motion for summary judgment were the same as those it asserted in its motion to dismiss because a motion to dismiss is decided on the\n   <em>\n    plaintiff's\n   </em>\n   pleadings. TEX. R. CIV. P. 91a.6 (except in determining attorney's fees, \"the court may not consider evidence in ruling on the motion and must decide the motion based solely on the pleading of the cause of action, together with any pleading exhibits permitted by Rule 59\");\n   <em>\n    City of Dall. v. Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784869\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/494/722/#p724\">\n    494 S.W.3d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 724 (Tex. 2016) (per curiam). Finally, if we were to grant Burlington's request and hold that the trial court erred in denying its motion, this would effectively require us to vacate or overrule the trial court's summary judgment of these claims in Burlington's favor. We cannot do so when the court of appeals' affirmance of the summary judgment is final and not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   We note that Burlington could have challenged the trial court's denial of its motion to dismiss at the time it was denied.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Essex Ins.

App.-Beaumont 2014, pet. denied) (reviewing a denial of a motion to dismiss under a permissive interlocutory appeal). It chose not to. We reject Burlington's argument that it is entitled to recover attorney's fees as the prevailing party on the motion under Rule 91a when Burlington received an adverse ruling on that motion, did not challenge the ruling at that time, and later prevailed on its motion for summary judgment, which became final when it was not appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the reasons set out above, we hold that the rule against perpetuities does not invalidate the Koopmanns' future interest in the NPRI created by Strieber's deed. We affirm that part of the court of appeals' judgment but on different grounds. However, we hold that the reservation's savings clause is ambiguous and affirm the court of appeals' remand on this issue. In\n   addition, we hold that section 91.402 of the Natural Resources Code does not preclude a lessor's common law claim for breach of contract, and we affirm this part of the court of appeals' judgment. Finally, we decline to hold that Burlington is the prevailing party as to its motion to dismiss, and thus, we affirm the court of appeals' judgment as to attorney's fees pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 91a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Justice Blacklock did not participate in the decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Burlington is a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips Company, the other petitioner in this case.
