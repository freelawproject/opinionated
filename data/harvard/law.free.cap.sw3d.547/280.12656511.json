We affirm the trial court's sanctions order, but reject as moot the complaint regarding\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Samuel Morales Castillo was killed when an FE Express, LLC truck driven by Francisco Javier Bernal struck a vehicle, which then struck Castillo as he stood next to his vehicle on the side of the road. Castillo's girlfriend, Maria Isabel Serna Contreras, as next friend and guardian of Samara Isabella Morales Serna and Samantha Isabel Morales Serna, Minor Children (collectively \"Contreras\"), filed a wrongful death action against FE Express and Bernal. Contreras was represented by attorney Ronald Rodriguez of the Law Offices of Ronald Rodriguez, P.C., a Laredo firm. This suit was assigned to the 341st District Court, Webb County, Texas. Castillo's wife, Paulina Navarro Hernandez, individually and on behalf of her two minor children (collectively \"Navarro\"), also filed a wrongful death action against FE Express and Bernal. Navarro was represented by the Corpus Christi firm of Liles Harris, PLLC-specifically attorneys Kevin W. Liles, Brian K. Harris, and Stuart R. White (collectively \"Liles\"). The lawsuit filed by Liles on behalf of Navarro was assigned to the 111th District Court, Webb County, Texas. Thereafter, FE Express and Bernal, who were represented by James L. Ray and Kyle D. Giacco (collectively \"R&amp;G\") of Daw &amp; Ray, L.L.P., a Houston law firm, filed a motion to consolidate the two suits. The trial court granted the order, ordering Navarro's suit consolidated into Contreras's suit in the 341st District Court. It is undisputed that attorneys for both Navarro and Contreras sent demands to counsel for FE Express and Bernal, seeking the full limits of FE Express's $1 million per accident insurance policy. In January 2015, FE Express's insurer, who was willing to settle for policy\n   limits, proposed mediation or arbitration to apportion the insurance proceeds between Navarro and Contreras. It does not appear any formal mediation or arbitration proceedings occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 11, 2015, approximately nine months after the motion to consolidate was granted and while the wrongful death suits were still pending in Webb County, Liles, on behalf of Navarro, filed a wrongful death suit in Nueces County asserting the identical factual and legal allegations contained in the Webb County petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Liles served R&amp;G with a copy of the petition, but did not notify counsel for Contreras of the new suit. In the Nueces County petition, Liles asserted venue was proper in Nueces County \"under the general venue rule.\" Three days later, Liles, who represented that a settlement had been reached, asked the Nueces County trial court to appoint a guardian ad litem to protect the interest of the Navarro minor children. The trial court granted the motion and rendered an order appointing an ad litem. Thereafter, Liles served R&amp;G-but not Contreras's attorney-with a notice stating that \"a Friendly Suit Hearing\" had been set for October 1, 2015 in the Nueces County court, indicating a settlement had been reached between Navarro and FE Express and Bernal. Two amended hearing notices were filed September 24, 2015 and September 30, 2015-these too were served on R&amp;G, but not on counsel for Contreras. The final notice set the friendly suit hearing for on October 12, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 6, 2015, several events took place. First, R&amp;G, as stated in their appellate brief, \"agreed to waive service\" and filed an answer on behalf of their clients, FE Express and Bernal, to Navarro's Nueces County suit. The answer was a Rule 92 general denial; R&amp;G did not contest Liles's venue allegation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 92. Second, approximately two hours after R&amp;G filed the answer in the Nueces County suit, Liles filed a notice of nonsuit in Webb County, dismissing Navarro's claims against FE Express and Bernal without prejudice. There was no mention of the settlement or the friendly suit setting in the notice of nonsuit. Finally, R&amp;G served Navarro and Contreras with FE Express and Bernal's \"First Amended Responses to All Plaintiffs' Request for Disclosure.\" In the amended response, FE Express and Bernal amended twelve responses-(a) through (l)-to the requests for disclosure. Included in the amendment, was the response to request (h), which sought disclosure of \"[a]ny settlement agreements described in Rule 192.3(g).\" FE Express and Bernal amended their original responses to advise they had reached a settlement agreement with Navarro in the amount of $700,000.00. The response noted the settlement had not been finalized and the settlement documents were being prepared for court approval. Accordingly, no actual settlement agreement was produced. The responses did not include any information about the Nueces County suit or the hearing set for October 12, 2015. The amended responses were served the day before the scheduled deposition of Paulina Navarro Hernandez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The next day, October 7, 2015, Contreras took Navarro's deposition. There was no mention during the deposition of the settlement or the hearing pending in Nueces County. Contreras's attorney stated at the sanctions hearing that he received the amended responses to the request for disclosure regarding the settlement \"late in\n   the day\" on October 6th as he was preparing for the deposition. As to the settlement, he \"figured we would come back to\n   <em>\n    this Court\n   </em>\n   later and deal with that.\" (emphasis added)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The hearing on the Nueces County friendly suit was held on October 12, 2015, as set out in the final amended notice of hearing. At the hearing, there was no specific mention of the Webb County suit-or the fact that there were additional minors involved. The only hint of additional claimants arose when R&amp;G asked Navarro if she understood there were \"other claimants against our clients that are also seeking part of the proceeds of the insurance policy.\" Navarro replied that she was aware there were other claimants, but did not mention the other minors. When questioned by her own attorney, Navarro admitted a settlement agreement and release existed and she had met with Liles the night before the friendly suit hearing \"and discussed and read the entire agreement.\" Thus, the record establishes the written settlement agreement existed as of October 11, 2015. However, no copy of the agreement was produced to Contreras until February 1, 2016, when her attorney specifically requested it. On the same date the hearing was held, the Nueces County trial court approved the settlement and signed an \"Agreed Final Judgment\" between Navarro and defendants FE Express and Bernal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Contreras received a copy of the actual settlement agreement, her attorney filed a motion for sanctions on her behalf. In the motion, Contreras alleged the Webb County trial court should impose sanctions: (1) under Chapter 10 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code because Liles filed the October 6, 2015 notice of nonsuit for an improper purpose; (2) under Rule 215.3 because Liles and R&amp;G abused the discovery process by failing to timely produce a copy of the actual settlement agreement; and (3) under its inherent power to impose sanctions because Liles and R&amp;G engaged in abusive conduct that affected the court's core functions and attacked the integrity of the judicial system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a consequence for this sanctionable conduct, Contreras requested the trial court to order the following relief: (1) order the settling parties and their attorneys deposit the $700,000.00 settlement funds into the court registry; (2) strike Navarro's pleadings and render judgment that she and her children take nothing; (3) order Navarro's three attorneys to each pay Contreras $250,000.00; (4) strike FE Express and Bernal's answer and render a default judgment in the amount of $10 million in favor of Contreras; and (5) order the attorneys for FE Express and Bernal to each pay Contreras $250,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to the motion for sanctions filed on behalf of Contreras, Liles filed a motion for sanctions on behalf of his client. In this counter motion for sanctions, Navarro alleged the motion for sanctions filed by Contreras violated Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which precludes the filing of pleadings that are groundless and brought in bad faith or groundless and brought to harass, and Chapter Ten of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which precludes the filing of any pleading that is presented for an improper purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 10.001(1), 10.004(a) (West 2017); TEX. R. CIV. P. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on the motions for sanctions. The hearing took\n   place on different days over the course of several months. Prior to making a determination, the trial court ordered Liles and R&amp;G to submit certain documents for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. The trial court reviewed the documents, but denied Contreras's request for access to them. Ultimately, the trial court granted Contreras's motion for sanctions, finding that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Liles filed a notice of nonsuit for an improper purpose in violation of Chapter 10;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 R&amp;G abused the discovery process by failing to respond fully to Contreras's request for disclosure by not producing the settlement agreement as required by the discovery rules; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Liles and R&amp;G conspired to intentionally and unethically avoid and interfere with the court's jurisdiction, sabotaged Contreras's ability to object to the settlement agreement, and undermined the trial court's duty to protect the Contreras minors' best interests, resulting in a direct attack on the judiciary and legal system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, the trial court did not adopt the relief requested by Contreras. Rather, the trial court ordered Navarro's attorneys to pay, jointly and severally:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 a monetary penalty of $50,000.00 into the court registry;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 all court costs incurred in representing the Navarro plaintiffs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 one-half of all court costs related to the motion for sanctions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 attorney's fees and expenses to the Contreras's attorney in the amount of $37,744.00 with post-judgment interest; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 $10,000.00 into the court registry if an appeal is filed to be held as attorneys' fees and expenses in the event of an unsuccessful appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court also ordered the Navarro attorneys to complete three hours of legal ethics education within six months of the order. As for R&amp;G, the trial court ordered them to pay, jointly and severally:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 a monetary penalty of $25,000.00 into the court registry;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 one-half of all court costs related to the motion for sanctions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 attorney's fees and expenses to the Contreras's attorney in the amount of $12,180.00 with post-judgment interest; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 $10,000.00 into the court registry if an appeal is filed to be held as attorneys' fees and expenses in the event of an unsuccessful appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial court also ordered R&amp;G to complete three hours of ethics education within six months of the order. The trial court denied Navarro's counter motion for sanctions. After the trial court signed an order of severance, all parties, including Contreras, filed notices of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On appeal, Liles and R&amp;G challenge the imposition of sanctions. Contreras challenges the trial court's refusal to allow her to inspect the documents that were submitted to the trial court by Liles and R&amp;G for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sanctions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On appeal, Liles and R&amp;G, who filed separate briefs, contend the trial court erred in imposing sanctions against them. Liles also contends the trial court erred in denying Navarro's motion for sanctions against Contreras's attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Appellate courts review a trial court's imposition of sanctions under an\n   abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    Nath v.

A sanctions award is an abuse of discretion if it does not comply with due process because a trial court has no discretion in determining what the law is or applying it to the facts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9249937\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/134/835/#p838\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, we cannot say a trial court abused its discretion simply because it decided a matter differently than we might have in a similar circumstance.\n   <em>\n    Samlowski v.

Some sort of settlement agreement, given the timeline, was presumably reached before Liles filed the second wrongful death action on behalf of Navarro in Nueces County on September 11, 2015-there would have been no reason for Liles to file the second wrongful death action in Nueces County in the absence of a settlement. But it was not until October 6, 2015, that R&amp;G served Navarro and Contreras with FE Express and Bernal's \"First Amended Responses to All Plaintiffs' Request for Disclosure.\" In the amendment, R&amp;G disclosed FE Express and Bernal had reached a settlement agreement with Navarro in the amount of $700,000.00.

In addition, with regard to venue, Liles alleged venue was proper \"under the general venue rule.\" This was a misstatement of law because the accident did not occur in Nueces County, none of the parties resided in Nueces County, and FE Express did not have its principal office in Nueces County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.002(a) (West 2017). The only connection to Nueces County was the fact that Navarro's attorneys had their principal office in that county. Soon after filing the suit in Nueces County, Liles sought appointment of a guardian ad litem for the protection of Navarro minors. Again, without notice to Contreras's counsel or the Webb County court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In response to the Nueces County petition, R&amp;G agreed to waive service on behalf of its clients. Moreover, R&amp;G, despite knowing venue was not proper in Nueces County, declined to challenge Liles's misstatement regarding venue by not filing a motion to transfer venue and allowing the case to continue in Nueces County. The trial court could have found this to be evidence of collusive conduct by Liles and R&amp;G to keep Contreras and the Webb County trial court in the dark regarding the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Although R&amp;G supplemented its responses to Contreras's requests for disclosure six days prior to the final hearing in Nueces County, advising Contreras's counsel of a settlement, the language in the response appears carefully contrived to avoid disclosure of the action pending in Nueces County. In the response, R&amp;G stated the settlement documents were being prepared \"and subject to approval by a Court\"-not \"a court in Nueces County\" or the \"Nueces County Court at Law No. 1\"-again, leaving Contreras in the dark and without information that might have been used to advise the Webb County trial court about the happenings in Nueces County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Liles and R&amp;G continued the process, which culminated in an October 12, 2015 hearing after which the Nueces County\n   trial court approved the settlement and rendered an agreed judgment. There is nothing in the record to indicate the Nueces County judge knew anything more than there were \"other claimants\" to the insurance proceeds. Liles and R&amp;G did not see fit to advise the Nueces County judge that those \"other claimants\" included two other minor children in a pending suit in Webb County. Notably, Liles waited until six days prior to the Nueces County hearing to nonsuit Navarro's Webb County suit. Liles had permitted the Webb County suit to remain pending until October 6, 2015, despite having filed the suit in Nueces County suit on September 11, 2015. Thus, identical suits were pending on behalf of Navarro in two counties for almost thirty days without notice to either court or Contreras. If Liles and R&amp;G believed their conduct in filing and participating in the Nueces County suit was completely above board and nothing more than effective lawyering, why the secrecy? Why, as the Webb Count trial court determined, procure the settlement in \"darkness\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   At the sanctions hearing, Liles admitted the attorneys pursued the action in Nueces County to avoid Rodriguez-counsel for Contreras-and any effort he might make to disrupt the settlement. They point out Contreras had no authority or right to stop or interfere with the settlement even if the settlement had exhausted the insurance proceeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tex.

We do not disagree with this general proposition. But the attorneys' avoidance of Contreras's counsel suggests something more, particularly given the involvement of competing minors, and supports the trial court's decision to impose sanctions under its inherent authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   It is undisputed that two sets of minors were competing over limited insurance funds-this was known by all parties. When minors bring suit, trial courts have the responsibility to protect their best interests.\n   <em>\n    Urbish v. The Honorable 127th Judicial Dist. Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9971781\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/708/429/#p432\">\n    708 S.W.2d 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432 (Tex. 1986). Here, when Navarro and Contreras filed suit, the Webb County trial court became responsible for the best interests of all four minor children. The attorneys' decision to file suit in Nueces County to avoid Contreras's counsel suggests a belief by the attorneys that not only would her counsel lodge objections to any settlement that awarded the Navarro minors more than half of the available settlement funds, but those objections might have found favor with the Webb County trial court given its duty to protect all of the minors under its jurisdiction, thereby impairing any settlement between Liles's clients and R&amp;G's clients. Thus, we hold the Webb County trial court could have concluded, in its discretion, complicity by the attorneys to keep the court in the dark regarding their settlement actions, thereby unilaterally divesting the trial court of its jurisdiction over and ability to protect all the minors under its authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Moreover, as the trial court recognized, attorneys have a duty of candor toward the tribunal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

Given the evidence and the context in which the attorneys' conduct took place, we hold the trial court could have determined otherwise. Although there may have been no affirmative misrepresentations to the Webb County trial court, silence may constitute a misrepresentation when there is a duty to speak and a person remains silent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bradford v.

The attorneys had a duty of candor toward the tribunal, and they admittedly took every action necessary to avoid the possibility that the Webb County trial court might learn of their actions in Nueces County, including failing to advise the Nueces County judge of the pending action in Webb County and the involvement of additional minors. Although, as R&amp;G points out, the affirmative actions taken in Nueces County-to secure the settlement so as to avoid discovery of the events by counsel for Contreras or the Webb County trial court-were executed by Liles, R&amp;G's actions reflect complicity with Liles. Liles would not have been able to succeed without R&amp;G's involvement and agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The attorneys also argue the Webb County trial court was without authority to sanction based on conduct that occurred in Nueces County. Under the facts of this case we disagree. The cases relied upon by the attorneys for this position are distinguishable.

However, we hold we need not address whether the sanctions imposed were excessive because that issue either has not been presented, or has not been presented in such a way as to require appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   With regard to Liles, Liles has not challenged the amount of sanctions imposed.

After reviewing Liles's appellate brief we hold Liles has presented nothing for our review with regard to the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    TransAmerican\n   </em>\n   test, i.e., the amount of the sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Although R&amp;G raises the issue of excessiveness, it does so in a very specific way. R&amp;G's entire argument on excessiveness is based on the premise that it was sanctioned $37,180.00, plus $10,000.00 in contingent appellate attorney's fees, for the discovery violation. However, the record does not support this premise. As discussed above, the trial court imposed sanctions on R&amp;G not only for a discovery violation pursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, but under its inherent authority for R&amp;G's collusive conduct with Liles. The trial court made this clear in its order and on the record. In the order, as set out above, the trial court specifically notes the Chapter 10 violation by Liles, the discovery violation by R&amp;G, and the collusive conduct by both sets of attorneys with regard to procurement of the settlement agreement in Nueces County. At the conclusion of the sanctions hearing, on the record, the trial court sets out the collusive conduct and then specifically states that in order to deter such conduct it would impose a monetary sanction of $25,000.00 against R&amp;G-and $50,000.00 against Liles. This is exactly what the trial court did in its sanctions order. Thus, R&amp;G was not sanctioned $37,180.00 for a single discovery violation. However, R&amp;G fails to parse its excessiveness argument based on the sanctions actually imposed for separate conduct. Rather, R&amp;G simply lumps the monetary sanctions together, arguing all of the amounts were imposed for a single discovery violation, which is inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As this is R&amp;G's only argument regarding excessiveness, and it is based on an erroneous premise, we conclude R&amp;G has not presented an apposite argument for our review. As noted above, it is not this court's responsibility to construct an argument for an appellant and engage in research to support the argument as it would render us advocates as opposed to unbiased adjudicators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ihnfeldt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207010922\">\n    2016 WL 7010922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.

Liles contends there was nothing in the motion \"that was even arguably meritorious,\" but it was still required to respond to the motion. Thus, Liles contends the trial court erred in denying its motion for sanctions against Rodriguez. Having determined the trial court did not err in sanctioning Liles and R&amp;G for the acts and omissions set out in the Contreras sanctions motion, it would be counter intuitive to hold the trial court erred in denying Liles's counter motion for sanctions. Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in denying Liles's motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Pending Motion &amp; Temporary Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   At the time this appeal was submitted, there was a pending motion for access to the record. In addition, this court had rendered an order granting a temporary stay. We will now deal with these matters in light of our disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In February 2017, Contreras filed in this court a \"Motion for Access to the Appellate Record.\" In the motion, Contreras advised that part of the appellate record consists of documents submitted to the trial court\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and then sealed. Contreras asserted she needs access to the documents to properly prepare for appeal. This court ordered the motion carried with the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   When Contreras filed her brief, she renewed her request for access to the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   documents, arguing a lack of access to the documents prevented her from briefing that evidence in detail. However, we hold that access to the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   documents was not necessary for full briefing of this matter. As is clear from our holding, Contreras was able to rely on and point to sufficient evidence in the unsealed portion of the appellate record to permit this court to render a decision affirming the sanctions order. Accordingly, any complaint about access to the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   documents is now moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heckman v.

We therefore deny as moot the motion for access to the portion of the appellate record filed in this court under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In addition to the foregoing motion filed by Contreras, Liles also filed a motion in this court prior to full briefing, asking for a stay. Liles filed its notice of appeal in this court on October 3, 2016. Concomitant with that filing, Liles filed a \"Conditional Emergency Motion to Stay Enforcement.\" Therein, Liles asked this court to stay the portions of the trial court's order that required Liles: (1) to deposit monetary sanctions and contingent appellate attorneys' fees into the registry of the court within ten days of the trial court's September 23, 2016 sanctions order; and (2) to pay the court-ordered costs and attorney's fees within three days of the trial court's sanction order. On October 3, 2016, after reviewing the motion, we rendered an order granting Liles's motion. We ordered the portion of the trial court's sanctions order that required Liles to deposit monies and pay fees stayed pending further order of this court. Having determined the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing\n   the sanctions, we now order our temporary stay lifted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Contreras Cross Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Contreras filed a notice of appeal to contest the trial court's refusal to permit her to review the documents Liles and R&amp;G submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection by the trial court. The trial court wished to review the documents prior to rendering a decision on Contreras's motion for sanctions. After reviewing the documents, and as set out in detail above, the trial court granted Contreras's motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   On appeal, Contreras contends she has been \"unfairly denied access to a portion of the record supporting her argument to affirm [the] sanctions award.\" She argues she is \"entitled to review and rely on the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   documents in support of her [appellate] arguments\" and that this court \"should reverse the trial court's refusal to provide Contreras access to the documents.\" The argument presented in this cross appeal is essentially the same as that urged by Contreras in her motion for access to the record-Contreras needs access to the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   documents reviewed by the trial court to properly present her appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As set out in our discussion above, given our affirmance of the sanctions order, the unsealed portion of the record was sufficient to permit Contreras to argue, and this court to hold, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing sanctions on Liles and R&amp;G. Thus, we hold any complaint about access to the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   documents is now moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heckman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314284\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/369/137/#p162\">\n    369 S.W.3d at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Granting Contreras access to the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   documents cannot affect her rights given our decision affirming the sanctions order. Alternatively, if the cross appeal is not moot, and the trial court's refusal to grant Contreras access to the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   documents was error, we hold the error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

The portion of the record to which Contreras had access was sufficient for her to properly present her case to this court, and for this court to find in her favor, precluding a finding of harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314284\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/369/137/#p162\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, we overrule the complaints presented by Liles and R&amp;G with regard to the trial court's imposition of sanctions and hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions as set out in its September 23, 2016 order. We further hold that Liles failed to raise an issue challenging the amount of fees imposed, and the issue raised by R&amp;G with regard to the amount of fees was based on a faulty premise, so neither issue is properly presented for our review. As to the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   documents, we deny as moot Contreras's motion for access to the sealed portion of the record. On the same basis, we hold the cross appeal is also moot, or any error by the trial court is harmless. Finally, we order the temporary stay imposed on October 3, 2016 lifted. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's order of sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    There was nothing in the Nueces County petition to indicate that the suit was merely a \"friendly suit,\" nor was there any mention of the wrongful death action still pending in the 341st District Court in Webb County.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    In the motion, Navarro sought sanctions against Contreras and FE Express and Bernal, as well as their attorneys.
