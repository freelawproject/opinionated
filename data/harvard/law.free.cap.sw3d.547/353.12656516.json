In addition to the Presiding Bishop's policy and leadership tasks, he or she also presides over meetings of TEC's House of Bishops and performs ecclesiastical tasks, including, \"[i]n the event of an Episcopal vacancy\" in a diocese, consulting with that diocese's \"Ecclesiastical Authority to ensure that adequate interim Episcopal Services are provided.\" The Presiding Bishop \"shall perform such other functions as shall be prescribed in\" TEC's canons and may delegate some duties and responsibilities to officers in the General Convention's Executive Council, which is responsible for carrying out the General Convention's programs and policies and exercises \"powers conferred upon it by Canon, and such further powers as may be designated by the General Convention.\" The Presiding Bishop is the chair and president of the Executive Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The bishop in each diocese is chosen by the rules prescribed by the convention of that diocese but cannot be ordained and consecrated without the consent of a majority of the standing committees of all of the dioceses and without the consent of a majority of TEC's bishops.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   If one of TEC's bishops abandons communion with TEC by open renunciation, formal admission into any religious body not in communion with TEC, or other activities, subject to the procedures set out in TEC's canons and the consent of the majority of TEC's bishops, the Presiding Bishop may depose that bishop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The convention of each diocese must appoint a standing committee, which acts as the council of advice for the diocese's bishop or substitutes as the diocese's ecclesiastical authority if there is no bishop\n   canonically authorized to act.

In 1874, a missionary bishop of Northern Texas was elected and consecrated and the Diocese of Texas was delimited to set apart the area to the north and west as the Missionary District of Northern Texas. Four years later, the 1878 Journal of the Fourth Annual Convocation of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Missionary District of Northern Texas set out the form for a constitution of a parish acceding to the TEC and diocesan constitutions and canons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   This Parish, as a constituent part of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Missionary District of Northern Texas, expressly accedes to, recognizes and adopts the Constitution, Canons, Doctrines, Discipline and Worship of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, and the Constitution and Canons of the Protestant Episcopal Church in this jurisdiction, and acknowledges their authority accordingly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 1893, TEC's constitution provided that no churches or chapels would be consecrated until the bishop sufficiently certified that the property was \"secured, by the terms of the devise, or deed, or subscription by which they are given, from the danger of alienation, either in whole or in part, from those who profess and practise the doctrine, discipline, and worship of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Two years later, the Diocese of Dallas held its first diocesan convention. The preamble to its originating December 1895 constitution states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   We, the Clergy and Laity, of the Protestant Episcopal Church, in the United States of America, resident in that portion of the State of Texas which, by the General Convention of said Church, was in the year A.D. 1874 set off as the Missionary District of Northern Texas, having been convened by the Missionary Bishop of Northern Texas, for the purpose of organizing a Diocese whose territorial limits shall be co-extensive with those of said Missionary District, do now, by and with the consent of said Bishop and in order to effect the organization\n   of said Diocese, ordain and establish this Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Over half a century later, at its 53rd annual convention held in 1948, the Diocese of Dallas amended its constitution's article 13, \"On Title to Church Property.\" That article provided that title to all real property acquired \"for the use of the Church in this Diocese,\" including the real property of all parishes and missions, \"shall be vested in the Bishop and his successors in office, in trust.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   More than three decades after that, in June 1982, the Diocese of Dallas held a special convention to consider a resolution to divide itself and, if approved, to request that TEC's General Convention ratify the division.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The resolution passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   TEC held its General Convention that same year, from September 5 to 15, 1982. On the fourth day, the motion to adopt Resolution B-18, providing for the division of the Diocese of Dallas, carried in the House of Bishops. On the seventh day, the House of Deputies concurred, ratifying the division to create EDFW (known at that time only as the \"Western Diocese\") based on, among other things, the certificate of the Diocese of Dallas's Chancellor that all of the requisite documents had been executed and \"that all of the appropriate and pertinent provisions of the Constitution and Canons of the General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the USA and the Constitution and Canons of the Diocese of Dallas have been fully complied with in respect of this submission.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The October 1982 Annual Meeting Journal of the Diocese of Dallas reflected that seventy-two years after the division issue was first raised in 1910, the Diocese of Dallas was finally sharing \"in the trauma and excitement of such a division,\" resulting, at least in part, from the area's significant population growth over time and the size of the diocese (larger than 43 other dioceses, including some dioceses that covered entire states).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bishop Davies observed that the General Convention had ratified the action of the diocesan convention when it voted to divide the Diocese of Dallas, that the new diocese planned to come into existence as of January 1, 1983, with the filing of its documents with the Secretary of TEC's General Convention, and that the new diocese would hold its primary convention on November 13, 1982, to name itself, organize committees and officers, accede to the national constitution\n   and charters, adopt its own constitution and charters, and implement a budget.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   One of the resolutions promulgated at the Diocese of Dallas's October 1982 Annual Meeting declared that \"[t]itle to all real property ... located within the territorial boundaries of the western diocese shall be transferred to the western diocese.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the meeting, the Diocese of Dallas's Chancellor was granted permission to initiate and conduct for the diocese \"such action in the courts of the State of Texas as may be necessary and prudent for the accomplishment of the goals and purposes of the foregoing resolution, including partition actions, cy-pres actions, and other actions under the laws of Texas or the United States.\" Additionally, the resolution provided that the division of all corporations, foundations, and funds \"shall be made subject to the terms, conditions[,] and purposes of the instruments establishing them and any amendments thereto.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   EDFW adopted its constitution and canons on November 13, 1982.

On December 16, 2008, at a special meeting of the standing committee, the Corporation's board, and the chairman of the constitution and canons committee, the first item of discussion addressed parishes and individuals who wanted to stay with TEC. Of particular concern was the perception that the \"Steering Committee of North Texas Episcopalians\" and the \" 'Remain Episcopal' folks\" were using the official Diocesan shield \"in lots of their publicity-in newspaper ads and on the web, etc.-identifying themselves boldly as 'the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth in the Episcopal Church U.S.A,' \" which the meeting's attendees said was confusing and misleading. Those attending unanimously agreed to send a \"cease and desist\" letter regarding use of EDFW's official seal and shield in publicity. They then discussed the \"very conflicted situation which now exists at All Saints' Church, Fort Worth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    5. 2009\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Presiding Bishop Schori issued a \"Notice of Special Meeting of the Convention of the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth, Saturday, February 7, 2009.\" In that notice, she stated that as there was no bishop nor any qualified members of the standing committee in the diocese, she had called the meeting \"in consultation with the Steering Committee of faithful Episcopalians of that Diocese,\" to elect a provisional bishop and to elect or appoint members of the standing committee, executive council, and other officers, to adopt a budget, and to consider resolutions relating to \"recent purported amendments to the Constitution and canons of the Diocese,\" as well as other resolutions relating to the TEC-affiliated diocese's organization and governance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The emergency convention convened at Trinity Episcopal Church under Presiding Bishop Schori. After quorums were verified and the \"parliamentary necessities were accomplished,\" the first order of business was to elect a provisional bishop. Edwin F. Gulick Jr., who was elected to the post, thereafter made appointments to various commissions and committees for the vacancies resulting from the schism. Bishop Gulick also appointed trustees for the Corporation, on the basis that the previous trustees' effective resignation occurred when they left TEC by the \"irregular, illegal action of the convention in 2008.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In his deposition, Bishop Gulick acknowledged that the Corporation's board members were supposed to be elected one per year and, between sessions, replacements would be voted on by the board. And despite his inability to point to specific language authorizing EDFW to remove all of the trustees, he nevertheless explained that \"in the unforeseen, unanticipated\n   emergency moment,\" everything possible had been done to comply with EDFW's and TEC's constitutions and canons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   On April 14, 2009, the TEC parties adopted amended and restated articles of incorporation for the Corporation and filed them with the Texas Secretary of State. These amended and restated articles purported to return to the Corporation's original articles of incorporation (i.e., administration in accordance \"with the Constitution and Canons of the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth and the Episcopal Church of the United States\"), and listed Bishop Gulick, James Hazel, John Stanley, Robert Bass, Cherie Shipp, and Trace Worrell as the current members of the board of trustees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   At the 27th Annual Meeting of the Diocesan Convention on November 14, 2009, the TEC-affiliated EDFW ratified the actions of the February 7, 2009 special meeting, and after Bishop Gulick's resignation, C. Wallis Ohl was elected and installed as the TEC-affiliated EDFW's bishop. The same individuals who were put into place at the February 7, 2009 special meeting were elected to the TEC-affiliated diocese's standing committee and the Corporation's board of trustees. The convention also ratified the resolutions made and actions taken at the February 7, 2009 special meeting and brought EDFW's constitution and canons back into compliance with TEC's constitution and canons. Bishop Ohl testified that the faction headed by Bishop Iker was not the \"Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth,\" that he-not Bishop Iker-was the legitimate and properly elected EDFW Bishop, and that he, Hazel, Shipp, Worrell, Bass, and Stanley-and not Bishop Iker, Salazar, Patton, Virden, Barber, and Bates-were the Corporation's legitimate and properly elected trustees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Episcopal Diocese\n   </em>\n   , 422 S.W.3d at 647-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

TEC argued that \"[t]he secular act of incorporation does not alter the relationship between a hierarchical church and one of its subordinate units\" and that finding otherwise \"would risk First Amendment implications.\" The Diocese, on the other hand, argued that the case was governed by the Texas Non-Profit Corporation Act and the Texas Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act; under those statutes a corporation may amend its articles of incorporation and bylaws; and TEC had no power to limit or disregard amendments to the Corporation's articles and bylaws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    Episcopal Diocese\n   </em>\n   , 422 S.W.3d at 650 (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   After the trial court granted summary judgment and issued a declaratory judgment for the TEC parties in 2011, stating that the changes made by Appellees to the Corporation's articles and bylaws were ultra vires and void,\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellees appealed directly to the supreme court.

Additionally, the TEC parties had pleaded for the imposition of a constructive trust under a number of theories, including estoppel.

They also argued, as they do on appeal, that the Dennis Canon, in addition to Appellees' words and actions prior to the schism, imposed a trust-express, contractual, or constructive-in their favor. And they argued that Appellees' adverse possession claim failed because there was no \"adverse\" interest until the 2008 schism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The TEC Parties' Motion and Appellees' Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In their summary judgment motion, the TEC parties contended:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u2022 that because TEC had determined that Appellees\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   represent EDFW and its congregations and that the TEC parties\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   represent them, the property held in trust by the Corporation was held in trust for the TEC parties;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u2022 that Appellees had no right to control the Corporation because, in addition to the plain terms of the Corporation's bylaws, it was a subordinate entity of EDFW that only the TEC parties could control;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u2022 that state associations law favored the TEC parties because local chapters are treated as constituents of larger organizations;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u2022 that an express trust was created when EDFW agreed to TEC's rules in exchange for formation, membership, and property, including the Dennis Canon, but that even without an express trust, the TEC parties were entitled to a constructive trust;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u2022 that Appellees' adverse possession claim failed because they did not meet all of the necessary elements to establish that claim;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u2022 that Appellees were estopped from raising claims and defenses that contradicted their commitments, conduct, and prior statements to courts and other federal and state authorities;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u2022 that, contrary to Appellees' assertion, the TEC parties did have standing; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u2022 that based on all of the above, the trial court should grant summary judgment on the TEC parties' trespass-to-try-title claim and their request for attorney's fees and for declaratory judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Appellees responded that the supreme court had rejected the TEC parties' deference theory in favor of neutral principles, that there was no express or irrevocable trust in TEC's favor nor a contractual or constructive trust, that there was no breach of fiduciary duty, and that the TEC parties' remaining grounds were baseless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Supplemental Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   On March 2, 2015, the trial court, except as to claims involving All Saints Episcopal Church, granted Appellees' motion and denied the TEC parties' motion. The parties filed supplemental summary judgment motions to address the All Saints issues\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   and agreed that the remaining claims in cause number 141-252083-11-the claims for attorney's fees, conversion, violations of business and commerce code section 16.29, damages for breach of fiduciary duty (as opposed to the predicate for a constructive trust), the action to quiet title, and for an accounting-should be severed and stayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In their summary judgment motion relating to All Saints Episcopal Church,\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellees argued that the Corporation held legal title to two of the All Saints properties-the sanctuary and parish hall on 5001 Crestline and the rectory on 5003 Dexter-by virtue of the 1984 judgment's property transfer and that beneficial title was held by the group affiliated with them. Ergo, applying the same reasoning as the trial court's previous summary judgment, Appellees were entitled to summary judgment as to those two properties. Appellees waived their claims to the remaining four All Saints properties \"so as to resolve this case without a trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The TEC parties, in their All Saints summary judgment motion, asked the trial court to construe the deeds, to declare the TEC parties the properties' equitable owners, and to remove Appellees as the trustees or owners of legal title.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court disposed of the All Saints summary judgment motions in its final summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Trial Court's Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   On July 24, 2015, the trial court signed a final judgment in this case, consolidating its prior orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In the judgment, the trial court granted Appellees' motion as to All Saints on the two pieces of property under dispute and denied the TEC parties' opposing motion. The trial court recited in its judgment that the claims for attorney's fees in both the original and severed action, the claims in\n   the severed action for conversion, damages for breach of fiduciary duty, to quiet title and for an accounting, and the claims under business and commerce code section 16.29 remained pending in the original action, cause number 141-237105-09, and ordered that those remaining claims, \"to the extent they are also pending in this cause,\" were dismissed without prejudice and preserved for litigation in cause number 141-237105-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The trial court made the following declarations in its judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   1.

The third report recommended that EDFW affiliate with the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone as a member diocese \"until such time as an orthodox Province of the Anglican Communion can be established in North America.\" Bishop Iker likewise issued a statement entitled, \"10 Reasons Why Now Is the Time to Realign,\" which included observing that \"[a]t this time there is nothing in the Constitution or Canons of TEC that prevents a Diocese from leaving ...

That is, the TEC parties view Appellees' claimed disaffiliation as void under the larger association's rules and the General Convention's determination that the alleged disaffiliation was a nullity. They also argue that the All Saints properties are held in trust for TEC and for the All Saints Church affiliated with TEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   Appellees respond that this is not an ecclesiastical dispute and claim that \"[s]ince a dispute about the officers of a Texas corporation is not ecclesiastical, then a dispute about the officers of a Texas unincorporated association isn't either.\" They also argue that the highest authority on property issues-within or outside of TEC-is the local bishop, not TEC's administrative officers, reciting terminology from TEC's Canons, Title IV, \"Ecclesiastical Discipline,\" which defines \"ecclesiastical authority\" as the diocese's bishop or standing committee \"or such other ecclesiastical authority established by the Constitution and Canons of the Diocese.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   Appellees further argue that \"[t]he founders of TEC had made similar solemn engagements to the Church of England-but they certainly didn't forfeit church property in America when those churches separated.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n   And they argue, \"[N]one of the property documents incorporate religious tests, and neither side has asked the courts to decide who can lead worship or attend church conventions,\" nor have the courts been asked \"to decide who can lead any religious body, or whether dioceses can withdraw from TEC.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    98\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   Appellees point out that Texas law dictates how the association's and corporation's officers can be elected or replaced, and Texas law governs the Corporation's and EDFW's amendments to drop any reference to TEC. Appellees rely on the Corporation's holding legal title and their defendant-congregations holding beneficial title based on their union with the diocesan convention. They argue: (1) EDFW's constitution and canons define missions and parishes as unincorporated associations in union with the diocesan convention; those not \"in union\" are not entities for which the Corporation holds property and those \"in union\" are those who send delegates to the convention's annual meeting; (2) Texas law makes EDFW's constitution and bylaws controlling, and the annual convention elected Bishop Iker and opted to disaffiliate; and (3) TEC's \"newly formed\" diocese did not inherit the property of the existing diocese simply by adopting the same name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    99\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   The TEC parties reply that Appellees' own theory concedes that the neutral principles analysis establishes legally-enforceable trusts for EDFW and its congregations, which leads to the ecclesiastical question of who may control these religious entities and puts the case squarely within the exception\n   <em>\n    Masterson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Episcopal Diocese\n   </em>\n   detailed (i.e., ecclesiastical structure determines property dispute). They further argue that the All Saints properties are in trust for the TEC-affiliated All Saints based on All Saints's governing documents, particularly the All Saints 2001 bylaws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   <strong>\n    (B) Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   We must initially determine whether this is an associations-law question or an identity question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n   To do so, we must look at the substance and effect of the TEC parties' live pleading. In their live pleading, the TEC parties intermingled a number of claims seeking legal and equitable relief with others seeking relief based on doctrine and internal procedures. Some of their claims, particularly as beneficiaries of trusts-as set out above-are claims that we may legitimately consider in our neutral-principles review. Based on the above, we have determined that there is a question about who is the \"Protestant Episcopal Church, within the territorial limits of what is now known as the said Diocese of Dallas, in the State of Texas,\" referred to in the 1947 deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   With that in mind, we note that our supreme court has already identified TEC as a hierarchical organization and has stated that whether TEC's appointed bishop can take such actions as forming a parish, recognizing membership, and authorizing the establishment of a vestry \"are ecclesiastical matters of church governance\" over which the court lacks jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Masterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7327975\" index=\"472\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/422/594/#p596\">\n    422 S.W.3d at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To the limited extent that we can consider these organizations' internal actions, we do not think that the record affirmatively reflects any activities that were per se illegal in a nonecclesiastical\n   sense or against public policy, fraudulent, or against public health and safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   Although Appellees argue that under state associations law they were within their rights to remove the diocese and diocesan property from TEC, such law applies to the rules used by associations to regulate, within legal limits, their\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   internal affairs, not to the question of an association's identity.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Juarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8913952\" index=\"476\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/172/274/#p279\">\n    172 S.W.3d at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (private association's right to govern its affairs),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184346\" index=\"477\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/595/\">\n    443 U.S. at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184346\" index=\"478\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/595/\">\n    99 S.Ct. at 3026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that if the interpretation of an ownership instrument requires resolution of a religious controversy, the court must defer to resolution of the doctrinal issue by the authoritative ecclesiastical body),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westbrook\n   </em>\n   , 231 S.W.3d at 398, 400 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Minton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10297630\" index=\"479\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/297/615/#p622\">\n    297 S.W. at 621-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to explain why courts must decline jurisdiction over disputes concerning church membership and holding that while neutral principles may\n   <em>\n    define\n   </em>\n   a dispute, their\n   <em>\n    application\n   </em>\n   may impinge on a church's ability to manage its internal affairs).

When it defied the governing strictures of the association of which it was a member, and particularly when it declared itself apart from that organization, it lost its identity as a part of\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   larger association.\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   , 808 S.W.2d at 550-51 (listing factors courts consider to identify whether a church is hierarchical);\n   <em>\n    Templo Ebenezer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 752 S.W.2d at 198 (distinguishing hierarchical churches from congregational churches based on the congregational-type church's independence and ability to \"totally control[ ] its own destiny\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   TEC's dioceses are members of TEC, identified by the dioceses' accession to TEC's governing rules, just as parishes simultaneously accede both to TEC's governing rules and to their governing diocese's rules. Individual members of a parish may decide to worship elsewhere; a majority of individual members of a parish or diocese may decide to do so. But when they leave, they are no longer \"Episcopalians\" as identified by TEC;\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   they become something else. And that something else is not entitled to retain property if that property, under the terms of the deed, is held in trust for a TEC-affiliated diocese or congregation. By rejecting TEC, Appellees also rejected any claim to items and property affiliated with TEC or with being a TEC-affiliated diocese to the extent that the instruments of ownership spell out an express interest. While a decision to disaffiliate is an ecclesiastical matter, what happens to the property is not, unless the\n   affairs have been ordered so that the ecclesiastical decisions effectively determine the property issue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Masterson\n   </em>\n   , 422 S.W.3d at 607, and the macro-level view of the associations' relationship is consistent with the deference we are required to give to the ecclesiastical determination by a hierarchical church.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Civil courts are constitutionally required to accept as binding the decision of the highest authority of a hierarchical religious organization to which a dispute regarding internal government has been submitted.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-440\">\n   The plain language of the 1947 deed sets forth a trust with the identified beneficiary as \"the Protestant Episcopal Church\" as it was located within the territorial limits of what was formerly the Diocese of Dallas. As set out above, it was within those territorial limits that the Diocese of Dallas gave birth to EDFW. From the various documents in the record of this case, the \"Protestant Episcopal Church\" identified in the deed at the time of the deed's making is TEC, thus making TEC's local Fort Worth affiliate the beneficiary of the trust. That is, the trust did not make TEC itself the beneficiary; rather, by its language, the trust identified the diocese\n   <em>\n    affiliated with TEC as located within that territory\n   </em>\n   as the beneficiary. This is most clear when considering that the 1984 judgment did not actually touch the property's equitable title, which was vested in the Church in a diocese whose name and geographic configuration might change as, anticipated since 1910, the giant Diocese of Dallas would-and subsequently did-pursuant to its division into two TEC dioceses.

Each of the elected trustees would serve until his successor's election and qualification or \"until his death, resignation, disqualification or removal.\" The bylaws specified that to be qualified, a trustee \"may be either lay persons in good standing of a parish or mission in the Diocese of Fort Worth, or members of the Clergy canonically resident within the Diocese.\" Any trustee at that time could be removed by EDFW's bishop.

The Corporation, in turn, would hold real property acquired \"for the use of a particular parish or mission in trust for the use and benefit of such parish or mission.\" The Corporation could not convey, lease, or encumber such property without the consent of the rector, wardens, and vestry of such parish or mission. If a parish or mission were dissolved, the property held in trust by the Corporation \"shall revert to said Corporation for the use and benefit of the Diocese, as such.\" The same article in the 1989, 2006, and 2008 EDFW constitution and canons reflects no change other than renumbering. The corresponding canon, \"Corporation of the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth,\" established the Corporation's purposes and management of its affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-469\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

As pointed out by the supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Masterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-475\">\n   Absent specific, lawful provisions in a corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws otherwise, whether and how a corporation's directors or those entitled to control its affairs can change its articles of incorporation and bylaws are secular, not ecclesiastical, matters.... The current statutory scheme changes the default rule on who is authorized to amend the bylaws, but under neither the former nor the current statute is an\n   <em>\n    external\n   </em>\n   entity empowered to amend them absent specific, lawful provision in the corporate documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-476\">\n   422 S.W.3d at 609-10 (emphasis added) (referencing revised civil statutes article 1396-2.09 and business organizations code section 22.102 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-477\">\n   According to the supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Masterson\n   </em>\n   , if nothing in the corporate documents requires amendments to be subject to approval of\n   <em>\n    TEC\n   </em>\n   , and no Texas law precludes such a corporation from amending its articles and bylaws to exclude references to TEC, then there is no requirement under Texas corporations law to otherwise subject the Corporation to\n   <em>\n    TEC\n   </em>\n   's attempted interference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 613 (\"To the contrary, the articles of incorporation and bylaws specified that qualified parish members were entitled to elect the vestry and amend the bylaws\"). As nothing in the Corporation's documents provides for TEC's approval and nothing in our law precludes the amendments to exclude references to TEC, TEC lacks standing for a claim as to the Corporation, and to the extent the trial court granted summary judgment on this basis, it did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-478\">\n   Further, according to the amended bylaws, the board of directors identifies the \"Bishop\" for the Corporation's purposes. Although this might otherwise be considered an \"ecclesiastical\" determination, because the bylaws treat the identification of the \"Bishop\" as merely the identification of the Corporation's chairman of the board, we cannot say that a title alone, under the circumstances presented in the bylaws here, requires \"consideration of doctrinal matters,\" i.e., \"the ritual and liturgy of worship or the tenets of faith,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184346\" index=\"496\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/595/\">\n    443 U.S. at 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184346\" index=\"497\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/595/\">\n    99 S.Ct. at 3025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , particularly as the bylaws provide the methodology for the Corporation's board to identify the \"Bishop\" for the Corporation's purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-479\">\n   However, the bylaws were amended on August 15, 2006, when there was only one \"body\n   <em>\n    now known as\n   </em>\n   the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth,\" from which lay and clergy members of the board were drawn and the bishop identified, and that body was affiliated with TEC. [Emphasis added.] Over two years later, on November 15, 2008, Appellees voted to leave TEC. The schism gave rise to two distinct entities: one recognized by TEC as the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth and one\n   <em>\n    self\n   </em>\n   -identified by Appellees as such. The bylaws and articles do not provide a description of the characteristics of the diocese self-identified by Appellees, but they do require that elected trustees be either lay persons in good standing of a parish or mission, or canonically resident, in the entity identified by the Corporation's board as \"the body\n   <em>\n    now known as\n   </em>\n   the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth.\" [Emphasis added.] As set out above, it is within TEC's province to identify its diocese in the geographic area identified as Fort Worth and what it takes to be a member in good\n   standing or canonically resident therein. Accordingly, on November 15, 2008, when Appellees voted to disaffiliate, it was TEC's prerogative to determine whether the board members of the diocese formerly associated with TEC had become disqualified under the Corporation's bylaws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-480\">\n   We conclude that the TEC-affiliated EDFW controls appointment to the Corporation's board and therefore that the TEC parties identified within the TEC-affiliated EDFW have standing for these related complaints. We sustain the TEC parties' subissue 1(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-481\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Remaining Arguments: Constructive Trust, Estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-482\">\n   Paralleling the complaints in their live pleading, the TEC parties refer us to TEC canon I.17.8, \"Fiduciary responsibility,\" which refers to a TEC officer's duty to \"well and faithfully\" perform the duties of that office in the Church and to a lay person's responsibility to be a communicant in good standing. They further refer us to the \"Declaration of Conformity\" that Bishop Iker and \"every dissident cleric\" signed, refer us to prior statements by Bishop Iker and others in previous cases involving dissidents that could be read to contradict Bishop Iker's nouveau-dissident position here, and complain that the trial court allowed Bishop Iker et al. \"to renege on their promises, break their commitments, and breach relationships of trust and confidence as Church officers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-483\">\n   The TEC parties base their constructive trust argument on the basis of a fiduciary duty owed to them as the diocese and congregations that remained loyal to TEC, asserting that Appellees \"broke a century's worth of oaths and commitments\" when they left and took the TEC-affiliated property, resources, and name.
