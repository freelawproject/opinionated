The trial court dismissed her claims pursuant to Rule 91a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. We affirm the portion of the trial court's judgment dismissing Skelton's breach of fiduciary duty claim. We reverse the portion of the judgment dismissing Skelton's legal malpractice claim and remand the cause for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Skelton, an attorney, was charged with forging the will of her deceased client. The charge stemmed from a will she prepared for Ysidro Canales in May or June of 2002. Although the will was executed in Skelton's office, the original will remained in Canales's possession. When Canales died in May 2003, the original will could not be located. Skelton found a copy of the executed will in her office, but due to a flood, it was water-damaged. The will Skelton had prepared for Canales was still among the documents in her computer, so Skelton printed a clean copy. Because the newly printed copy of the will lacked signatures,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Skelton physically cut the signatures off the water-damaged copy of the will and pasted them onto the printed copy. Skelton made a copy of the newly created document and filed it as a copy of Canales's will in the probate court. In September 2003, Skelton's secretary contacted law enforcement and informed them that she suspected Skelton had created a false will for Canales. On November 15, 2004, Skelton was charged by indictment with forging Canales's will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Gray represented Skelton in the December 2007 criminal trial. Skelton was ultimately convicted of forgery. The trial court sentenced her to a suspended one-year term of imprisonment and placed her on community supervision for two years. Thereafter, Gray's representation of Skelton ended, and she hired new counsel to represent her on direct appeal. On appeal, Skelton argued that the jury charge improperly allowed conviction for a theory not included in the indictment and that Gray rendered ineffective assistance. This court affirmed the trial court's judgment in an opinion dated June 9, 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skelton v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-08-00720-CR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202298859\">\n    2010 WL 2298859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

The jury found that (1) Canales executed a valid will; (2) Skelton did not act with the intent to defraud or harm another when she physically altered the will; and (3) the will submitted to probate was an accurate copy of Canales's will. Based on the jury's verdict, a judgment was rendered on March 17, 2009 ordering that the will contestants take nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   More than two years later, on September 26, 2011, Skelton filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus, \"claiming that she is actually innocent, she was denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct, and she received ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Skelton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6935204\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/434/709/#p715\">\n    434 S.W.3d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 715 (Tex.

In response, Gray filed a Rule 91a motion to dismiss, arguing 1) Skelton's legal malpractice claim was \"barred by the\n   <em>\n    Peeler\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   doctrine because\n   she has not been exonerated from the underlying criminal conviction;\" and 2) the statute of limitations barred her claims for both legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court granted the Rule 91a motion to dismiss in Gray's favor, finding the legal malpractice claim failed for lack of exoneration and the breach of fiduciary duty claim was barred by limitations. This appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, Skelton presents the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1.

In\n   <em>\n    Peeler\n   </em>\n   , the Texas Supreme Court considered whether a convict can sue her criminal defense attorney for legal malpractice.

She contends\n   <em>\n    Peeler\n   </em>\n   only applies to\n   <em>\n    convicted\n   </em>\n   criminals and that her conviction no longer stands. She alternatively argues that if a\n   <em>\n    Peeler\n   </em>\n   analysis is necessary, her claims were improperly barred because she has been \"effectively exonerated\" by way of the habeas proceeding and the State's dismissal, along with the jury's finding in the will contest that she did not act with the intent to defraud or harm another when she altered Canales's will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We agree that the facts before us are distinguishable from the facts in\n   <em>\n    Peeler .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peeler\n   </em>\n   applies in cases where a malpractice plaintiff has been convicted of a crime.

Skelton argues\n   <em>\n    Apex Towing\n   </em>\n   crafted an additional reference date-when litigation is \"otherwise finally concluded\"-which supports using the date of the mandate issuance in the habeas proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apex Towing Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105929\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/41/118/#p121\">\n    41 S.W.3d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She notes that a habeas corpus application \"relates to and flows from the original conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Falby v. Percely\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-04-422 CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201038776\">\n    2005 WL 1038776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Tex. App.-Beaumont May 5, 2005, no pet.) (mem. op.). As a result, only a final order in a habeas corpus proceeding marks the conclusion of the litigation from which it flows. Skelton also argues from a policy perspective that if we were to adopt Gray's rationale, a potential malpractice plaintiff would be barred by limitations before she ever has the opportunity to obtain exoneration. Thus, she contends limitations cannot accrue on a legal malpractice claim against a criminal defense attorney until after the attorney's former client has had a reasonable opportunity to seek habeas corpus relief to challenge the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We agree that Skelton's malpractice claim is not barred by limitations. To bring a cause of action for legal malpractice against a criminal defense attorney would require the plaintiff to overcome the application of the\n   <em>\n    Peeler\n   </em>\n   doctrine by either the absence of a conviction or exoneration. In this case, Skelton could not have sued Gray for malpractice until her conviction had been vacated through the habeas corpus proceeding. Had she tried to sue him any sooner, her claim would have been barred by\n   <em>\n    Peeler.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Other jurisdictions have held that limitations is tolled while a criminal defendant pursues post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKnight v.

There are sound public policy reasons for tolling the statute of limitations on legal malpractice actions until post-conviction relief has been obtained. Dispositive post-conviction relief is relevant to the issues of proximate causation and damages, and thus tolling promotes judicial economy \"because many issues litigated in the quest for post-conviction relief will be duplicated later in the legal malpractice action.\"\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10382332\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/816/1358/#p1360\">\n    816 P.2d at 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Gray argues that limitations cannot be tolled until the end of the habeas proceeding because Texas has no deadline for filing post-conviction relief following a criminal conviction, and thus there is no time limit on a criminal defendant's ability to sue her defense attorney for malpractice arising out of the initial representation. We disagree that the possibility of indefinite tolling exists. First, a habeas application may be denied on the basis of laches.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093227\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/398/206/#p210\">\n    398 S.W.3d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Vasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178083\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/499/602/#p612\">\n    499 S.W.3d 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2016, pet. ref'd). Second, convicted criminals have a vested interest in seeking post-conviction relief as quickly as possible. Many individuals seeking post-conviction relief are incarcerated, or, like Skelton, seeking to recover a professional license vital to their livelihood. Thus, Gray's concerns related to a never-ending tolling period are unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Given the unique nature of the legal malpractice claim arising out of criminal proceedings, limitations must run from the event that \"exonerates\" the former criminal defense client or otherwise vacates that client's conviction. We therefore conclude that the statute of limitations on Skelton's legal malpractice claim was tolled until the completion of the habeas corpus proceeding which served to overturn her conviction, i.e., on November 6, 2014. Because Skelton sued within two years of that date, her malpractice claim is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Skelton also sued Gray for breach of fiduciary duty. In her petition, she alleged, \"[d]uring the representation, Defendant charged Plaintiff in excess of $2,800 for office supplies and computer equipment that he falsely claimed was necessary to the representation but he actually did not utilize in his representation of Plaintiff.\" The elements of a breach of fiduciary duty claim are: (1) a fiduciary relationship between the plaintiff and defendant, (2) a breach by the defendant of his fiduciary duty to the plaintiff, and (3) an injury to the plaintiff or benefit to the defendant as a result of the defendant's breach.\n   <em>\n    Lundy v. Masson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8170700\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/260/482/#p501\">\n    260 S.W.3d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied). The limitations period for a breach of fiduciary duty claim is four years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 16.004(a)(5) (West 2002). \"As a general rule, a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when facts come into existence that authorize a party to seek a judicial remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins.

A cause of action \"accrues when a wrongful act causes a legal injury, regardless of when the plaintiff learns of that injury or if all resulting damages have yet to occur.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9258218\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/128/211/#p221\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The trial court found that Skelton's cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty accrued in December 2007 when Gray's representation of Skelton ended and that Skelton did not plead \"excusable delay in discovering\" Gray's alleged misconduct. The trial court further found that, \"if [Gray] failed to use the $2,800 payment for her benefit, [Skelton] would have been entitled to a refund of the payment by [Gray] at the conclusion of his employment, even if she had been found 'not guilty' in the trial court or her post-conviction writ application based on ineffective assistance had been denied.\" Thus, the trial court found that tolling did not apply to the breach of fiduciary duty claim and that limitations barred Skelton's claim for breach of fiduciary duty in December 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Gray's representation ended in December 2007 at the conclusion of the criminal trial. Skelton did not plead the discovery rule or otherwise assert that she was not aware of the alleged breach until a later date. Thus, Skelton was required to bring her breach of fiduciary claim by the end of December 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 16.004(a)(5).
