Taylor contends the circuit court erred in admitting evidence of uncharged misconduct. Upon review of the briefs and the record, we find no error and affirm the judgment. We have provided the parties with a Memorandum explaining the reasons for our\n   decision, because a published opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AFFIRMED.
