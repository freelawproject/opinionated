Metro filed a motion to dismiss. After a hearing, the Trial Court entered an order dismissing the petition for writ of certiorari for lack of jurisdiction. The Trial Court found fatal defects in the petition for writ of certiorari, including that it was not supported by oath as required. Petitioners appeal to this Court. We affirm the judgment of the Trial Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Three decisions arising from three meetings of the Commission, all related to affordable housing development, are at issue on appeal. These meetings took place on March 24, April 14, and May 12, 2016. On April 14, the minutes of the March 24 meeting were approved and signed. On April 28, the minutes of the April 14 meeting were approved and signed. Finally, on May 26, the minutes of the May 12 meeting were approved and signed. As a result of these meetings, the Commission determined that the Forest View Park planned unit development was active.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 16, 2016, Petitioners filed their petition for writ of certiorari and supersedeas seeking review of the Commission's decision. The petition alleged, in part, that \"the Commission acted in an arbitrary and judicially excessive manner when it found the Forest View Park PUD to be active.\" The petition was not supported by oath. On May 23, 2016, Petitioners filed an amended petition. The amended petition was not supported by oath either. On June 6, 2016, Petitioners filed yet another amended petition, which also was not supported by oath. On August 5, 2016, Metro filed a motion to dismiss. Only on August 15 did Petitioners file a proposed new petition that was sworn to and otherwise compliant with the requirements for a petition for writ of certiorari. On August 19, 2016, the Trial Court conducted a hearing on Metro's motion to dismiss. On August 30, 2016, the Trial Court entered an order granting Metro's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The Trial Court stated, as pertinent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court finds that the latest of the challenged Planning Commission decisions was made May 12, 2016. The Petition was filed May 16, 2016. The Petition does not state that it is the first application for the writ and is not verified as required under the Tennessee Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The minutes approving the May 12 decision were approved and signed on May 26, 2016. More than sixty days have passed since those minutes were approved and signed. Because the Petition does not state that it is the first application for the writ and is not verified, the\n   Court has no jurisdiction to review the Planning Commission's decision. Nor does the Court have jurisdiction to grant a motion to amend the petition or to convert it to a declaratory judgment action. Pursuant to Article VI, Section 10 of the Tennessee Constitution and\n   <em>\n    Talley v. Bd. of Prof'l Responsibility\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315843\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/358/185/#p192\">\n    358 S.W.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192 (Tenn. 2011), this case is DISMISSED. Costs are hereby taxed to Petitioners. This is the final order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Petitioners subsequently filed their \"motion requesting relief.\" On October 20, 2016, the Trial Court entered its order denying Petitioners' motion requesting relief. The Trial Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   This matter came before the Court for hearing on September 30, 2016 on the Petitioners' \"Motion Requesting Relief\" from the \"Final Order of Dismissal\" entered by this Court on August 30, 2016. Upon consideration of the Motion, the pleadings of the parties, the argument of counsel and the entire record, the Court finds that the Motion should be denied. This Order incorporates and reiterates the findings made by this Court at the hearing on September 30, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Petitioners initially assert that the Final Order of Dismissal was not final, in part because the Order only addressed the May 12. 2016 decision of the Davidson County Planning Commission and did not address the Commission's March 24, 2016 and April 12, 2016 decisions. However, this Court finds that the August 30, 2016 Order was intended to completely conclude this case. The Order is styled a \"Final Order of Dismissal\" and specifically states that this case is dismissed with costs taxed to the Petitioners. The Order also definitively states that \"[t]his is the final order.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Accordingly, given that the August 30th Order is a final decision dismissing this cause of action, the Court must assume the Petitioners seek relief from that Order under either Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 59.04, which governs motions to alter or amend a judgment, or Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02, which generally allows a party to seek relief from judgments or orders under certain defined circumstances. The Court finds neither of these Rules justifies relief in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Rule 59.04 offers relief to a movant wishing to alter or amend a judgment in very limited circumstances.

As they have not met the burden of identifying a mistake, inadvertence, surprise, neglect, or other circumstance envisioned by the rule, the Petitioners' motion to alter the prior Order is not justified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that the August 30th Order addressed all claims that were before the Court. Having read the filings in this case, the Court finds that there is no new argument or new evidence being presented by the Petitioners in their Motion for Relief.

If too much time had elapsed since the Commission's most recent decision at issue, then naturally the two prior relevant decisions also would be encompassed by the Trial Court's ruling that time had expired. We hold, as did the Trial Court, that the Trial Court's final order of dismissal and subsequent order denying relief to Petitioners under theories of Rule 59.04 and 60.02 resolved all of the claims between the parties and as such represented a final, appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The next issue we address is whether Petitioners' petition for writ of certiorari should be treated as an action for declaratory judgment and thus avoid the constitutional and statutory requirements applicable to a writ of certiorari. According to Petitioners, the Commission made new law and changed the very landscape of Forest View Park, and, therefore, Petitioners' legal challenge should be construed as an action for declaratory judgment. Respondents, on the other hand, argue that the Commission's determination was a minor administrative application of existing law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In a recent opinion, our Supreme Court discussed whether and when common-law writ of certiorari or declaratory judgment is available to review administrative decisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The threshold question in determining whether an administrative decision is subject to judicial review by common-law writ of certiorari is whether the administrative body performed a legislative or a quasi-judicial function.\n   <em>\n    McCallen v.

Pemberton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385938\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/530/76/#p103\">\n    530 S.W.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103-04, 111-12 (Tenn. 2017) (Footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In the present case, three Commission decisions are challenged. The March 24, 2016 Commission decision revised the planned unit development from 212 to 96 units, pursuant to Metropolitan Code \u00a7 17.40.120.G. The April 14, 2016 decision by the Commission deferred until May 12 a determination as to whether the planned unit development still was active. Finally, on May 12, 2016, acting pursuant to Metropolitan Code \u00a7 17.40.120.H, the Commission determined that the planned unit development was active. The Commission, therefore, applied existing law to make certain determinations regarding development. Echoing the plaintiff's stance as articulated by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    McFarland\n   </em>\n   , Petitioners effectively assert that the Commission \"got it wrong.\" In our judgment, the Commission's decisions were of a quasi-judicial or administrative rather than legislative character. A petition for writ of certiorari, rather than an action for declaratory judgment, was the appropriate\n   method to challenge the Commission's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We next examine whether Petitioners successfully vested the Trial Court with subject matter jurisdiction by the filing of their petition for writ of certiorari. The petition for writ of certiorari must state that it is the first application for the writ.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-8-106\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-8-106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) provides: \"The petition for certiorari may be sworn to before the clerk of the circuit court, the judge, any judge of the court of general sessions, or a notary public, and shall state that it is the first application for the writ.\" Our Supreme Court has discussed the constitutional and jurisdictional gravity of the oath requirement with respect to petitions for writs of certiorari as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The courts' power to issue writs of certiorari flows from Article VI, Section 10 of the Tennessee Constitution. Thus, in order to vest a court with subject matter jurisdiction in a certiorari proceeding, a petition for writ of certiorari must satisfy Article VI, Section 10's requirements. Article VI, Section 10 requires petitions for a writ of certiorari to be \"supported by oath or affirmation.\" Because this requirement is constitutional, it is mandatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beck v.

Therefore, the Trial Court properly granted Respondents' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
