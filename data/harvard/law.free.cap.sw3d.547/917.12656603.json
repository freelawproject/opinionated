Appellee Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD) filed a motion for en banc reconsideration of our original opinion. We deny both motions, withdraw our opinion and judgment dated January 25, 2018, and substitute the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   TRWD owns property along the Trinity River and leases part of it to a business entity that operates a restaurant. After failing to convince the Tarrant Appraisal Review Board that the property was exempt from ad valorem taxes, TRWD initiated the underlying tax appeal in the district court and obtained a summary judgment that the property was tax exempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   TAD challenges the trial court's rulings denying its special exceptions and evidentiary objections, but the principal issue in this appeal is whether, and under what constitutional or statutory authority, TRWD's property is tax exempt. Although we agree with TAD that the property's eligibility for a tax exemption is limited to tax code section 11.11(a), which exempts public property \"used for public purposes,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011.11\">\n    Tex.

We conclude and hold that TRWD's property is tax exempt under\n   tax code section 11.11(a) because the property is used for public purposes as a matter of law. We will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

TRWD owns, and leases part of, the Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Depicted in the image below, the triangular-shaped Property the subject of this tax appeal is located on the Trinity River, at 3201 Riverfront Drive in Fort Worth (the Property). According to Alan Thomas, TRWD's Deputy General Manager, TRWD acquired the Property in connection with a federal control project known as \"Program D.\" Undertaken in concert with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the program's purpose was to control flooding on the Clear Fork Trinity River. TRWD must maintain ownership of the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Bisecting the Property and the Trinity River is a stretch of the Trinity Trails, a system of public trails and amenities that TRWD constructed, owns, and maintains. In an effort to counteract a lack of use outside of certain areas along the trails and \"to encourage development of river-facing businesses on TRWD's property and adjoining properties,\" TRWD determined to improve and to lease the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In March 2011, TRWD leased 10,295 of the Property's then-existing 50,688 square feet to chef Tim Love's River Shack, LLC. Under the lease, TRWD agreed to construct a building (or pavilion) on the Property, and River Shack agreed to operate a restaurant-the Woodshed Smokehouse. The lease limits River Shack's permitted uses of the leased Property to the following: \"restaurant (eat-in and take-out) with alcohol sales, recreational activities and entertainment, including live music to the\n   extent permitted by applicable municipal ordinances.\" River Shack pays TRWD rent based on a percentage of its annual sales-between 4% and 6%-and Thomas confirmed that \"[a]ll income received by TRWD from the [lease] is deposited into the general fund of TRWD and used exclusively for [ ] TRWD's public purposes.\" The lease terminates if the United States Army Corps of Engineers determines that the leased premises must be removed or materially altered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The portion of the Property that River Shack does not lease consists primarily of common areas-\"that part of the [Property] intended for the common use of [River Shack], its employees, customers and other invitees, and the general public, especially members of the general public utilizing the Trinity River and Trinity Trails\"-and a parking lot, which is reserved for River Shack's exclusive use during business hours. Tim Love stated in his affidavit that the Woodshed Smokehouse \"routinely provides free concerts of local singers and bands on the pavilion area shared with the public,\" \"sponsors runs and walks on the Trinity Trail System,\" \"passes out free water and Gatorade to the trail users,\" and provides \"games and recreational equipment (such as ping pong and corn hole) for the public's use on the common areas located on the Property.\" The lease obligates River Shack to make its restrooms available to \"all persons\" on the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Tax-exemption denial and district-court appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At some point, TRWD received notice that TAD had proposed to deny TRWD an exemption from paying ad valorem taxes on the Property. TRWD protested the decision before the Tarrant Appraisal Review Board, and it issued orders in February 2016 denying TRWD an exemption on 35,067 square feet of the Property but granting TRWD an exemption on 11,472 square feet of the Property for the tax years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. According to TAD, the portion of the nonexempt Property includes \"the restaurant building itself, the off-street parking lot provided for Woodshed Smokehouse's exclusive use during its hours of operation and at other specified times, the landscaped areas on and around that building and parking lot, and associated sidewalks and entryways providing ingress and egress for them.\" The exempt property includes \"a grassy playground, bike racks, water fountain, park bench, public toilet, trailside shelter, and associated sidewalks and on-street parking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   TRWD appealed the review board's decisions by filing a petition in the district court. TRWD later filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Property was tax exempt as a matter of law. TAD responded and filed special exceptions and objections. The trial court granted TRWD's motion and ordered that TRWD \"is not required to pay for years 2012 through 2015 any ad valorem tax or assessment on the\" Property and that TAD \"shall correct the appraisal roll, tax bill, and such other records so that they conform to the\" trial court's judgment. TAD appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In a summary-judgment case, the issue on appeal is whether the movant met the summary judgment burden by establishing that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

THE PROPERTY'S TAX-EXEMPT STATUS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In its first issue, TAD argues that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment for TRWD because under the relevant constitutional, statutory, and caselaw authorities, TRWD did not prove, as a matter of law, that the Property is tax exempt. Specifically, TAD argues that the Property is not tax exempt under section 11 of TRWD's Organic Statute because that provision is a void special law in violation of article VIII, section 2(a) and article III, section 56(a)(22) of the Texas constitution ; because the tax code controls over the Organic Statute, as evidenced by tax code section 1.02 and the tax code's enabling language repealing any conflicting laws; and because the conflicts provision contained in section 22 of the Organic Statute, added in 2001, does not render the Organic Statute otherwise applicable. TAD argues that the Property's tax-exempt status should instead be determined pursuant to tax code section 11.11(a), which TAD contends applies only when public property is used exclusively for the use and benefit of the public. Because, according to TAD, \"a for-profit company is leasing the property and operating a restaurant and bar on the property for its own financial gain,\" the Property is not tax exempt under tax code section 11.11(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   TRWD responds that the Property is tax exempt under article VIII, section 2(a) of the Texas constitution and its enabling statute, tax code section 11.11(a), because water control and improvement districts created under article XVI, section 59, like TRWD, serve a public purpose as a matter of law; because TRWD's Organic Statute declares a public use of the property; and because TRWD uses the Property for public purposes even though it leases part of it to River Shack, as neither article VIII, section 2(a) nor tax code section 11.11(a) require exclusive public use. TRWD further argues that the Property is alternatively tax exempt under article XI, section 9 of the Texas constitution because it is devoted exclusively to public use, that the Organic Statute's section 11 either is not a void local or special law or is a constitutionally-authorized local or special law, and that the Organic Statute does not conflict with the tax code, but even if it did, the Organic Statue would control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In our original opinion, we strove to address the parties' detailed arguments, and we divided our analysis into three primary sections-(1) section IV.B, which addressed the tax-exempt status of the Property under article XI, section 9 ; (2) section IV.C, which addressed the tax-exempt status of the Property under the Organic Statute; and (3) section IV.D, which addressed the tax-exempt status of the Property under article VIII, section 2(a) and tax code section 11.11(a). On reconsideration, TRWD argues that we should remove the sections of our original opinion that addressed the Property's tax-exempt status under article XI, section 9 and under the Organic Statute because no part of our holding under tax code section 11.11(a) relied upon those sections, rendering them advisory. TRWD also emphatically challenges virtually every aspect of our analysis of section 11 of the Organic Statute. Because, under these circumstances,\n   we are sympathetic to TRWD's concerns about issuing an advisory opinion, and because we are not altering the holding in our original opinion that the Property is exempt under tax code section 11.11(a), we remove the sections of our original opinion that addressed article XI, section 9 and section 11 of the Organic Statute, and we will not address any sub-arguments related to those matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

We hold that to avail itself of the exemption contained in tax code section 11.11(a), TRWD had no obligation to prove that the Property was devoted exclusively to the use and benefit of the public. So long as the Property is \"used for public purposes,\" TRWD is entitled to an exemption under tax code section 11.11(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Property is \"used for public purposes.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Initially, we note that TAD's argument is worded loosely enough to be construed several different ways. On one hand, TAD argues that like the property in\n   <em>\n    City of San Antonio\n   </em>\n   , which had no public purpose after City Public Services leased its lignite reserves to Alcoa, \"the nature and use of the [P]roperty [here] was fundamentally changed\n   <em>\n    from public to private\n   </em>\n   when TRWD leased the property\" to River Shack to operate a restaurant and bar on the Property for its own financial gain. [Emphasis added.] To be clear, whether section 11.11(a) contains an exclusive public-use requirement has no bearing whatsoever on this specific argument because if the Property had\n   <em>\n    no public purpose\n   </em>\n   after TRWD leased it to River Shack, then undoubtedly, it could not be \"used for public purposes\" and tax exempt under section 11.11(a). Like the court in\n   <em>\n    City of San Antonio\n   </em>\n   addressed the issue in that case, we can resolve this specific argument by simply examining whether the Property continued to have a public purpose after it was leased to River Shack.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of San Antonio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202986248\">\n    2006 WL 2986248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (declining to consider whether section 11.11(a) requires exclusive public use because City Public Services \"ceased using the land in question for any public purpose when it signed the lease with Alcoa\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On the other hand, by relying on the\n   <em>\n    Grand Prairie Housing Authority\n   </em>\n   cases, which held that the medical building was not tax exempt because it was not being used exclusively for the use and benefit of the public, TAD appears to argue that the Property is not tax exempt because River Shack is operating a restaurant for financial gain and, therefore, not using the Property exclusively for the use and benefit of the public. We determined above that section 11.11(a) does not contain an exclusive public-use requirement, but that does not end the inquiry. We must still examine the record to determine whether TRWD established, as a matter of law, that the Property is being \"used for public purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011.11\">\n    Tex.

Of course, if the Property is so used, then logically, it cannot have \"no public purpose.\" Our resolution of this argument will therefore necessarily resolve TAD's \"no public purpose\" argument immediately above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   One thing is certain: Whether property is used for public purposes is a highly fact-specific question that, we believe, must be answered on a case-by-case basis. \"Public purpose is not easily defined.

The question, however, is whether the Property continues to be so used after the lease was executed and River Shack began operating a restaurant for profit. Contrary to TAD's overly narrow characterization, the Property is not some run-of-the-mill strip mall that TRWD developed merely for retail purposes. River Shack no doubt operates a business for profit, but that is only one facet of a larger project that, at its core, unquestionably has a public purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The legislature amended TRWD's Organic Statute in 2001 and 2005 to authorize TRWD to, respectively, provide for \"the acquisition, construction, development, operation, or maintenance of recreational facilities\" and of \"facilities intended to promote economic development to the full extent authorized by Section 52-a, Article III, Texas Constitution.\" Tex. Water Aux. Laws, Table III, art. 8280-207 (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.) [Act of May 28, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 1363, \u00a7 3, sec. 18, \u00a7 4, sec. 18A(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%204302\">\n    2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 4302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] (italics removed). Consistent with those purposes, Alan Thomas opined in his affidavit that TRWD entered into the lease with River Shack \"to encourage development of river-facing businesses on TRWD's property and adjoining properties.\" He also confirmed that the Property \"was intended and designed as a trail amenity to provide the public with recreational enhancements ancillary to the public's use of the Trinity Trails system.\" Thus, as TRWD's summary-judgment evidence conclusively demonstrates, TRWD leased the Property to River Shack in connection with its optimistic plan to develop the Property for economic and recreational purposes. The Property is used primarily for the comfort and welfare of the public, and the income that TRWD receives from the lease is deposited into TRWD's general fund and used for public purposes. With its pavilion, common areas, and location adjacent to the Trinity Trails, and developed and leased for economic and recreational purposes, the Property is used for public purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Both the Organic Statute and the lease confirm the Property's public use. TRWD's Organic Statute provides that \"[t]he accomplishment of the\n   <em>\n    purposes\n   </em>\n   stated in [the Organic Statute are] for the benefit of the people of this State.\" Tex. Water Aux. Laws, Table III, art. 8280-207 (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.) [Act of May 9, 1957, 55th Leg., R.S., ch. 268, \u00a7 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1957%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%20574\">\n    1957 Tex. Gen. Laws 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] (emphasis added). While this provision is a strong indication that the Property is used for public purposes, even better evidence is found in the lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burnet Cent. Appraisal Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181403\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/117/\">\n    497 S.W.3d at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (examining lease to determine whether property had public purpose);\n   <em>\n    City of San Antonio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202986248\">\n    2006 WL 2986248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (same). It states that the Property \"is intended for the use and enjoyment of the general public, especially including those engaged in activities on the Trinity River which flows adjacent to the southern boundary of the [Property] and those using [the] Trinity Trails.\" And one of the permitted uses of the leased property is \"recreational activities and entertainment, including live music.\" Thus, unlike the lease in\n   <em>\n    City of San Antonio\n   </em>\n   , which expressly\n   <em>\n    disavowed\n   </em>\n   any public purpose for the property there, the lease here expressly\n   <em>\n    confirms\n   </em>\n   that the Property is used for public purposes. Any incidental private benefit that River Shack earns from its operation of the restaurant cannot somehow eliminate the public purposes for which the Property is clearly used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We hold that, as a matter of law, the Property is \"used for public purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011.11\">\n    Tex.

We overrule TAD's first issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    V. SUMMARY-JUDGMENT STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In its second issue, TAD argues that the trial court failed to apply proper summary judgment standards, including that in ruling on TRWD's motion for summary judgment, the trial court should have deferred, or at least afforded some measure of deference, to the Tarrant Appraisal Review Board's determination that the Property is not tax exempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   TRWD pursued an appeal of the review board's decision pursuant to tax code chapter 42. Not only is the scope of review in such a proceeding \"trial de novo,\" but the trial court is expressly prohibited from \"admit[ting] in evidence the fact of prior action by the appraisal review board ..., except to the extent necessary to establish jurisdiction.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042.23\">\n    Tex. Tax Code Ann. \u00a7 42.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b) (West Supp. 2017). This unambiguous scope of review statutorily foreclosed the trial court from affording any deference to the review board's determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Appraisal Review for Travis Cty.

App.-Austin 1984, writ dism'd) (reasoning similarly). Nevertheless, insofar as the construction rule expressed in\n   <em>\n    Tarrant Appraisal District v. Moore\n   </em>\n   has any potential application here, we do not afford TAD's construction of section 11.11(a) serious consideration because it contradicts tax code section 11.11(a)'s plain language, as we held above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10014613\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/845/820/#p823\">\n    845 S.W.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 823 (Tex. 1993) (\"Construction of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement is entitled to serious consideration, so long as the construction is reasonable and does not contradict the plain language of the statute.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   TAD argues that TRWD failed to establish that the Property was tax exempt as a matter of law, but our analysis over the foregoing pages shows, and holds, otherwise. We overrule TAD's second issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS AND EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In its third issue, TAD argues that the trial court abused its discretion by overruling its special exceptions to TRWD's summary-judgment motion. The gist of its argument is that TRWD's motion did not sufficiently identify the grounds on which it was based. But as we touched on above, TRWD's motion was sufficient to give TAD fair notice of its grounds. Moreover, even if the trial court did abuse its discretion, we fail to see how TAD was in any way harmed; all arguments were preserved for appellate review, and both sides have provided this court with a substantial amount of briefing and argument, demonstrating a thorough knowledge of the overlapping issues in this complicated appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gause v. Gause\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776796\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/496/913/#p919\">\n    496 S.W.3d 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 919 (Tex.

App. P. 44.1. We overrule TAD's third issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   TAD argues in its fourth issue that the trial court abused its discretion by denying its objections to part of TRWD's summary-judgment evidence-an engineering report, Alan Thomas's affidavit, and Tim Love's affidavit. No part of our analysis relied on the engineering report, and to the extent that we recited any of the facts contained in Thomas's and Love's affidavits, we did so largely for contextual purposes. As with the special exceptions, even if the trial court did abuse its discretion, we fail to see-nor does TAD otherwise sufficiently explain-how TAD was harmed by the trial court's rulings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

As Justice Stayton observed in\n    <em>\n     Galveston Wharf Co. v.

If the \"devoted exclusively\" language contained in article XI, section 9 is so construed, and because tax code section 11.11(a) covers only \"public property,\" then the provisions have distinct meanings and applications. This is yet another reason why we cannot superimpose article XI, section 9's \"devoted exclusively\" language upon tax code section 11.11(a) -they appear to serve different purposes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
