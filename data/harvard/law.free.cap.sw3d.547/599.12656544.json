In five points on appeal, Employer challenges the Commission's finding that Employer failed to prove its entitlement to a penalty against Elsworth for his violation of Employer's safety rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 287.120.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because it is dispositive in this appeal, we address and deny only point 3, and need not address the remainder of Employer's points. The Commission's award to Elsworth is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the job less than a month, 18-year-old Elsworth overturned a dump truck while rounding a corner on Route D in Wayne County in March 2007. The truck rolled twice, fracturing Elsworth's skull and placing him in a \"persistent vegetative state\" for the remainder of his life.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After post-hearing stipulations, the only question the parties asked of the administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") was whether Employer was entitled to a penalty under \u00a7 287.120.5 for alleged violations of safety rules adopted by Employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The only evidence of safety rules in effect at the time of Elsworth's injury came from the testimony of two people, James Hovis (\"Hovis\") and David Richman (\"Richman\"). Hovis was the Eastern District Commissioner for Wayne County. He interviewed and hired Elsworth \"mostly to drive a dump truck.\" During Elsworth's initial interview on March 2, 2007, Hovis told Elsworth:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   If you're on-if you're in the vehicles or the equipment, you observe the laws that's out there. Your hardhats and your seat belts is a must, and I don't think you want to hear the story I told them. But when they say what happens, I said you'll get one warning. This is what happens after that. I said you don't want to know. I won't go into the length about the story I told them there, but he was told here, I says, now, can you-can you\n   work under them conditions, and he said, yes, I can. He was eager to get going, so I decided to hire him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Richman was Elsworth's direct supervisor. He testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Q. Did you have any conversations about safety with an employee before he went to work?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A. I advised [Elsworth] that he should always wear a seat belt, you know, while driving a dump truck, obey all traffic laws, regulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Employer argued that Elsworth had violated these rules by speeding and failing to wear his seatbelt at the time of the crash. After an exhaustive review of the evidence, the ALJ found Employer had not met its burden of proof. The Commission adopted the ALJ's findings and supplemented with additional findings. Together, those findings were that: (1) Employer had not adopted reasonable rules for the safety of its employees; (2) Employer had not made a reasonable effort to cause its employees to obey its safety rules; and (3) Employer had not proven that Elsworth was not wearing his seatbelt and was speeding at the time of the accident. Employer challenges each of those findings in five points on appeal. Relevant additional evidence will be discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We review the final decision and findings of the Commission and, to the extent adopted or incorporated by the Commission in its decision, the findings and conclusions of the ALJ.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sell v.

Employer failed to meet its burden of persuading the Commission that its award needed to be reduced due to\n   Elsworth's failure to follow Employer's safety rules. The Commission was not required to believe that Employer: (1) had adopted any training programs to ensure understanding and compliance with its safety rules; (2) had developed written policies or tests designed to impart the importance of following its safety rules; or (3) had adopted procedures to monitor employee compliance with its safety rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Commission could find from the evidence adduced that Elsworth was an inexperienced driver, having obtained his driver's license less than six months prior to his first day with Employer. Elsworth had never driven a dump truck and had no commercial vehicle experience at all. William Hampton (\"Hampton\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that Employer should have ensured Elsworth was qualified to operate the dump truck by training him in speed management, lane management, sight distance, vehicle inspection, and proper braking on grades and curves. Instead, the only evidence of Employer's training that Hampton uncovered were vague statements that Elsworth had accompanied or been accompanied by other drivers on a few occasions. Hampton concluded that Employer provided no specific training regarding the dump truck, the type of load that it carried, or general safety training for the dump truck. The Commission echoed Hampton's findings, noting that \"the only ... training that the employee was made aware of was some amount of 'On the Job' training by a few people without any specificity as to what training was provided or received.\" Furthermore, the Commission questioned whether Employer had met its burden of proving reasonable efforts considering that Employer had directed Elsworth to drive the dump truck by himself when Elsworth held only a Class B commercial driver's instruction\n   <em>\n    permit\n   </em>\n   , which he had acquired less than two weeks before his first day on the job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Employer's arguments to the contrary regarding its reasonable efforts challenge the weight to be given to conflicting evidence, but this Court must defer to the Commission's findings on those factual issues.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hornbeck v.
