FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 14, 1999, Craig Nunn pled guilty to four counts of aggravated sexual battery against four minor children who were patients at a hospital where he worked as a physician. The four incidents of aggravated sexual battery occurred between December 1997 and February 1998. Nunn received four concurrent sentences of twelve years to be served in the Tennessee Department of Correction. He was also sentenced to community supervision for life pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-524, which, at the time, provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (a) In addition to the punishment authorized by the specific statute prohibiting the conduct, any person who, on or after July 1, 1996, commits a violation of \u00a7 39-13-502, \u00a7 39-13-503, \u00a7 39-13-504 [aggravated sexual battery], \u00a7 39-13-522, or attempts to commit a violation of any of these sections, shall receive a sentence of community supervision for life.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (c) The sentence of community supervision for life shall commence immediately upon the expiration of the term of imprisonment imposed upon the person by the court or upon the person's release from regular parole supervision, whichever first occurs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (d)(1) A person on community supervision shall be under the jurisdiction, supervision and control of the Board of Paroles in the same manner as a person under parole supervision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The board is authorized on an individual basis to establish such conditions of community supervision as are necessary to protect the public from the person's committing a new sex offense, as well as promoting the rehabilitation of the person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Essentially, the lifetime supervision requirement of Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-524\"imposes an additional set of restrictions and requirements on the offender\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   serving his or her entire sentence of incarceration.\"\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

For example, the Sex Offender Directives required offenders to participate in counseling and polygraph tests and prohibited them from accessing the internet without approval or possessing alcohol. The Board of Probation and Parole granted supervising officers some discretion in imposing the conditions as deemed appropriate based on the particular offender's risks and needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nunn was released from serving his twelve-year sentence on March 28, 2009. On that same date, Nunn was placed on community supervision for life. According to Nunn, as he was being released from prison, the institutional parole officer placed him on the sex offender community supervision regime over his objection. Nunn signed a \"Community Supervision Certificate\" agreeing to abide by the Sex Offender Directives adopted by the Board of Probation and Parole, but he wrote beside his signature \"under protest.\" Days later, on March 31, 2009, Nunn met his supervising officer, who had him also sign a copy of the Sex Offender Directives containing the detailed list of specialized conditions of supervision for sex offenders. The Sex Offender Directives required Nunn to submit to curfews or electronic monitoring imposed by his supervising officer and to participate in counseling or treatment and polygraphs as deemed necessary. The Sex Offender Directives prohibited Nunn from possessing pornographic material, possessing alcohol, accessing the internet without permission from his supervising officer, working at an organization that provided services to minor children, or befriending anyone with minor children. The Sex Offender Directives provided that these conditions of supervision were \"guidelines ... established for all offenders\" and would apply to Nunn unless either the Board of Probation and Parole or his supervising officer and treatment provider determined otherwise, and if he did not agree with any condition, he could petition the Board for a modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Approximately eighteen months later, on September 29, 2010, Nunn filed a complaint for declaratory relief against the Board of Probation and Parole and the Tennessee Attorney General challenging the Sex Offender Directives as applied to him, on several grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nunn's complaint described his suit as one \"for declaratory relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2029-14-102\">\n    Tenn.

He claimed that the Sex Offender Directives adopted in 1999, months after he pled guilty, could not be applied to his community supervision for life. Nunn asked the trial court to declare that this application of Tennessee Code Annotated sections 39-13-524 and -526 and the Sex Offender Directives violated numerous provisions of the United States and Tennessee Constitutions regarding ex post facto laws, due process, equal protection, cruel and unusual punishment, self-incrimination, and separation of powers. In addition to citing Tennessee's Declaratory Judgment Act, he asked the court to also grant him declaratory relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in order to remedy these constitutional violations and \"the deprivation of civil rights under color of state law.\" Nunn did not seek monetary damages except for an award of attorney's fees and litigation costs pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Board of Probation and Parole and Attorney General filed an answer, and discovery ensued. Effective July 1, 2012, while the case was still pending, Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-524 was amended to provide that individuals subject to community supervision for life would be under the jurisdiction and supervision of the Tennessee Department of Correction rather than the Board of Probation and Parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2012 Tenn. Pub. Acts, c. 727, \u00a7 5 (replacing \"board of probation and parole\" with \"Department of Correction\" in the statutory text). Consequently, on August 20, 2012, the parties entered into an agreed order providing that the Department of Correction would be substituted as a party defendant in the place of the Board of Probation and Parole. On October 10, 2014, the parties entered into another agreed order permitting Nunn to file an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nunn's amended complaint stated that it was filed as a suit for declaratory judgment pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 4-5-225 of the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act and for declaratory relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nunn's amended complaint\n   set forth fifteen counts or claims alleging various violations of constitutional provisions, the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, two of the counts addressed the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act. Twelve counts asserted the following constitutional violations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. Ex post facto violations under the United States and Tennessee Constitutions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2. Separation of powers violation under the Tennessee Constitution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   3.

Violation of due process in connection with the mandatory therapy requirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, the \"pendant civil rights claim\" alleged that these same alleged violations of the United States Constitution also constituted violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as the State of Tennessee deprived him of \"rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the [Constitution]\" within the meaning of section 1983. Nunn claimed that he was entitled to declaratory relief pursuant to \u00a7 1983 due to the deprivation of his civil rights under color of state law. He sought attorney's fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Department of Correction and Attorney General (\"Defendants\") filed an answer to Nunn's amended complaint and asserted that his claims were time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Thereafter, the Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that the statute of limitations had expired for all of Nunn's declaratory claims asserting constitutional violations except the one regarding separation of powers. Initially, the Defendants argued that Nunn's claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   were subject to the one-year statute of limitations applicable to federal civil rights claims set forth\n   in Tennessee Code Annotated section 28-3-104(a). Next, the Defendants argued that Nunn's claims for declaratory relief pursuant to\n   <em>\n    state law\n   </em>\n   were not subject to any particular statute of limitations simply based on their nature as declaratory judgment actions, as declaratory judgment actions are merely a procedural device for asserting substantive claims. Accordingly, the Defendants contended that it was necessary to look to the nature of the underlying substantive claims in order to determine the statute of limitations applicable to the claims for declaratory relief. Because Nunn sought declaratory relief pursuant to state law and asserted his section 1983 claim based on the same underlying alleged violations of his federal constitutional rights, the Defendants claimed that the one-year statute of limitations applicable to his 1983 claim should also apply to his claims for declaratory relief under state law alleging federal constitutional violations. In addition, the Defendants argued that the same one-year statute of limitations for section 1983 actions should likewise apply to Nunn's declaratory claims for violations of the Tennessee Constitution, as they also alleged violations of his civil rights. While also suggesting an earlier date, the Defendants argued that the one-year statute of limitations began to run, at the latest, when Nunn was released from prison on March 28, 2009, and placed under supervision pursuant to the 1999 Sex Offender Directives, as he admittedly signed the necessary paperwork under protest. (Nunn's complaint was filed eighteen months later.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Defendants did not argue that Nunn's claims regarding the UAPA and separation of powers were time-barred. Instead, the Defendants analyzed the substantive merit of these claims and argued that they were entitled to summary judgment on these issues. As an alternative basis for summary judgment, the Defendants also analyzed the substantive merit of the constitutional claims that they asserted were time-barred and argued that they were entitled to summary judgment with regard to the merits of those issues as well. The Defendants submitted numerous documents as exhibits in support of their motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nunn filed a response and cross-motion for partial summary judgment. Nunn conceded that the Sex Offender Directives were imposed on him as he left prison on March 28, 2009, and argued, \"The date from which the statute of limitation must be marked is March 28, 2009.\" However, he claimed that Tennessee's general ten-year statute of limitations applied to his claims for declaratory relief. Nunn acknowledged that he was seeking \"declaratory relief under state declaratory judgment statutes and pendant claims under federal statutes permitting identical declaratory relief.\" Still, he insisted that his section 1983 claim was irrelevant to his \"state law declaratory relief claim, albeit citing federal constitutional violations.\" Nunn also asserted that the \"continuing violation\" doctrine would apply to his section 1983 claim because the enforcement of the conditions of supervision for sex offenders had become increasingly harsh in recent years. Nunn further analyzed each of the substantive claims asserted in his complaint and argued that it was inappropriate to grant summary judgment to the Department based on the merits of those claims. In fact, he asserted that he was entitled to partial summary judgment on his ex post facto claim. Nunn submitted a host of exhibits in support of his response and cross-motion for partial summary judgment, with the exhibits spanning more than three volumes of the technical record on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Following a hearing, the trial court entered an order granting the motion for\n   summary judgment filed by the Defendants and denying the motion for partial summary judgment filed by Nunn. First, the trial court concluded that the one-year statute of limitations provided in Tennessee Code Annotated section 28-3-104(a)(1)(B) applied to Nunn's claims pursuant to section 1983 seeking declaratory relief based on federal constitutional violations. Looking to the substantive nature of the remaining claims, the trial court found that Nunn was seeking declaratory relief under state law based on the same alleged violations of his federal constitutional rights that supported his 1983 claims, \"along with parallel violations of the Tennessee Constitution.\" As such, the trial court concluded that the same one-year statute of limitations applied to all of Nunn's civil rights claims, whether based on the United States or Tennessee Constitution. The court found that Nunn knew he was subject to the 1999 Sex Offender Directives when he was released from prison on March 28, 2009, and therefore, the one-year statute of limitations expired in March 2010. Because Nunn filed his complaint in September 2010, the trial court found that his civil rights claims under the federal and state constitutions were time-barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite Nunn's insistence that all of his constitutional claims were \"as applied\" challenges,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court construed two of Nunn's claims-based on separation of powers and vagueness-as \"facial challenges,\" and the court analyzed the substantive merit of those two claims. It also analyzed Nunn's claims under the UAPA. Finding no merit in any of Nunn's claims regarding these issues, the trial court also entered summary judgment in favor of the Defendants on these claims. As an \"alternative analysis,\" the trial court analyzed the substantive merit of Nunn's ex post facto claim and concluded that he had not demonstrated any ex post facto violation. Nunn timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ISSUES PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nunn raises the following issues, as we perceive them, for review on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   1.

Separation of Powers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In his amended complaint, Nunn alleged that the application of the statutes regarding community supervision for life violates the separation of powers principles set forth in\n   Article II, sections I, II, and III of the Tennessee Constitution. He asserted that the statutes \"impermissibly vest a purely legislative power\" in the Department of Correction, which is an agency of the executive branch of government. Although he recognized that the General Assembly may grant power to an administrative agency to promulgate rules and regulations, Nunn claimed that in this case, the General Assembly impermissibly delegated to an agency its discretion as to \"what the law shall be.\" Again, Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-524(d)(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   (d)(1) A person on community supervision shall be under the jurisdiction, supervision and control of the department of correction in the same manner as a person under parole supervision.\n   <em>\n    The department is authorized on an individual basis to establish such conditions of community supervision as are necessary to protect the public from the person's committing a new sex offense, as well as promoting the rehabilitation of the person.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Nunn's amended complaint alleged that \"[t]he 'individual basis' authorization granted in the above statutory provision vests the [Department of Correction] with the power to create specific supervision criteria and conditions for persons supervised pursuant to the statute.\" Nunn claimed that the conditions of supervision are arbitrarily created, implemented, and modified at the complete discretion of the Department. Because each violation of a condition of community supervision constitutes a separate criminal offense pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-526, Nunn argued that the Department's conditions of supervision \"function entirely and specifically as\n   <em>\n    criminal statutes\n   </em>\n   for which a person can be charged and convicted for specific acts which were entirely outside the contemplation of the General Assembly.\" He asserted that this power effectively conveys to a parole officer the authority to create a penal statute. Thus, Nunn claimed that a \"legislative function\" was impermissibly vested in the TDOC without sufficient standards or guidelines to determine legislative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   When evaluating the constitutionality of a statute, \"we begin with the presumption that an act of the General Assembly is constitutional\" and \"resolve every doubt in favor of the statute's constitutionality.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallaher v.

The defendant argued on appeal that Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-524(d)(1) violates Article II, section 3 of the Tennessee Constitution, providing that the legislative authority of this state shall be vested in the General Assembly. Because of the similarity of the issues presented, we quote from the court's thorough discussion of the separation of powers issue at length:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   Defendant asserts that the General Assembly unconstitutionally delegated its lawmaking authority to the Department of Correction (which by legislation took the place of the Board of Probation and Parole after Defendant was placed on CSL [community supervision for life] ) by enacting Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-524(d)(1). Specifically, Defendant argues that Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-524(d)(1) unlawfully authorized an executive branch entity to define a criminal act and the scope of its applicability. In other words, according to Defendant, by granting an executive branch entity the power to define and create certain conditions of CSL, and by stating that a knowing violation of any such condition is a crime as set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-526, the General Assembly authorized the executive branch to act in a legislative capacity to define and proscribe criminal acts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   In support of his argument, Defendant directs our attention to the wording of Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-526(b)(1), which states, \"(b)(1) If the conduct that is a violation of a condition of community supervision does not constitute a criminal offense, the violation is a Class A misdemeanor.\" Defendant implicitly asserts that a plain reading of this section of the statute clearly shows that under the challenged statute (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-13-524\">\n    Tenn.

Code Ann. 39-13-524 and 39-13-526 are unconstitutionally vague[.]\" In general, he notes that vague statutes do not give fair notice that certain activities may be unlawful and do not set reasonably clear guidelines for law enforcement officials and courts, inviting arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\n   <em>\n    State v. Forbes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10016334\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/918/431/#p447\">\n    918 S.W.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 448 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995). In an attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the\n   <em>\n    statutes\n   </em>\n   , Nunn suggests that several of the individualized\n   <em>\n    conditions\n   </em>\n   set forth in the Sex Offender Directives are vague and subject to differing interpretations by different supervising officers. For example, Nunn points to directives providing that sex offenders such as Nunn may not \"befriend\" any person with minor children, may not possess pornography, and may not work where services are provided to children. He notes that the directives also provide that a sex offender's supervising officer can create conditions of individual supervision deemed appropriate by the officer. As we perceive his argument, Nunn essentially complains that the governing statutes impermissibly leave the details regarding conditions of supervision open to a supervising officer's interpretation and discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   A special condition for an offender's supervision may be added at the discretion of the officer. Over the years during which Nunn has been subject to community supervision, his various supervising officers have differed as to whether he can attend weddings or professional football games. One officer told Nunn that his wife could have alcohol in the house while another said it was not acceptable. Nunn's supervising officers have also differed as to what it means to \"befriend\" someone. Nunn claims that these differences of opinion are especially noteworthy because he can be charged with a criminal offense if he violates a condition of his supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   In our view, the fact that Nunn's supervising officers have differed as to the\n   <em>\n    individualized\n   </em>\n   conditions they have imposed on Nunn over the years does not render the governing statutes unconstitutionally vague. The \"void for vagueness\" doctrine is based on fairness and is intended \" 'only to give 'fair warning' of prohibited conduct.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because the Sex Offender Directives were implemented after the commission of his crimes, he argues that the Sex Offender Directives constitute ex post facto laws as applied to him. Nunn appears to argue that applying the Sex Offender Directives to him implicates two categories of ex post facto laws discussed above. First, he suggests that the Sex Offender Directives have changed his punishment, inflicting a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed. Second, Nunn claims that the TDOC has altered the definition of criminal conduct with its individualized conditions of supervision and created new definitions of behavior that is criminalized, whereas before his conviction these acts were not. Nunn argues that the 1999 Sex Offender Directives essentially \"define crimes\" for him because a violation of the conditions of his supervision can result in incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   We recognize that administrative rules and regulations are not necessarily immune from the ex post facto analysis.

Pursuant to the existing statutes, Nunn was sentenced to community supervision for life with individualized conditions, and he remains under supervision for life with individualized conditions. The guidelines established by the Sex Offender Directives did not increase Nunn's punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was committed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Nunn also complains about the fact that he can now be punished for acts that were not crimes when he committed his offenses. He claims that an ex post facto violation exists because he can now be prosecuted for a criminal offense if he accesses the internet or possesses alcohol, when the conditions of supervision for regular parolees when he committed his offenses did not prohibit these same acts. However, these facts do not implicate the ex post facto clause. Again, the Tennessee Constitution provides that \"laws made for the punishment of\n   <em>\n    acts committed previous to the existence of such laws\n   </em>\n   , and by them only declared criminal, are contrary to the principles of a free Government; wherefore no Ex post facto law shall be made.\" Tenn. Const. art. I, \u00a7 11 (emphasis added). The ex post facto clause would prohibit a \"law that makes an action,\n   <em>\n    done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done\n   </em>\n   , criminal,\"\n   <em>\n    Pruitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12372311\" index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/398/#p415\">\n    510 S.W.3d at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but that is not the situation before us. The Sex Offender Directives and Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-526 do not make any action criminal that was innocently taken by Nunn before the passing of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    State v.

As such, the fact that the defendant's original conviction was one of several elements required in order to be convicted for the offense of failure to report to the sex offender registry was \"of no consequence for an ex post facto analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11908507\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/1079/#p1088\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same reasoning applies here. If Nunn is eventually convicted of the offense of knowingly violating a condition of his community supervision,\n   it will be as punishment for a separate offense taking place after adoption of the Sex Offender Directives. The Department of Correction has not impermissibly altered the definition of criminal conduct in violation of the ex post facto clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     E.

For Counts 13 and 14, his amended complaint alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   COUNT THIRTEEN\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   92.

His brief claims that the \"rules and orders promulgated by the TDOC to which the Petitioner is subject were not adopted in conformity with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act.\" Nunn mentions that the Sex Offender Directives were created by the Sex Offender Treatment Board and enforced by the Board of Probation and Parole before the Department of Correction acquired jurisdiction over them. He then summarily declares, \"It is this TDOC adoption and promulgation that was in direct contravention of the Administrative Procedures Act and thus the directives are void.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   We decline to consider the merits of this issue. Nunn does not specify which \"rules and orders\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   he seeks to challenge or how they fail to comply with any particular provision of the UAPA. \"The UAPA requires a state agency in Tennessee to follow uniform procedures when making rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Abdur'Rahman v.

He reasoned that \"because we are dealing with a 10-year statute of limitation for declaratory judgments involving the Department of Correction, [his] suit filed September 29, 2010 was timely since it was less than two years since he had been released from prison when the directives were applied to him.\" Nunn has continued to measure the limitations period \"from the date the correctional officer presented him with the conditions he was to endure for the remainder of his life\" on March 28, 2009. The trial court found that the statute of limitations commenced on March 28, 2009.

After repeatedly arguing throughout his brief that the statute of limitations commenced on March 28, 2009, and presenting the aforementioned issue, Nunn appeared to change course. His brief stated, \"The issues here assume the operative date for the communicant of the statute of limitations is March 28, 2009 when Petitioner was placed on CSL [community supervision for life] under the jurisdiction of the TBOPP.\" Nunn then briefly suggested that the statute of limitations may have \"commenced anew\" either when the Department of Correction assumed jurisdiction over community supervision for life in 2012 or when it implemented regulations in 2014. However, Nunn cited no authority for this argument and did not cite to any location in the record where he pursued this argument before the trial court. We decline to consider this late-raised alternative argument because it was not listed as an issue presented for review in Nunn's brief. \" 'Courts have consistently held that issues must be included in the Statement of Issues Presented for Review required by Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure 27(a)(4).
