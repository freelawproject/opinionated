Baxley reasons that, because he was convicted of the predicate DWI offense without the assistance of counsel, the predicate DWI is void, citing\n   <em>\n    Gideon v.

Based on the Hunt County judgment, Baxley asks us to find that the conviction \"on [its] face raise[s] a presumption [he] was denied his right to counsel in the [Hunt County offense] proceeding, and therefore that his conviction was void.\" Accordingly, we must decide whether the wording of the Hunt County judgment is equivalent to the Tennessee judgment at issue in\n   <em>\n    Burgett\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To begin with, the Hunt County judgment at issue in this case recites that \"the Defendant and Defendant's attorney, as stated above, were also present.\" Although it does not name defense counsel, it does not contain the specific statement found in the Tennessee conviction at issue in\n   <em>\n    Burgett\n   </em>\n   : \"Came the Assistant Attorney-General for the State and the Defendant in proper person\n   <em>\n    and without Counsel.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12044452\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/269/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis supplied).

The appellate record in this case does not establish on its face that Baxley was indigent or that he was not represented by counsel at the time of the 2008 Hunt County conviction, and he did not establish those facts by other testimony or evidence.

Wainwright\n    </em>\n    established the rule that the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the States by virtue of the Fourteenth, making it unconstitutional to try a person for a felony in a state court unless he had a lawyer or had validly waived one.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The State argues that Baxley has waived his complaint because he did not preserve it in the trial court. Preservation of error is systemic and a first-level appellate court should ordinarily review the issue on its own motion; this review, though, must not be overly technical in its examination of whether error was preserved.\n    <em>\n     Archie v. State\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311861\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/695/#p698\">\n     221 S.W.3d 695\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 698 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Generally, one must present the trial court with a timely, proper objection in order to preserve potential errors for appellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1. However,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    [t]he rules that require a timely and specific objection, motion, or complaint do not apply to two relatively small categories of errors: violations of \"rights which are waivable only\" and denials of \"absolute systemic requirements.\" Such errors may be raised for the first time on appeal. ... Examples of rights that are waivable-only include the rights to the assistance of counsel, the right to trial by jury, and a right of appointed counsel to have ten days of trial preparation which a statute specifically made waivable-only.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     Aldrich v. State\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9127830\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/104/890/#p895\">\n     104 S.W.3d 890\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 895 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (footnotes omitted). Because Baxley argues that the Hunt County judgment is void due to the denial of assistance of counsel during that proceeding, he asserts a complaint that cannot be waived by merely failing to object at trial. Accordingly, we will proceed to the merits of Baxley's argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    A predicate offense of operating an aircraft, watercraft, or amusement ride may also be used to enhance the offense level.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049.09\">\n     Tex.
