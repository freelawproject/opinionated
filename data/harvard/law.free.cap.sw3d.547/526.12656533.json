Roth Jr. and Erik Hermes (hereinafter \"the taxpayers\") bring this appeal from the Campbell Circuit Court's grant of summary judgment to the Campbell County Library Board of Trustees (hereinafter \"the Board\"). The primary issue is whether the holding of an opinion (hereinafter \"the Opinion\") of the Court of Appeals, which harmonized statutes relating to public library ad valorem tax rates, is to be applied retroactively or prospectively only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Campbell Cty.

App. 2015),\n   <em>\n    disc. review denied\n   </em>\n   (Dec. 10, 2015), a panel of this Court addressed whether public libraries in Kentucky, created by petition pursuant to Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 173.710\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , should assess the library's ad valorem tax rate in accordance with KRS 132.023 or KRS 173.790. The underlying class action, brought by a group of taxpayers in the Campbell Circuit Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   sought recovery of what they maintained were unlawfully excessive ad valorem taxes levied by the Campbell County Library Board. According to the taxpayers, the Board had erroneously calculated its ad valorem rate each year according to the provisions of KRS 132.023, which allows a taxing district to increase revenue from ad valorem taxes up to four percent without triggering a reconsideration by the district or voter recall referendum, when in fact it should have applied KRS 173.790, which only allows an increase in the tax rate via a petition signed by fifty-one percent of duly qualified voters in the district. The circuit court entered summary judgment for the taxpayers, ruling that the Board is required to comply with KRS 173.790, as the more specific statute, in setting its annual tax rate. The Board appealed. The Court of Appeals panel reversed the circuit court, concluding that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   KRS 132.023 and KRS 173.790 are both applicable to ad valorem taxing rates of a library taxing district formed by petition under KRS 173.720 and can be harmoniously interpreted to complement each other. KRS 132.023 generally controls the ad valorem tax rate assessed by a library taxing district formed by petition; however, KRS 173.790 is triggered if the library seeks to increase revenue from ad valorem taxes above 4 percent of the revenue generated from the compensating tax rate as set forth in KRS 132.023(1) and (3). Our construction of KRS 132.023 and KRS 173.790 gives effect to both statutes and honors what we believe the General Assembly intended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Campbell Cty.

The taxpayers filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The circuit court entered an agreed order limiting briefing solely to the issue of whether the Opinion should be applied retroactively or prospectively only. Following a hearing, the circuit court entered an order in which it applied the three-factor test for retroactivity set forth in\n   <em>\n    Chevron Oil Co. v.

The taxpayers filed a motion to amend, alter or vacate the order. The motion was denied and this appeal by the taxpayers followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The taxpayers raise four arguments: (1) that the circuit court order is contrary to the Opinion and violates the law-of-the-case doctrine; (2) federal due process and Kentucky law require the taxpayers to be provided with meaningful retroactive relief; (3) the order renders KRS 173.790 ineffective for periods prior to the Opinion, thereby violating Kentucky's separation of powers doctrine and; (4) even if prospective-only application was possible in this case, the circuit court erred in finding it justified here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Because the Opinion does not expressly state that its holding is to be given prospective-only application, they contend the holding must apply both retroactively and prospectively, and, in the absence of any petition for rehearing or modification by the Board, this retroactive application has become the law of the case. \"The law-of-the-case doctrine describes a principle which requires obedience to appellate court decisions in all subsequent stages of litigation.

An appellate court might direct a trial court, such as by ordering a new trial or the dismissal of charges. With such a mandate, the trial court's authority is only broad enough to carry out that specific direction. Alternatively, and as is very often the case when the appellate court reverses a trial court, it simply grants the trial court the discretion to conduct further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion. In such cases, ... the general principle is stated as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court may take such action, not inconsistent with the decision of the appellate court, as in its judgment law and justice require, where the case has been remanded generally without directions, or for further proceedings, or for further proceedings in accordance, or not inconsistent, with the opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   5 C.J.S.\n   <em>\n    Appeal and Error\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 978 at 481-83 (1993)\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pieck v.

App. 1991), we review the application of the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   factors for an abuse of discretion. \"An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court enters a decision that is arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair, or unsupported by sound legal principles.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321690\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/320/138/#p141\">\n    320 S.W.3d 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141 (Ky. App. 2010) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As to the first\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   factor, the circuit court found that there was no clear, past precedent regarding the proper statute to use in calculating the tax rate, and that the Board was given conflicting guidance by the Office of the Attorney General and the Kentucky Department for Library and Archives (KDLA). The taxpayers argue that the Board did not in fact rely on this guidance and actually disregarded the recommendation of the KDLA contained in the Kentucky Public Library Trustee Manual, which advised that tax districts could increase their tax rate significantly by the same method by which they were established; hence, those districts established by petition under KRS 173.720 could only increase their rate by petition. The taxpayers also argue that informal guidance from the KDLA and opinions of the Attorney General do not constitute \"legal precedent,\" and that the plain language of KRS 173.790 was the sole, clear past \"legal\n   precedent\" expressly applicable to library districts organized by petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The fact that a panel of this Court wrote a twenty-two-page Opinion reversing two well-reasoned circuit court opinions and expressly stated that the library districts acted in good faith in accordance with the directions of the Executive Branch for over thirty years supports the circuit court's finding that there was no clear past precedent on this issue and that this was also an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed. Thus, the Opinion meets the first\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   factor in that it established a new principle of law meriting prospective application only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In respect to the second factor, the circuit court found that the Opinion's harmonization of the two statutes was intended to avoid adversely affecting the libraries which had used KRS 132.023 in setting their ad valorem tax rates, and that consequently retroactive application of the new rule would not further its operation. The taxpayers argue that this approach confuses the purpose of the Opinion with the purpose of the harmonized rule itself. They contend that the common purpose and effect of both the harmonized statutes is to protect taxpayers, not library districts, and that a prospective application frustrates the purpose of the new rule by legitimizing and perpetuating tax increases made in 2000, 2003 and 2004 without a voters' petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But the Opinion construes KRS 173.790\"as a method available to a library taxing district seeking to increase the revenue from ad valorem taxes over 4 percent of the revenue generated from the compensating tax rate as permitted by KRS 132.023.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell Cty. Library Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6832330\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/475/40/#p41\">\n    475 S.W.3d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the legislature provided library taxing districts with a special means to increase their revenue apart from KRS 132.023, which suggests a strong interest in ensuring that the public libraries were always adequately funded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Thirdly and finally, the circuit court determined that retroactive application of the decision would cause \"substantial inequitable results\" because it might require the refund of taxes that would severely deplete the resources of numerous public libraries. This conclusion was founded on the Opinion, which expressed serious concerns about the adverse consequences on eighty library districts, in existence for over thirty years, if the original decision of the Campbell Circuit Court holding that KRS 173.790 was the controlling statute was allowed to stand. The appellants characterize the circuit court's conclusion as ill-founded because there is nothing in the record to show that any library district other than the Campbell Board has ever sought to increase its tax rate by more than four percent without a petition of the voters. According to the taxpayers, their research shows only the Campbell Board has ever violated KRS 173.790 as harmonized by the Opinion. They emphasize that prospective-only application will allow the Board not only to retain excessive tax revenues improperly but to maintain those inflated rates by means of a petition of voters. Even if we accept the taxpayers' claim that retroactive application of the Opinion will impact solely the Campbell County Library Board and no other, the Board maintains that that retroactive application would require the refund of millions of dollars already spent on facilities, books, staff and other library operations. Under the circumstances, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the evidence and deciding that retroactivity would lead to substantial inequitable results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Campbell Circuit Court granting summary judgment and the order denying the motion to amend, alter or vacate are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ALL CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    A similar action was also brought by a group of taxpayers in Kenton County. The Kenton Circuit Court ruled that KRS 173.790 was the controlling statute and that the Kenton County Library Board had improperly relied upon KRS 132.023 to increase the ad valorem tax rate. The circuit court denied the plaintiffs a refund for \"overpaid\" ad valorem taxes. In the first appeal to this Court, the Kenton County case was consolidated with the Campbell County case. The Kenton County plaintiffs are not parties to the present appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
