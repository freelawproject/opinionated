App. S.D. 2016). We include only those facts necessary to our disposition, and as necessary for context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 22, 1995, Green broke into an apartment occupied by two sisters, R.E. and S.E., who were staying with their brother, N.E., who was asleep in another room. Green robbed the sisters, threatened to kill them with a gun, and sexually assaulted them. Green also stole money from N.E. A pair of shorts, a pair of underwear, and a bed sheet were collected at the scene and tested positive for the presence of semen. Even though police had DNA, they were unable to identify the perpetrator until July 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July 2006, Springfield police received a \"hit\" from a national DNA indexing system, indicating that the DNA profile developed from evidence seized at the scene was associated with Green's DNA profile recently entered into the system in Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In early August 2006, a Springfield detective traveled to Illinois and served a search warrant on Green to obtain a buccal swab for further DNA analysis. Green was not arrested at that time. At the end of August 2006, the DNA analysis revealed\n   that Green could not be eliminated as a match when his DNA profile was compared to the DNA profile from the shorts and a bed sheet obtained from the crime scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 27, 2006, a felony complaint was issued in Greene County against Green, but Green was already incarcerated in Illinois as a result of separate pending charges there. On September 27, 2007, while still incarcerated in Illinois, Green filed a \"Speedy Trial Demand and Motion for Writ of Habeas Corpus\" in his Greene County case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Green was located and arrested on March 9, 2009, and charged by amended information with one count of attempted forcible rape, two counts of forcible sodomy, and three counts of first-degree robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 25, 2010, Green filed a \"Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Defendant's Right to Speedy Trial\" asserting violations of \"the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, as well as Article One, Sections 10, 18(a), and 21 of the Missouri State Constitution and [section] 545.780[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At an evidentiary hearing on October 12, 2010, Green testified as to how the length of his pre-trial incarceration had personally affected him, including the possibility of termination of his parental rights to his children in Illinois, the damage to his relationship with his children, his loss of 60 pounds due to stress, the loss of a business, and the loss of all of his possessions. Green stated his goal in filing his demand for speedy trial was to get the Illinois and Missouri cases \"going at the same time[,]\" so he could get concurrent time or credit for the time he had spent in jail. The trial court denied Green's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following a bench trial commencing on October 19, 2010, Green was convicted of one count of forcible rape, two counts of statutory sodomy, and three counts of first degree robbery. The trial court sentenced Green to consecutive life sentences on each count. Following the motion court's denial of Green's post-trial motion, this Court affirmed Green's convictions and sentences on direct appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 26, 2012, Green timely filed his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   \"Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct the Judgment and Sentence,\" and appointed counsel timely filed an amended motion thereafter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended motion\n   asserted, in relevant part, that trial counsel failed to \"adduce evidence supporting [Green]'s motion to dismiss as to why he was prejudiced by the delay in his case going to trial.\" Green asserted trial counsel would not allow him to assist in trial preparations, and that there were three missing pieces of evidence that \"could have been used as a valuable source of impeachment,\"-the initial 911 tape of a call made at 4:30 a.m. on December 22, 1995, and two medical reports of the physical examinations of S.E. and R.E. Green \"believe[d] the absence of this evidence prejudiced his defense because it could have been used as a valuable source of impeachment[,]\" and that had this \"evidence been adduced at the hearing, ... there [was] a reasonable probability that the trial court would have granted the Motion to Dismiss or in the alternative, the Court of Appeals would have found prejudice to [Green]'s defense resulting in a different outcome.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   An evidentiary hearing was held on January 21, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Green testified that there was an unconstitutional delay in this matter that caused various problems in his defense at trial. Green testified that the delay caused certain pieces of favorable evidence-specifically, for use in impeachment-went missing during the delays, including: (1) \"police reports,\" (2) the \"DNA analytical report,\" (3) \"the fact that they had three different people as suspects for this case,\" (4) \"they didn't preserve any other DNA for further testing[,]\" (5) the lack of a \"differential extraction to show that there was no mixture\" of his and the victim's DNA, (6) there was \"no video or no paper that I signed saying that I confessed\" to the detective, (7) no notes from the detective's interview which the detective destroyed afterwards, (8) the 911 call tapes, (9) six crime scene photos, (10) medical reports of the victims, specifically, the triage notes of S.E., (11) N.E.'s post assault report was missing, (12) the FBI sexual assault questionnaire was missing, and (13) and the lab technician's report was missing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Green testified he believed that were this evidence available at trial, the outcome would have been different. Green further testified that defense counsel failed to adduce evidence as to these harms in the evidentiary hearing on Green's speedy-trial motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Green stated that although defense counsel gave him several opportunities to testify about potential prejudice at the motion to dismiss hearing, he was restricted\n   in that testimony due to defense counsel instructing him to testify to matters only as dictated by defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 23, 2017, the motion court entered its \"Order Denying [Green]'s Motion to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Judgment and Sentence under Rule 29.15.\" The motion court specifically found that Green's testimony-the evidentiary basis of his Rule 29.15 claim-was not credible. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In one point on appeal, Green argues that the motion court clearly erred in denying his Rule 29.15 motion because the motion court's \"rationale for finding [ ] Green not credible overlooked material facts and law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court will affirm a motion court's judgment denying postconviction relief unless its 'findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous.'
