The trial\n   court granted summary judgment in favor of DSC on Arcese's claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Following a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment in favor of DSC and awarded DSC attorney's fees. Arcese appealed from the trial court's judgment, and this Court reversed the trial court's award of attorney's fees and court costs to DSC.\n   <em>\n    Arcese v.
