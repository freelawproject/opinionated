Frierson, II, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal arises from the denial of parole to an inmate by the Tennessee Board of Parole (\"the Board\"). The inmate was convicted in 1990 of first degree murder and first degree burglary. The Board denied parole on the basis that the inmate's release at the time of the hearing would depreciate the seriousness of the crime for which he was convicted. The inmate filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Davidson County Chancery Court (\"trial court\"), alleging violations of due process and equal protection. The trial court denied relief, determining that no grounds existed to disturb the Board's decision. Discerning no reversible error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Factual and Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Billy Joe Greenwood is an inmate in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Correction, currently housed at the Morgan County Correctional Complex. In 1990, Mr. Greenwood was convicted of first degree murder and first degree burglary. He was sentenced to life in prison for the murder conviction and six years of incarceration for the burglary conviction, with such sentences to be served concurrently.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On direct appeal, Mr. Greenwood's convictions were affirmed by the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, which recited the following facts underlying Mr. Greenwood's original convictions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The record establishes that in April 1989, the defendant was quite distraught over his recent divorce from Alice Evonne Dishman and resulting separation from his young daughter. While in this troubled state of mind, the defendant began to consume excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages and drugs. During the day of 22 April 1989, he drank approximately two cases of beer, smoked marijuana, and ingested cocaine and valium.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   That evening, Greenwood broke into the home of Sherry Dishman, Alice Evonne Dishman's sister, and took a loaded .30-.30 caliber rifle. Rifle in hand, he sat on the hood of his car in front of her home waiting for his former wife to stop by.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Sherry Dishman arrived first. She was accompanied by a male friend, Charles Haney. They did not observe Greenwood, and he permitted them to pass without incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A short time later, David Dishman drove up, and Greenwood confronted him. After saying to Dishman, \"You ain't Evonne, you son-of-a-bitch,\" he shot Dishman in the stomach. Leaving Dishman on the ground where he had fallen, the defendant went to the front door of the home, kicked it in, and entered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Once inside, he was met by Sherry Dishman and Haney. The rifle discharged as the three of them struggled over it. Unable to cock the rifle again, the defendant produced a knife and threatened to use it to kill them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Haney and Dishman were able to eject the defendant. Outside again, the defendant noticed that David Dishman was attempting to stand. Dishman reached out to the defendant, called his name, and apologized for whatever he had done to him. In response, the defendant said that they would die together\n   and thereupon shot Dishman a second time. Dishman later succumbed to these wounds, and the defendant was arrested two days later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. Mar. 3, 1992) (reinstated op.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Tennessee Board of Parole records, a parole hearing regarding Mr. Greenwood was held on July 14, 2009, following which the Board denied parole upon finding that Mr. Greenwood's release from custody at that time would have depreciated the seriousness of his crime. The Board recommended that Mr. Greenwood complete or participate in \"anger [management], substance abuse [treatment], criminal thinking, etc. programs,\" and a review hearing was scheduled for July 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This second parole hearing, held on July 23, 2015, is at issue now on appeal. Mr. Greenwood spoke during the hearing and requested that the Board release him from custody on parole. Evidence presented at the hearing included the factual circumstances concerning the criminal offense for which Mr. Greenwood is incarcerated, in addition to signatures supporting and in opposition to parole; oral statements in support of parole presented by Mr. Greenwood, two prison employees, and a friend of Mr. Greenwood's; certificates of completion from various programs in which Mr. Greenwood had participated while incarcerated, including Change Companies Residential Drug Abuse Program, Victim Impact Program, Pro-Social Life Skills Program, and Behavioral Therapeutic Community; letters both in support of and in opposition to Mr. Greenwood's release on parole; and oral statements from Alice Dishman, Sherry Dishman, Charles Haney, and a representative of the district attorney's office in opposition to Mr. Greenwood's release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following the parole hearing, the hearing officer, Board member Tim Gobble, informed Mr. Greenwood that he was voting to deny parole, having concluded that the seriousness of Mr. Greenwood's crime would be depreciated by his release at that time. When informing Mr. Greenwood of his recommendation, Mr. Gobble stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Greenwood, after considering the totality of the circumstances here and your file, there [are] some things I want to commend you on. I do want to commend you on your institutional behavior and your efforts there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I want to commend you on your program participation and your efforts there with your substance abuse and addiction issues and your admitted anger issues that you were no doubt dealing with at the point of this offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   But I also cannot overcome at this time the seriousness of this offense where a young man was ruthlessly and needlessly gunned down by you not once, but twice, and the 18-year-old young man had no involvement in anything at all with what you were angry about, and had a full life ahead of him that was taken away from him senselessly and needlessly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   And you having served less than 30 years of a life conviction prevents me from voting to parole you at this time because of the seriousness of the offense in which you were convicted of.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   To do so at this time would depreciate the seriousness of the crime of which you've been convicted and promote disrespect for the law. So my vote is to deny your parole and review it again in July of 2020. That's five years from now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I do want to commend you on the efforts that you are making towards rehabilitation. I think you are showing some progress. I want to see that continue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I appreciate the comments that the prison officials have made, and I know they don't do that lightly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   And so I think you have made some strides. But again, the seriousness of this offense just prevents [me from] voting to parole you at this time, having served less than 30 years of a life sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Three additional Board members adopted Mr. Gobble's reasoning and voted unanimously to deny parole. On August 4, 2015, the Board provided Mr. Greenwood with written notice that parole had been denied and that his next parole hearing would be scheduled for July 2020. Mr. Greenwood filed an administrative appeal with the Board, which was ultimately denied. Following a review of the Board's file and an audio recording of the hearing, the Board reasoned that Mr. Greenwood's allegation that significant procedural errors had occurred at the parole hearing was unsubstantiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Greenwood subsequently filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the trial court. Upon the Board's notice of no opposition to the issuance of a writ of certiorari, the trial court granted Mr. Greenwood's petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the trial court, Mr. Greenwood alleged that the Board's denial of parole violated \"his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law under the United States Constitution and article one sections eight and nine of the Tennessee Constitution.\" Mr. Greenwood also alleged that his equal protection rights were violated, arguing that other inmates who were similarly situated had been released on parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court subsequently entered an order dismissing Mr. Greenwood's petition upon finding that \"[t]he declination of parole based upon seriousness of the offense is supported by evidence in the hearing transcript in this case, describing [Mr. Greenwood's] murder of a defenseless eighteen year old who was not involved in the dispute between [Mr. Greenwood] and his ex-wife.\" The court concluded that \"the Board's final decision to decline parole based on the seriousness of the offense was proper pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-503\">\n    Tenn.

Issue Presented\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Greenwood presents one issue on appeal, which we have restated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Whether the trial court erred by denying relief to Mr. Greenwood upon his petition for writ of certiorari.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   III. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Inmates may use the common law writ of certiorari to seek review of decisions made by prison disciplinary boards, parole eligibility review boards, and other similar tribunals.\n   <em>\n    Willis v.

The common law writ of certiorari has been used to \"remedy (1) fundamentally illegal rulings; (2) proceedings inconsistent with essential legal requirements; (3) proceedings that effectively deny a party his or her day in court; (4) decisions beyond the lower tribunal's authority; and (5) plain and palpable abuses of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097794\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/113/706/#p712\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The decision of whether to grant or deny parole to an inmate is vested with the Board, not the courts.\n   <em>\n    Hopkins v.

The Board subsequently delivered its official decision to deny parole to Mr. Greenwood on August 4, 2015, providing as reason for denial that Mr. Greenwood's release from prison at that time \"would depreciate the seriousness of the crime of which [Mr. Greenwood] stands convicted or promote disrespect of the law.\" Upon our review of the record, we determine that the trial court correctly found that the Board provided a legally sufficient reason for its denial of Mr. Greenwood's parole.

Although the Board was permitted to consider whether Mr. Greenwood would be able to successfully reintegrate into society as a factor when making its parole determination, the Board was not required to consider this factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Comp.%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%201100\">\n    Tenn.

At the conclusion of the hearing, Mr. Gobble informed Mr. Greenwood of his vote and recommendation to the Board that parole be denied but commended Mr. Greenwood on his \"institutional behavior and [his] efforts there,\" specifically mentioning Mr. Greenwood's participation and efforts in addressing \"substance abuse and addiction issues and [his] admitted anger issues.\" According to Mr. Gobble, however, when making his decision to recommend that parole be denied, he was unable to \"overcome at this time the seriousness of this offense where a young man was ruthlessly and needlessly gunned down by [Mr. Greenwood], not once, but twice.\" Pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 40-35-503(b), the Board was permitted to deny parole based on the seriousness of Mr. Greenwood's crime. Accordingly, Mr. Greenwood's argument that the Board's decision was arbitrary, illegal, or fraudulent because it did not consider his ability to reintegrate into society is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Mr. Greenwood further argues that no evidence supports the Board's decision to deny parole. However, upon a review of the record, we disagree. In writ of certiorari proceedings, a court does not have the authority to reweigh the evidence presented to the Board or substitute its\n   own judgment for that of the Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Ct. App. 2011). However, if no material evidence exists to support the Board's decision, it is arbitrary or illegal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316693\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/353/121/#p124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Courts have consistently determined that the Board is permitted to deny parole if the Board concludes that the inmate's release on parole at that time would depreciate the seriousness of the crime for which he or she stands convicted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brennan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12375219\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/871/#p873\">\n    512 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   875 ;\n   <em>\n    Arnold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11890726\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/956/478/\">\n    956 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   482 ;\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457730\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/60/79/#p82\">\n    60 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   83 ;\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

App. 1999). Ergo, the seriousness of the crime constitutes material evidence upon which the Board may rely to deny parole. In fact, Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 40-35-503(b)(2) specifically requires the Board to deny parole when the inmate's release would depreciate the seriousness of the inmate's crime or promote disrespect for the law. Although Mr. Gobble commended Mr. Greenwood for his efforts during his incarceration, he and the Board members were unable to recommend release on parole at that time. We discern no error concerning the basis on which the Board made its decision and determine that material evidence existed to support the Board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Additionally, Mr. Greenwood argues that the Board's decision to deny parole is a \"fundamentally improper re-consideration of the original sentence.\" According to Mr. Greenwood, his sentence \"\n   <em>\n    intrinsically incorporated\n   </em>\n   the minimum number of years the sentencing judge and the statute demanded.\" He argues that \"[a]fter the minimum passed, the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   rational considerations and factors that should be considered ... were the conduct of [Mr. Greenwood] during his confinement and his likelihood of a proper reintegration into society\" (emphasis in original).

In\n   <em>\n    Arnold\n   </em>\n   , the Court determined that \"consideration of the seriousness of the offense at both sentencing and parole does not violate double jeopardy principles because denial of parole does not constitute 'another' punishment, but rather perpetuates a validly imposed sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11890726\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/956/478/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Kell v.

Inasmuch as Mr. Greenwood argues that his equal protection rights were violated by the Board and that the Board's decision to deny parole was discriminatory and thereby arbitrary or illegal, we determine that his equal protection argument should be considered.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202097548\">\n    2007 WL 2097548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5. Because the issue is one of law, we will consider whether Mr. Greenwood's equal protection rights were violated by the Board's decision to deny parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Mr. Greenwood claims that \"similarly situated individuals were actually granted parole by the same board members in\n   cases which satisfied less of a positive candidate than he.\" Despite Mr. Greenwood's conclusory allegations that he was treated differently than other inmates, the record before us does not contain any evidence to support his argument. Mr. Greenwood has failed to present the trial court or this Court with any specific examples which would have supported the existence of any similarly situated individuals to whom he refers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that Mr. Greenwood was denied parole while other similarly situated inmates were granted parole, we determine that the Board had a rational basis for denying parole. We review the Board's decision for rationality, and the Board's decision will be upheld unless the Board lacks a rational basis for its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison v.

We note that for purposes of equal protection, inmates are not a suspect class, such as race, nationality, or alienage, which would mandate strict scrutiny, or a quasi-suspect class, such as gender or illegitimacy, which would require heightened scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , 514 S.W.3d at 720 ;\n   <em>\n    Gallaher v.

Furthermore, because inmates do not have a fundamental right or liberty interest in parole, strict scrutiny would not apply in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-503\">\n    Tenn.

Following a hearing, the Board in this instance considered the evidence presented and determined that parole should be denied due to the seriousness of Mr. Greenwood's crime. The Board's decision to deny Mr. Greenwood's parole based on its determination that releasing Mr. Greenwood on parole would depreciate the seriousness of the crime for which he was convicted and promote disrespect of the law was a rational basis for denying parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Because the Board had a rational basis for its decision denying Mr. Greenwood's parole, the Board's decision was not illegal or arbitrary. Therefore, although the trial court should have considered Mr. Greenwood's equal protection claim insofar as it was a claim of discrimination that if successful, would have rendered the Board's decision illegal or arbitrary, we determine any error in this regard to be harmless because Mr. Greenwood's equal protection argument is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   VI. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the trial court denying relief to Mr. Greenwood in this matter.
