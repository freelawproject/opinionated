After a pedestrian was struck and killed by a public bus in Fort Worth, her daughter sued the Fort\n   Worth Transportation Authority (FWTA), its two independent contractors, and the bus driver under the TTCA. We must decide three issues: (1) whether the TTCA's damages cap applies individually or cumulatively for independent contractors performing essential governmental functions; (2) whether an employee of an independent contractor performing essential governmental functions is protected by the TTCA's election-of-remedies provision; and (3) whether the transit defendants should have been awarded attorney's fees arising out of interpleader. We hold that the damages cap applies cumulatively when, as here, an independent contractor performed essential governmental functions of a transportation authority. We also hold that the TTCA's election-of-remedies provision extends to cover an employee of an independent contractor performing essential governmental functions. Finally, we hold that the transit defendants are not entitled to attorney's fees. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court's judgment in favor of FWTA with respect to issues one and two. We affirm the court of appeals' denial of attorney's fees and remand of the case for a trial on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Judith Peterson was walking across a street in downtown Fort Worth when she was struck and killed by a public bus driven by Leshawn Vaughn. Vaughn was an employee of McDonald Transit, Inc. (MTI), a subsidiary of McDonald Transit Associates, Inc. (MTA). Both MTA and MTI are independent contractors that operate Fort Worth's bus transportation system. Peterson's daughter, Michele Rodriguez, brought a wrongful death suit against Vaughn, FWTA, MTA, and MTI (collectively, the \"Transit Defendants\"). Rodriguez pled a single count of negligence against all defendants collectively, asserting a variety of acts or omissions, including: \"making an improper and unsafe turn,\" \"driving at an unsafe and excessive speed,\" \"negligently hiring ... Defendant Vaughn,\" and \"[f]ailing to establish and maintain safe and appropriate bus routes.\" These allegations are not allocated among or attributed to particular defendants, and with the exception of those allegations that clearly refer to the actions of the bus driver, discerning which defendants are alleged to have committed which acts or omissions is difficult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FWTA is a regional transportation authority under Texas Transportation Code chapter 452, and it provides public transportation services, including bus routes, to areas under its control. TEX. TRANSP. CODE \u00a7 452.001(1). As such, FWTA performs \"essential governmental functions\" and its exercise of power under chapter 452 \"is a matter of public necessity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 452.052. The Transportation Code permits an authority to \"contract for the operation of all or a part of the public transportation system by[ ] an operator.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 452.056(a)(3). Pursuant to this provision, FWTA contracted with MTI and MTA to provide management and operational services for its fixed-route bus operations. The contract specifically provided that \"MTA and MTI are independent contractors of the FWTA\" for purposes of section 452.056(d) of the Transportation Code, and that \"[a]ll persons employed by MTA and MTI ... are employees, agents, subcontractors or consultants of MTA and/or MTI, and not of the FWTA.\" Section 452.056(d) limits the liability of a private contractor performing the function of an authority under chapter 452 \"to the extent that the authority or entity would be liable if the authority or entity itself were performing the function.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 452.056(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under the contract, MTA agreed to furnish a Director of Transportation Services\n   of FWTA's Operating Functions, who would be \"responsible for the overall management and operation of all components of the FWTA's Operating Functions.\" MTI, a wholly owned subsidiary of MTA, agreed to carry out FWTA's operating functions and \"employ all necessary and appropriate personnel ... including drivers.\" The contract also provided that MTI would \"procure all other goods and services reasonably necessary and useful to manage and operate the FWTA's public transportation system in accordance with the policies, procedures, budgets and other directives of the President of the FWTA\"; that \"[a]ll contractual obligations which are to be entered into or assumed by MTI personnel on behalf of the FWTA shall be in the name of the FWTA\"; and that \"[a]ll contractual obligations and related liability entered into on behalf of the FWTA in accordance with this paragraph shall become and remain valid obligations of FWTA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rodriguez alleged in her pleadings that the Transit Defendants operated as a joint venture. Accordingly, she asserted that FWTA, MTA, and MTI were vicariously liable for Vaughn's negligence, if proven, under respondeat superior. Specifically, her pleadings included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3.06 Hereinafter in this Petition, all Defendants other than Vaughn may be collectively referred to as \"The [Transit] Defendants.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3.07 At all material times and in all material respects, The [Transit] Defendants owned, operated, managed, and/or controlled the bus transportation system operating in Fort Worth, Texas, commonly known as The T.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-17\">\n   3.08 Upon current information and belief, The [Transit] Defendants were engaged in a joint enterprise or joint venture to operate and/or maintain such bus transportation system, and each had the actual right to control the business operations, policies, procedures, and activities of such system. Additionally and/or alternatively, they comprised and constituted a single business enterprise in such regard. Additionally and/or alternatively, they were managers, vice principals, agents, mere tools, instrumentalities, departments, and/or alter egos of each other or of one or another of them with regard to operation of such system. They are vicariously and/or jointly and/or severally liable for the conduct of one another in such regard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n   3.09 Additionally and/or alternatively, at all material times, Defendant Vaughn was an agent, servant, and employee of MTA and/or MTI and was acting within the course and scope of her authority as such agent, servant and employee. Accordingly, MTA and MTI are liable to [Rodriguez] for her conduct under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    Respondeat Superior\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rodriguez sought declaratory relief that (1) FWTA was liable for the conduct of MTA, MTI, and Vaughn; and (2) pursuant to the Transit Defendants' contract, \"whatever liability may be incurred by Vaughn-as an employee of [MTI] and/or [MTA]-constitutes part of the operating expenses of FWTA and shall be paid by FWTA, and that Vaughn is a third-party-beneficiary of such contract in such regard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As an authority under the Transportation Code, FWTA is considered a \"governmental unit\" for purposes of the TTCA. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.001(3)(D). Generally, governmental units are entitled to immunity unless it has been waived.\n   <em>\n    Reata Constr. Corp. v. City of Dall.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409239\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/371/#p374\">\n    197 S.W.3d 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 374-75 (Tex. 2006). Under the TTCA, the Legislature has waived the immunity of a governmental\n   unit, such as FWTA, for personal injury or death proximately caused by the negligence of an employee acting within the scope of employment if the \"death arises from the operation or use of a motor-driven vehicle.\" TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.021(1)(A). However, the liability arising out of this waiver of immunity is \"limited to money damages in a maximum amount of $100,000 for each person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409239\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/371/#p374\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.023(b). Recognizing that a regional transportation authority might delegate some or all of the operation of its public transportation system to one or more independent contractors, the Legislature contemplated liability for such a situation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n   A private operator who contracts with an authority under this chapter is not a public entity for purposes of any law of this state except that an independent contractor of the authority that ... performs a function of the authority ... is liable for damages only to the extent that the authority or entity would be liable if the authority or entity itself were performing the function ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   TEX. TRANSP. CODE \u00a7 452.056(d). Rodriguez seeks the statutory maximum of $100,000 from each entity separately-FWTA, MTA, and MTI-for a total of $300,000. The Transit Defendants counter that their liability is cumulatively limited to $100,000 by the TTCA's damages cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The TTCA also contains an election-of-remedies provision that protects government employees: \"The filing of a suit under this chapter against a governmental unit constitutes an irrevocable election by the plaintiff and immediately and forever bars any suit or recovery by the plaintiff against any individual employee of the governmental unit regarding the same subject matter.\" TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.106(a). Rodriguez seeks to recover $5 million from Vaughn individually, arguing that she is not protected by this provision because she is an employee of an independent contractor (MTI), and not of a governmental unit (FWTA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Rodriguez filed her claim against the Transit Defendants on July 11, 2012. At that time, a separate lawsuit brought by New Hampshire Insurance Company against FWTA and Vaughn arising out of the same incident was already on file.\n   <em>\n    N.H. Ins. Co. v. Fort Worth Trans. Auth.\n   </em>\n   , No. 067-258065-12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206809025\">\n    2014 WL 6809025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (67th Dist. Ct., Tarrant County, Tex. Oct. 23, 2014). New Hampshire Insurance sought subrogation to recoup workers' compensation death benefits paid to Rodriguez. Anticipating that it would be drawn into the litigation brought by New Hampshire Insurance, MTI filed a petition in intervention as a party-defendant, counter-claimant, and cross-claimant in that suit. Arguing that the $100,000 damages cap under the TTCA applied cumulatively to all of the Transit Defendants, MTI filed an interpleader petition and tendered $100,000 into the registry of the court in accordance with Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 43.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 43. In its interpleader petition, MTI stated that it would not deny liability for Rodriguez's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shortly thereafter, New Hampshire Insurance nonsuited its claim and the two suits were consolidated. This time, all of the Transit Defendants filed an amended interpleader petition, stating that though the claims were defensible, they would not raise a defense if the court determined that their total exposure was limited to $100,000. After consolidation, the Transit Defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking dismissal of all claims, or in the alternative, a declaration that the $100,000 tendered into the court's registry was the maximum amount owed under the TTCA for all claims against all defendants. Rodriguez also filed a motion\n   for summary judgment, seeking a declaration that the damages cap applied to each defendant separately, and that the potential liability of Vaughn, as the employee of a private contractor, was not capped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court denied Rodriguez's motion and granted summary judgment in favor of the Transit Defendants, ruling that FWTA, MTI, and MTA should be treated as a single governmental unit under the TTCA, limiting Rodriguez's claim to a maximum recovery of $100,000. Further, the trial court dismissed Vaughn under the TTCA's election-of-remedies provision and denied the Transit Defendants' request for attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.106. The court of appeals reversed in part, holding that FWTA, MTI, and MTA were separate entities-each subject to a separate $100,000 damages cap, for a total of $300,000-and that Vaughn, an employee of MTI, was not an employee of a governmental unit and therefore was subject to unlimited personal liability and should not have been dismissed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656396\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/546/180/#p198\">\n    546 S.W.3d 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198-99,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203453183\">\n    2016 WL 3453183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 2016, pet. granted). The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's denial of attorney's fees, holding that the Transit Defendants had not provided sufficient evidence to support their requested fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198.

TTCA's Damages Cap\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties ask us to interpret two separate provisions of the TTCA- Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 101.023 and Transportation Code section 452.056 -to determine whether the TTCA's damages-cap provision applies cumulatively or separately when an independent contractor performs essential governmental functions. Under the TTCA, \"liability of a unit of local government ... is limited to money damages in a maximum amount of $100,000 for each person.\" TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.023. Under the Transportation Code, a private operator who \"performs the function of the authority ... is liable for damages only to the extent that the authority or entity would be liable if the authority or entity itself were performing the function.\" TEX. TRANSP. CODE \u00a7 452.056(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Transit Defendants argue that the plain language of these statutes does not allow the imposition of liability above $100,000. For the reasons explained below, we agree. If FWTA operated its bus transportation system and employed its bus drivers directly, this case would not be before us. FWTA's liability would be limited\n   to $100,000 and Vaughn would be dismissed under the election-of-remedies provision. The fact that FWTA delegated its transportation-related governmental functions to independent contractors, as it is statutorily authorized to do, does not somehow expand the potential liability arising from those governmental functions. Rodriguez argues that the TTCA allows her to sue different entities for different causes of action arising from the same event, and each is liable to its own, respective $100,000 cap. However, this argument does not comport with the language of the TTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.023. Rodriguez takes the position that FWTA, MTA, and MTI each performed separate functions and are therefore each liable up to their own, separate $100,000 caps; however, this interpretation is inconsistent both with Rodriguez's pleadings and with the plain language of the statute. Under the contract, MTA agreed to employ a Director of Transportation Services, who was responsible for \"the overall management and operation of all components of the FWTA's Operating Functions.\" MTI agreed to \"employ all necessary and appropriate personnel\" and to \"procure all other goods and services reasonably necessary and useful to manage and operate the FWTA's public transportation system.\" Neither entity, acting alone, performed all of the services necessary to operate FWTA's bus transportation system. Rodriguez asserted that FWTA, MTA, and MTI collectively \"owned, operated, managed, and/or controlled the bus transportation system operating in Fort Worth\" and that they \"were engaged in a joint enterprise or joint venture to operate and/or maintain such bus transportation system\" and \"comprised and constituted a single business enterprise in such regard,\" even going so far as to assert joint and several liability. Thus, we must consider how section 452.056(d)'s liability limits apply when independent contractors act jointly in operating a public transportation system. Here, if FWTA had itself performed each function involved in the operation of the bus transportation system, its liability would still be limited to a maximum of $100,000.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Thus, \"the extent that [FWTA] would be liable if [FWTA] itself were performing the function\" is $100,000, regardless of\n    whether FWTA performed a discrete part of the operation of its bus transportation system (e.g., employing the necessary personnel) or all functions necessary for such operation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The inclusion of the word \"only\" reinforces our understanding of how the Legislature intended to limit the liability of independent contractors under Chapter 452 when they are performing functions of the government.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX.

Based on the plain language of section 452.056, we conclude that the statute does not extend immunity to private contractors, but instead limits the liability of private contractors performing an essential governmental function under chapter 452.

This construction would effectively multiply the TTCA's statutory damages cap by the number of independent contractors performing a single governmental function, even when, as here, the independent contractors are alleged to have engaged in a joint enterprise with the authority that constitutes a single business enterprise. Such a result would be inconsistent with the statute's plain language, which limits liability to what the transportation authority would incur-a maximum of $100,000 for all functions involved in operating a public transportation system. Moreover, it cannot be that the Legislature's intent in enacting the TTCA-which operates through the relevant provisions to limit the government's liability and to encourage and facilitate a transportation authority's use of independent contractors-was to allow an authority's use of independent contractors to result in a significant increase in the amount of the TTCA's damages cap.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    We hold that the liability of any number of independent contractors performing essential governmental functions for an authority under chapter 452 is limited to a single damages cap under the TTCA.

CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.021(1).

We reject the notion that an employee's conduct cannot be within the course and scope of her employment if she is acting negligently. In fact, an entire body of law-respondeat superior-has developed around the premise that an employee can act within the course and scope of employment and still be negligent.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Ineos USA, LLC v.

But we find no precedent to support extending the protection of interpleader-and the accompanying attorney's fees-to an alleged tortfeasor/defendant. Moreover, the allowance of attorney's fees for an alleged tortfeasor/defendant attempting to interplead the extent of his liability is adverse to public policy. Counsel for New Hampshire Insurance offered a simplified explanation during the hearing on attorney's fees:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    [It's] the same thing as if I'm driving down the street on the way home today and I hit a car with two people in it and I injure the driver and I injure the passenger.

Because the interpleader was improper and the merits of Rodriguez's negligence claim have not yet been tried, we affirm the court of appeals' remand to the trial court for further proceedings, but consistent with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <strong>\n     VI. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    We hold that the TTCA's damages cap applies cumulatively when independent contractors perform essential governmental functions for a transportation authority under Transportation Code chapter 452.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.023 ; TEX. TRANSP. CODE \u00a7 452.056. The plain language of section 452.056 is clear that an independent contractor operating a public transportation system on behalf of a regional authority shall be treated as the government for liability purposes; therefore, that contractor can be liable only to the extent that the authority would be liable if it were performing the same function. MTA and MTI thus are entitled to the same limitation on liability as the governmental unit would be if it performed that function. If FWTA were operating its own bus transportation system, its liability would be limited to a maximum of $100,000. The Transit Defendants' cumulative liability is likewise limited to one $100,000 cap. We further hold that section 452.056 brings Vaughn under the protection of the TTCA's election-of-remedies provision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.106. Finally, we hold that the Transit Defendants' interpleader was improper. They were not innocent, disinterested stakeholders in the litigation, and therefore are not entitled to attorney's fees based on their attempted interpleader. For the reasons expressed above, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals in part and reinstate the judgment of the trial court as to the damages-cap and election-of-remedies issues. We affirm the court of appeals' denial of attorney's fees but on different grounds, and we affirm the remand to the trial court for further proceedings, but consistent with this Court's opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Justice Johnson filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Lehrmann and Justice Boyd joined.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Justice Blacklock did not participate in the decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    JOHNSON, joined by JUSTICE LEHRMANN and JUSTICE BOYD, dissenting.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Assuming McDonald Transit Associates, Inc.

The Statutes\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Under the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA), the Legislature has, in part, waived a governmental unit's immunity as to injuries or death arising from the operation or use of a motor-driven vehicle. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.021.

The Entities\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    I agree with the Court that by enacting section 452.056, the Legislature did not attempt to grant private contractors immunity from damages. Rather, it attempted to limit the\n    <em>\n     extent\n    </em>\n    of their liability.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 841-42. Rodriguez does not challenge the Legislature's authority to limit the liability of MTI and MTA, but she asserts that nothing in the language of section 452.056 limits her potential recovery from the three entities involved-FWTA, MTA, and MTI-to a cumulative total of $100,000. The Court concludes otherwise. It says that because of the statute, \"the liability of independent contractors performing essential governmental functions is limited to a single damages cap under the TTCA.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 845. However, the statutory text does not support that conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The Court looks to the functions performed by MTA and MTI and concludes that they acted jointly in operating the public transportation system. The Court then concludes that the damages cap applies cumulatively because FWTA's liability would be limited to $100,000 if it had performed all of the functions necessary to operate the transportation system, including those performed by MTA, MTI, and their employees. And while the Court may be correct regarding the extent of FWTA's liability if it itself had performed all the activities relevant to Rodriguez's claim, section 452.056 does not limit the liability of individual independent contractors, such as MTA and MTI, based on the functions they contracted to perform. Although the language of the statute limits a private operator's liability when it performs a function of an authority, the limit applies to \"\n    <em>\n     an\n    </em>\n    independent contractor.\" TEX. TRANSP. CODE \u00a7 452.056(d) (emphasis added). MTA is an independent contractor performing functions of FWTA. So is MTI. Applying the statute to each as \"\n    <em>\n     an\n    </em>\n    independent contractor\" yields the result that each is liable for damages to the extent FWTA would be liable had it performed \"the function.\" Nothing in the statute provides\n    that if multiple private operators have contracted with an authority, then either their functions must be considered to determine whether those functions are joint or the total of their liabilities is in any way combined.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The Court concludes that \"the Legislature has instructed that, for the purpose of liability, an independent contractor performing the function of an authority ... should be treated as if it were the governmental unit performing that function.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 846. Contrary to the Court's statement, though, nothing in the language of section 452.056(d) either explicitly or implicitly \"instructs\" that such an independent contractor should be treated as a governmental entity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    In construing statutes, we strive to give effect to the Legislature's intent, looking for that intent first and foremost in the plain language of the statute.\n    <em>\n     Lippincott v. Whisenhunt\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6864494\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/462/507/#p509\">\n     462 S.W.3d 507\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 509 (Tex. 2015). In subsection 452.056(d), the Legislature chose to limit the liability of private operators for damages only to the extent that a transportation authority would be liable. Nothing in the language of section 452.056 indicates the Legislature intended to extend full governmental status to private contractors.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6864494\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/462/507/#p509\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6864494\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/462/507/#p509\">\n     at 508\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"A court may not judicially amend a statute by adding words that are not contained in the language of the statute. Instead, it must apply the statute as written.\"). If the Legislature had so intended, it would, and should, have said so. Moreover, and to the exact contrary, the Legislature made clear that it was limiting the governmental attributes it extended to private operators by stating that a private operator is \"\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    a public entity.\" TEX. TRANSP. CODE \u00a7 452.056(d) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The Court continues by concluding that applying the TTCA damages cap to each individual contractor would essentially multiply the cap and run counter to the Legislature's intent to limit the government's liability and encourage the use of independent contractors.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 845. But as explained above, the Legislature explicitly chose not to treat private operators as governmental entities. TEX. TRANSP. CODE \u00a7 452.056(d). And limiting the liability of each individual contractor to $100,000, the amount for which FWTA could be liable under the TTCA, will still result in limited liability for FWTA. Moreover, there is nothing in this record hinting that limiting the liability of independent contractors to $100,000 each will discourage contractors from bidding on government contracts or discourage governmental entities from using contractors when appropriate. To the contrary, experience and common sense instruct otherwise. There is no shortage of independent contractors willing to bid on and perform government contracts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Brown &amp; Gay Engineering, Inc. v. Olivares\n    </em>\n    , we recently considered whether to extend the protections of immunity to private contractors.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865844\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/117/#p121\">\n     461 S.W.3d 117\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 122 (Tex. 2015). We explained that the rationale for and purpose supporting sovereign and governmental immunity is protection of the public fisc.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865844\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/117/#p121\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865844\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/117/#p121\">\n     at 121-22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We noted that such immunity guards against unforeseen expenditures associated with defending lawsuits and paying judgments and that \"private companies can and do manage their risk exposure by obtaining insurance.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865844\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/117/#p121\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865844\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/117/#p121\">\n     at 121-23\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We concluded that \"[e]ven if holding a private party liable for its own improvident actions in performing a government contract indirectly leads to higher overall costs to government entities in engaging private contractors, those costs will be reflected in the negotiated contract price.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865844\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/117/#p121\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865844\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/117/#p121\">\n     at 123\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because extending immunity to the private contractor would not have furthered the purpose of immunity, we declined to do so.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865844\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/117/#p121\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865844\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/117/#p121\">\n     at 124\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    In this case, we should follow the principles we expressed in\n    <em>\n     Brown &amp; Gay Engineering.\n    </em>\n    While the Court concludes that section 452.056 does not attempt to extend full immunity to private contractors, it also concludes that it could not have been the Legislature's intent to allow a transportation authority's use of independent contractors to result in an increase in the amount of a recovery under the TTCA.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 845. But applying the damages cap to MTA and MTI individually does not expand the liability of FWTA under the TTCA. It is one thing to protect governmental entities and the public fisc from judgments. It is another to limit the liability of a private party and thereby shift the burden of injury from the tortfeasor to the injured person just because the tortfeasor was performing a governmental function when it caused the injury. The organizational model of FWTA, MTA, and MTI as independent entities did not come about by happenstance. Indeed, it would blink reality to even think that the three entities, with their intricate divisions of responsibilities, liabilities, and relationships, were the result of other than careful planning and documentation. In some tangential way, the public fisc may be affected where private contractor tortfeasors can be sued by persons they injure because the contractor's bid price likely will include some amount for liability insurance premiums and related costs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brown &amp; Gay Engineering\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865844\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/117/#p121\">\n     461 S.W.3d at 122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But where the liability of a governmental entity such as FWTA is limited regarding injuries caused by independent contractors such as MTI and MTA, both the purpose underlying governmental immunity-protection of the public fisc-and the purpose underlying the tort system-requiring wrongdoers to compensate those they have injured-are fulfilled. Moreover, private entities assume the risks of defending against, and potential liability for, tort claims on a daily basis. That is so whether they are performing governmental functions under contracts with the government or performing nongovernmental functions under contracts with private parties: it is part of doing business. Indeed, those risks are part of every nongovernmental entity's daily existence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    <strong>\n     B. The Bus Driver Employee\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    The Court next concludes that \"for the purpose of liability, an independent contractor performing essential governmental functions under chapter 452 of the Transportation Code shall be treated as the government; therefore, the employees of such an independent contractor are to be treated as employees of the government for purposes of liability.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 847. Of course, the TTCA would not apply to Leshawn Vaughn and would not even be part of the discussion if she were not employed by a governmental unit. And as noted above, I disagree with the Court that MTA and MTI either are, or should be treated as, governmental units. But, even given the Court's mistaken conclusion regarding their status and treatment, the Court errs in its analysis regarding whether the TTCA's election of remedies provision applies to Vaughn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The TTCA provides that \"[t]he filing of a suit under this chapter against a governmental unit constitutes an irrevocable election by the plaintiff and immediately and forever bars any suit or recovery by the plaintiff against any individual employee of the governmental unit regarding the same subject matter.\" TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 101.106(a). But the Act specifically excludes employees of independent contractors from the definition of \"employee.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865844\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/117/#p121\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 101.001(2). The Court acknowledges this language, but concludes that despite it, \"an independent contractor performing essential governmental functions under\n    chapter 452 of the Transportation Code shall be treated as the government; therefore, the employees of such an independent contractor are to be treated as employees of the government for purposes of liability.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 856.

If FWTA performed only one function-route design, for example-and outsourced the rest, its liability would still be limited to $100,000. Thus, FWTA's liability is collective as to all functions. The liability limit for independent contractors is likewise collective because damages are capped at the amount FWTA would incur, and under section 101.023, FWTA's liability for any number of functions cannot exceed $100,000.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-125\">\n     The bill that was adopted read, in relevant part: \"If an independent contractor of the authority is performing a function of the authority, the contractor is liable for damages to the extent that the authority would be liable if the authority itself were performing the function.\" H.B. 1453, 70th Leg., R.S.
