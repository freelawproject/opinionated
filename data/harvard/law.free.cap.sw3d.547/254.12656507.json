Martinez, Justice\n  Miguel Aguilar, Jr. appeals his conviction on one count of continuous sexual assault of a child and three counts of indecency with a child arguing three main issues: (1) he was denied a fair trial because a biased juror served on his jury; (2) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to quash the indictment based on double jeopardy and an unconstitutionally vague statute; and (3) the trial court abused its discretion by failing to hold a hearing on his motion for new trial. We affirm the trial court's judgments.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  <strong>\n   BACKGROUND\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  Because Aguilar does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence or raise any other evidentiary issues, only a brief recitation of the facts is warranted.\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-11\">\n  Aguilar married Blanca in 1990 and they had six children together, including five daughters. They divorced in 2009, and Miguel was awarded full custody of all the children. No allegations of sexual abuse were raised during the divorce proceedings. In April 2014, one of the daughters, \"Teresa\" [a pseudonym], made an outcry to her eldest sister Samantha when she picked up Teresa from school. Teresa stated that her father had been sexually abusing her for years. Samantha proceeded to pick up another sister, \"Sonia\" [a pseudonym], from school and Sonia made a similar outcry about her father sexually abusing her. Another daughter, Anna, was also in the car at the time and made similar allegations of sexual abuse by their father. Samantha drove the girls home and told another sister, Bianca, about the claims of abuse by their father. Bianca called their mother and told her about her sisters' allegations against their father. All of the girls went to the police station, along with their mother, to report the abuse and give statements.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Aguilar was indicted on four counts of indecency with a child by contact against Sonia in 2014, and one count of continuous sexual abuse against Sonia and Teresa during the period from November 17, 2007 through June 17, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN . \u00a7\u00a7 21.11(a)(1), 21.02 (West 2011 &amp; Supp. 2016). At trial, Samantha testified to the outcry statements by Sonia and Teresa that Aguilar would make them sleep with him at night and would engage in various acts of sexual contact with them. Sonia and Teresa testified similarly. Aguilar testified and proclaimed his innocence. He presented evidence that at least one of the counselors who examined the girls was initially \"unable to determine\" whether they had been sexually abused. No physical or medical evidence of sexual abuse was admitted. The jury found Aguilar guilty on all counts, except Count I which was abandoned by the State prior to trial. He was sentenced to eighty years of imprisonment on the continuous sexual abuse count and twenty years of imprisonment on each count of indecency, with the sentences to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BIASED JUROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his first three issues, Aguilar asserts he was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to a fair and impartial\n   jury because a biased juror served on his jury. The State responds that Aguilar failed to preserve any error when he declined to pursue an objection to the juror's continued service after the juror was questioned at the bench about any potential bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jury selection took place on April 25, 2016 before Associate Judge Melissa Joy Garcia. J.S. was sworn in as one of the jurors. Trial began two days later on April 27, 2016 before District Judge Oscar J. Hale, Jr. Before opening statements began, defense counsel informed the trial court and prosecutor on the record that he learned that J.S. had posted a comment about the trial on Facebook after being selected to the jury. Defense counsel expressed his concern that the post indicated a \"gender bias in favor of women\" and argued it was significant because the victims were two young girls and the prosecutor was a woman. The post read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Just yesterday I wrote a paper on Women in Leadership &amp; had to explain why we are underrepresented. Ironically I had jury duty today &amp; who is the judge? Melissa Joy and prosecutor Linda G ... Then I get selected to serve on a trial beginning on Wed ... Happy B-Day to me. Guess I'll be spending it with strangers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The post was accompanied by a photograph of J.S.'s juror identification card. J.S. also commented on her own post, stating, \"Louie, I forgot to mention we were in Monica's courtroom. Imagine that Women in power ... I love it!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Judge Hale read the post and stated that \"gender bias is one thing,\" but promoting \"women [in] power\" is another, noting that unequal pay for women is currently \"a hot topic on the national level.\" The judge stated he would allow counsel to question J.S. under oath on the record, but also stated, \"unless you're going to show us something else that she said specifically about how she's biased against men,\" then \"I really don't see anything on this.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   J.S. was brought into the courtroom and placed under oath. After defense counsel obtained her confirmation that she wrote the Facebook post and comment, he posed the following question, \"after hearing all the evidence, the judge is going to give you an instruction to set aside your personal feelings, to set aside your bias, bias for women against men. And my feeling is that, from your position, you are unable to do that. Is that true?\" Before she could reply, the trial court interrupted, stating that defense counsel had not established anything yet and the question was based on assumptions; the court instructed counsel to rephrase the question. After another question by defense counsel asking whether the juror \"would be able to put your biases aside,\" the trial court again interrupted and took over the questioning. The court asked, \"Do you have a bias against men?\" and J.S. replied, \"Negative. No. Not at all. I'm just very proud of these girls. They've gone a long way.\" In response to the court's follow-up question, \"Do you have a bias against the defendant, more specifically,\" she answered, \"No, sir, no.\" The trial court asked two more questions about whether J.S. could judge the credibility of the witnesses' testimony equally, \"whether they were male or female, or the defendant or the victim,\" and she confirmed that she could do so. At that point, the court asked defense counsel whether he had any other questions, and counsel stated, \"No further questions.\" J.S. left the courtroom and defense counsel stated, \"Thank you, your Honor\" and requested that the Facebook posting, marked as Defendant's Exhibit 1, be included in the record. When the court inquired, \"Anything else?\" defense counsel moved on to\n   another matter involving a motion in limine by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The record reflects that at no time did counsel for Aguilar raise any further objection to J.S. serving on the jury, move to have her excused and replaced by the alternate, or move for a mistrial. In his reply brief, Aguilar asserts that his counsel made \"an objection through context\" and that it was apparent to the trial court that counsel objected to the continued jury service of J.S. The context of the exchange on the record, as set forth above, does not support Aguilar's assertion that the issue was preserved. The record shows that the trial court inquired into any potential bias by J.S., her answers did not show a bias, and defense counsel did not express any objection to her continued jury service, or request a substitution or any other relief, after the questioning. Therefore, Aguilar waived any error with respect to any bias by J.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P . 33.1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Aguilar mistakenly argues in his reply brief that the right to an impartial jury cannot be waived by a defendant. The Court of Criminal Appeals has expressly held that \"the right to trial by impartial jury, like any other right, is subject to waiver (or even forfeiture) by the defendant in the interest of overall trial strategy.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8241562\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/253/686/#p697\">\n    253 S.W.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (also stating the right to an impartial jury is \"not to be regarded ... within the rubric of\n   <em>\n    Marin v.

App.-San Antonio Oct. 7, 2015, pet. ref'd) (mem. op., not designated for publication) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, even if Aguilar's gender-bias issue had been preserved, it lacks merit. The record does not establish that J.S. had a bias against men or in favor of women, or more specifically, a bias against the defendant, which would disqualify her from serving on the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN . art. 35.16(a)(9) (West 2006) (biased or prejudiced juror is unfit to serve). In addition, the substance of Aguilar's argument in his brief does not match the gender-bias argument he made at trial (or listed in his points of error). Aguilar argues in his brief that J.S.'s Facebook posting constituted \"an unauthorized conversation with someone outside of the jury\" which entitles him to a new trial under TEX. R. APP. P . 21.3(f), not that it revealed a bias in favor of women, or against men or Aguilar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P . 21.3(f) (requiring a new trial in a criminal case upon the occurrence of certain events, including \"when, after retiring to deliberate, the jury has received other evidence; when a juror has talked with anyone about the case; or when a juror became so intoxicated that his or her vote was probably influenced as a result\"). Aguilar never raised the issue of \"outside communications\" by J.S. at trial, only gender bias.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rezac v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020329\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/782/869/#p870\">\n    782 S.W.2d 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 870 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (nothing is preserved for review when the appellate issue does not match the trial objection). Finally, Aguilar asserts that when the trial court took over the questioning of J.S., it changed the scope of the inquiry from a gender bias \"in favor of women,\" as Aguilar was claiming, to one \"against men,\" and thereby prevented him from pursuing his issue. That claim is contradicted by the record which shows, as quoted above, that Aguilar's initial question concerned a possible bias by J.S. \"for women against men.\" The court's questions to J.S. encompassed whether she had a bias \"against men\" or \"against the defendant\" as well as whether J.S. could judge the credibility of the witnesses\n   equally, regardless of \"whether they were male or female, or the defendant or the victim.\" There was no disparity of any substance between the inquiries by counsel and the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because Aguilar failed to preserve any error based on J.S.'s continued service as a juror, we overrule Aguilar's issues. Alternatively, we hold the record does not establish that J.S. had a gender bias which prevented her from serving as a juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL (FAILURE TO FILE MOTION TO QUASH INDICTMENT)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In his next four issues, Aguilar asserts his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to file a motion to quash the indictment based on (i) double jeopardy because the predicate offenses of the continuous sexual abuse count overlap with the separate counts of indecency and constitute the \"same offense,\" and (ii) the unconstitutionally vague nature of the continuous sexual abuse statute. The State responds that Aguilar cannot prove the prejudice prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   because a motion to quash on either of those two grounds would have failed on its merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Aguilar contends that, when applied to a continuous sexual abuse case, the \"on or about\" principle precludes the State from separately charging a defendant with a predicate offense listed in section 21.02(c) that occurred at any time antecedent to the indictment, even if the alleged date falls outside the continuous sexual abuse time period. Under Aguilar's theory, once continuous sexual abuse of a child is charged, no predicate offense may ever be separately charged, even if its alleged date falls outside the continuous period, without creating a double jeopardy violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We recently addressed a similar double jeopardy argument in\n   <em>\n    Dwyer v.

In\n   <em>\n    Dwyer\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was charged with one count of continuous sexual abuse of a child and one count of aggravated sexual assault against the same child alleged to have occurred outside the continuous abuse period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 537-38, at *1. The continuous sexual abuse was based on the predicate offense of indecency by contact via Dwyer's hand touching the child's genitals at least twice, while the separate aggravated sexual assault was based on digital penetration of the child's sexual organ.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After he was convicted on both counts, Dwyer argued on appeal that \"[t]he jury was improperly charged that it was\n   <em>\n    not bound by the dates\n   </em>\n   described in the indictment, [which] permitted them to base [Dwyer's] convictions for both aggravated sexual assault and continuous sexual abuse ... on a single instance of digital penetration and placed [him] in double jeopardy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 541, at *4 (emphasis added). As Aguilar does, Dwyer argued the double jeopardy violation was apparent on\n   the face of the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

We disagreed, reasoning that the plain language of section 21.02(e)(2) indicates that the Legislature did not intend for continuous sexual abuse of a child and a predicate offense listed in section 21.02(c) to be the \"same offense\" if the separately alleged predicate offense occurred outside the period in which the continuous sexual abuse allegedly occurred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 542-43, at *5 (quoting the language of section 21.02(e)(2) of the Penal Code ). We then applied the plain statutory language of section 21.02(e)(2) to the offense dates alleged in the indictment and concluded that because the separate offense of aggravated sexual assault was alleged to have occurred outside the period of continuous sexual abuse, there was no double jeopardy violation apparent on the face of the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 542-43, at *5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Carmichael\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12180325\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/505/95/#p100\">\n    505 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   100-01 ). In a post-submission letter, Aguilar argues\n   <em>\n    Dwyer\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable and not controlling because the double jeopardy argument there was raised for the first time on appeal, and he raised it in a motion for new trial. That procedural distinction does not affect the substantive double jeopardy analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, the separate indecency offenses in Counts III, IV, and V were alleged to have occurred \"on or about April 24, 2014,\" which is\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the November 17, 2007-June 17, 2013 period specified in the continuous sexual abuse count, but, by necessity, anterior to presentment of the indictment. Aguilar's theory that no offense listed as a predicate offense for continuous sexual abuse could ever be separately charged contradicts the Legislature's expressed intent with regard to the \"sameness\" of the offenses, and would render section 21.02(e)(2) meaningless. Applying the presumption that the Legislature did not act unreasonably or arbitrarily in enacting the statute, until proven otherwise, we reject Aguilar's argument as leading to an absurd result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peraza v.

We conclude that, on the face of the indictment, the independent indecency offenses alleged in Counts III, IV, and V are not the \"same offense\" as the continuous sexual abuse offense for purposes of double jeopardy, and Aguilar may be convicted and punished for each count in a single prosecution.

At oral argument, Aguilar argued that the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him because it permits a continuous sexual abuse conviction to be based on two or more predicate acts committed at any time during the alleged continuous abuse period, and therefore does not provide sufficient notice to permit an effective alibi defense. Aguilar asserted that, because the child victims did not testify to specific dates of sexual abuse during the alleged continuous abuse period, and the statute permits that, he was precluded from proving his alibi defense that he was away working in the oilfield on the alleged dates of abuse. Aguilar did not raise this vagueness argument in his brief. Further, Aguilar has not cited us to any such alibi evidence in the record.

Aguilar's last two issues are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, we affirm the trial court's judgments.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    To the extent Aguilar raises a facial vagueness challenge to section 21.02 based on this same argument concerning the lack of specific dates for the continuous sexual abuse, we conclude that he failed to prove that ground would have been successful in a motion to quash the indictment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The affidavit by Aguilar's trial counsel is merely a verification that the facts stated in the motion for new trial are \"true.\" The affidavit adds no detail or substance concerning the matters raised in the motion for new trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Aguilar also filed an unsworn \"Offer of Proof for the Motion for New Trial\" in which his appellate counsel states that he traveled from San Antonio to Laredo on June 30, 2016 to visit with Judge Hale about setting a hearing date on the motion for new trial. However, June 30, 2016 falls well outside the ten-day period for presentment of the motion and there is no notation by Judge Hale showing he had actual knowledge of the motion for new trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.
