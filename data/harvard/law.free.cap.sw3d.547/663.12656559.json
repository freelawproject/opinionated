In eight issues, Appellant contends that the accomplices' testimony was not sufficiently corroborated, the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and the trial court abused its discretion by admitting or refusing to strike certain pieces of evidence. Because we hold that the accomplices' testimony was sufficiently corroborated, the evidence was sufficient to support Appellant's conviction, and the trial court did not reversibly err by making any of the challenged evidentiary rulings, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Deitra Coleman, Appellant's Wife, Tried to Buy Two Xboxes at GameStop with Fifteen $50 Bills and Some Small Change.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 27, 2014, a black man and woman, identified at trial as Appellant and\n   his wife, Deitra Coleman, walked into GameStop on South Hulen Street in Fort Worth. Coleman asked for two Xbox consoles. Appellant left the store, came back, and left again while Coleman remained in the store. Coleman gave the cashier, Derek Cook, fifteen $50 bills as payment for the Xboxes. After Cook counted the money, he asked for more because the total due was around $757 and change. Coleman placed seven dollars and some coins on the counter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Coleman Abandoned the Fifteen $50 Bills but Retrieved the Seven Dollars and Coins Before Leaving GameStop.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cook held one of the $50 bills up to the light to look for its security strip and watermark, neither of which he saw. Before Cook could tell Coleman that he required another form of payment, she left, abandoning the fifteen $50 bills but taking the seven dollars and coins from the counter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Evidence at Trial Showed That Appellant Participated in the Transaction and That He Gave Coleman the Bills Before the Transaction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At trial, cashier Cook, who no longer worked at GameStop, identified Appellant as the man who was in GameStop with Coleman on December 27, 2014, but on cross-examination, Cook stated that he was \"[n]ot one hundred percent\" certain that the man in a still photograph taken from the store's surveillance video that day was Appellant. Similarly, Cook had picked Appellant's picture out in a pretrial, out-of-court lineup, but with only a \"70 to 80 percent\" or \"75 to 80 percent\" certainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cook testified that he did not recall seeing Appellant give Coleman any money at the time of the incident, but when reviewing the store's surveillance video later, \"[i]t looked [to him] as if the male handed the female a small fold of cash\" before the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, Coleman admitted that Appellant gave her something at GameStop but stated that it was not money, and she did not know or remember what it was. During the investigation, however, Coleman told Fort Worth Police Department (FWPD) Detective Ron Turner, who had been promoted to Sergeant by trial, that Appellant handed her the money to buy the Xboxes at GameStop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Similarly, Investigator Michael Weber of the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office (TCDA) testified that Coleman told him that Appellant gave her $600. Further, accomplice witness Edward Nunley testified that Appellant told him that his purchases with the counterfeit money he bought from Nunley included games from GameStop. Finally, the jury saw the GameStop surveillance video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Bills Collected by the FWPD at GameStop Were Counterfeit, and Evidence at Trial Shows That Appellant Knew It.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. GameStop Cashier Derek Cook Distinguished the $50 Bills from Genuine Currency.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Cook testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 He examined the top $50 bill of the stack he received from Coleman for \"maybe five to ten seconds\" and determined that it had neither a security strip nor a watermark and that it \"didn't feel normal\" and \"felt different\" than money;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 He checked some of the other bills with the light;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Two separate serial numbers were used: ten bills had one serial number, and the remaining five bills had the other serial number;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Many of the bills had the same stamp on the back;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 The bills looked faded, \"as the ink [wa]s kind of washed away\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 His manager double-checked the bills and agreed that they were not real; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Neither customer returned for the $50 bills or asked Cook questions about why the transaction was not completed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Shaun Baughman, Walmart Asset Protection Manager, Testified Counterfeit Money Was Received the Same Day at a Walmart Store in Fort Worth.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Shaun Baughman, Asset Protection Manager for Walmart, testified about a similar offense that occurred earlier on the same day at a Fort Worth Walmart:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 On December 28, 2014, the store's cash office notified him that on the previous afternoon, approximately $480 in counterfeit $50 and $10 bills had been received in the electronics department at Register 67;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Cash office personnel researched until \"[t]hey actually found the transaction for that exact denomination\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 He tracked the transaction on the store's surveillance video;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 On the video, Baughman saw a black male enter the store with a black female, give her money, stand at the register with her, and leave the store with her, carrying the Xbox she had purchased;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 If the serial numbers on the counterfeit money at Walmart matched the serial numbers on the counterfeit money collected at GameStop, he would think the counterfeit money possibly came from the same people;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 The bills \"shouldn't have the same serial number\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 Baughman was not an expert at recognizing counterfeit money, but he was \"pretty good\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 He recognized the money to be counterfeit from the feel of the paper, the look of the ink, the absence of a security strip, and the fact that the lines were not straight on the paper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Baughman also testified that photocopies of the $50 bills used at GameStop were \"picture[s] of counterfeit money. Or it's fifty dollar bills.\" Over objection, he testified that he could \"tell by [the] way the paper [was] crumbling, it[ was] not the actual paper. The ink appear[ed] to be off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Accomplice Deitra Coleman Admitted That Appellant Gave Her the Money She Spent at Walmart, and the Walmart Surveillance Video Showed a Couple Dressed Exactly Like the Couple in the GameStop Video Running to Their Car After Leaving the Store.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even though TCDA Investigator Weber testified that Coleman told him that neither she nor Appellant knew the GameStop money was counterfeit, she admitted at trial that on December 27, 2014, she and Appellant had gone to Walmart before they went to GameStop and that he had given her money at some point before they reached Walmart that she used there to purchase something, but she could not remember what. The State played for the jury those portions of the Walmart surveillance video showing a black man and woman dressed exactly like the couple in the GameStop surveillance video arriving in the Walmart parking lot, entering the store, completing the transaction, exiting the store, running to their car in the parking lot, and driving away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Special Agent Jason Boswell Testified That the GameStop Bills and Walmart Bills Were Counterfeit.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   United States Secret Service Special Agent Jason Boswell testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 He had examined the bills from the GameStop and Walmart transactions at the FWPD's request;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 The bills were all counterfeit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 JK16440416A, the serial number on the $50 bill he held at trial, taken from State's Exhibit 20 containing the Walmart bills, matched the serial number on the GameStop bills in State's Exhibit 18;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 Henry Paulson was the Secretary of the Treasury when one of the counterfeit $50 bills collected from GameStop purported to be issued;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 Timothy Geithner was the acting Secretary of the Treasury when another of the GameStop counterfeit $50 bills purported to be issued;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 The Department of the Treasury authorizes the making of United States currency;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 The counterfeit money was not authorized to be printed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 The counterfeit money purported to be genuine currency; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022 The Department of the Treasury did not authorize the counterfeit money to purport to be United States currency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    5. FWPD Sergeant Ron Turner Testified That the Bills Were Counterfeit.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Sergeant Turner testified that Coleman told him that the money Appellant gave her to spend at GameStop and Walmart came from accomplice Nunley. Sergeant Turner further testified that the bills were counterfeit and that Agent Boswell had confirmed his suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   When Sergeant Turner talked to Appellant by phone, Appellant denied passing money to anybody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Accomplice Witness Edward Nunley Testified That He Sold Appellant the Counterfeit $50 Bills.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accomplice witness Nunley testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \u2022 Around November 2014, he received about $41,000 in counterfeit money from a one-time drug deal in which he acted as the middleman;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 Most of the counterfeit money was in $50 bills;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 Appellant asked Nunley about the counterfeit money, and Nunley told Appellant that the money was in fact counterfeit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022 Appellant bought the counterfeit $50 bills from Nunley with cash;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022 Appellant told Nunley that he bought \"a TV and a PlayStation and something\" with the counterfeit money;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \u2022 Appellant told Nunley that he bought games with the counterfeit money at GameStop and that he also spent the money at Walmart, on ordering in food, and for a single night's stay at a motel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 Appellant called, texted, or went to see Nunley about the counterfeit money six or seven times; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 Appellant sent Nunley a text stating, \"Bro I need them bills,\" referring to the counterfeit money.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The trial court also admitted the text message, apparently sent more than three weeks after the GameStop forgery, into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Accomplice Testimony Was Sufficiently Corroborated.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In part of his first issue, Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence corroborating Coleman's and Nunley's accomplice testimony implicating Appellant in the forgery. The accomplice-witness rule, set out in Article 38.14 of the code of criminal procedure, provides that \"[a] conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the offense committed[,] and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense.\" Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14 (West 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    1. We Review the Nonaccomplice Evidence for Evidence That Tends to Connect Appellant to the Forgery.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The accomplice-witness rule is a statutorily imposed sufficiency review and is not derived from federal or state constitutional principles that define the legal and factual sufficiency standards.\n   <em>\n    Druery v.

When evaluating the sufficiency of corroboration evidence under the accomplice-witness rule, we \"eliminate the accomplice testimony from consideration and then examine the remaining portions of the record to see if there is any evidence that tends to connect the accused with the commission of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Solomon v.

Agent Boswell was not sworn in until the next day, immediately before he testified, and the trial court explicitly placed him under the Rule before he began testifying. After the first round of Boswell's direct examination and well into his cross-examination by defense counsel, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   Q. .... You've talked with Detective Turner about this case; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   A. I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Q. Okay.

Which rule?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   After Agent Boswell answered, defense counsel moved to strike all of his testimony on the basis that he had violated the Rule. The trial court stated, \"I didn't swear this witness in and place him under the Rule until right before he testified. If y'all want the people all sworn in, that are testifying, together, I would ... have done that. Nobody asked me to do it.\" The record confirms the trial court's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The trial court swore Sergeant Turner in and expressly placed him under the Rule when he testified after Agent Boswell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

At trial, the State showed Officer Marleau State's Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, and he testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   \u2022 The pictures showed the fifteen $50 bills he received on December 27, 2014, at GameStop;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   \u2022 He placed the bills in a sealed property envelope and wrote his badge number and initials on the back of it; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   \u2022 While he could not tell from the photos that the bills in the photos were the same bills he picked up, because he had not tagged the individual bills, he assumed that the bills in the photographs were the actual bills he had collected from GameStop because they were pictured with the property envelope he had initialed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Appellant objected to the admission of the photos on the ground that Officer Marleau was \"unable to authenticate\" the photographed $50 bills as the \"actual[ ] ... items that were placed in the ... evidence bag.\" Appellant also objected that Marleau could not lay the proper predicate because he could not \"reasonably tell th[e] Court th[ese] photo[s] accurately represent[ ] the circumstances at the time the photo[s] w[ere] taken.\" The prosecutor told the trial court that the actual bills would be forthcoming, and the trial court overruled the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Cashier Cook also testified that the photos of the counterfeit bills appeared to show the bills that he received from Coleman because ten of the photographed bills had the same serial number, five had the same other serial number, and the $50 bills Coleman gave him were proportioned in that same way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Finally, Sergeant Turner answered affirmatively when asked if State's Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 \"purport to be photographs of the package for State's Exhibit 18 and what is contained within[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   We have already upheld the admission of State's Exhibit 18-the actual property envelope and counterfeit $50 bills collected at GameStop.

Baughman had already offered similar testimony about the bills used at Walmart with no objection. Further, other witnesses, both before and after Baughman, testified that the GameStop bills were counterfeit with no objection. Specifically, GameStop cashier Cook contrasted the bills with the genuine article:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   \u2022 The first bill he checked lacked a security strip and watermark, \"didn't feel normal,\" and \"felt different\" than money;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   \u2022 The fifteen bills had only two different serial numbers among them\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n   \u2022 Many of the bills had the same stamp on the back;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   \u2022 The bills looked faded, \"as the[ir] ink [wa]s kind of washed away;\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   \u2022 His manager agreed that they were not real.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Additionally, Agent Boswell and Sergeant Turner testified that the bills were counterfeit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   A trial court's erroneous admission of evidence will not require reversal when other such evidence was received without objection before or after the complained-of ruling.\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323091\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/313/274/\">\n    313 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   302 n.29 (citing\n   <em>\n    Leday\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11603126\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/983/713/#p716\">\n    983 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   718 );\n   <em>\n    Lane v State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9167875\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/151/188/#p193\">\n    151 S.W.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193 (Tex.
