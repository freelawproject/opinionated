We have, however, provided a memorandum opinion for the use of the parties setting forth the reasons for our decision. We affirm the Judgment pursuant to Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to RSMo. 2000 as amended.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Effective January 1, 2017, this Section has been transferred to Section 579.055.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Effective January 1, 2017, this Section has been transferred to Section 579.074.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
