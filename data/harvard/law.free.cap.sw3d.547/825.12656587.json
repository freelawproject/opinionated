He contends there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions. Upon review of the briefs and the record, we find no error and affirm the judgment. Because a published opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose, we have provided the parties with a Memorandum explaining the reasons for our decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AFFIRMED. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
