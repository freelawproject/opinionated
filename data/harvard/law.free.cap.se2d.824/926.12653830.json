The facts and procedural history pertinent to the instant appeal are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Respondent-Parents have nine children together-Amy, Nick, Callie, Holly, Fanny, Steve, Val, David, and Vivian\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively, the children). On 28 October 2016, Respondent-Parents were living with their nine children, who were all minors at the time, in a single motel room with two double beds at the Starlite Motel in Mount Airy. At approximately 3:00 a.m. that morning, the children were performing \"chores\" in the bathroom of their motel room while Respondent-Father talked on the telephone with Respondent-Mother, who was working out of the county. An altercation occurred between the siblings, resulting in five-year-old Callie being knocked unconscious. Respondent-Father called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   When EMS arrived, Callie was awake and responsive. EMS transported Callie to Northern Hospital of Surry County for further evaluation. Upon arrival, doctors noted multiple bruises and abrasions around her forehead, both eyes, and her left cheek and ear; bite marks to her left forearm and leg; and multiple bruises in various stages of healing on her torso and legs. Based on the child's condition, doctors immediately contacted Surry County Department of Social Services (DSS) and law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On 31 October 2016, DSS filed juvenile petitions alleging that all nine children were neglected. In addition to the events surrounding Callie's hospitalization, the petitions alleged the children had not received medical or dental care in over a year and several school-age juveniles reported during interviews with DSS that they could not read or write. On 31 October 2016, DSS received nonsecure custody of all nine children. Respondent-Father was also arrested and charged with five counts of Misdemeanor Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On 23 March 2017, the children were adjudicated neglected. Respondent-Parents entered into a Family Services Agreement (Case Plan) to address the issues that led to the children's removal. Specifically, Respondent-Parent's Case Plan required them to: find and maintain appropriate housing and employment; attend and complete parenting classes; complete mental health evaluations and participate in any recommended counseling and treatment; and locate social support to help with caring for their children. On 23 March 2017, the trial court entered a Juvenile Disposition Order that retained the children in the custody of DSS, provided Respondent-Parents with supervised visitation once per week for one hour, and required Respondent-Parents to comply with the Case Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Respondent-Parents failed to comply with the Case Plan. Throughout the life of the case, Respondent-Parents were reluctant to provide DSS with details regarding their housing and employment. At numerous times, DSS did not have a physical address for Respondent-Parents, as Respondent-Father had told DSS \"it was none of [their] business.\" Respondent-Father reported he was disabled but failed to provide verification of any disability or pending claim for disability. In August of 2017, Respondent-Parents reported cleaning houses; however, neither provided any verification of this employment. With respect to parenting classes, Respondent-Parents attended several classes, but neither Respondent-Mother nor Respondent-Father ever completed a parenting program. Although both parents obtained mental health evaluations, neither followed through with their recommended treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In addition to not complying with the Case Plan, Respondent-Parents' behavior during visitations with the children was often times inappropriate. Respondent-Parents spent visitation \"interrogating the children about what was happening in their lives in their foster homes, instructing them not to listen to social workers or their foster parents, [and] not to talk to therapists.\" Respondent-Parents also spoke negatively of the two oldest children, David and Vivian, both to the other children and to David and Vivian directly, instructing the other children not to talk to David and Vivian and referring to David and Vivian as \"stupid\" and \"retarded.\" After 27 June 2017, Respondent-Father stopped attending visitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 5 January 2018, the trial court entered a Permanency Planning Hearing Order ceasing reunification efforts with Respondent-Parents, terminating the visitation rights of Respondent-Parents, and changing the children's permanent plan of care to termination of parental rights and adoption. Although neither Respondent-Parent was present at this permanency planning hearing, both Respondent-Parents were represented by court-appointed counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 26 January 2018, trial counsel for Respondent-Father (First Counsel) filed a Motion to Withdraw as Counsel, which failed to include a certificate of service showing Respondent-Father was notified of First Counsel's pending withdrawal. On 26 January 2018, the trial court entered an Order to Withdraw allowing First Counsel's withdrawal and appointing a new attorney (Second Counsel) as Respondent-Father's subsequent counsel. However, this Order also failed to include any certificate of service or other document showing Respondent-Father received notice of this withdrawal and replacement of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 28 February 2018, DSS filed a petition to terminate Respondent-Parents' parental rights to the children. DSS provided Respondent-Parents notice of their Motion for Termination of Parental Rights by mailing copies of the Motion to Respondent-Parents' respective attorneys, with Second Counsel receiving Respondent-Father's notice. The Record shows on 5 April 2018, a preliminary hearing was held which Second Counsel attended on behalf of Respondent-Father; however, the Record fails to show whether Respondent-Father attended this preliminary hearing. On 3 May 2018, the trial court conducted a permanency planning hearing that Second Counsel attended on behalf of Respondent-Father, but Respondent-Father did not attend this hearing, which set the termination hearing for 27 June 2018. Although DSS served Second Counsel with notice of this termination hearing, the Record does not show whether Respondent-Father ever received any notice of the pending termination hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A hearing on the Motion for Termination of Parental Rights was conducted on 27 June 2018. Neither Respondent-Parent was present at the hearing, although each of their attorneys appeared on their behalf. At the beginning of the hearing, Respondent-Mother's attorney brought her client's absence to the trial court's attention and made a motion to continue the action. Second Counsel joined in the motion to continue after informing the trial court he was unsure if Respondent-Father was aware of the termination hearing. Specifically, Second Counsel told the trial court the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-17\">\n   [SECOND COUNSEL]: Judge, on behalf of [Respondent-Father], I would join in the motion [to continue], tell the Court I think the file shows that this matter was originally one in which [First Counsel] had represented [Respondent-Father]. I was appointed to represent him once [First Counsel] was released, back in January. Since then, I'll tell the Court I've had no contact with him, have no contact information for him. I don't know whether, to what extent, my appointment was communicated to him. Don't know whether he is even aware of this proceeding today. I know the motion was -- the motion for TPR was served on me as his attorney of record. But again, I don't know whether he is aware of that at all. There are some addresses indicated in the file, but I understand that they are not good addresses anymore, so I have no way to get in touch with him. I did see him here in the courthouse at one point. I don't remember exactly when it was, but within the last couple of months, and introduced myself to him, and asked that he get in touch with my office so that I could speak with him about that matter. But other than that, I've had no contact with him. I don't know if he had my contact information at the time, so again, it would be my motion to continue as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After hearing brief arguments from counsel for DSS, the trial court denied Respondent-Parents' motions to continue, at which point Second Counsel made a motion to withdraw. The trial court declined to address Second Counsel's motion to withdraw. Thereafter, Respondent-Parents' attorneys remained present in the courtroom but did not actively participate in the termination hearing. The trial court concluded that grounds existed to terminate Respondent-Parents' parental rights. The trial court further concluded it was in the children's best interest that Respondent-Parent's parental rights be terminated, even though it acknowledged the low likelihood of adoption for David and Vivian. On 23 July 2018, the trial court entered the Termination Order terminating Respondent-Parents' parental rights to the children.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Pseudonyms have been used to protect the identities of the juveniles.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Issues\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Respondent-Father asserts the trial court erred by denying Second Counsel's motion to continue the termination hearing and failing to address Second Counsel's motion to withdraw where serious issues of notice were raised, resulting in Respondent-Father being denied his right to fundamentally fair procedures.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-1110(a), and those findings demonstrate a reasoned decision within the trial court's discretion. We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion and affirm the decision of the trial court terminating Respondent-Mother's parental rights to David.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Conclusion\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Accordingly, we remand for further proceedings the portion of the trial court's 27 June 2018 Termination Order terminating Respondent-Father's parental rights. We affirm the portion of the Termination Order terminating Respondent-Mother's parental rights to David.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    REMANDED; AFFIRMED IN PART.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Report per Rule 30(e).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Judge ZACHARY concurs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Judge BERGER concurs in a separate opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    BERGER, Judge, concurring in separate opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    I concur with the majority opinion. However, I cannot agree with the majority that documentation that a parent actually received notice of an order allowing withdrawal of counsel is required for \"fundamental fairness.\"\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-85\">\n     We note Respondent-Mother does not challenge the Termination Order regarding the seven youngest children.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
