Brown appeals the circuit court order amending his sentence for murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime and denying his request for additional credit for time served. On appeal, Brown argues the circuit court erred by denying him credit for time served for the entire time period between his arrest date and the date of his guilty plea and sentencing. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2006, Brown turned himself in to the Aiken County Sheriff's Office for the murder of his father-in-law and was indicted for murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. On August 15, 2007, Dr. Richard Frierson evaluated Brown and found him incompetent to stand trial. As a result, on October 4, 2007, the circuit court ordered Brown to be committed to the South Carolina Department of Mental Health (the Department) for sixty days for competency restoration. In February 2009, the circuit court ordered that Brown be re-evaluated. On March 6, 2009, and April 3, 2009, Dr. Frierson evaluated Brown and found he had a genuine mental illness. Accordingly, the circuit court ordered Brown be committed to the Department for sixty days for competency restoration. After Brown completed his second sixty-day commitment to the Department, Dr. Frierson found Brown was still incompetent and recommended that Brown be civilly committed. Following a hearing, on October 7, 2009, Brown was committed to the\n   Department pursuant to section 44-17-580 of the South Carolina Code (2017). Except for both sixty-day commitment periods, Brown was housed in the county detention center from his arrest until his civil commitment on October 7, 2009. The State dismissed the charges against Brown on October 20, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In early 2014, the Department began to consider releasing Brown due to his improved condition. As a result, the State re-indicted Brown for murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime on February 7, 2014, and requested that Brown be evaluated by Dr. Frierson, who found Brown mentally ill but competent to stand trial. On February 22, 2016, Dr. Frierson evaluated Brown and, again, found him competent to stand trial. Brown remained committed in the Department until the day before he pled guilty. Brown pled guilty on February 29, 2016, and the circuit court sentenced him consecutively to thirty years' imprisonment for murder and five years' imprisonment for possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the sentencing, the circuit court gave Brown credit for time served between his arrest on September 9, 2006, and the State's dismissal of his charges on October 20, 2009, amounting to three years, one month, and eleven days credit for time served. However, the court denied Brown credit for time served for his civil commitment, the time period after the State dismissed his charges. A few days later, the circuit court issued a consent order amending Brown's credit for time served to also include credit for Brown's pre-trial confinement between February 7, 2014, when the State re-indicted Brown, and February 29, 2016, when Brown pled guilty and was sentenced. The circuit court denied Brown time-served credit \"during the time of his commitment to [the Department] between October 20, 2009, and the time of his re[-]indictment on February 7, 2014.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Brown was confined as a result of the prosecution of his original charges. The State chose to dismiss Brown's charges when he was deemed incompetent to stand trial.

We find this scenario is similar to\n   <em>\n    Blakeney\n   </em>\n   , where the supreme court held a defendant was entitled to credit for time served even though a county waited to execute an arrest warrant for over a year after they issued it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blakeney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"190635\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/339/86/#p88\">\n    339 S.C. at 87-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"190635\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/339/86/#p88\">\n    529 S.E.2d at 10-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, the probate court's order has a handwritten notation stating, \"Should Mr. Brown regain competency, he shall be discharged to the Abbeville County Detention Center, and the Solicitor shall be notified pursuant to state law.\" According to section 44-23-460 of the South Carolina Code (2018), if the superintendent of a hospital \"believes that a person against whom criminal charges are pending no longer requires hospitalization, the court in which criminal charges are pending shall be notified.\" Although charges were no longer pending against Brown as of October 20, 2009, the State continued to receive information about Brown and was notified, pursuant to the probate court's order, as soon as the Department\n   believed Brown could be released due to his improved condition in early 2014. After the State was notified, it re-indicted Brown for the same charges on February 7, 2014, and requested another competency evaluation. Thus, it is clear from the probate court's order and the subsequent actions of the solicitor that the State intended to prosecute Brown as soon as he regained competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Moreover, section 44-23-460(2) of the South Carolina Code (2018) would have barred the prosecution of Brown if he had \"been hospitalized for a period of time exceeding the maximum possible period of imprisonment to which the person could have been sentenced if convicted as charged.\" Thus, if Brown had been committed for longer than the possible sentence for his crime, the State would not have been able to re-indict him.

We find, under the limited and unique facts of this case, Brown is entitled to credit for time served even though there were no charges pending against him. Although the charges were technically dropped, the result was functionally the same as if the charges were still pending against Brown.
