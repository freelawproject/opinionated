(collectively, Taxpayers) appeal the decision of the Administrative Law Court (ALC) finding the gross proceeds from Taxpayers' rental of tangible personal property included fees from the sale of \"Optional Liability Waiver Provisions\" (Waivers). On appeal, Taxpayers argue the ALC erred in (1) failing to apply the appropriate rules of statutory construction to the applicable taxing statutes; (2) finding the Waivers were taxable when no imposition statute imposes a tax on waivers; (3) relying on the measure of tax statute when no imposition statute was invoked; (4) finding the Waiver proceeds were part of Taxpayers' gross proceeds of sale; (5) failing to determine whether the intangible Waivers were subject to sales tax; and (6) finding the \"Consumer Rental-Purchase Agreements\" (Rental Agreements) and Waivers constituted a single agreement or transaction. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Taxpayers operate retail stores in South Carolina from which customers can rent-to-own durable consumer goods such as televisions, computers, appliances, and furniture. A customer who rented goods from Taxpayers was required to enter into a Rental Agreement. Under the Rental Agreement, the customer chose a weekly, monthly, or semi-monthly rental term and made rental payments accordingly. A customer could acquire ownership of a rental item by making all term payments for a specified number of rental terms. The customer could also unilaterally terminate the Rental Agreement at any time by returning the rental property and paying any overdue fees. The Rental Agreement contained a \"Risk of Loss and Damages\" section which provided the customer was responsible for the fair market value of the rental property if it was lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Taxpayers also offered customers a Waiver. The Waiver gave the customer the option to pay an additional fee along with the rental term payment-weekly, monthly, or semi-monthly. If a customer chose to pay the Waiver fee, Taxpayers would waive the customer's liability for the value of the rental\n   property in the event of certain enumerated conditions: lightning, fire, smoke, windstorm, theft, or flood. The Waiver provided Taxpayers would waive the customer's liability only if the customer \"paid all periodic rental payments including the liability waiver fee through the date of loss and ... complied with all other terms of [the] Rental Agreement ....\" Either the customer or Taxpayers could terminate the Waiver at any time without notice; the termination became effective at the end of the rental term. The Waiver further stated it was \"an additional part of the Rental Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The South Carolina Department of Revenue (the Department) audited Rent-A-Center East, Inc.'s sales tax returns for the period April 1, 2007 through October 31, 2010; the Department audited Rent Way, Inc. for the period April 1, 2007 through October 31, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The audits showed Taxpayers properly paid sales taxes on proceeds from the Rental Agreements. However, Taxpayers did not pay sales taxes on proceeds\n   from the Waivers. The Department determined Rent-A-Center East, Inc. owed $521,694.93 plus interest; Rent Way, Inc. owed $192,158.64 plus interest. Taxpayers submitted payment in the amount of $919,585.55 for all taxes and interest owed and timely requested a contested hearing before the ALC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After a hearing, the ALC found the Rental Agreements and Waivers were \"fundamentally interconnected\" because the Waivers were described as \"provisions\" of the Rental Agreements, the Waivers could not be entered into independently of the Rental Agreements, and the Waiver fees were calculated based on the term payment of the Rental Agreements. The ALC went on to find the true object of the transaction was \"to obtain the use of an item while minimizing the financial risk of its damage, loss, or destruction.\" The ALC concluded the Waivers were subject to sales tax and ordered Taxpayers to remit payment of $851,622.31 plus accrued interest to the Department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This court's standard of review is set forth in section 1-23-610(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2018), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The review of the [ALC]'s order must be confined to the record.

As the parties agree, sections 12-36-910(A) and 12-36-90 must be read sequentially. Section 12-36-910(A) imposes a sales tax of five percent on the \"gross proceeds\" of all\n   <em>\n    persons\n   </em>\n   engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail. Section 12-36-90 then defines \"gross proceeds\" as \"the value proceeding or accruing from\" the sale or lease of tangible personal property. Because we find Taxpayers' argument that section 12-36-910(A) imposes a sales tax on certain enumerated transaction types rather than persons unavailing, we also find the ALC did not err in reaching section 12-36-90 in determining whether the proceeds from Taxpayers' sale of Waivers constituted\n   \"gross proceeds\" within the scope of section 12-36-910(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    THE TRUE OBJECT TEST\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Taxpayers argue the ALC erred in determining the Rental Agreement and Waiver constituted a single agreement under the true object test.

Similar to the Louisiana statute imposing a sales tax on gross proceeds derived from sales or rentals, section 12-36-910(A) imposes a sales tax on \"gross proceeds of sales\" of tangible personal property. Moreover, both the \"real object\" test and our \"true object\" test focus on the customer's intent for entering a transaction with elements of both goods and services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boggero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363620\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/414/277/#p280\">\n    414 S.C. at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363620\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/414/277/#p280\">\n    777 S.E.2d at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he true object test focuses on factual questions; namely, whether the customer's purpose for entering the transaction was to procure a good or a service.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The evidence before the ALC showed the fee for the Waiver and the fee for the Rental Agreement were paid together during each rental term. The Waiver could only be enforced if all payments under the Rental Agreement were made. The Rental Agreement contained a line item for the Waiver fee. The Waiver fee was calculated as a fixed percentage of the term payment under the Rental Agreement. Customers could not purchase a Waiver without first entering a Rental Agreement, and Taxpayers did not offer Waivers for items sold by third parties. The Waiver also specifically stated it was \"an additional part of the Rental Agreement\"; although Taxpayers argued this language was included in the Waiver solely to reduce their liability under consumer protection laws, they failed to point to any specific law or policy of any state mandating the inclusion of such language. Therefore, substantial\n   evidence in the record supported the finding that the sale of the Waiver was merely incidental to the Rental Agreement under the true object test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fraternal Order of Police\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"529277\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/332/496/\">\n    332 S.C. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   501 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"529277\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/332/496/\">\n    506 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   497 n.2 (\"According to the 'true object test[,'] sales which are merely incidental to the transaction and not its true object are not exempt from the retail sales tax.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We acknowledge evidence could also support a finding that the Waivers were separate and distinct from the Rental Agreements. The Waivers were optional and could be cancelled at any time without cancelling a Rental Agreement. Taxpayers also separately listed the fee for the Rental Agreement and the fee for the Waiver on customers' receipts. Moreover, payment of the Waiver fee did not count toward the purchase of the rental property. Nonetheless, because this court \"may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the [ALC] as to the weight of the evidence on questions on fact\" and our review of the ALC's application of the true object test is limited to substantial evidence under\n   <em>\n    Boggero\n   </em>\n   , we affirm the ALC on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1-23-610(B) (providing an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the ALC as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    GROSS PROCEEDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Taxpayers argue even if the ALC properly reached the measure of tax statute, it erred in finding the Waiver proceeds were gross proceeds of the sale of the Rental Agreements. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In our view, because substantial evidence supports the ALC's finding that the Waivers were merely incidental to the Rental Agreements, the Waivers must also be subject to the sales tax as gross proceeds of the Rental Agreements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12-36-910(A) (\"A sales tax, equal to five percent of the gross proceeds of sales, is imposed upon every person engaged or continuing within this [s]tate in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail.\"); \u00a7 12-36-90 (\"Gross proceeds of sales, or any similar term, means\n   <em>\n    the value proceeding or accruing from the sale\n   </em>\n   , lease, or rental of tangible personal property.\" (emphasis added) ). Put differently, because the Waivers and Rental Agreements were inextricably linked, the\n   value proceeding from the Rental Agreements included the value Taxpayers received from the Waivers,\n   and the Waivers are not exempt from the sales tax.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fraternal Order of Police\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"529277\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/332/496/\">\n    332 S.C. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   501 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"529277\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/332/496/\">\n    506 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   497 n.2 (\"According to the 'true object test[,'] sales which are merely incidental to the transaction and not its true object are not exempt from the retail sales tax.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Parish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026706\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/95/#p96\">\n    60 So.3d at 96-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding identical waivers were subject to a sales tax statute imposing a tax on \"the gross proceeds derived from the lease or rental of tangible personal property\" because the waivers were inextricably linked to the rental agreements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The ALC also addressed the holdings of\n   <em>\n    Travelscape, LLC v.
