ARTHUR KELSEY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case returns to us on remand from the United States Supreme Court. It involves an unsuccessful motion to suppress filed in the trial court by Ryan Austin Collins. Convicted of receipt of stolen property, Collins appealed to the Court of Appeals, claiming that the trial court should have excluded evidence obtained by police during a warrantless search of a motorcycle parked on a private residential driveway. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, holding that exigent circumstances justified the search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

In our opinion, the exclusionary rule does not apply in this case even if no exigent circumstances existed because, at the time of the search, a reasonably well-trained officer would not have known that the search of the motorcycle, located a few feet across the curtilage boundary of a private driveway, was unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We begin with a settled but often overlooked premise.

The driver wore a helmet with a tinted face shield that obscured his or her identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Officer Rhodes activated his emergency lights and siren and attempted to stop the motorcycle.

Assessing the situation to be too dangerous to follow, Officer Rhodes discontinued his pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Officer Rhodes had noted the motorcycle's license plate number. He later ascertained that the Department of Motor Vehicles (\"DMV\") had no active record for it. Using a separate law enforcement database, he ascertained that the license plate had earlier been recorded on another motorcycle whose driver had been issued a summons. An informant supplied Officer Rhodes with information that led him to believe that the motorcyclist who was associated with the license plate had sold a motorcycle fitting the description of the one that had passed him on Route 250 to Ryan Austin Collins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On September 10, 2013, Officer Rhodes heard a police radio transmission that officers were responding to a local DMV branch because Collins was attempting to register a car that officers believed had been reported stolen in New Jersey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Rhodes went to the DMV branch to speak to Collins about the motorcycle. He arrived at about the same time as Officer Matthew McCall, another Albemarle County police officer who wanted to speak to Collins about a similar incident that had occurred on June 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   While various officers spoke with Collins about the motorcycle and the car he was attempting to register, Officer Rhodes accessed Collins' Facebook page and saw photographs showing what Officer Rhodes believed to be the motorcycle he had attempted to stop in July. One of the photographs showed the motorcycle parked outside a house, but he was unable to determine its location. He showed the photographs to Collins, who denied any knowledge of it. Collins eventually left the DMV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Officer Rhodes quickly ascertained that the house shown in the photograph was on Dellmead Lane in the City of Charlottesville. Within thirty to sixty minutes after Collins left the DMV, Officer Rhodes and another officer, Officer Litton, went to the address and saw, from the public street, an object in the driveway of the house. The object was in an area of the driveway beyond the steps to the front porch and within a few feet of the side wall of the house, and therefore within the curtilage. The object appeared to be a motorcycle covered with a white cover or tarpaulin, showing a partially-exposed chrome front wheel and the silhouette and contours of an extended body. These features were consistent with the motorcycle that Officer Rhodes had encountered in July.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Officer Rhodes entered the driveway and took a photograph of the covered object. He then removed the cover to reveal an orange-and-black Suzuki motorcycle with an extended body, chrome wheels, and a chrome swing arm. He was certain it was the motorcycle he had encountered in July. He took a photograph of the uncovered motorcycle. He ascertained that the license plate did not match the one he had noted during the July encounter. He searched DMV records for the plate number on the motorcycle in the driveway and ascertained that it was registered to a Kawasaki motorcycle in Waynesboro. He checked the motorcycle's vehicle identification number (\"VIN\") and ascertained that it had been reported stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Officer Rhodes knocked on the front door of the house. Collins answered and stepped outside. Officer Rhodes noted that Collins had changed clothes from the shorts, t-shirt, and flip-flops he had been wearing at the DMV into jeans, a long-sleeved shirt, and a pair of boots. Officer Rhodes asked Collins about the motorcycle and he again denied any knowledge of it. He eventually changed his story and said that it belonged to a friend. He said that he had driven it about a week earlier from his mother's house to the Dellmead Lane address. During this conversation, Officer McCall notified Officer Rhodes that he had confirmed that Collins had taken a 2008 Suzuki motorcycle to a local automotive store, which had serviced a motorcycle for Collins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The VIN on the store's invoice\n   matched the VIN on the motorcycle in the driveway by all but one digit. When confronted with this information, Collins again changed his story and admitted that he had driven the motorcycle to the store to have its tires replaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Officer Rhodes then arrested Collins. During a search incident to the arrest, Officer Rhodes discovered a key to the motorcycle in Collins' pocket. Collins was later indicted for buying or receiving stolen property, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-108. Prior to his subsequent bench trial, he filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the search at Dellmead Lane. The court denied the motion, convicted Collins of the offense, and sentenced him to three years' incarceration, which was suspended except for jail time already served. The court's ruling on the motion to suppress has been the subject of Collins' appeals to the Court of Appeals,\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

Officer Rhodes therefore had no way of knowing whether Collins or the hypothetical accomplice was on the way or was already in the house. Officer Rhodes could reasonably have believed that he lacked the time to obtain a search warrant, or that if he asked Officer McCall to do so, it would not arrive in time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Justice McClanahan adopts many of these arguments in her concurring opinion, and stresses that courts should not second-guess, with the benefit of hindsight, officers' judgments on the scene. These asserted justifications are not persuasive, though, even in light of the scene as Officer Rhodes described it in his testimony. It is true that Officer Rhodes had probable cause to believe that the object in the driveway was the motorcycle that had twice eluded police at high speed. But based on the evidence, he had no reason to believe at the time that he decided to enter that the motorcycle had been stolen. To the contrary, his informant had told him that Collins bought it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   It is also true that motorcycles are mobile. But the motorcycle here could not be immediately driven, despite Justice McClanahan's assessment that \"someone ... could have quickly and easily jumped on [it] and sped off.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 498. The photograph Officer Rhodes took shows that the cover was form-fitting, gathered at the bottom with a tie-cord or elastic, and completely obstructed the motorcycle's rear wheel, ignition, and controls. The photograph also shows that the motorcycle was parked with the partially-revealed front wheel abutting the sport-utility vehicle parked in front of it in the driveway, and that the sides of the driveway were enclosed by the wall of the house on one side and a retaining wall nearly as tall as the sport-utility vehicle on the other. The photograph shows that the driveway was scarcely wider than the sport-utility vehicle. Thus, driving the motorcycle away would first require Collins or the hypothetical accomplice to approach it; remove the cover (which, incidentally, would have exposed it to plain view); either back it out of the driveway for the length of the retaining wall or attempt to turn it around, if the narrow width of the driveway between the retaining wall and the house accommodated the turning radius increased by its extended body; mount it; and turn it on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Consequently, even viewing the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, it strains credulity to suggest that neither Officer Rhodes nor Officer Litton could have secured the driveway to prevent anyone from removing the motorcycle while the other went to obtain a warrant to search it. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld police officers' authority to temporarily secure a location when they have probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime will be found\n   there, to prevent the removal or destruction of such evidence while a search warrant is obtained.\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

Collins cites no Virginia precedent, nor are we aware of any, holding that a denial of a suppression motion can be reversed on appeal based upon evidence never presented to the court that denied the motion to suppress. It is nevertheless apparent from a review of Officer Rhodes' testimony at the suppression hearing and at trial that he neither searched the house where the motorcycle was located nor had any authority to do so. Therefore, he had no way of knowing during the short time that he was at the scene whether one or more individuals were in the residence, and any purported statement by him that no one was there would have necessarily been mere speculation. To be sure, from the circuit court judge's point of view, it would be unreasonable to infer that the residence was vacant unless some evidence suggested as much.
