LOUON v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b292-6\">Submitted March 18, 1910</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Am6\">Decided June 15, 1910.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b292-7\">A verdict based upon a loss of probable profits, which might have accrued to plaintiff in his business as an insurance agent, cannot be sustained by proof only of premiums received upon insurance : effected by him during a preceding period, and without any proof from which the jury might legally infer how much of such premium represented the plaintiff\u2019s profit.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-9\">.On appeal from the District Court of Jersey City.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b292-10\">Before Justices Trenchard and Mioturn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-11\">Eor the plaintiff, <em>James A.

An examination of the testimony leads us to the conclusion that this request should have been charged, because nowhere in the record do we find any testimony of the plaintiff, or of any other witness, upon which the jury could reasonably or legitimately make an estimate of the plaintiff\u2019s profits in his busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>ness during any period anterior to the trial. It is true the plaintiff speaks of the \u201cpremiums\u201d he derived from insurance formerly effected by him; but neither in common parlance nor in the vernacular of the plaintiff\u2019s business is that word applied to an agent\u2019s profits from the bnsiness. It is confined entirely to the payment due to the company for its services as underwriter. 31 <em>Cyc. </em>1164. This testimony was therefore clearly unsatisfactory and incompetent as legal evidence for submission to the jury as a basis for estimating the plaintiff\u2019s probable loss of business, without further proof from which the plaintiff\u2019s proportion of the sum thus received as premium could be legitimately inferred as his distinctive profit or earning. <em>Greenl.
