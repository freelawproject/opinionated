The above section of the Practice act, however, has changed the common law rule in actions for libel, and the averment of a special defamatory sense is all that is necessary. <em>Andrew </em>v. <em>Deshler, </em>14 <em>Vroom </em>16; <em>Curley </em>v. <em>Feeney, </em>33 <em>Id. </em>70. Moreover, the innuendo does not attribute to the words used a meaning which they are incapable of bearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">If it were otherwise, however, since the adoption of the one hundred and sixth section of the Practice act, whereby the pleader may impute any meaning to the words published, a demurrer is unavailing to question the propriety of the imputed meaning, for the imputed meaning of the words is ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>mitted by the demurrer. <em>Empire Cream Separator Co. </em>v. <em>De Laval Dairy Supply Co., </em>46 <em>Vroom </em>207.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">. It is next objected that on the face of the declaration it appears that the words are not the words and libel of the defendant. It is argued that because the statement is introduced by the words \u201cit is said,\u201d shows affirmatively that the defendant did not originate the libel, but merely that he had heard it alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The declaration charges the defendant with the composition and publication of the article. It is immaterial that a libel, if composed by the defendant, is couched in the form of hearsay. Chief Justice Hornblower, in <em>Schenck </em>v. <em>Schenck, Spenc. </em>208, thus disposes of this question:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u201cA man may slander or libel another as effectually by circulating rumors or reports, or by putting his communication, spoken or written, in the shape of hearsays, as by making distinct assertions of the slanderous matter and giving them out as truths, within his own knowledge, or for the accuracy of which he pledges his own veragity. The only difference is the latter class of calumniators are rather the more honorable of the two, if any comparison can be made between such characters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The last point, that there is not a proper averment of special damage, is not set up among the grounds of demurrer and cannot be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">The plaintiff is entitled to judgment upon the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
