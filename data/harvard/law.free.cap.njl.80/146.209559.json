The sole contention is that the land, having been acquired for railroad purposes under legislative authority, is not assessable for benefits because held for fairly anticipated railroad purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We think there is no merit in the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">It is probably true that the land was acquired with the intention of using it some time in the future for railroad purposes, but the proofs show it is not essential to the exercise of the corporate franchises of the prosecutor, as the railroad is now constructed and operated, within the decision of <em>State, Morris and Essex Railroad Co., </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>7 <em>Vroom </em>56. Hot is the land within projected plans for a change in the railroad tracks or yards in accordance with any scheme of improvement <em>in fieri, </em>which the prosecutor is at this time actively engaged in executing, within the decision of <em>State, Morris and Essex Railroad Co., </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>6 <em>Id. </em>40. The land in question is lying vacant, and is not at this time necessary for the company\u2019s railroad, but is held as a matter of convenience to the company, which the company in the exigencies of its legitimate business may, at some future time, require for additional tracks or for a readjustment of its present tracks. Whether the land in question will ever be so used seems from the evidence somewhat problematical. As yet no step has been taken in that direction. It is quite clear, too, that the land is not so irrevocably appropriated to the use of the prosecutor in the operation of its railroad that it might not be applied to other uses or sold. In this situation the land is assessable for benefits. <em>Morris and Essex Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>35 <em>Id. </em>148; <em>affirmed, </em>36 <em>Id. </em>683; <em>Morris and Essex Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>35 <em>Id. </em>151; <em>affirmed, </em>36 <em>Id. </em>683.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The assessment against lot 44-A, block 2597, will be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The assessment against the tract having a frontage of seventy-five feet on Rose avenue and a depth of one hundred feet, and being a part of lot 50, block 2577, will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
