L. </em>1894, <em>p. </em>146, is sought to be set aside on two <em>grounds\u2014first, </em>because the interior line of the public park laid out by said ordinance is below low-water mark, and <em>second, </em>because the statute under which the ordinance was passed is unconstitutional.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b552-7\">Before Justices Garrison, Swayze and Voori-iees.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-8\">Eor the prosecutor, <em>George A.

This decision was affirmed and the opinion of this court adopted by the Court of Errors and Appeals. 47 <em>Id. </em>819.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">More recently in the case of <em>Fishblatt </em>v. <em>Atlantic City, </em>49 <em>Id. </em>134, the act in question was again considered and sustained in this court, and this decision has been affirmed by the Court of Errbrs and Appeals in an opinion reported <em>ante p. </em>269.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">In the case before us, counsel for the prosecutor seeks to have us declare the act unconstitutional in the face of these decisions because the proviso to section 2 excepts from the prospective regulations of the act boardwalks theretofore constructed in part to the landward of the line of high water. We think that such an exception is based upon a natural and legitimate grouping of objects that were properly excepted from the prospective features of the act, and is one of those products of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the law that are covered by the general object expressed in its title. <em>Moore </em>v. Burdett, 33 <em>Vroom </em>163.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The argument of prosecutor\u2019s counsel that \u201cbeach or ocean front\u201d must be confined to land between high and low water is met by the language of the act both in its body and title. In each case it is a \u201ccity located on or near the ocean and embracing within its limits or jurisdiction any beach or ocean front\u201d that is authorized to lay out a place of public resort \u201con or along the beach or ocean front of <em>such </em>city.\u201d The act therefore contains its own definition of what it means by \u201cocean front of such city,\u201d viz., as much of such front as is within the limits or jurisdiction of such city. This interpretation was applied in the opinion of Chancellor Pitney, affirming the decision of the Supreme Court in the Eishblatt case. This is what he says: \u201cThe territorial limits of the municipality must be regarded as entering into the definition of the clause Teach or ocean fiont of such city.\u2019 If such limits extend to the ocean-ward side of low-water mark, as well as inland, the clause first quoted from the title of the act is as fairly descriptive of the land that lies below as that which lies above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">rt remains therefore 'only to inquire what ocean front lies within the territorial limits or jurisdiction of Ventnor City. By \u201cAn act to incorporate Yentnor City,\u201d &amp;c. <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1903, <em>p. </em>15), the territory included in such city is bounded by \u201cthe Atlantic ocean on the south as far as the jurisdiction of the state extends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Under the Eishblatt case this meets and disposes of the contention under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The ordinance brought up by this writ is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
