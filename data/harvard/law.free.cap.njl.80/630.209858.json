The ground stated in defendant\u2019s specification is \u201cThat the defendant covenanted and agreed to pay one-half the assessment in case the same assessment be confirmed by the courts, and not otherwise, yet the judge before whom the above case was tried, disregarded the condition of said covenant and promise, and ordered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, whereas, the said condition not having happened, judgment should have been ordered in favor of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">The defendant argues that as the original assessment was set aside, his covenant to pay is at an end, that he was only bound upon the happening of a condition, namely, \u201cThe confirmation of said assessment by the courts,\u201d which has not happened. There is no merit in this argument. The assessment mentioned in the deed referred to an assessment for opening Baldwin avenue, and was manifestly intended to protect the purchaser against one-half of the cost of that improvement which was then chargeable against the land. The conveyance was taken subject to that charge upon condition that defendant pay one-half. The re-assessment ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>by the court was a part of the original proceeding, and is in effect a mere revision of the adjudication. <em>Cadmus </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>17 <em>Vroom </em>549, 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The condition in the deed is a modification of the covenant against encumbrances, and without it the defendant would be bound to pay all of the assessment as re-assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
