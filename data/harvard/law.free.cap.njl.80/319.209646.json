The price at which Bayonne was furnished with water was on a sliding scale running from $89 per million for the first two million gallons per day, down to $40 for the sixth million and all in excess thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In a suit brought by the defendant in error under its contract with the town of Kearny, the trial judge was requested to find that the town should be charged for water furnished at the rate of $40 per million gallons. The trial court, however, having found as a fact that the town of Kearny never took two million gallons per day, declined to find as requested and sealed an exception, on which error has been assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">There was no error; the contract gave the town the right to have the same prices charged it that Bayonne was charged; Bayonne was charged $40 only on the sixth million of gallons per day furnished to it. Kearny not being in a position to claim that price, there was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s request. This is the only legal error complained of. The judgment of the Supreme Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\"><em>For </em>affirmance\u2014Ti-ie Chancellor, Chiee Justice, Garrison, Swayze, Trenchaed, Parker, Bergen, -Voorhees, Minturn, Bogert, Vredenburgh, Vrooai, Gray, Cong-don, JJ. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\"><em>For </em>reversal\u2014Hone.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
