L. </em>1899, <em>p. </em>159. This section, as amended, makes it lawful for a borough to make a contract with the governing body of \u201cany adjoining municipality,\u201d or with any water company in this slate, for a term not exceeding ten years, &amp;e. It seems also io be undisputed that, if the city has any such authority, it is found in the act of April 16th, 1897 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>232), wherein it is provided that it shall be lawful for the board of aldermen or other governing body of any municipal corporation in this state owning or controlling water works to make contracts with \u201cany adjoining municipal corporation,\u201d or with any private corporation therein, to furnish a supply of water for public or private uses, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Both of these statutes were considered and construed in the case of <em>Rehill </em>v. <em>East Newark and Jersey City, </em>44 <em>Vroom </em>220, wherein Mr. Justice Pitney (the present Chancellor) discussed all of the statutes under which it was claimed that Jersey City had the right to furnish water to other municipalities. In that case, because it appeared that the territory of East Newark was not contiguous to that of Jersey City, it was held that the act of April 16th, 1897 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>232), did not authorize a contract between East Newark and Jersey City, and the same construction was given section 76 of the Borough act.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>In the present ease it appears, without dispute, that the borough of North Arlington is about five miles from the city of Jersey City, and that at no place do the municipalities touch each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The opinion of the Supreme Court in the Behill case was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals without further opinion (45 <em>Vroom </em>849), and that case is conclusive of the case now in hand. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the prosecutors\u2019 other objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The resolution and contract under review will be set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
