The moving papers are grossly inadequate to support so drastic a remedy. (See <em>S. Z. B. Corp. </em>v. <em>Ruth, </em>14 A D 2d 678.) Moreover, in a landlord and tenant relationship, there must be a showing that a receivership is necessary rather than the more expeditious remedy of a summary proceeding. Settle order on 10 days\u2019 notice. Concur \u2014 Botein, P. J., Breitel, McNally, Eager and Steuer, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
