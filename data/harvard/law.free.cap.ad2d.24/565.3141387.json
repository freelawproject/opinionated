Judgment affirmed, with costs. In our opinion, the agreement was not void for lack of mutuality (cf. <em>Steinhilber </em>v. <em>Challenger Steel Prods. Corp., </em>9 A D 2d 695). It is also our opinion that the issue as to the meaning of the contract was properly submitted to the jury (cf. <em>Anchin, Block &amp; Anchin </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Coal &amp; Coke Corp., </em>284 App. Div. 940, affd. 308 N. Y. 985) and that the verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor was supported by sufficient evidence. The court\u2019s charge, in our opinion, was not inadequate, (cf. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>19 App. Div. 262, 263, affd. 162 N. Y. 643); in any event there were no exceptions thereto and reversal is not required in the interests of justice. Ughetta, Acting P. J., Christ, Brennan, Hill and Rabin, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
