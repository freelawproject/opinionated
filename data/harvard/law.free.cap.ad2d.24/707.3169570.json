Construing this provision in the original enactment (L. 1905, ch. 724, \u00a7 14), Special Term, as long ago as 1911, held appointments after, or extensions beyond one year and eight months unauthorized and we affirmed <em>(Matter of Board of Water Supply, </em>74 Misc. 146, affd. 151 App. Div. 913); and no subsequent statutory amendment or decisional law has weakened that holding. We do not pass on the additional contentions presented. Order, in each case, reversed, on the law, without costs, and motions denied, without costs. Gibson, P. J., Herlihy, Taylor, Aulisi and Hamm, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
