On March 19, 1985, the ALJ found that petitioner was entitled to reinstatement to either disputed elementary physical education teaching position. Specifically, the ALJ recommended Capodilupo\u2019s reinstatement to the position of Kevin Reilly, who had not intervened before the Commissioner. He also found him entitled to replace Margaret Savage, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>had intervened. The Commissioner rejected these recommended decisions of the AU in their entirety, upholding the Board\u2019s retention of both Reilly and Savage. The State Board of Education (State Board) reversed the determination of the Commissioner and the Board concerning Capodiiupo\u2019s entitlement to Reilly\u2019s position and sustained the Commissioner and the Board concerning the Board\u2019s decision to retain Savage. The Board appeals from the State Board\u2019s ruling that Capodilupo was entitled to Reilly\u2019s position. We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Capodilupo had been employed by the Board for five consecutive school years teaching secondary school physical education classes. He held the required State-issued teaching certificate endorsed in both elementary and secondary physical education and had acquired tenure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He had never taught elementary physical education. Thus, he was a tenured teacher seeking reinstatement to a position for which he was certified, but in which he had acquired no demonstrable experience. Both of the candidates whom he sought to replace had experience in the elementary school position and were certified, but had not acquired tenure. Capodilupo claimed these facts gave him seniority over the selected candidates within the meaning of the education law. In the alternative, he urged that, where no candidate has seniority but one has tenure, tenure must prevail. <em>See Lichtman v. Ridgewood Bd. of Ed., </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>362 (1983); <em>Spiewak v. Rutherford Bd. of Ed., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>63 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">We first address Capodiiupo\u2019s claim to seniority. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:3-1.10(b) states that \u201c[sjeniority ... shall be determined ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>cording to the number of academic or calendar years of employment ... in specific categories ...\u201d Both the Commissioner and the State Board agreed that Capodilupo possessed no seniority rights concerning the elementary school position because elementary physical education teaching and secondary physical education teaching are separate seniority categories, <em>see N.J.A.C. </em>6:3\u20141.10(1)(15)(iii). The Board contends that this conclusion ends the inquiry under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:28-9 <em>et seq., </em>which mandates that RIFFED teachers be dismissed and rehired in order of \u201cseniority\u201d as determined under the regulations. The Commissioner agreed, concluding that Capodilupo\u2019s lack of seniority as an elementary teacher precluded his claim for reinstatement to that position and equating Capodilupo\u2019s tenure claim with his lack of seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In reversing the Commissioner, the State Board first reasoned that Capodilupo had tenure in all positions for which his instructional certificate qualified him, including elementary physical education, even though he did not have seniority in that category. Perceiving a gap in the RIF legislation from the use of the word \u201cseniority\u201d and the absence of reference to \u201ctenure,\u201d the State Board relied upon its quasi-legislative responsibility to balance \u201cthe protection afforded tenured teaching staff members by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:28-5 and the authority granted to district boards of education by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:28-9.\u201d It ruled that district boards are obliged to take into consideration the tenure rights of individuals affected by a RIF.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In support of this conclusion, the State Board noted that seniority provides a mechanism for ranking all <em>tenured </em>teaching staff members so that reductions among the tenured force can be effected in an equitable fashion and in accord with sound educational policies. <em>See Lichtman v. Ridgewood Bd. of Ed., supra, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 368. A tenured teacher, however, is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to retention as against a non-tenured teacher under the tenure law. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the purpose of tenure which was to give a measure of security to teachers after the prescribed number of years of service. <em>See Viemeister v. Bd. of Education of Prospect Park, </em>5 <em>N.J.Super. </em>215, 218 (App.Div.1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">We agree. While it is well-established that the right to tenure is statutory, <em>Spiewak v. Rutherford Bd. of Ed., supra, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>at 72; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:28-1 to -15, \u201cthe Tenure Act should be liberally construed to achieve its beneficent ends.\u201d <em>Spiewak v. Rutherford Bd. of Ed., supra, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>at 74. The Board\u2019s reliance upon <em>Lichtman v. Ridgewood Bd. of Ed., supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 364 to support its contention that tenure has no relevance in a RIF is misplaced. Moreover, although the jurisdiction of the Commissioner encompasses questions regarding tenure rights under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:28-5, <em>Bd. of Ed., City of Newark, Essex Cty. v. Levitt, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239, 246 (App.Div.1984), the ultimate administrative decision-maker in reviewing law concerning school matters is the State Board, whose final decision will not be upset unless unreasonable, unsupported by the record or violative of the legislative will. <em>Dore v. Bedminster Twp. Bd. of Ed., </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>447, 453 (App.Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Our review of the record satisfies us that the State Board was within its delegated authority when it ruled that a tenured teacher seeking reinstatement within the endorsements on his or her certificate is entitled to preference in a RIF as against a non-tenured applicant with the same certification. We further reject the contention that the State Board was \u201crulemaking,\u201d in violation of the standards of <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 331-32 (1984), when it liberally construed the Tenure Act according to these well established principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">We recognize that, in upholding the Board\u2019s decision to retain Savage, the State Board also made a finding that the Board\u2019s obligation to consider tenure in a RIF could be balanced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u201csound educationally based reasons for its decision to retain a non-tenured teacher.\u201d Savage\u2019s retention, however, is not the subject of a cross-appeal and the Board advanced no \u201ceducationally based reasons\u201d to retain Reilly, beyond his experience as an elementary teacher. Accordingly, we find it both unnecessary and inappropriate to address the merits of this portion of the State Board\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Petitioner also challenged the right of a tenured elementary teacher who was also retained.
