As part of its function, PVWC maintains records of accounts receivable. All unpaid water charges payable to PVWC become a lien on the real estate serviced by it. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40:62-141. It has been PVWC\u2019s practice to furnish certified water lien search information upon request, for a fee of approximately ten dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Techniscan Corporation is engaged in the business of searching certain public records on behalf of various title insurance companies. It seeks access to the records kept by PVWC in order to conduct essentially the same type of water lien search for approximately the same fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">PVWC refused to permit Techniscan to conduct such searches of its records for the reasons that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">(1) Such activities are solely for Techniscan\u2019s \u201cown business purposes and economic benefit\u201d and accordingly, there is no legal requirement that such access be granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">(2) Such activities \u201cwould be patently and irreparably disruptive to the operation\u201d of PVWC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">(3) Such activities \u201cwould be an improper delegation of a governmental function\u201d and \u201cnot in the public interest as required by\u201d the Right to Know Law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Techniscan filed suit to compel access to PVWC\u2019s records and then filed a motion for summary judgment based solely on the rights accorded to it by the Right to Know Law. Hence, its common law access rights are not implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">The Right to Know Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1, <em>et seq., </em>enacted in 1963, declares the public policy of this State to be that public records \u201cshall be readily accessible by the citizens of this State\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>as a means of protecting the public interest. It provides specifically that, with certain exceptions, every citizen shall have the right to inspect and purchase copies of such records pursuant to an established fee schedule. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-2. No issue of confidentiality or other restrictions expressed or implied in the statute is raised here by PVWC.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">PVWC concedes that the purpose of the statute \u201cis the salutary one of promoting a free flow of information in order to ensure an informed citizenry.\u201d <em>Nero v. Hyland, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>213, 221 (1978). However, it argues that allowance of such unfettered access to public records by \u201ca private commercial enterprise ... motivated by private pecuniary gain\u201d will not further the implied public interest requirement of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Recently, in <em>Loigman v. Kimmelman, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>98 (1986), the Supreme Court had occasion to discuss the competing interests of the State and its citizens where a citizen seeks access to official information gathered during a law enforcement investigation alleged to be confidential in nature. During the course of discussing the general principles to be applied in construing the Right to Know Law, the Court noted that, \u201c[o]rdinarily, only an assertion of citizen or taxpayer status is necessary for production of common-law records, subject to a showing of good faith\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104. Moreover, in <em>Beck v. Bluestein, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247, 256 (App.Div.1984) we pointed out that \u201c[ujnlike a citizen\u2019s common law right to inspect and examine public records, the Right to Know Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 <em>et seq., </em>imposes no requirement of standing or interest to obtain access to public records.\u201d <em>See also Citizens for Better Ed. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Camden, </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>523 (App.Div. 1973); <em>McClain v. College Hosp., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>346, 354 (1985) (discussing common law rights of inspection as opposed to those which are statutory in origin).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Under the Right to Know Law it is not necessary to establish a purpose for which access to the public records is sought. Indeed, once it is demonstrated that the records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>sought are those defined in the statute and are not otherwise protected, the right to access is absolute. <em>Beck v. Bluestein, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 257. The fact that the statute contains specific provisions for a fee schedule for requested copies of such records suggests that the Legislature did anticipate search activities of the public records by commercial entities. <em>See </em>Conditional Veto Message of Governor Hughes, Assembly No. 344 (May 6, 1963). We perceive no reason to treat such commercially motivated \u201ccitizens\u201d seeking access under the Right to Know Law differently from citizens seeking information for a purely \u201cprivate\u201d reason or need. Moreover, there is no statutory prerequisite that a person seeking access to a public record, not otherwise protectable, demonstrate that such inspection will result in the protection of the public\u2019s interest. Rather, the Legislature made clear that it is the granting of the access by passage of the statute that will accomplish the goal of \u201cprotection of the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">In addition, we point out <em>Accident Index Bureau v. Hughes, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>160 (1965) as further support for our conclusion. There, plaintiff sought access to Workers\u2019 Compensation records in order to provide employees with information concerning past injuries and claims of prospective employees. While decrying the motivation of the plaintiff agency, the Court held that the provisions and broad policy of the Right to Know Law prohibited barring access to the records notwithstanding that plaintiff was engaged in \u201cpoor behavior\u201d for profit. <em>Id. </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Historically, private searchers and abstracters have always utilized public records for profit in searching titles for prospective purchasers of real and personal property. We see no reason to suddenly draw a distinction for the governmental agency involved here because plaintiff admits to a profit motive. <em>See </em>66 AmJur.2d, <em>Records and Recording Laws, </em>\u00a7 17 at 353. The argument that PVWC offers the same search services is irrelevant to our consideration. While we have no hesitancy in concluding that a public agency may promulgate reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>able regulations in order to obviate or reduce any disruption of its record keeping functions in addition to those provided in the statute, the basic right of plaintiff to have access to such records, regardless of any pecuniary benefit flowing therefrom cannot be disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the determination of the trial judge that plaintiff is entitled to access to the PVWC records on a \u201cnon-discriminatory basis.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
