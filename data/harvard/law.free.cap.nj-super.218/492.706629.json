We agree with Judge Hyland of the Law Division that it does not and affirm. A cause of action for defamation does not, without more, allege physical or emotional injury to the person defamed within the meaning of the standard homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">This is the factual background leading to this claim. Dr. Ari Kiev is a practicing psychiatrist with his office and related teaching responsibilities in New York City. He had a professional and personal interest in sports medicine; this generated his interest in the health club industry. He eventually met Kenneth Dion who was involved with health clubs and programs known as Club Nautilus. Together with other professionals who were his friends, Dr. Kiev established several Club Nautilus centers. The investors set up individual corporations for each operation, and Dr. Kiev was made president of each. In light of his active psychiatric practice, he was unable to participate in the daily management of the clubs so a management contract was executed with a company, Total Management, operated by Dion. Not only was an initial investment made, but Dr. Kiev advanced other monies and also personally guaranteed certain obligations of the business. He also solicited customers and additional investors while the corporations were still viable. He wanted to emphasize the sports medicine aspect of the club and attempted to steer the marketing and advertising in that direction. However, he was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>convince Dion to change the advertising theme which generally focused on Dion\u2019s stunning wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The clubs were eventually unsuccessful and closed. Dr. Kiev suffered a loss of about $160,000. At about that time, a reporter from the Philadelphia Inquirer called Dr. Kiev for his comments in regard to Dion and the closing of the businesses. During this interview Dr. Kiev made the allegedly defamatory statements pertaining to Dion, which were the basis of an action instituted in the federal court in Pennsylvania in 1983 against Kiev. That action eventually was settled for $45,000 by plaintiff Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Company, Dr. Kiev\u2019s personal liability insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The allegedly defamatory article was an account of the financial difficulties of Club Nautilus. The reporter attributed Club Nautilus\u2019 collapse to \u201cthe unwieldiness of the club\u2019s 35 checking accounts, the differing opinions of 47 investors and Dion\u2019s ambitious dreams.\u201d The reporter also said that Dion was \u201can artful promoter who nonetheless lacked the management skills to make the clubs financially successful.\u201d The article drew support from quotations from several investors. It quoted Kiev as follows: \u201cHe was running it like a big business like a Jack LaLanne, but he didn\u2019t have the assets of a Jack LaLanne____ I think he is just incompetent.\u201d Another investor, Leo Goldner, was quoted as saying that the clubs \u201cwere totally mismanaged.\u201d Both Goldner\u2019s and Kiev\u2019s quotes were cited as the basis for Dion\u2019s federal court defamation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Upon the filing of the January 1983 defamation suit in the United States District Court in Philadelphia against Kiev and Goldner, in which Dion alleged defamation in comments made to the reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, which were published in the story of October 81, 1982, Kiev asked each of his liability insurance carriers to defend him: United Services Automobile Association (USAA), pursuant to a homeowner\u2019s policy, and Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., pursuant to a personal liability policy. USAA disclaimed; Lumbermen\u2019s agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>defend, and settled for the $45,000 which it paid to plaintiff in the federal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Lumbermen\u2019s then brought this action in the Law Division seeking a declaration that USAA indeed had owed Kiev a duty to defend the federal suit and for a judgment compelling USAA to indemnify Lumbermen\u2019s for the $45,000 settlement payment on Kiev\u2019s behalf, and for its litigation expenses-. In its answer USAA asserted that no coverage was provided under the terms of its homeowners insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">After trial at which Kiev was the sole witness Judge Hyland issued a written opinion in favor of USAA. He ruled that (1) the policy\u2019s coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201d did not include a defamation action; and, in the alternative, (2) coverage was excluded by the policy\u2019s exclusion for claims arising out of the insured\u2019s \u201cbusiness pursuits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Lumbermen\u2019s contends that the judge erred in finding that the \u201cbodily injury\u201d clause of the USAA homeowner\u2019s policy did not cover the defamation action against Kiev. Lumbermen\u2019s refers to paragraph 20 of the federal court complaint in which Dion alleged that \u201cKiev\u2019s statements severely damaged plaintiff\u2019s reputation, impaired his effectiveness to work in his current businesses, diminished his ability to promote new businesses, and caused him embarrassment, humiliation, anguish and distress.\u201d Because the dictionary defines \u201canguish\u201d and \u201cdistress\u201d to include bodily as well as mental effects, Lumbermen\u2019s argues that the complaint alleged \u201cbodily injury\u201d and triggered USAA\u2019s duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In the section of the policy labelled \u201cLiability Coverages,\u201d USAA agreed that</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">If a claim is made or a suit is brought against any insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this coverage applies, we will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">a. pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">b. provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice. We may make an investigation and settle any claim or suit that we decide is appropriate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Our obligation to defend any claim or suit ends when the amount we pay for damages resulting from the occurrence equals our limit of liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In the definitional section, \u201cbodily injury\u201d was defined as \u201cbodily harm, sickness or disease, including required care, loss of services and death resulting therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Judge Hyland found that defamation was not \u201cbodily injury\u201d within the meaning of this policy, saying</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">A defamation action such as that instituted by Mr. Dion does not represent a claim or suit for damages under either of the above terms [bodily injury or property damage] as defined by the policy. To argue that an action for defamation would be covered stretches the language quoted to the limit and constitutes an unreasonable interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The duty to defend is determined by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the coverage provisions of the policy: the duty exists only if the complaint states a theory of recovery for which coverage is provided by the policy; there is no duty as to counts not covered. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>18, 21-23 (1984); <em>Burd v. Sussex Mutual Insurance Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 388-389 (1970). The duty to defend is measured without regard to the ultimate merits of the cause of action: if the complaint alleges facts which, if proved, would constitute a covered risk, the insurer must defend even though if its insured wins at trial, the insurer will have no duty to pay. Hence, it is said that the duty to defend is independent of or broader than the duty to pay. <em>Danek v. Hommer, </em>28 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68, 79 (App.Div.1953), aff\u2019d o.b. 15 <em>N.J. </em>573 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Thus the issue is whether a defamation action against Kiev was the kind of risk of \u201cbodily injury\u201d covered by USAA. We are surprised at the dearth of authority disclosed by our research on this point. The only case on point is from Louisiana: <em>Aker v. Sabatier, </em>200 <em>So.2d </em>94 (La.Ct.App.1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 202 <em>So.</em>2d 658, 251 <em>La. </em>49 (1967). There a chiropractor sued a medical doctor for defamation. Also named as a defendant was the doctor\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance carrier, whose policy purported to indemnify the doctor for damages due to \u201cbodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>injury.\u201d No express mention was made of defamation in the policy. The carrier prevailed on summary judgment, and the doctor appealed, arguing that the allegation in the complaint that the alleged defamatory remarks caused \u201ca painful memory\u201d constituted an allegation of \u201cbodily injury.\u201d The Louisiana Court of Appeals disagreed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">... [I]n this case, there are no allegations that any physical or bodily injury resulted from the alleged libel and slander. That being the case, there can be no recovery under the policy because of a \"painful memory,\u201d which is clearly mental and note physical in nature. [200 <em>So. </em>at 96].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The only other factually similar case worth noting is <em>Employers Mut. Liability Ins. Co. of Wis. v. Hendrix, </em>199 F.2d 53, 59 (5 Cir.1952), in which the Fifth Circuit commented in dictum that a claim for slander did not involve \u201cbodily injury\u201d and was not within the coverage of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Unlike a claim for physical or mental injury, defamation \u201cis not concerned with the plaintiff\u2019s own humiliation, wrath or sorrow, except as an element of \u2018parasitic\u2019 damages attached to an independent cause of action.\u201d <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, Law of Torts </em>(5 ed. 1984), \u00a7 111 at 771. And: \u201cThe mere fact that the plaintiff\u2019s feelings and sensibilities have been offended is not enough to create a cause of action for defamation.\u201d 2 <em>Harper &amp; James &amp; Gray, Law of Torts </em>(2 ed 1986), \u00a7 5.1 at 94. Rather, defamation is an impairment of a \u201crelational\u201d interest, <em>i.e., </em>it denigrates the opinion which others in the community have of plaintiff, and it invades plaintiff\u2019s interest in his reputation and good name. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus the damages sustained by a defamed plaintiff are not to his personal feelings, but rather to those losses which accompany an interference with one\u2019s social, business, religious or familial relations. <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, supra, </em>\u00a7 116A at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Clauses insuring against \u201cbodily injury\u201d are understood in the industry, according to one set of commentators, to refer to physical and mental damage to the person. <em>Riegel, Miller, &amp; William, Insurance Principles and Practices, Property and Liability </em>(6 ed. 1976) at 430. According to these writers, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>term does not include \u201cpersonal injuries,\u201d such as \u201cfalse arrest, libel or slander, and wrongful entry or eviction,\u201d which \u201cmay be added by endorsement.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus \u201cpersonal injury\u201d coverage is not the same as \u201cbodily injury\u201d coverage in insurance terms. 7A <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice </em>(Berdal ed. 1979), \u00a7 4501.14 at 186. It is \u201cbroader and more comprehensive than the term \u2018bodily injury\u2019,\u201d which is limited to impact to the body. <em>See also Nuzzi v. United States Casualty Co., </em>121 <em>N.J.L. </em>249, 254 (E. &amp; A. 1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Given this distinction drawn in the industry, the inclusion in USAA\u2019s policy of a \u201cbodily injury\u201d clause instead of a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d clause was significant. Arguably, had USAA intended to cover defamation actions, it would have included the kind of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d clause which Lumbermen\u2019s did include in its policy. The Lumbermen\u2019s contract expressly defined \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to include physical and mental harm, as well as such additional intrusions upon the individual as false arrest, wrongful eviction, malicious prosecution, humiliation, and \u201clibel, slander, defamation of character or invasion of privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In its reply brief Lumbermen\u2019s cites a recent opinion of Judge Baime which, plaintiff claims, supports its position that the defamation claim qualifies under the \u201cbodily injury\u201d clause. <em>NPS Corp. v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547 (App.Div.1986). The issue there was whether the insurer\u2019s duty to defend under a \u201cbodily injury\u201d clause was \u201ctriggered by a complaint alleging acts of sexual harassment by the insured\u2019s employee resulting in the complainant's emotional distress and mental anguish.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548. The sexual harassment was an assault and battery consisting of offensive touching of the insured\u2019s employee\u2019s \u201cbuttocks and breasts.\u201d Reversing the trial judge, which had held that \u201cbodily injury\u201d contemplated physical harm only, Judge Baime held that the term also \u201cincludes the emotional and psychological sequelae <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>allegedly resulting from the unauthorized invasion of the complainant\u2019s person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The judge reasoned that the phrase \u201cbodily injury\u201d was ambiguous in this context, thereby warranting application of the principle that doubts must be construed in favor of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 551. He surveyed case law holding that emotional stress is as real as physical pain, <em>id. </em>at 552, and concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">... [W]e disagree with INA\u2019s argument that bodily injury necessarily entails some physical or corporeal harm caused by the application of external violence. We are unable to separate a person\u2019s nerves and tensions from his body. Clearly, emotional trauma can be as disabling to the body as a visible physical wound. Moreover, it is common knowledge that emotional distress can and often does have a direct effect on other bodily functions. <em>[Id. </em>at 553],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">He found it significant that the policy did not, as it might have, expressly limit \u201cbodily injury\u201d to physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">We find <em>NFS </em>is factually distinguishable from this defamation case. In <em>NPS </em>there was a physical assault which had harmful emotional consequences. Judge Baime was \u201cunable to separate a persons\u2019 nerves and tensions from his body,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 553, and thus held that an assault and battery which caused emotional distress qualified as \u201cbodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554. Thus the basis of his decision was that there was injury to the person, defined broadly as both her body and her emotions. In the case before us, in contrast, the alleged defamation was not an assault on Dion\u2019s body which had emotional consequences. Rather, Dion\u2019s reputation was allegedly impaired, which in turn caused him \u201cembarrassment, humiliation, anguish and distress.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the dictionary definitions of \u201canguish\u201d and \u201cdistress\u201d is unconvincing. In the context of the complaint as a whole, Dion was clearly alleging common-law defamation, nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Because of our conclusion on this point, we need not reach the coverage questions presented involving the \u201cintentional act\u201d exclusion and the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
