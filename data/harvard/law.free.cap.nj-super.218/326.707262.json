(Transit)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was struck by a stolen car driven by defendant Ronald Longson, Jr. At an arbitration hearing conducted pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-25 <em>et seq., </em>the arbitrator determined that the accident was caused solely by Longson\u2019s negligence and awarded Ross the sum of $5555. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Ross moved in the Law Division to confirm the award against Longson and, because Longson was concededly uninsured, to require that the award be paid by Transit. Judgment was entered against Longson, but the motion to compel Transit to pay was denied. Ross appeals from the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The sole question presented by the appeal is whether Transit, as a public entity, is obligated to provide uninsured motorist (UM) coverage to its injured passengers. The issue has been addressed in only one reported decision, <em>Transport of New Jersey v. Matos, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571 (Law Div.1985), which held that Transit was not so obligated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reach the contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The framework of the dispute can be briefly stated. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6B-1 mandates that \u201c[ejvery owner or registered owner of a motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State shall maintain motor vehicle liability insurance coverage____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-l.la in turn provides that every motor vehicle liability policy shall include coverage \u201cfor payment of all or part of the sums which the insured ... shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the operator or owner of an uninsured motor vehicle____\u201d An owner of more than 25 motor vehicles may qualify as a self-insurer <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-52(a), in which event his certificate of self-insurance is deemed an insurance policy which incorporates the UM coverage required of all motor vehicle insurance policies by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1. <em>Transport of New Jersey v. Watler, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>400, 401 (1979). <em>See also Mortimer v. Peterkin, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>598 (App.Div.1979); <em>Crocker v. Transport of New Jersey, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>Super. </em>498 (Law Div.1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, a municipality is deemed to provide UM coverage if it establishes an insurance fund under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-6b, \u201c[t]o insure against liability resulting from the use or operation of motor vehicles, equipment or apparatus owned by or controlled by it----\u201d <em>Christy v. City of Newark, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>598, 607-608 (1986). The statutory obligation to provide UM coverage in insurance policies thus has been judicially declared to extend to private self-insurers and to municipalities which have established an insurance fund. The question here is whether that obligation extends as well to Transit, a self-insured public entity without any statutory insurance fund.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Christy </em>requires the conclusion that Transit must afford UM coverage to its passengers. In <em>Christy, </em>the court rejected Newark\u2019s contention that UM coverage could only be predicated on an insurance policy or a certificate of self-insurance. It found the various statutory provisions to establish a public policy that \u201call motor vehicles registered in New Jersey, including those owned by self-insurers, carry UM coverage as part of liability insurance.\u201d 102 <em>N.J. </em>at 607 (quoting <em>Transport of New Jersey v. Watler, </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>453, 463 (App.Div.1978), aff\u2019d as modified, 79 <em>N.J. </em>400 (1979)). That policy \u201cdoes not depend for its vitality on a piece of paper, either an insurance policy as such or a certificate of self-insurance____\u201d 102 <em>N.J. </em>at 607. The statutory fund created by Newark constituted a \u201cstatutory contract\u201d which obligated the municipality \u201cto furnish the UM coverage mandated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1, to the extent of at least the statutory minimum of $15,000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608. The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">So strong is the public policy favoring UM coverage that in the absence of an unmistakable legislative declaration to the contrary, we are certain that the foregoing principle applies to any legislatively-authorized self-insurance fund, including one formed under the authority of the predecessor to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:10-6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\n<em>Ibid.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">To be sure, Transit does not have a legislatively-authorized self-insurance fund. But it does have legislative authority to self-insure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We see no reason of law or logic why the rationale of <em>Christy </em>is not equally applicable. To paraphrase <em>Christy, </em>the public policy that all motor vehicles, including those owned by self-insurers, carry UM coverage should not depend for its vitality on whether the owner has a legislatively-authorized self-insurance fund or legislative authority to self-insure without funding. <em>See </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">We are unpersuaded by Transit\u2019s references to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-54 (exempting from the Motor Vehicle Security-Responsibility Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-23 to 60, \u201cany motor vehicle owned by ... this State or any political subdivision of this State ... \u201d) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:25-8 (exempting Transit from the insurance requirements of Title 48). Those provisions allow Transit to operate its buses without obtaining liability insurance. But <em>Christy </em>held, with respect to a municipality which also was not required to procure insurance, that the statutory authorization to operate without insurance did not place the publicly-owned motor vehicles beyond the reach of the strong public policy that all motor vehicles registered in New Jersey carry UM coverage. Nor do we find any merit in Transit\u2019s contention that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-la bars recovery against it for the acts of third parties. <em>Christy </em>held that the UM claim was not in tort but was a claim arising out of a \u201cstatutory contract.\u201d 102 <em>N.J. </em>at 610. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>have already said, Transit\u2019s election to self-insure carries the same UM obligations as did Newark\u2019s election to establish an insurance fund; there is no reason to characterize Transit\u2019s obligations any differently than Newark\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">For those reasons, and in the \u201cabsence of an unmistakable legislative declaration to the contrary\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at 608), we are satisfied that Transit, as a self-insured public entity, is required to furnish the UM coverage mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1. The contrary holding in <em>Transport of New Jersey v. Matos, supra, </em>which came prior to <em>Christy, </em>is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The August 29, 1986 order is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for the entry of an order directing Transit to pay the judgment recovered by Ross against Long-son.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-14\">Defendant was improperly impleaded as Transport of New Jersey, a private bus company which was purchased by New Jersey Transit Bus Operations, Inc., a public entity, on October 15, 1980, pursuant to the Public Transportation Act of 1979, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:25-1 <em>et seq. </em>The accident for which Ross brought suit occurred on April 4, 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\">In <em>Travelers Ins.
