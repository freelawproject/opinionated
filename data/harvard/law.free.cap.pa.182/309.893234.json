The above named electric light companies were competitors for business in the city of Lancaster, and P. B. Shaw, a stockholder of the Edison Company, owned about #100,000 of its #135,000 capital stock; he was also the owner of some of the bonds of said company; the said P. B.

The said P. B. Shaw, in procuring an interest in or majority of the stock of the said' Citizens\u2019 Company and Gas Company, was not the agent of any of the said parties, his co-defendants, and when he purchased the said stock and interest, he acted on his own behalf and without any authority from, or agency of, any of his codefendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">13th.

At a meeting of the stockholders of the Gas Company, held on February 12, 1895, the following preamble and resolution were adopted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">\u201c Whereas, The Backus Manufacturing Company, being the owner of useful and valuable patents for the application of gas for heating purposes, has, through P. B. Shaw, proposed to sell, and assign to this company the exclusive right to use and sell and to license others to use and sell within the territory of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and adjacencies, the Backus Portable Steam Heater, Radiating Mantel and Gas Consuming Appliances now owned by said Backus Manufacturing Company, for the sum of one hundred and ninety-seven thousand, six hundred dollars, payable in the stock and bonds of the said Lancaster Gas Light and Fuel Company, one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars in stock, and seventy-two thousand and six hundred dollars in bonds, upon condition that this company will immediately, upon acceptance of said proposition, begin and energetically push the sale and use of said system of steam heating in the city of Lancaster; therefore, be it</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">\u201c Resolved, That the aforesaid proposition of P. B. Shaw be, and the same hereby is, accepted, and that the board of directors be requested to make said purchase and to issue the stock and bonds to said P. B. Shaw, in accordance with said proposition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\">16th. The meeting of the stockholders of the Gas Company at which said resolution was adopted was regularly called, in accordance with a resolution duly passed at a meeting of the board of directors on December 13, 1894, and according to the laws of the commonwealth providing for the increase of stock and the bonded indebtedness of corporations. All of the stockholders of said Gas Company except two, one of whom was plaintiff, numbering in all twenty-seven out of twenty-nine, and holding 7,580 shares out of the 8,000 shares of the capital stock of the said company, expressly waived notice of said meeting and assented to said increase of stock and indebtedness in writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ing; advertisement was made for sixty days in the newspapers of the city of Lancaster of the time and place of said stockholders\u2019 meeting; and at the meeting of said stockholders every share of stock present or represented was voted in favor of said increase of stock and indebtedness, and the above resolution, requesting the directors to issue the stock and bonds to the said P. B. Shaw, for the purchase of the right to use and sell and license others to use and sell the Backus Portable Steam Heater, Radiating Mantel and Gas Consuming Appliances, was unanimously adopted at said meeting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-3\">18th. Since the adoption of the said resolution, and since the increase of the stock and indebtedness of the Gas Company, and since the purchase of the right to use the Backus patents and appliances, the operations of the said Gas Company have been conducted with increased efficiency and economy, so that, with a gain to the stockholders, the said Gas Company has been enabled to supply gas to the citizens of Lancaster and to their consumers and patrons at a reduced price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\">20th. P. B. Shaw, one of the defendants, sold a large quantity of the stock of the Gas Company and the Edison Company, in equal proportions, all at its par value, with the exception of that sold to one or two persons, and to them at prices not less than seventy-five per cent of its par value; all of whom are bona fide purchasers, and are still stockholders, a list of whom is appended to the testimony filed of record in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\">21st. The plaintiff was not a stockholder in either of said electric light companies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">CONCLUSIONS OK LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-7\">Two questions arise from the pleadings and the testimony in this case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-8\">1st. Whether, as alleged by the plaintiff, the purchase by the Gas Company of the Backus heater and the increase of the capital stock and the bonded indebtedness of the said Gas Company, was a scheme and a fraud on the Gas Company, perpetrated by the parties defendant, other than the Gas Company, and prejudicial to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-9\">2d. Whether the license assigned .by the Backus Manufacturing Company or P. B. Shaw to the Gas Company-was a license to use anything that was proper, convenient, necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>or connected with the manufacture of gas, or its distribution, or for the purposes for which the company defendant was incorporated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-4\">The plaintiff contends that the increase of the capital stock of the Gas Company to the amount of $125,000, and the increase of its bonded indebtedness to the amount of $72,600, are not for any value actually received by the said company, and not in the furtherance of its real interests, but it was done for the purpose of enabling said defendants, other than the Gas Company, to obtain control of the three companies organized in said city of Lancaster, for the purpose of supplying heat, light and fuel to the citizens thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">A careful examination of the testimony adduced on the part of the plaintiff will show that the plaintiff failed in his proof to establish the material averments contained in his bill; and, therefore, the court was obliged to refuse to find, as requested by the plaintiff, that the increase of the Gas Company\u2019s capital stock and bonded indebtedness was not for any value by the company and not in furtherance of its real interests. There was no evidence before us to show that the license assigned by the Backus Manufacturing Company was not of any value, or that the increase of the capital stock and bonded indebtedness of the Gas Company was not made in compliance with the act of assembly. Admitting, for the sake of the discussion, that P. B. Shaw, one of the defendants, who controlled the Edison Companjr by reason of holding a majority of its stock, and virtually the Gas Company for the same reason, and made the purchase of the Citizens\u2019 Company, devised a scheme for the purpose of controlling the three companies, which is the most that can be inferred from the testimony adduced, the transaction, in our opinion, did not prejudice the rights of the stockholders of the Gas Company. On the contrary, the proof rather shows it to have been of benefit to the company. We cannot conceive how, therefore, under the circumstances of this case, it has prejudiced the rights of the complainant. All the stockholders of the Gas Company, it appears, with the exception of the plaintiff, and, perhaps, one other, willingly entered into the transaction and gave it their support. The acts of its directors were not considered improper within the belief of all these stockholders, many of whom as will be seen are among our best and most in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>telligent business men, who, doubtless, would have been the first to complain if these acts had been done to their prejudice as stockholders. Thus, we have the request of but one stockholder, invoking the aid of a court of chancery to declare the acts of his company in the premises illegal and void, unsupported by any proof of fraud or collusion, or evidence of fraud or corrupt motives by other parties than the company defendant, as charged and averred in plaintiff\u2019s bill. Had it been shown at the hearing of this case that P. B. Shaw or a majority of the Gas Company or any of its directors had entered into an alleged scheme to benefit themselves at the expense of the Gas Company or of the minority of the stockholders, the case would have been different. The plaintiff has not brought himself, however, within this chancery rule, by reason of the lack of proof, and, therefore, we must hold that the plaintiff has no standing on this point of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-3\">The second question, however, needs careful consideration. It involves the interpretation of the statute governing the franchise of the company; and in this we recognize the principle that a single stockholder may, when measures are adopted, which are plainly beyond the powers of the company and inconsistent with the objects for which the company was incorporated, invoke the aid of a chancellor to interpose in behalf of the minority stockholders to prevent the performance of such act. The usual remedy, however, is by quo warranto by the commonwealth through the attorney general, but in our opinion it is not the only remedy. We will, therefore, consider this question: That is, were the acts of the Gas Company in the purchase of the Backus heater, and consequently, its increase of the capital stock and bonded indebtedness, ultra vires ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-4\">It is contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the Backus heater is not an appliance used in the manufacture and supply of gas, or in distributing the same to consumers. They pressed this point with great force at the argument, and with some degree of plausibility under the following rule:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-5\">\u201cA corporation, indeed, constituted by statute for certain purposes, is regarded as so entirely the creature of the statute, that acts done by it without the prescribed formalities, or for objects foreign to those for which it was formed, would be, in general, null and void. In so far as the rights granted to cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>porations are destructive of, or encroach upon public or common right, they are undoubtedly to be construed most strongly against those setting them up, and in favor of the state or public ; they are not to be extended beyond the express words in which they are given, or their clear import; and whatever is not given in unequivocal terms, is to be deemed as expressly withheld. And even in their own internal affairs, they are held to strict and rigid conformity with the powers granted, and the manner of their exercise prescribed by the statutes under which they have their being.\u201d Endlich, on the Interpretation of Statutes, sec. 354. This rule is, however, modified: Id., sec. 416; Emerson v. Commonwealth, 108 Pa. 124.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-4\">The legislation affecting the subject is contained in the act of 1874 and its supplements. The second section of the eleventh clause (Purdon\u2019s Digest, pi. 406), defines the granting of the franchise for \u201c the manufacture and supply of gas, or the supply of light or heat to the public by any other means.\u201d The 84th section provides as follows: \u201c Companies incorporated under the provisions of this statute for the supply of water to the public, or for the manufacture and supply of gas, or the supply of light or heat to the public by any other means shall, unless otherwise provided by this act,\u2019 from the date of the letters patent creating the same, have the powers and be governed, managed and controlled as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-5\">\u201c Clause 1. Where any such company shall be incorporated as a gas company, or company for the supply of heat or light to the public, it shall have authority to supply with gas light the borough, town, city or district where it may be located, and such persons, partnerships and corporations residing therein or adjacent thereto as may desire the same at such price as may be agreed upon and also to make, erect and maintain therein the necessary buildings, machinery and apparatus for manufacturing gas, heat or light from coal or other material, and distributing the same,\u201d with the right to enter upon the streets and lay pipe, etc.: Emerson v. Commonwealth, 108 Pa. 124.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-6\">What was the intendment of this section of the act ? The application for the charter of the gas company says that the corporation was formed for the purpose of manufacturing and supplying illuminating and heating gas to the public in the city of Lancaster. This is, in effect, in our opinion, a charter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>furnish heat as well as to furnish light to citizens of this place. The furnishing of light contemplates more than the supply of illuminating gas; so, also, the furnishing of heat more than the furnishing of heating gas. The purpose of the grant necessarily contemplates a contrivance for the distribution of heat. In order to distribute heating gas there are required not only pipes for the conveying of gas, but, also, in our opinion, all other necessary appliances and fixtures for its reception and use by the patrons of the company. Gas stoves and gas heaters, therefore, are indispensable to the use of heating gas, and, therefore, are not foreign to or inconsistent with the objects for which the company was incorporated. We might as well contend that the appliance of a gas burner, which is absolutely necessary for the creating of light from illuminating gas, is foreign to and inconsistent with the objects for which the company was incorporated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-3\">Judge Endlich in his excellent work on the Interpretation of Statutes, from which we have already quoted, gives us the principle, which we think applicable to this case, in these words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-4\">\u201c When powers, privileges or property are granted by statute, everything indispensable to their exercise or enjoyment is impliedly granted also, as it would be in a grant between private persons.\u201d And farther on he adds: \u201c Even when a corporation is created with certain specifically enumerated powers, it possesses, in addition, by implication, all such as are necessarily incident to those specified, or essential to the expressed purposes and objects of the corporate existence. \u2018In this country all corporations whether public or private, derive their powers from legislative grant, and can do no act for which authority is not expressly given or may not be reasonably inferred. But, if we were to say that they can do nothing for which a warrant could not be found in the language of their charters, we should deny them in some cases the power of self-preservation, as well as many of the means necessary to effect the essential objects of their incorporation. And, therefore, it has been an established principle in the law of corporations that they may exercise all the powers within the fair intent and purpose of their creation, which are reasonably proper to effect the powers expressly granted. Nor should anything that is fairly incidental to those things which the legislature has authorized be held ultra vires, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>unless expressly prohibited. Thus, it has been decided, that e. g. the grant to a municipality of power to \u2018prevent and extinguish fires,\u2019 granted, by implication, the power to erect a fire-engine house; of power to \u2018 make police regulations or needful by-laws,\u2019 a power to purchase fire-engines; of power to contract \u2018 for lighting \u2019 streets, a power to acquire street fixtures, including gas pipes and lamp-posts for that purpose; and a grant of power to a railroad company to purchase land in order to procure stone and other material necessary for the construction of its road, a grant of power to purchase land in order to get cross-ties and firewood. Indeed, it may be generally said, that, whenever a power is given by statute, everything necessary to make it effectual, everything essential to the exercise of it is given by implication: \u201d Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes, sec. 418.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-4\">We hold, therefore, that the Gas Company had legal authority to purchase the right to the use of the Backus heater as apart of its franchise. There was no contention at the argument of this case that the Gas Company did not follow the act of assembly in its proceedings to increase its capital stock and bonded indebtedness. The plaintiff simply denies that the increase was for value received, or in furtherance of the real interests of the company. In this respect we do not agree with him. The increase, in our opinion, was not only regularly and lawfully made, but it was made for a valuable consideration, and the effect has been without any prejudice to any of the rights of the plaintiff or to any interest of the Gas Company. It cannot be questioned that the Gas Company had a legal right to increase the capital stock and bonded indebtedness of the company either for money or for labor done or for property actually received: 2 Thompson\u2019s Commentaries on the Law of Corporations, sec. 1604, et sequitur; act of April 29, 1874, relating to corporations; Purd. Dig. 417, ph 68.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">A corporation may take in payment of its shares any property which it may lawfullypurchase. Such a transaction is not ultra vires or void, but is valid and binding upon the original share-takers and upon the corporation, unless rescinded or set aside for fraud. While such a contract stands unimpeached for fraud or otherwise, the courts, even where the rights of creditors are involved, will treat that as payment which the parties have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>agreed should be payment: 2 Thompson\u2019s Commentaries, sec. 1642.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-3\">DECREE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-4\">And now, April 5, 1897, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the bill of R.

The charter was for gas, not for light or heat. Gas is not heat, it is fuel which may be converted into heat by combustion. When the gas is delivered to the consumer it is still gas only. It is not heat. If the consumer does not produce combustion, no heat is obtained, and if he does produce it, the act of doing so is his act : Emerson v. Com., 108 Pa. 111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-7\">The court was clearly wrong in holding that the Gas Company could furnish light and heat as well as gas to the public, and this error caused the court to fall into an equally grave error in holding that these Backus appliances were necessary for the distribution of heat by the Gas Company, and hence formed a part of the Gas Company\u2019s distributing system. If the terms of a charter could be so extended by implication a company such as this could certainly manufacture these appliances, could manufacture any portion of its plant and sell, not only chandeliers, gas fixtures and Backus appliances, but whatever entered into and formed a portion of its plant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-8\"><em>W.

It is a stockholder\u2019s bill to enjoin the issue of new stock and the increase of the corporation\u2019s bonded indebtedness, upon two grounds, first, that the increase is not in good faith for the purposes and in the interest of the corporation, but in pursuit of a scheme to acquire control of the corporation and run it in the interest of a rival; and secondly, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the new debt is to be created for the purchase of certain patent appliances, not for the manufacture or distribution of gas, but for its consumption, the dealing in which appliances is not within the company\u2019s charter purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">It is beyond dispute that the increase of the stock and the bonded debt was duly authorized by the stockholders under all the formal requirements of the law, but plaintiff charges, on the first branch of the case, that the increase was procured fraudulently by the defendants, other than the Gas Company, who being stockholders, owners and directors in the Edison Company, a rival electric light and heat company, acting through their agent, Shaw, bought up a majority of the shares in the Citizens\u2019 and also in the Lancaster Company, and having thus obtained control of the latter, issued the new stock and bonds nominally to buy the Backus patent heating apparatus, but in reality to raise money to pay\u2019' for the stock of the Citizens\u2019 Company, previously secured on options, and intended to be merged in the Edison for the profit of the latter. Of course, the burden of proof of such charge was upon the plaintiff, and it is sufficient to say that we agree with the learned court below that there was no evidence which in any degree sustained it. The agency of Shaw for the other defendants was affirmatively disproved both by him and them, and it was shown that ten of the fourteen defendants were not stockholders, owners or directors of the rival company, the Edison, at the time Shaw acquired the control of the stock of the Lancaster Company, charged to be in the interest of the Edison. On this branch the complainant\u2019s case entirely failed of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The second branch of the case raises a mixed question of law and fact, namely, the authority of the Lancaster Gas Company to purchase the right to use and deal in the steam heater, radiating mantel and gas consuming appliances covered by the Backus patents. It is argued for plaintiff that the charter purpose of the Gas Company is limited by the words \u201c manufacturing and supplying illuminating and heating gas,\u201d and that nothing can be included which is not a necessary part or appliance for manufacturing or supplying. This is too narrow and literal a construction, and overlooks the fundamental object of the corporation, the manufacture and supply of gas to customers for profit. It would be of no use-to manufacture gas if there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>were not customers to buy, and hence the company may fairly supply not only the gas itself, but incidentally such appliances and conveniences as will induce new customers to use gas or old ones to use more. This is a legitimate mode of extending the company\u2019s business, in direct furtherance of its charter object. In considering such questions, much weight must be allowed to the judgment of the parties most interested, the officers and stockholders of the corporation itself, and while they will not be permitted, as against the commonwealth or a dissenting stockholder, to go outside of their legitimate corporate business, yet where the act questioned is of a nature to be fairly considered incidental or auxiliary to such business, it will not be unlawful, because not within the literal terms of the corporate grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">This is the general rule even where corporate privileges are most strictly construed. \u201c Corporations may transact, in addition to their main undertaking, all such subordinate and connected matters as are, if not essential, at least very convenient to the due prosecution of the former: \u201d Green\u2019s Brice\u2019s Ultra Vires (2d ed.), ch. 3, sec. 2, p. 86. The illustration given by Mr. Brice is that railway companies may erect refreshment rooms or book stalls, and \u201c adopt other similar measures for both providing for the comfort of their customers and adding to their own receipts.\u201d The American illustrations in the same line, which have revolutionized modern travel will occur to everyone. In Brown v. Winnisimmet Co., 11 Allen, 326, it was held that the contract of a ferry company to charter one of its boats for temporary use in another business was valid. Many illustrations are suggested in the opinion of Bigelow, C. J., who said, \u201cWe know of no rule or principle by which an act creating a corporation for certain specific objects, or to carry on a particular trade or business, is to be strictly construed as prohibitory of all other dealings or transactions not coming within the exact scope of those designated. Undoubtedly the main business of a corporation is to be confined to that class of operations which properly appertain to the general purposes for which its charter was granted. But it may also enter into' contracts and engage in transactions which are incidental or auxiliary to its main business, or which may become necessary, expedient or profitable in the care and manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>ment of the property which it is authorized to hold.\u201d See also Lyndeborough Glass Co. v. Mass. Glass Co., 111 Mass. 315. And in our own case of Watts\u2019s Appeal, 78 Pa. 370, a land company\u2019s charter purpose was to sell a large tract of land, but it was authorized inter alia \u201c to aid in the development of the minerals and other materials,\u201d and also \u201c to promote the clearing and settlement of the country.\u201d The directors, among other things, built sawmills and a hotel. It was held that their acts were not ultra vires, Gordon, J., saying (page 392) \u201cWe know of no other material upon these lands more abundant or more obviously requiring development than the timber. Neither can we conceive of anything better calculated to develop this kind of materials than sawmills. So we regard a hotel of some kind in so large a territory of wild lands, as not only a convenience adding greatly to the settlement of the country, but a necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">In the present case the stockholders of the Gas Company by an almost unanimous vote, decided that the purchase of the Backus patents was to the advantage of the company\u2019s business as a manufacturer and distributor of gas, and the court below has found as a matter of fact that they were right. We cannot say as matter of law that they were wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Decree affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
