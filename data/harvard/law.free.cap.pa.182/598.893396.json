McNeal, each in the sum of $1,600, and each conditioned to pay the sum of $800 at the decease of Eliza Schaeffer, widow of Emanuel Schaeffer. Eliza Schaeffer died on March 30, A. D. 1890, and all the money due her by reason of the bond given to and held by her was paid, and therefore all liability for or on account of said bond so held by her, ceased; that the remaining four bonds are unpaid, and three of the said bonds are held by Catharine H. Long and one of the said bonds is held by W. H. Roland, to whom they were assigned by the several owners. Edwin M. Schaeffer, the assignor of Charles L. Schaeffer, never had any interest as a mortgagee in said mortgage either in law or in fact, hut, on the contrary, was the mortgagor mentioned therein; he neither created nor reserved for himself any interest or share therein at the time of the execution by him of the said mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-6\">Further, he, said Edwin M.

Hiester, her heirs and assigns, and after the death of the said Mary T. E. Hiester the said premises became vested in her deponent, by which conveyance he, the said Edwin M. Schaeffer, parted with all his right, title, in and to the premises bound by the said mortgage, and also with any share or interest he might have had in said mortgage as one of the legatees mentioned in the last will and testament of Emanuel Schaeffer, deceased, or of any interest he might have had in the said mortgage representing the amount of dower monej'- payable at the death of the said Eliza Schaeffer, all of which your deponent believes and expects to be able to prove on the trial of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-7\">The court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense and entered judgment against B. F. Eshleman, the terre-tenant, for the sum of $4,386.56, $1,111 of which to the use of. Charles L. Schaeffer, $818.89 to the use of Wm. H. Roland, $2,456.67 to the use of Catharine H.

How then can Charles L. Schaeffer issue a writ of scire facias' on said mortgage and recover judgment thereon, no bond ever having been given to his assignor, and no interest in the mortgage ever having been created for or reserved to him. The sum of $4,000, it is true, was the amount, upon which the interest at six per cent, amounting to $240, was to be paid to Eliza Schaeffer annually, and to secure these annual payments the bond for $1,000 was executed, but when all liability on this bond ended, the mortgage was only a collateral security for the payment of the four bonds of $800 each. Nowhere in.the mortgage do we find the amount of $4,000 mentioned. No definite amount is anywhere specified, but it simply recites that it is given \u201c in consideration of the aforesaid debt or sums of $240 annually and four sums of $800 each, and for the better securing the payment of the same.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b622-6\"><em>W.

Schaeffer to Eliza Schaeffer, widow of Emanuel Schaeffer, deceased, to secure the payment of five obligations (one in favor of each of .saidmortgagees), viz: One in the penal sum of $1,000 conditioned for the payment of $240 annually to said widow, during her natural life, and the others each in the penal sum of $1,600 conditioned for the payment of $800 to each of said children, respectively, upon the decease of said widow. After specifically reciting the annuity of $240 to the widow and $800 to each of said four children, as the consideration of the mortgage, etc., that instrument contains the usual defeasance clause to the effect that, upon the payment of the sums thus secured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the said mortgage, as well \u201c as the said five recited obligations, shall become void and of no effect,\u201d etc. The first mentioned obligation accordingly became \u201c void and of no effect \u201d by payment in full of said annuity to the widow to the date of her decease.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In their statements the plaintiffs aver among other things that the mortgage represents $4,000 of the estate of Emanuel Schaeffer which, by his will, he divided equally among his five children, of whom Edwin M., the mortgagor, was one, and that his interest is claimed by his assignee, Charles L. Schaeffer, one of the equitable plaintiffs; but this averment derives no support whatever from the mortgage in suit. It discloses no interest thereunder in either the mortgagor or his assignee. The only mortgage debt that remained, after payment in full of the annuity to the widow, was the $800 to each of said four children, aggregating the sum of $3,200, with interest from that date. These claims, as we understand, are not disputed by the terretenant, appellant, but that of Edwin M. Schaeffer is denied; and we fail to find in the instrument.sued on anything upon which he or his assignee can possibly base any claim against the terretenant, who became such by purchase of the mortgaged premises subject to the mortgage only, and so far as appears without notice of any other claim than those specified therein. In his affidavit of defense, the terre-tenant distinctly avers, \u201cThat Edwin M. Schaeffer never had any interest as a mortgagee in said mortgage, either in law or in fact, but, on the contrary, he was the mortgagor therein, that he neither created nor reserved for himself any interest or share therein at the time of the execution of said mortgage.\u201d In the face of this averment, and in the absence of anything in the mortgage itself on which to base any claim in favor of Edwin M. Schaeffer, it is impossible to sustain the court below in holding that the affidavit of defense was not sufficient to prevent judgment for the full amount claimed by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The conveyances in the terre-tenant\u2019s chain of title \u201c subject to the mortgage \u201d gave him no notice of anything not set forth in the mortgage. As we have seen, all that the latter \u2014 including the bonds therein recited \u2014 provided for was the payment of the annuity to the widow, and upon her decease, $800 to each of the four children. On the payment of these sums, the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>gage, as well as tbe obligations recited therein, were, in the language of the former, to become \u201c void and of no effect.\u201d The claim set up by the plaintiffs for the additional sum of $800 is in conflict with the plain terms of the written instrument. As clearly appears, it contains no intimation of any such claim or interest in Edwin M. Schaeffer as is asserted in plaintiff\u2019s statement; nor is it averred that the terre-tenant had any notice of such claim prior to his purchase of the mortgaged premises. It is not even suggested that any such provision in favor of the mortgagor was omitted from that instrument by accident or mistake, and hence no effort has been made to reform the instrument on which the scire facias was issued. Nothing can be recovered in this proceeding except so much of the several sums secured thereby as remains unpaid. The $800 sought to be recovered to the use of Edwin M. Shaeffer\u2019s assignee is clearly not one of them. The court below therefore erred in embracing that sum with interest in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
