The undisputed evidence showing that the money for which the note in suit was given was the money of Sarah Jane Slear, the wife of George M. Slear, the defendant, and that this money was borrowed and used by her husband for the purpose of paying part of the purchase money on the farm on which both husband and wife had their home, and upon the income of which they lived, the note in suit does not, standing alone and by itself, establish an agreement on the part of George M. Slear to pay interest on the money of his wife for which the said note was given. <em>Answer: </em>This is affirmed, but the note should he taken into consideration by you with all the other evidence in the cause in determining whether or not Mr. Slear was to pay interest.

Now this contract might not be by merely the note itself, but by that in connection with the other testimony in the case; and if you believe that this note was to draw interest during the life of Mrs. Slear, notwithstanding the'faet that they lived together as husband and wife on the farm, you will find a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.] [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-9\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

It follows that a question might well arise, without contradicting the terms of the note, whether it. was the agreement or intent of the parties that it should not bear interest during the life of the wife. On that question considerable testimony was taken and the learned court below fairly left it to the jury to decide upon all the testimony, including the note itself and the legal intendment arising from it, whether the agreement of the parties was that interest should be paid, or should not be paid, during the life of the wife. The jury has found that it was not to be paid. There was adequate testimony to justify such a finding, and there was no error in submitting the question in that way. It was entirely undisputed that the defendant borrowed the money from his wife to pay on the purchase, or valuation money of a farm which he accepted upon partition proceedings in the orphans\u2019 court, and that he and his wife lived together on the farm until her death, using the proceeds of the farm for that purpose. This fact, together with the direct testimony as to the declarations of the wife that she was not to get any interest during her life, was quite sufficient to raise the question submitted to the jury. The assignments of error are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
