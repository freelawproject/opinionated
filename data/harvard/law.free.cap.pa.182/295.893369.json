D. 1897, letters of administration de bonis non cum testamento annexo were granted by the register of wills of Philadelphia to Joseph M.

At the time of the making of said will and at the time of the death of said testator he was the owner in fee simple of real estate, inter alia, as follows: A certain lot or piece of ground, marked No. 203, on the plan of lands of The Logan Land Association, located and situated in Philadelphia, on the west side of Twenty-seventh street, at'the distance of two hundred and fifty-two feet and six inches (252 ft., 6 in.), southward from the south side of Cumberland street in the twenty-first ward, of the city of Philadelphia, containing in front or breadth, on the said Twenty-seventh street, twenty feet (20 ft.), and extending that breadth, in length or depth, westward, between parallel lines, at right angles with the said Twenty-seventh street, on the north line thereof, one hundred and thirty feet and four and five eighths inches (130 ft., 4f in.), and on the south line thereof, one hundred and thirty-one feet and eleven and three fourths inches (131 ft., Ilf in.), to lands of Henry Duhring.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">3\u00a3. The testator owned other lands in Forest and Yenango counties, Pa., and left personal property of the value of about $30,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">4. That, on the first day of March, 1897, articles of agreement were entered into, between Joseph M. Potts, administrator d. b. n. c. t. a., plaintiff, of the one part, and Joseph P. Breneman, defendant, of the city of Lancaster, of the other part, for a sale of the above described premises, for eleven hundred dollars ($1,100) payable on March 3,1897, on the delivery of the deed, the sale being made for the purpose of distributing the proceeds, under the will of Samuel Miller, deceased. On March 3, 1897, the said Joseph M. Potts, administrator, plaintiff, tendered to the said Joseph P. Breneman, defendant, a deed, sufficient and correct in form, for the above described premises, and demanded the purchase money, eleven hundred dollars ($1,100), according to the agreement, which the said Joseph P. Breneman declined and refused to pay, admitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that the deed was sufficient in form ; that the title of Samuel Miller in said premises was complete; that there were no liens or incumbrances on said property; that all the debts of said Samuel Miller had been paid, but averring that under the will of said Samuel Miller the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. had no power to sell; that said power in the executrix terminated with and at the death of Eliza Miller, and that the said Joseph M. Potts, administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. could not make a legal conveyance of and title to said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-5\">5. That all the debts of Samuel Miller, deceased, were paid by his executrix named in the will within a year after his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">And, by the case stated, the court is asked if it shall be of opinion that, under the said will of Samuel Miller, deceased, and the grant of letters of administration d. b. n. c. t. a. to Joseph M. Potts, the said administrator had power, under said will, to sell said real estate, and to make a good and legal title to Joseph P. Breneman, the said defendant, to enter judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of eleven hundred dollars ($1,100); but, if the court shall be of opinion that the said power to sell cannot be exercised by the said administrator d. b. n. c. t. a., and that said plaintiff had not power to make a good and legal title to said real estate, then to enter judgment for the defendant, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">The question presented for our consideration and determination in the case thus presented is whether or not Mr. Joseph M. Potts, administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of Samuel Miller, late of the city of Philadelphia, deceased, has power and authority, under the will of Samuel Miller, deceased, to sell the real estate of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-8\">That, by his will, the testator gave to his wife, and subsequently widow, Eliza Miller, a life estate in all his real estate and personal property, subject to the annuity of Mary McCullouch, and after the decease of his wife he bequeathed and devised the remainder of his estate, real, personal and mixed, unto all his brothers and sisters then living, and the issue and descendants of any of them then dead, and Edith Fodell (then), the wife of John A. Shulze, if then living, and her issue and descendants if she be then dead, their heirs and assigns, per stirpes, in equal shares and parts, subject to the payment of the annuity of $800 to Mary McCullouch, annually, during her life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>cannot be questioned, is not denied. He made his wife, Eliza Miller, sole executrix of his will, and gave her \u201cpower and authority to sell, dispose of and convey, in fee simple, any, or all of his real estate,\u201d and to change any investments of his personal property, as she should deem most advantageous to her and to his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">Eliza Miller, the executrix, died in December 1896, and in January, 1897, letters of administration d. b. n. c. t. a. were duly granted to Joseph M. Potts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">As appears by Exhibit \u201c B,\u201d attached to and filed with the case stated, there are about sixty persons who are now entitled to participate in the distribution of this estate, who, so far as known, are scattered through the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, District of Columbia, Oregon, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois and Kansas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-7\">By the act of assembly of March 12, 1800, sec. 3, it is provided that, \u201c If, where such devises as aforesaid have been or shall be made, or authorities and directions given, such executor or executors are deceased, or shall hereafter die, or have refused, or shall hereafter refuse, or have renounced, or shall renounce, and letters of administration with the will annexed have been, or shall be granted, it shall and may be lawful for such administrators with the will annexed to sell and convey such real estates, and otherwise act respecting the same as fully and completely as if such deceased, refusing or renouncing executor or executors, might or could have done, were he, she or they still living, or had he, she or they accepted the execution of the last wills and testaments of such testators, or had not renounced.\u201d And, by the act of February 24, 1834, it is provided that:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-8\">\u201c Sec. 13.

The powers of executors c. t. a. under these acts have been the subject of numerous decisions which have clearly and definitely established the principles and rules of law, and it only remains to determine whether or not the facts as presented in any particular cases fit them. Some of those rules of law may be stated thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-7\">1. A power to sell for the purpose of distributing the proceeds amongst persons who are named or described in the will is a power which belongs to the executor, virtute officii.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-8\">2. Where there is no limitation as to the time of exercising the power of sale given to executors in a will, the same may be controlled within a certain period, ascertainable from the general scheme and purpose of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-9\">3. The duration of an executor\u2019s power to sell real estate depends upon the intent of the testator, and where the will shows that the testator gave this power for a particular purpose the power ceases to exist after that purpose has been accomplished or has become impossible or unattainable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-10\">4. Where power is given by will to executors to sell real estate, with a view to the distribution of the proceeds among legatees, such power belongs to the executors virtute officii.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-11\">Was not the intention of Samuel Miller, the testator, to give his executrix, or her successor, power to sell his real estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>with a view to distribute the proceeds thereof, with his personal estate among the legatees named and specified in his will?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\">From the terms of the case stated, we learn that Samuel Miller, the testator, left a considerable estate, real and personal. His widow survived him more than twenty years. At the time of her decease, and we may say, presumably, at the time of the testator\u2019s decease, his relatives, heirs and legatees, as we have seen, were scattered over (many of) the United States. While he gave his wife the use, income and profits of his estate, she was given no power to use or consume any part of the corpus or principal. She had full power and authority to \u201c sell the lands and to change the investments and securities.\u201d Under the will she was undoubtedly authorized to convert the whole estate into money at any time she chose, and to have it in this form, for distribution at the time of her death, there need have been no real estate to be sold after her death, if she had seen proper to sell it during her life. It will be observed that the. power to sell is not given to her nominatim merely, nor to her .... as his wife or widow, as life tenant, or as the beneficiary of the trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">In the first item of his will he gives to his'wife his house, furniture and household goods. In the second item he gives to his wife the use, rents and income of his estate. In the next clause he gives the residue to his brothers and sisters or their descendants, living at the time of his death, and to Edith Fodell. And finally he appoints his wife, Eliza Miller, \u201c sole executrix of this my last will and testament,\u201d and as such, \u201c with power and authority, to sell, dispose of and convey in fee simple, any, or all of my real estate, and change any investments of my personal property as she shall deem most advantageous to my estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">It is argued on the part of the defendant that \u201c the wording of the will shows that the power was to end with the life of the widow, for the words of the will are, \u201c I direct that my said wife shall not be required by any court, to give security, to secure the interest of the person or persons entitled in remainder to any part, or portion of my estate; \u201d that \u201c this clearly shows that it was the intention of the testator to give only his executor power to sell, and, if not so sold, the power was to die with her death; that remainder refers only to real estate, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>testator intended the persons entitled to portions of his estate after the death of his widow to take the real estate remaining unsold; \u201d that \u201c a remainder is a remnant of an estate in lands or tenements, expectant upon a particular estate, created together with the same at one time.\u2019.\u2019 And this is correct, in cases like those cited, where a power of sale is given with the express purpose of raising money to pay devisees, special legacies, etc. The power to sell was exhausted when there was enough sold and converted to accomplish such purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">In the case under consideration there is no such limitation. The testator says : \u201cAfter the decease of my .said wife, I give, devise and bequeath, the said residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, unto all my brothers and sisters then living, and the issue and descendants of any of them then dead,\u201d etc., and, in Commonwealth v. Hackett, 102 Pa. 505,' the Supreme Court say: \u201c A testamentary clause, disposing of \u2018 all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate,\u2019 will, in the absence of a contrary intention apparent in the will, pass residuary realty as well as personalty, and by virtue of the act of April 8, 1838, after acquired real estate will pass under such clause\u201d in a will. And in Darlington\u2019s Case, 160 Pa. 70, cited by defendant, it is said that a conversion of real estate into personalty is worked when there is \u201c such a blending of realty and personalty by the testator in his will as to show that he intended to create a fund out of both real and personal estate and to bequeath the same as money.\u201d Just such is the case here. The testator makes no devise of any portion of his real estate as such to any person named in his will, but blends his whole estate, \u201c the whole of the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed,\u201d into one mass, one fund for distribution, and distributes it, or rather orders it to be distributed as money, thus rendering it necessary that his real estate should be sold for the purposes of distribution, for the purpose of carrying out the testator\u2019s disposition of his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">In Ross v. Barclay, 18 Pa. 183, the Supreme Court, Gibson, C. J., held that by virtue and force of the act of February 24, 1834 (before cited), relating to executors and administrators, an \u201c administrator with the will annexed \u201d may execute a power to sell in order to bring the land into a course of administration, but not to execute a trust for a collateral pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>pose; that the 67th section of the act puts an administrator with the will annexed on a footing with a surviving executor, but not on a footing with a testamentary trustee, and the rule, thus stated, has been in the main adhered to in subsequent decisions. In Gray v. Henderson et al., 71 Pa. 368, it is said that, by the act of February 24, 1834, sec. 12, it is enough if, in any part of the will, the intention be expressed, to confer a power of sale on executors; and the power is implied when the distribution and management of the fund arising from a sale is expressly confided to the executor, or when it is confounded by the testator in one common fund with the personalty (as here), although there be no express direction to the executor to distribute it. While in Waters v. Margerum, 60 Pa. 44, ShabsWOO\u00bb, J., held that the deed by the administrator d. b. n. conveyed no title, because the power to sell given by the will to the executors was not for the payment of debts, but for distribution among legatees and for investment; in Evans v. Chew, 71 Pa. 49, Sbabs'WOOD, J., delivering the opinion of the court of nisi prius, modified this decision somewhat by expressly deciding that administrators c. t. a. had all the power given to executors virtute officii; that the general power to sell will be presumed to be for the payment of debts, and that a power to sell for the purpose of distributing the proceeds amongst persons named in the will is a power belonging to the executor \u201c virtute officii,\u201d as well where the power is discretionary, as where the direction is absolute. In view of the former dicta of Chief Justice Gibson, and of what Justice Shabswood admits to have been a slip on his part, and inasmuch as the opinion of Justice Shabswood at nisi prius is adopted by the court, per curiam, in Evans v. Chew, it is interesting as well as highly important to this case to note the opinion of the court: \u201c A general power to sell will of course be conclusively presumed to be for the payment of debts; for a purchaser is never required to call for or look into an account, or to demand an inventory of personalty or list of debts. Such was the power in Meredith\u2019s Estate, 1 Parsons 433. Mr. Binney\u2019s opinion, Hood on Executors, 241 and note. About the authority of an administrator with the will annexed in such a case there could be no question. A power also to sell for the purpose of distributing the proceeds amongst persons named or described in the will is a power which, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>seems equally clear, belongs to the executor virtute officii. This would seem to he the case without question where there is an absolute direction to sell, and not a mere discretionary power, for in that cas\u00e9 the estate would be converted into money from the death of the testator; but the same rule, as it appears to me,applies where there is only a power. In the case of Keefer v. Schwartz, 47 Pa. 503, there was indeed an absolute direction, but it is not rested upon that ground in the opinion. Mr. Justice Strong said : 1 The executors were not made testamentary trustees of the property. They were directed to sell for distribution. Their powers and duties were official by virtue of their office.\u2019 Some difficulty appears to have arisen in the minds of counsel, from what was evidently merely a dictum of Gibson, C. J., in Ross v. Barclay, that \u2018 no statute of Pennsylvania empowers an administrator with the will annexed to execute a trust of land confided to an executor by title or name for any other purpose than to sell for payment of debts ; \u2019 and his declaration in the same case that a power could not be exercised by such administrator \u2018to turn the land into money for the convenience of partition.\u2019 This last phrase is repeated in Waters v. Margerum. In both these cases the trust extended beyond the sale and distribution, virtute officii, to an investment; in short, a trust for a collateral purpose. The executors were, in both of these cases, testamentary trustees, and they were invested with power as such. These dicta were, therefore, entirely aside from the case. For myself I- may say that I copied the phrase from Ross v. Barclay, as is often done, in the hurry of composition, and it passed without notice in consultation. I may have, and probably had in my mind, not a sale for the purpose of distribution, but, what is not uncommon in the country, a power to executors to make partition, with an ancillary power of sale and conveyance for that purpose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\">It might, therefore, well be assumed that this case established in Pennsylvania the rule of law that a power to sell for the purpose of distributing the proceeds amongst persons named or described in a will is a power belonging to an executor virtute officii, and is transmitted to the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">In Lantz v. Boyer, 81 Pa. 325, the real estate was devised to the wife for life, and in case the wife should so desire, and the executors deem it for the best interests of wife and children, they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>authorized to sell the same. The executors were discharged, and letters of administration d. b. n. c. t. a. granted to Boyer. Sharswood, J., again delivering the opinion, the court held that \u201c it may now be considered as definitely settled that whenever a power is given by will to executors to sell real estate with a view to the distribution of the proceeds among legatees, such power belongs to them virtute officii, and may be exercised by an administrator de bonis non with the will annexed. ... It seems equally clear that it mates no difference whether the distribution is to be immediate or upon the expiration of a certain period-of time, or upon the uncertain contingency of a life or lives. In the case before us, the life estate was given to the widow, and absolute direction to the executrix to sell, if she should desire it, and the proceeds of the sale to be invested in good real estate security, the interest to be paid to the widow for her life, and a part of the principal, if she should desire, to be invested in a house for her use for life.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-6\">In that case the residue was to be distributed under the intestate laws, and the wife\u2019s share, when her life estate should expire, would be a part of the residue. The court says: \u201c He makes a common fund of his estate, real, personal and mixed, and by whom is the distribution to be made ? By Ms executors, certainly, and that, virtute officii. This duty of distribution then devolved of necessity upon the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. If' so, he must be entitled to receive and invest the fund, and hold it so invested until that period of final distribution shall arrive.\u201d Upon this reasoning it was held that the administrator, with the will annexed, had power to vest in the purchaser a title to the real estate. We might refer to other cases in further illustration, but this seems to fit the case under consideration in all material points with such great precision that we forbear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-7\">In this case Samuel Miller most unquestionably gave his executrix power to sell all Ms real estate with a view to and for the purpose of distribution. He had no children. His wife was not to have, receive or take any portion of the corpus of his estate for her use or benefit during\" life.

When his wife died, and the estate came to be distributed, his executrix was dead, and an administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. was, as we have seen, duly appointed. The power of sale was absolute, and belonged to the executrix virtute officii, and, therefore, may be properly and legally exercised, the real estate sold, the estate settled and distribution made as directed by the will, by the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. under and by virtue of the provisions of the act of February 24, 1834.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-4\">The court being of opinion that under the said will of said Samuel Miller, deceased, and the grant of letters of administration d. b. n. c. t. a. to Joseph M.

In Wilkinson v. Buist, 124 Pa. 258, this Court held, under the terms of that will, the power to sell ended with the life estate, because the testator plainly so intended. In Fidler et al. v. Lash, 125 Pa. 87, the sole purpose in creating the power to sell was to provide for the widow during her lifetime. Necessarily, the intention was, that it should end with her death. In Swift\u2019s Appeal, 87 Pa. 502, the fact, as found by the court, was, that enough realty had been sold to pay the devises; that for this purpose alone the power had been conferred, and when the purpose was accomplished the power was exhausted. There is, really, no conflict in these cases with those cited by the court. The direction that his wife should not be required to give security for the interests of the persons \u201centitled in remainder\u201d and the words \u201cbequeath the said residue and remainder of my estate \u201d are not significant of a limitation of the power, in view of the whole will, and especially of the codicil. True, technically, a remainder is an estate in land, limited to take effect and to be enjoyed after another estate is determined; and such estate vests immediately on the death of the donor, to be enjoyed in possession after the determination of the particular estate. But the testator, manifestly, here used these technical words in the sense of \u201c balance of,\u201d \u201c what is left,\u201d or \u201c what may remain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The judgment is affirmed on the opinion of the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
