Co., June Term, 1893, No. 674, overruling exceptions to report of master.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AX7\">Before Green, Williams, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.</judges>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A7S\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-10\">Exceptions to master\u2019s report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-11\">The case was refered to A. T. Frebdley, Esq., as master, who, after reciting the facts found by him in Handy\u2019s Estate, 167 Pa. 554-8, reported as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-12\">Upon these facts on the former appeal, 167 Pa. 552, the Supreme Court held : 1. That this case was a proper one for the court to exercise the jurisdiction conferred by the act of 1876, by staying the execution issued by Larned <em>&amp; </em>Haas, and directing that a sale be made by the assignee for the benefit of creditors ; and 2. That the interest to be sold should be the three sixteenths undivided interest in remainder of E. S. Handy, Jr., in the entire estate of his father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-13\">The Supreme Court further referred the case back to the master to ascertain the liens upon said undivided interest, if any, which would remain after the said sale, and those which would be discharged by such sale,' together with their several amounts and their respective rank of priority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-14\">Upon the second hearing before the master additional testimony was taken and proof made: (a) That the life tenant is now seventy-three years of age. The youngest son, H. H. S<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Handy, is now twenty-nine years of age. (b) As to the value of the real and personal estate of the testator; and (e) that the executors had accounted in the orphans\u2019 court, and had handed over the assets to the trustees named under the will, but that said executors had not been discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">The testimony as to the value of the real and personal estate was, ultimately, conceded by all counsel to be immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">The object of the testimony as to the transfer of the assets by the executors to the trustees was for the purpose of endeavoring to set aside the assignment by E. S. Handy, Jr., of April 29, 1893, to the executors, as being an assignment to one person in trust for another, the counsel for Messrs. Larned &amp; Haas contending that in reality it was an assignment to executors in trust for the trustees, and hence invalid, as not being recorded within thirty days, under the decision in Kern v. Powell, 98 Pa. 253. This point is not an open one before the master. It was directly decided in the former report and affirmed by the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">Even if the point were open the conclusion of the master would be the same. The real creditor is the estate of E. S. Handy, and whether the assignment was made to executors or to trustees would seem to be immaterial, as long as it was for the benefit qf that creditor estate. As matter'of fact the trustees are also executors, together with the widow. The acts of 1818 and 1843 were not intended to apply to this state of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-8\">The only questions before the master are those referred to him by the decision of the Supreme Court, and this depends upon the construction of the will of the testator. By the eighth item of his will the testator devised and bequeathed his estate to the Philadelphia Trust, Safe Deposit and Insurance Company in trust for his wife for life, and after her death directed that the trustees should pay to his sons on their respectively attaining the age of twenty-five and twenty-eight years three fourths of their share in the testator\u2019s estate, their respective shares \u201cbeing one-fourth part of my estate,\u201d the remaining fourth to be held by the trustees under a spendthrift son\u2019s trust. Full powers of sale were given to the said trustees. By the second codicil to his will the testator provided as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-9\">\u201c I hereby revoke the authority given to my said trustees in the ninth item of my will to sell my real estate in the city of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Philadelphia and I further direct that upon the death of my wife my said trustees shall divide my estate both real and personal into four equal shares and one equal share shall be held by my said trustees for each one of my said children upon the trusts and for the same purposes as are set forth in my will, and for no other trust or purpose whatsoever. And of this division and allotment they shall cause a record to be made in the office of the recorder of deeds for the county of Philadelphia. I authorize my trustees however to sell any vacant lots on Kensington or Lehigh avenues of which I may die seized whenever they can do so advantageously.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-4\">By the third codicil the testator empowered his trustees to sell any of his real estate except that situated in the nineteenth and twentieth wards of the city of Philadelphia, and his Digby residence, the latter restriction being under certain conditions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-5\">In alluding to the nature of the interests thus created the first report of the master stated:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-6\">\u201c Under the will of the testator, while the said E. S. Handy, Jr., has a vested remainder in three sixteenths of the entire estate of the testator, yet it is doubtful whether any title vests in the said E. S. Handy, Jr., in any specific piece of property constituting that three sixteenths interest. The testator by his second codicil directs that after the death of the widow the said trustees shall divide his estate, both real and personal, into four equal shares, which are to be held and disposed of as provided in the will, and that the said trustees shall make a record of this division and allotment in the office of the recorder of deeds. It is the trustees who are to make this division, and although the allotments may be equal in gross they are not necessarily specific interests in each specific piece of property. Authority to partition implies authority to make equality \u2014 one house may be assigned to one distributee and another house to another. It was to prevent the necessity of the distributees holding together undivided interests in common, and being compelled to resort to partition by bill in equity and consequent sales of interests, that the testator provided for division and allotment by the trustees. To vest the title in specific pieces of property in the distributees the allotment and division was ordered to be recorded in the recorder of deeds office. The sole restriction upon the trustees\u2019 powers is that such division and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>allotment shall be equal in gross to similar divisions and allotments to other distributees.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">Upon appeal the Supreme Court, per Mr. Justice Mitchell, said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">\u201c As will be noticed more fully hereafter no specific gift is made to him (E. S. Handy, Jr.) of any part of the estate, real or personal, but only a share in the sum total of the value of both, and it is open to argument that his interest in realty as such will begin only in the event of any realty being set apart to him in the division which the trustees shall make hereafter. That his interest in the estate as a whole is vested and liable for the payment of his debts, as the master held, does not settle the question of its present liability as land to the lien of a judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">And the learned justice further said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-8\">\u201c Moreover, of what the debtor\u2019s share shall finally consist as to realty or personalty is and must remain entirely uncertain and contingent until after the death of the life tenant, when the trustees are to make partition and distribution in their unfettered discretion, so that they make \u2018 four equal shares,\u2019 and until that time there is a power of conversion in the trustees as to a considerable portion of the realty by a sale, which would under the will be paramount to any interest of Handy, Jr., or a purchaser of his title in any part of the realty. Nothing could be more utterly vain and speculative than an attempt to fix the valu\u00e9 of the debtor\u2019s interest in the real estate under such circumstances. He may not have any real estate at all, for, as the personalty is more than two thirds of the whole, the trustees may allot his entire share in personalty; or on the other hand, they may put it all in realty, with or without owelty. The one thing in all this maze, which is capable of even an approximate estimation, is the general value of his interest in his father\u2019s estate as a whole, real and personal combined.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-9\">And in deciding that a creditor would not have a right to use his lien as equivalent to money in bidding at the sale, the learned justice further said that this resulted\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-10\"><em>\u201c </em>By the testator\u2019s act, in giving his son an undivided remainder in the blended real and personal estate, so that the latter\u2019s interest in the realty alone, if any he has, is impossible of present ascertainment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The question, however, although so directly alluded to, was not decided. Hence, in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court the master proceeds to ascertain\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-4\">1. What liens exist against the interest of E. S. Handy, Jr. ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-5\">Messrs. Lamed &amp; Haas claim a lien against the interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., in the real estate of his father by virtue of their judgment of July 11, 1893. As a judgment is not a lien upon personalty, and as execution was not here issued until after the assignment for the benefit of creditors, the question is whether E. S. Handy, Jr., has such an interest in land as is bound by the lien of a judgment. In Pennsylvania a judgment binds equitable, reversionary, and even inchoate interests, but those interests must be estates in the land, and unless the debtor has an interest in specific real estate which he could himself convey, a judgment against such debtor is not a lien against said real estate. In Morrow v. Brenizer, 2 Rawle, 188, Chief Justice Gibson said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-6\">\u201c It is supposed that a judgment is a lien on every possible interest in land, whether immediate or remote, actual or contingent. This takes for granted that the legatee had in fact an interest in the land. . . . But, it is proper to remark, that both the major and minor are untrue. The interest of a mortgagee, judgment creditor, owner of a legacy charged on land, creditor of an intestate estate, mechanic or material man, or of a preferred creditor under an assignment to trustees (to each of whom the land is debtor), is not the subject of judgment and execution. Nothing is such but an immediate interest, as, for instance, the estate of a tenant by the curtesy <em>initiate; </em>or of a widow, whose interest is put, by the intestate acts, on the footing of a rent charge. The only thing peculiar to a judgment with us is that it binds an equitable, or even an inchoate interest, but that interest must be an estate in the land.\u201d So in Thomas v. Simpson, 3 Pa. 69, the court said: \u201c In Pennsylvania a judgment is a lien on every kind of equitable as well as legal interest in land vested in the debtor at the time of the judgment, and such interest may be seized and sold in execution in payment of debts. A rent charge on estates of a tenant by curtesy initiate; or widow\u2019s dower, her interest being put by the intestate acts on the footing of a rent charge; or right or title in land, although unaccompanied by <em>possession; </em>in short, every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>interest, of every description, provided it be an interest in the land, may, in this state, be sold on execution.\u201d To tbe same effect are Allison v. Wilson, 13 S. &amp; R. 330; Hess v. Sborb, 7 Pa. 231. Hence it has been held that a judgment is not a lien upon the right to live upon land belonging to another: Calhoun v. Jester, 11 Pa. 474. Nor upon an easement consisting of a right of way or occupation of certain land: Western Penna. R. Co. v. Johnston, 59 Pa. 294. This principle was applied in a different form in Colhoun v. Snider, 6 Binn. 135; Ross\u2019s Appeal, 106 Pa. 82; Waters\u2019s Appeal, 35 Pa. 523.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-3\">Applying these principles, it will be observed that under the will, while the interest of a son is vested, yet that such interest is a general interest in the testator\u2019s entire estate, and not in any separate or distinct item thereof. The sole right of the distributees is, after the death of the widow, to receive something which will amount to one fourth of the entire estate of the testator, and this is to be worked out by the trustees alone, and it is their decision and allotment which the testator directs shall be recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds, which alone vests the title in specific pieces of property. Prior to allotment, of what real estate is E. S. Handy, Jr., seized? What specific land could he convey ? Upon what real estate could the sheriff post his notices of execution ? The interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., is not a three sixteenths interest in each piece of land of which the testator died seized, for that would imply a jurisdiction to compel the trustees to allot a three sixteenths interest in each tract or house to the said E. S. Handy, Jr. The only control which E. S. Handy, Jr., has over the trustees, and his only present specific interest in the estate, is an interest to compel a proper execution of the trust, viz: to compel an allotment of one equal fourth part to the said E. S. Handy, Jr. He has no interest to compel the allotment of specific items of the estate. That discretion the testator has vested in his trustees by the second codicil, and this clause has been decided by the Supreme Court and held to empower the trustees to make allotment \u201c in their unfettered discretion,\u201d the only limitation being that it shall be divided into \u201c four equal shares: \u201d Handy\u2019s Estate, 167 Pa. 564. The trustees could allot one share in personalty, provided that it was equal in value to every other share. Under the evidence there is ample personalty to make such allotment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>scheme of the testator is apparently not to invest any child with any specific interest in any specific property prior to allotment and division by the trustees. The powers of sale vested in the trustees as to many properties would lead to the same conclusion as to the testator\u2019s intention, for a sale of any piece of real estate by the trustees under their power would defeat the title of a judgment creditor, and searches would not be taken out against the cestuis que trust, who are distributees. Under the statute executors who are given powers of sale are invested with the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-4\">The interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., under the present will would seem to be somewhat analogous to the interest of the distributees in Chew\u2019s Executors v. Chew, 28 Pa. 17, where a testator authorized his executors, after they had obtained knowledge of the condition of his estate, to convey at their discretion lands to his children as the executors might select; and it was held that the children had no estate in the land until it was conveyed to them by said executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">The fact that the will does not operate as a conversion, as has been argued, does not affect the determination of tins question. If there was a conversion; of course no lien by judgment would attach. But because there is no conversion it does not follow that the interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., is a specific interest in each piece of real estate of which his father died seized. The rights and interests of E. S. Handy, Jr., are solely conferred by the will of his father, and he takes them in such, manner as the testator chooses to direct, and there is nothing illegal in the testator giving a vested interest in the execution of the trust, and deferring that vesting as to any specific item of his estate within any time regulated by the rule against perpetuities. No illegal injustice to creditors is effected by such provision, for the testator, had he so chosen, could have exempted the entire interest from liability of every kind to creditors by making a spendthrift son trust of the entire interest, instead of as to only one fourth thereof, as he has done. The question is, whether E. S. Handy, Jr., has such a tangible interest in the land of which his father died seized qua land, as entitles a judgment to become a lien thereon, or whether, on the contrary, the interest of E. S. Plandy, Jr., is simply an interest in a blended fund, the specific proportions of which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>impossible to ascertain until division. In the opinion of the master the latter is the correct construction of the testator\u2019s will. To hold that prior to allotment each son is invested with a specific interest in each specific piece of real estate, of which the testator died seized,' whereby executions may be issued, and a specific interest sold in certain described real estate, would seem necessarily to conflict with the plan of distribution provided by the testator, as it divests the trustees of any discretion whatever in mating their allotment and division. By such construction it would necessarily follow that the trustees had no discretion other than to make their allotments so that each share should contain an equal fourth interest in realty and an equal fourth interest in personalty. Whereas the Supreme Court in this case have held that the trustees are to make such \u201c partition and distribution in their unfettered discretion, . . . and the trustee may allot his share in personalty, or on the other hand, they may put it all in realty with or without owelty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">It was, however, argued that all parties in interest had a right to elect to dispense with the execution of the trust, and to take the land as land, and that the judgment given by E. S. Handy, Jr., was evidence of his election to take sufficient land as land as would be necessary to satisfy the judgment. But E. S. Handy, Jr., could not disturb the will by his sole election, and there was no evidence of any election on the part of the other distributee; and, moreover, giving a judgment would seem to be no evidence of such an election on the part of E. S. Handy, Jr. The judgment was establishing by matter of record the validity and amount of an existing indebtedness. Such judgment could be enforced against personalty as well as realty, therein differing from a mortgage, which was held to be a provisional election in Bailey v. Allegheny Bank, 104 Pa. 425. In the last-named case it also appears that all the other distributees under the will had united in an express election. If giving a judgment is to be treated as an election under a will to appropriate land to satisfy the judgment, it might in this case, with equal force, be conversely argued that the prior assignment by E. S. Handy, Jr., of April 29, 1893, to the Philadelphia Trust Company, was equally declaratory of Ms Mtention to elect to appropriate so much personalty as would be necessary to fully satisfy that assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Hence the master reports that the judgment of Lamed &amp; Haas is not a lien upon the interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., in his father\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-4\">The result does not lessen the liability of the interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., to pay his debts, and it does not deprive Lamed &amp; Haas of their rights as creditors. It simply puts them upon an equality with all creditors other than the executors of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">The only other claimants who assert a lien are the executors of the estate. On April 29, 1893, E. S. Handy, Jr., conveyed all his right, title and interest in his father\u2019s estate to the executors to secure the payment of the sum of $42,031.13, the amount stated in the said assignment to be the indebtedness of E. S. Handy, Jr., to the said estate. At this date the trustees, who (except the widow) are also executors, were and are in possession of the estate. It was in the language of the Supreme Court \u201c a valid and effective assignment.\u201d The executors, therefore, have a lien upon the interest of the said E. S. Handy, Jr., under his said assignment of April 29, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">Under the evidence, the amount for which the executors have alien is, as of January 1, 1896, the sum of $44,188.73. As appears in the second original finding of fact, this is composed of three promissory notes, given by E. S. Handy, Jr., to his father, amounting to $24,746, and of the sum of $17,285.13, being the amount due by the said E. S. Handy, Jr., upon the pledge of certain shares of stock loaned him by his father and redeemed by the executors\u2019 payment of this sum of $17,285.13. This last-named indebtedness arose in the lifetime of the testator, the said testator having loaned his son fifty shares of the Philadelphia Trust Company stock, for the purpose of borrowing for the use of his said son such sum as the Philadelphia Trust Company might loan thereon to him. The Philadelphia Trust Company thereupon loaned the said E. S. Handy, Jr., $18,000, which was subsequently reduced by payments to $16,500. On April 29,1893, this sum amounted, with interest, to the aforesaid sum of $17,285.13, and as the stock was more valuable than the amount of the loan, the executors reduced the liability to a cash basis by paying the debt for which it was pledged. As this indebtedness arose from the express act of the testator in Ms lifetime, being in reality a loan of cash by the testator in the form of- stock, which was liquidated in cash by the execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>tors, it would seem that, although not recited in the will, its validity is the same as the other loans made by the testator, which were so set forth in his said will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">The indebtedness of E. S. Handy, Jr., to his father\u2019s estate was stated, by the agreement of April 29, 1893, to be at that date $42,031.13. Apart from this liquidation, the master has investigated the amount of the indebtedness and finds that the sum stated in said agreement is correct, and that all interest thereon had been previously paid or adjusted. The executors presented a claim for interest on the notes held by the testator from 1881' down to the testator\u2019s death in 1889, but this claim was negatived by the evidence and by subsequent admissions. Since the testator\u2019s death the interest on these notes has been paid in full to October, 1895, by deductions from E. S. Handy, Jr.\u2019s share of the income of the estate. The result is, that the total indebtedness of E. S. Handy, Jr., for which the executors have a lien, is, as of January 1,1896, the amount of the notes held by testator, viz. \u2022......$24,746 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">With interest at five per cent from October 2, 1895, to January 1, 1896 ...... 305 89</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-9\">And the additional sum of .... 17,285 13</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-10\">With interest at six per cent to January 1,1896, less' partial payments '......1,85171</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-12\">Making altogether, as of January 1, 1896 . . $44,188 73</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-13\">The assignment of April 29, 1893, was not recorded prior to the judgment of Larned &amp; Haas, but if the master is correct in finding the judgment of Larned <em>&amp; </em>Haas is not a lien it would be unnecessary to discuss the effect of such nonrecording. If, however, the master should err in his decision as to the nature of the interest of E. S. Handy, Jr., in the estate, it would still seem that, as against Larned <em>&amp; </em>Haas, the unrecorded assignment is, under the decision in Davey v. Ruffell, 162 Pa. 443, as valid as if it had been duly lodged for record, for Larned &amp; Haas, being neither purchasers nor mortgagees, but merely judgment creditors, were not within the purview of the recording acts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-14\">Whether the sale will be subject to or discharged from the executor\u2019s lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-15\">The executors joined in the prayer of the assignee\u2019s petition, and by their answer, filed of record, prayed and consented that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the sale might be free and discharged from the lien which they held by virtue of their assignment of April 29,1898, and that their rights should be asserted upon the fund to be produced thereby. The former decree of the master, decreeing a sale discharged from their lien, was made upon their consent. This of course binds them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">Apart from this, the same conclusion would seem to result under general doctrines. Thus, the interest created by the assignment of April 29, 1893, is such an interest by way of lien as would seriously embarrass any private sale attempted to be made by the assignee. In the language of the act of 1876, it is to the \u201c manifest interest of all parties \u201d that the purchasers title shall be a clear and unincumbered title. Otherwise the property would be more or less sacrificed in value, as the purchasers would be compelled to speculate on the duration of the life of the widow in determining how long they could hold the property before being called upon to pay the principal of the lien subject to which they bought it, and the existence of this prior lien and its uncertain duration would also prevent the purchasers from borrowing money thereon by way of mortgage or other charge, and in other ways add to the unmarketability of the title. These contingencies would defeat the obtaining a fair price for the property, and it is obviously the interest of Messrs. Larned &amp; Haas, as well as the assignee, that the sale shall be made in such manner that the largest price can be obtained. The executors are also interested in such result, and hence themselves pray that the sale may be free and discharged from any claim upon their part, and that their rights shall be asserted upon the fund to'be produced thereby. There does not seem to be any rule of law which prevents this. The decisions are the other way, for the indebtedness to secure the payment of which the assignment of April 29, 1893 was executed, in so far as said indebtedness consists of the amounts advanced by the testator, has been decided by the Supreme Court to consist merely of loans and not technical advances; and in so far as said indebtedness is composed of the amount due by E. S. Handy, Jr., upon the stock loaned him by bis father, such indebtedness is also clearly a loan. Hence the entire sum for which the interest of E. S.

The principal question now raised is whether the estate of E. S. Handy, Jr., under his father\u2019s will included any interest in land which would be subject to the lien of a judgment against him. This question was incidentally considered in the former case but in the state of the record then was not decided though some intimation was given of the leaning of the court. The learned master, however, to whom the matter was referred back for the ascertainment of the liens and the effects of the sale upon them, took up the question anew with great learning and ability, and has stated his conclusions with such clearness and accuracy that little more is necessary for us than to express our approval of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The testator left his estate in trust but gave a beneficial interest in one fourth of it to his son E. S. Handy, Jr. The proportionate part was fixed but the specific property of which it should consist was left wholly within the control of the trustees, and could only be determined when they made the division directed by the testator on the death of his widow. Such division is within their absolute discretion, subject only to the requirement that it shall be into equal fourths in value. They may set apart as this son\u2019s share all personalty, or all realty, or a portion of each. Until such allotment he has no vested interest in any part of the land, but only a mere possibility or expectation, not the subject of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Decree affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
