D., 1895, between Oliver J. Lenhart of the county of York, state of Pennsylvania, hereinafter called the party of the first part, and Frank C. Cleaver of the city of Philadelphia, party of the second part, hereinafter mentioned, witnesseth: That the said party of the first part, for and in consideration of the purchase and conveyance to the said party to the second part of two certain creameries, one situated in Dovdr borough, the other situated in Kralltown, together with the machinery, fixtures, etc., contained in the above-mentioned creameries, and the further consideration of the purchase of certain machinery and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>leasehold of one other creamery situated at Wellsville, all of these creameries being situated in the county of York, state of Pennsylvania, the receipt for which is hereby acknowledged by the said party of the first part; he, the said party of the first part, does hereby agree with the said party of the second part that he will not engage in the manufacture of butter, nor in the purchase or sale of milk, either as principal, as an agent or as an employee at any point within a radius of five miles from any of the aforementioned creameries for a period of three years from the date of these presents.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-6\">It was objected to by defendant for the reason that its contents, together with the allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s statement, showed that it was not based on any good and adequate consideration, and that it was therefore void; and for the further reason that in the body, and in another place in the plaintiff\u2019s statement, there is a reference to a previous agreement, which, according to the plaintiff\u2019s statement, shows the consideration, if any, upon which this agreement was based; and therefore it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to produce the previous agreement before offering this one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-7\">The Court: As the case now stands, I will overrule the offer, and give the plaintiff an exception. And I would say, further, that no sufficient consideration appears for the agreement set out in the plaintiff\u2019s statement, unless contained in an agreement of June 29, 1895, as specified therein, which has not been produced or offered in evidence.

In consideration whereof, the said F. C. Cleaver, for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, doth covenant, promise and agree, to and with the said O. J.

Cleaver shall have possession of the creameries; the balance of the purchase money, with five per cent, interest on the same, to be paid April 1, 1896, when and at which time title shall be passed. The said F. C. Cleaver shall have the use of the Big Mount creamery from July 1, 1895, at the yearly rent of $96.00, and shall also have the first chance to purchase the same. And for the true performance of all and every the covenants and agreements aforesaid, each of the said parties bindeth himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, unto the other, his executors, administrators and assigns in the penal sum of ... . dollars firmly by these presents.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">E.

I do not - think that any consideration has been shown for the agreement in suit, nor that the paper last offered, the agreement for the purchase of these creameries by the plaintiff from the defendant, constitutes any consideration for that agreement. They are not contemporaneous agreements, and do not purport tobe. I therefore exclude the offer, and reject the offer also of the original agreement, upon the ground that the plaintiff is bound to show a consideration for the agreement in suit, and has failed to do so.

But, on the other hand, it is well established that there may be, upon a good consideration, and where reasonable ground exists for the restriction, partial restraint of trade, and that an agreement for such purpose is sustainable : Lange v.

Ency. of Law, 834.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A0OQ\">July 15, 1897:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Akd\">Mr. Justice Green,</author>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The consideration of the original contract dated June 6, 1895, for the conveyance and sale of the creameries therein described, was the sum of $5,950 in money, which was to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>paid for the properties. Nothing was said in that contract about any restriction upon the seller, Lenhart, in the conduct of the same business at any time or place. He did not become subject to any duty or obligation to abstain from carrying on the same business thereafter, and hence he was at perfect liberty to do so if he chose. It cannot, therefore, be said that it was any part of the consideration of the contract that Lenhart should not engage in the same business in the future. That contract was consequently completely performed when the conveyances were made and delivered, and money paid according to its terms. It necessarily follows that when the second agreement was made on the 29th of the same month of June, there was nothing left of the first agreement which could operate as a consideration of the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">There is practically no dispute as to the law in regard to this class of contracts. The agreement in suit is a contract in partial restraint of trade. As such, under all the .authorities, it must, as one of the essential elements, be founded upon a good and sufficient consideration. In Keeler v. Taylor, 53 Pa. 467, Woodward, C. J., delivering the opinion, said: \u201cThe general rule is that all restraints of trade, if nothing more appear, are bad. This was the rule laid down in the famous case of Mitchel v. Reynolds, 1 P. Wms. 181. But to this general rule there are some exceptions, as, if the restraint be only particular in respect to time or place, and there be a good consideration given to the party restrained. . . . The cases are fully collected in Smith\u2019s note to Mitchel v. Reynolds, 1 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, and from them it will be seen that all such contracts to be good at law must be founded in a valuable consideration, must be reasonable, and must impose no general restraint upon trade and industry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The same doctrine was repeated in Gompers v. Rochester, 56 Pa. 194, where Thompson, C. J., said: \u201c Agreements in restraint of trade generally, are void. They are not so when limited in time, or partial in their operation, and when there is a sufficient consideration.\u201d And again in Harkinson\u2019s Appeal, 78 Pa. 196, Mbrcxjr, J., said: \u201cIt must be borne in mind that agreements in restraint of trade generally are void. To give validity to them they must be limited in time, or partial in their operation, and be supported by a sufficient consideration. \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Thus it will be seen that in all these utterances the necessity of a sufficient or valuable consideration is expressed as a requirement additional to the other requirements as to time and place. In all the cases it is also held that the restraining condition must not be involved in any doubt or uncertainty, and all the elements necessary to its validity must appear affirmatively. An instance of this kind appears in the case of Hall\u2019s Appeal, 60 Pa. 458. It was a written agreement of sale of the stock and good will of an undertaking business in Philadelphia for |3,000, and the restraining condition did not appear in the writing, though there was a blank of seven lines left in the instrument, which it was contended, was left for the insertion of such a condition, and there was some verbal testimony of that kind, and also that the seller had said it was unnecessary to have a written agreement to that effect, as he did not intend ever to go into business again in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">There was also some other verbal testimony to similar dec\u00eda- - rations of the seller made afterwards. The case was a bill for an injunction to restrain the seller from again engaging in the same business in Philadelphia. Williams, J., delivering the opinion said, \u201cWe have no doubt of the validity of such a contract, as is alleged in the bill, if founded on a sufficient consideration, or of the power of the court to restrain its breach by injunction. Our doubt in this case arises from the insufficiency of the proof to establish the existence of the alleged agreement. It cannot be inferred from the sale of the good will of the business and it is expressly denied in the answer. The sealed agreement between the parties given in evidence by the plaintiff, contains no stipulation or covenant on the part of the defendant, either to retire from the business, or not to resume it again in the city of Philadelphia, and in this respect it fully corroborates and sustains the hnswer.\u201d The judge then shows that the verbal testimony was insufficient to establish the restraining condition and he proceeds thus, \u201c As the alleged agreement is in restraint of trade its existence should be established by clear and satisfactory evidence, in order to justify the court in restraining its breach by injunction. There should be no doubt or uncertainty in regard to its terms, or the consideration upon which it was founded.\u201d Other cases are to the same effect as all of the foregoing, but it is not necessary to cite them.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>In the present case there is no doubt about the- terms of the restraining agreement. It is sufficiently specific as to time and place within which the restraint is to be operative. But it has no consideration to support it. The previous sale being complete in all respects, the duty of the parties on both sides was clearly defined, and the obligation to perform it was comprehended within its express provisions. The agreement in restraint was no part of its terms and there was no obligation on the part of Lenhart to restrain his operations thereafter. It was held in Wimer v. Overseers, 104 Pa. 317, that where a legal obligation exists, a cumulative promise to perform it unless upon a new consideration, is a nullity. Hence the obligation of Lenhart to perfect the sale under the first agreement and the obligation of Cleaver to comply with its terms could not be a consideration for the restraining agreement of the subsequent date. The latter paper was a mere voluntary agreement in restraint of trade and, as such, cannot have legal sanction. The assignments of error are all dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
