We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Bohmer was injured in February, 1992, while employed by Lybeck\u2019s Dairy (Lybeck\u2019s). Lybeck\u2019s was not covered by workers\u2019 compensation insurance at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Bohmer subsequently filed an independent cause of action in the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, pursuant \u2014 insofar as is relevant here \u2014 to \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, which provides for an action against an employer not enrolled in a workers\u2019 compensation plan as required by law. In an amended order dated November 18, 1993, the District Court stayed its proceedings pending a determination by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court of the extent of Bohmer\u2019s injuries and calculation of damages to which he would be entitled under \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, or, in the alternative, that it did not have jurisdiction to act in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Bohmer then petitioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for a hearing. Lybeck\u2019s moved to dismiss the petition, asserting lack of jurisdiction in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. The court granted the motion to dismiss and Bohmer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">The issue before us is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had jurisdiction to determine the compensation to which an employee is entitled from an uninsured employer pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-515(4), MCA. The court concluded that it did not. It reasoned that it did have jurisdiction over the action pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, but that the District Court acquired jurisdiction first under \u00a7 39-71-516, MCA, and, therefore, retained jurisdiction to dispose of the entire \u00e1ction.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">The resolution of this issue hinges on the appropriate interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-2905 and 39-71-516, MCA. \u201c[Wjhen several statutes may apply to a given situation, the construction adopted should be one which will harmonize the several statutes and, if possible, give effect to all.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Montana Power Co. v. Fondren </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>(1987), 226 Mont. 500, 506, 737 P.2d 1138, 1141. We review legal conclusions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to determine whether they are correct. <em>Lund v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 346, 348, 868 P.2d 611, 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\">While we disagree with the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, insofar as it relates to \u00a7 39-71-516, MCA, we conclude that the court\u2019s ultimate decision that it did not have jurisdiction is correct. We will affirm a court\u2019s correct result regardless of its reasoning. <em>Higham v. City of Red Lodge </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 400, 402, 807 P.2d 195, 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Prior to 1985, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s statutory grant of jurisdiction gave it \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to make determinations concerning disputes under chapter 71 [Montana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act].\u201d Section 39-71-2905, MCA (1983). In 1985, the Montana legislature passed House Bill 529. Section 6 of the bill \u2014 later codified as \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA \u2014 established \u201can independent cause of action [by an injured employee] against an uninsured employer for failure to be enrolled in a compensation plan as required by [chapter 71];\u201d damages recoverable in the action are the amounts the employee would have received if the employer had been properly enrolled in a compensation plan. Chap. 601, 1985 Mont. Laws 1258. Section 7 of House Bill 529 \u2014 codified as \u00a7 39-71-516, MCA \u2014 provided for district court jurisdiction over the new cause of action by requiring that an employee \u201cpursuing an independent cause of action pursuant to [39-71-515] must bring such action in the district court ....\u201d Chap. 601, 1985 Mont. Laws 1258. Finally, Section 11 of House Bill 529 amended the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s jurisdictional grant to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">39-71-2905 ... The workers\u2019 compensation judge has exclusive jurisdiction to make determinations concerning disputes under chapter 71, <em>except as provided in [39-71-516],</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Chap. 601, 1985 Mont. Laws 1259 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">As stated above, a proper interpretation must give effect to both \u00a7 39-71-516, MCA, as enacted, and \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, as amended. The legislature first created the.\u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, cause of action and then clearly and unequivocally vested jurisdiction over the action in the district courts. It finished by amending the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s statutory jurisdictional grant to provide an exception for a cause of action filed in district court pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-516, MCA. The interpretation which harmonizes and gives effect to both \u00a7 39-71-516, MCA, and \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, is that, via these actions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the legislature intended to prevent the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court from exercising jurisdiction over the new cause of action over which it specifically vested jurisdiction in the district courts. We conclude, therefore, that the exception contained in \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, excludes \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, causes of action from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s interpretation of the two statutes does not give sufficient effect to the statutory requirement that an employee file a \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, cause of action in the district court. Interpreting the exception in \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, as modifying the \u201cexclusive\u201d nature of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s jurisdiction results in shared, or concurrent, jurisdiction over \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, actions in that court and district courts. Such an interpretation is inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s clear grant of jurisdiction to district courts in \u00a7 39-71-516, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Bohmer\u2019s argument that the jurisdiction vested in the district courts pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-516, MCA, is confined to the liability issues raised in \u00a7 39-71-515(2), MCA, is not persuasive. Such an interpretation would limit the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction to questions relating to Lybeck\u2019s failure to enroll in a compensation plan and would exclude the damages issue which is an integral element of the cause of action. Our function in interpreting statutes is to \u201cascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Given the legislature\u2019s clear intent to require the filing of \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, actions in the district courts, we decline to insert a limitation into the statute where none exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to calculate the extent of Bohmer\u2019s injuries and the amount of compensation to which he was entitled. We hold, therefore, that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err by dismissing Bohmer\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Bohmer makes an additional argument concerning whether the District Court should have determined Bohmer\u2019s recoverable damages as a matter of law if it retained jurisdiction in the case. We decline to address this argument relating to proceedings which are not before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">As a final matter, Lybeck\u2019s requests the imposition of sanctions against Bohmer for arguing matters not properly before us and distorting and adding to the record. Sanctions on appeal, in the form of damages, are appropriate if this Court \u201cis satisfied from the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>and the presentation of the appeal... that the same was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds ....\u201d Rule 32, M.R.App.P. After reviewing the record before us, we cannot conclude that Bohmer\u2019s appeal was without reasonable grounds. We conclude that sanctions are not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON, TRIEWEILER and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
