We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-17\">Ms. Stine was employed by the Western Federal Savings Bank of Montana (Western Federal) from August 27, 1979, to January 13, 1993. During all times pertinent to this action, Western Federal had in place an overdraft policy which required employees to maintain a positive balance in any Western Federal account. In the event of an overdraft, employees were required to bring the account to a positive balance by the following business day. If the account were overdrawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>three days within any given month, the employee\u2019s supervisor would be contacted and a reprimand placed in the employee\u2019s personnel file. Finally, the policy provided that additional disciplinary action may be taken if the employee fails to maintain the account in a professional manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">Ms. Stine\u2019s problems with her account began in June of 1991, when her balance fell below zero on June 3, 4 and 11. In accordance with the overdraft policy she was given a letter of reprimand. The letter instructed Ms. Stine, to \u201crefer to the attached checking policy copied from your employment manual,\u201d and to read, sign, date and return the letter. Ms. Stine wrote a note on the bottom of the letter indicating that her failure to keep track of her deposits and withdrawals was the result of being \u201csick with lupus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The second incident occurred in September of 1992, when Ms. Stine\u2019s account showed a negative balance on September 2, 8 and 9. In this instance, Ms. Stine\u2019s supervisor photocopied Western Federal\u2019s policy on overdrafts and added a handwritten note at the bottom indicating that \u201cif any more overdrafts occur additional disciplinary action may be taken which could include termination.\u201d Ms. Stine read and signed this photocopy, including the handwritten note; the photocopy was then placed in her personnel file. Ms. Stine did not mention a medical problem to her supervisor during this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The final incident occurred in January of 1993, when Ms. Stine carried a negative balance on January 5, 6 and 11. She received a written reprimand in the form of a memorandum stating that Western Federal was considering termination based on her failure to properly maintain the account. Ms. Stine responded with a handwritten explanation that she had failed in her recordkeeping. No medical excuse or justification was mentioned. On January 13,1993, Western Federal terminated Ms. Stine\u2019s employment after she failed to remedy the negative balance as required by the policy and further overdrafts occurred on January 12 and 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Following her termination, Ms. Stine filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits with the Unemployment Insurance Division of the Department of Labor and Industry (Department). A claims specialist determined that she was disqualified from receiving benefits because she was discharged for cause associated with her violation of the overdraft policy. Her request for redetermination was denied. Following procedural difficulties not at issue here, Ms. Stine\u2019s claim was scheduled for a hearing on appeal before a Department referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The referee ultimately affirmed the determination, finding that Ms. Stine had been discharged for failure to comply with Western Federal\u2019s policy on overdrafts and that her actions constituted misconduct under \u00a7 39-51-2303, MCA. The referee further found that Ms. Stine\u2019s assertion that the account overdrafts were the result of a medical condition was not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Ms. Stine appealed to the Board of Labor Appeals (Board) which, failing to find any substantial evidence to warrant modification or reversal, adopted the referee\u2019s findings of fact and decision. On judicial review, the District Court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. Ms. Stine appeals. ;</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The issue before us is whether the District Court erred in determining that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">A district court\u2019s review of a decision of the Board of Labor Appeals is limited by \u00a7 39-51-2410(5), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">In any judicial proceeding under 39-51-2406 through 39-51-2410, the findings of the board as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive and the jurisdiction of said court shall be confined to questions of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">A finding is supported by evidence if it is supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla of evidence, but it may be less than a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Reynolds v. Pacific Telecom, Inc. </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 309, 314, 856 P.2d 1365, 1368. Under \u00a7 39-51-2410(5), MCA, a district court is not permitted to balance conflicting evidence in support of and in opposition to the Board\u2019s findings, determine which is the more substantial evidence, or consider where the preponderance of the evidence lies; to do so would substitute the district court\u2019s \u00a1view of the evidence for that of the Board, effectively nullifying the conclusive nature of the Board\u2019s findings. <em>Reynolds, </em>856 P.2d at 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">This Court\u2019s review of the Board\u2019s findings is governed by the same standard. <em>Zimmer-Jackson v. Dept. of Labor </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 357, 360, 752 P.2d 1095, 1098. Therefore, we review the record to determine whether substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Ms. Stine challenges the Board\u2019s general finding that her failure to maintain her account, under these circumstances, amounted to misconduct which disqualifies her from receiving unemployment benefits. Specifically, the Board found that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s actions must be interpreted as a deliberate, intentional or wanton disregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>of the employer\u2019s interest or of the standards of behavior the employer has the right to expect of an employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">In Montana, an employee may be disqualified for unemployment insurance benefits after discharge for \u201cmisconduct connected with the individuals\u2019s work or affecting the individual\u2019s employment.\u201d Section 39-51-2303(1), MCA. Misconduct, as defined by \u00a7 24.11.460(1), ARM, includes conduct by the claimant evincing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">(a) willful or wanton disregard of the rights, title, and interests of a fellow employee or the employer; (b) deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of an employee; (c) carelessness or negligence that causes or would likely cause serious bodily harm to the employer or fellow employee; or (d) carelessness or negligence in such a degree as to show an intentional or substantial disregard for the employer\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In addition, \u00a7 24.11.461(f), ARM, provides that violation of a company rule may, if the rule is reasonable and the claimant knew or should have known of the existence of the rule, be considered misconduct because it signifies a willful and wanton disregard of the rights, title and interests of the employer or a fellow employee. In this regard, Ms. Stine\u2019s reliance on <em>Connolly v. Montana Bd. of Labor Appeals </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 201, 734 P.2d 1211, for this Court\u2019s definition of what constitutes misconduct under \u00a7 39-51-2303, MCA, is misplaced. <em>Connolly </em>was decided prior to the 1988 promulgation of the definitional regulations implementing \u00a7 39-51-2303, MCA. These regulations became effective, January 1, 1989, were relied on by the Board and the District Court in this case, and have not been challenged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Ms. Stine testified that she was aware of Western Federal\u2019s policy regarding overdrafts on employee accounts and, in fact, issued numerous overdrafts leading to three reprimands by Western Federal. Her own testimony provides ample support for the Board\u2019s finding that her conduct constituted a deliberate disregard of the employer\u2019s interest or of the standards of behavior the employer has the right to expect of an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Ms. Stine argues, however, that an ongoing medical condition prevented her from complying with the overdraft policy. She contends that her actions are not intentional or deliberate and do not rise to the level of misconduct we have required in order to disqualify a person from receiving unemployment insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>In <em>LaVe v. Dept. of Labor &amp; Industry </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 339, 780 P.2d 189, we considered whether negligent failure to replace oil in the crankcase of a customer\u2019s automobile constituted \u201cmisconduct\u201d under Montana law. We determined that the employee\u2019s single act of negligence did not manifest sufficient disregard of the employer\u2019s interest to constitute misconduct. <em>LaVe, </em>780 P.2d at 192. Contrasting the situation in <em>LaVe </em>with her own conduct, Ms. Stine argues that because her actions resulted from a medical condition over which she has little, if any, control, they do not even rise to the level of negligence in <em>LaVe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In this latter regard, the record reflects that Ms. Stine did not advise Western Federal that her medical problems caused the September 1992, and January 1993 incidents; nor would she offer any explanation for the increased activity in her checking account in December of 1992, and January of 1993, which led to her numerous overdrafts. This record led to the referee\u2019s determination that Ms. Stine had failed to establish that her repeated violations of Western Federal\u2019s policy were the result of her medical condition. Moreover, <em>LaVe </em>provides no supportfor Ms. Stine. It concerned a situation where the employee had engaged in a single negligent act. <em>LaVe, </em>780 P.2d at 192. Here, Ms. Stine repeatedly violated Western Federal\u2019s overdraft policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Ms. Stine also argues that Western Federal\u2019s post-termination payment of severance benefits demonstrates that her conduct was not intentional and, therefore, does not rise to the level of misconduct. This argument and, indeed, Western Federal\u2019s payment of severance benefits are irrelevant to the issue before us. Western Federal\u2019s policy on severance pay did not require payment of severance benefits to Ms. Stine, and its willingness to provide these benefits based on Ms. Stine\u2019s length of service does not relate to our review of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Ms. Stine\u2019s repeated violation of the overdraft policy manifests a deliberate, intentional or wanton disregard of the employer\u2019s interest or of the standards of behavior the employer has the right to expect of an employee. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not err in affirming the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON, NELSON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
