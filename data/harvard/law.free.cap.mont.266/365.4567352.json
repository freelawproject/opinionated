We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">The sole issue is whether the District Court abused its discretion when it denied the State leave to file an information charging defendant with felony stalking.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">On November 24,1993, the Gallatin County Attorney\u2019s office filed a motion for leave to file an information charging Anthony David, III, with felony stalking in violation of \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA. The motion was accompanied by an affidavit of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">The affidavit set forth the alleged facts as follows. On November 5, 1993, David assaulted Cindy Tadday (Tadday). David left the Tadday residence in Tadday\u2019s car. Tadday immediately applied for a temporary restraining order (TRO). The District Court issued a TRO, and it was served on David that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">On November 6,1993, David telephoned Tadday. He left a message on Tadday\u2019s answering machine that he intended to obey the restraining order and that he was \u201cnot going to cause a single problem.\u201d David <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>also called Tadda/s mother on November 6, claiming he planned to make life \u201chell\u201d for her daughter. Later that day he again telephoned Tadday\u2019s mother and apologized for the earlier call.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Tadday left town on November 6 to avoid contact with David. She stayed with friends and did not go to school or work. Tadday returned home on November 17, 1993, and David repeatedly telephoned her that afternoon. Tadday was able to record portions of two of these calls. In one call, David stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">Please don\u2019t call the cops, my life\u2019s pretty short, my life span is about as long as yours. I\u2019m bringing witnesses to prove that you beat me up. If you have called the cops, I\u2019m fucked. But, I\u2019m not at my house so I have witnesses that say that I didn\u2019t [call]. Please help me get over this. For me to get over this, this is so humiliating, my life is over when your life is. Ah, you know what I\u2019m saying?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A52\">David telephoned Tadday between twelve and sixteen times that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Tadday told the Bozeman, Montana, police department that she believed David was \u201ccrazy.\u201d Tadday stated that she feared him when he was drinking and that she was \u201cscared to death\u201d of him. Tadday also feared that David would attempt to injure her dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The State moved the District Court for leave to file an information on November 24,1993. The court denied the motion on November 29, 1993. The court ruled that probable cause was not established. The court determined that the affidavit did not show threats or intimidation. The court found that while some of the telephone calls \u201cpossibly could have been considered harassing,\u201d they were insufficient to create probable cause that David committed felony stalking. The court also noted that the State had other available means by which to charge David, such as breach of the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied the State\u2019s motion for leave to file an information charging defendant with felony stalking pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Leave to file an information shall be granted when probable cause exists that an offense has been committed by an identified suspect. Section 46-11-201, MCA. The probable cause determination is left to the sound discretion of the district court. A determination of probable cause will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Buckingham </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 252, 256, 783 P.2d 1331, 1334. District court judges should use their common sense when reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>affidavits of probable cause. <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 28, 30, 792 P.2d 1103, 1105. In reviewing such cases, this Court has noted that \u201cthe reviewing court must give special deference to judicial probable cause determinations.\u201d <em>State v. Riley </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 413, 423, 649 P.2d 1273, 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In 1993 the Montana Legislature enacted legislation making certain \u201cstalking\u201d activities illegal. Codified as \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA, the statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">(1) Aperson commits the offense of stalking if the person purposely or knowingly causes another person substantial emotional distress or reasonable apprehension of bodily injury or death by repeatedly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">(a) following the stalked person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">(b) harassing, threatening, or intimidating the stalked person, in person or by phone, by mail, or by other action, device, or method.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Stalking is a felony if it is a second or subsequent offense, or if the defendant was under a judicial restraining order at the time of the alleged conduct. Section 45-5-220(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The affidavit fails to show that David followed Tadday. The affidavit likewise does not show that David threatened or intimidated Tadday. While the affidavit may indicate that David\u2019s conduct might have been harassment, it was within the District Court\u2019s discretion to determine that the affidavit was insufficient to show probable cause that David stalked Tadday.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">The affidavit also presents no showing that David\u2019s alleged stalking activities were the cause of Tadday\u2019s emotional distress or apprehension. The affidavit does not state that Tadday feared David because of the telephone calls; rather, the affidavit seems to indicate just the opposite. Based on the affidavit, the District Court could reasonably assume that Tadday\u2019s apprehension of David was a product of their pre-existing strained relationship. The affidavit states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aju\">Tadday is afraid of the defendant <em>when he is drinking. </em>Tadday has quit going to school and quit going to work so the defendant cannot find her. Tadday told [detective] Welsand she was \u201cscared to death.\u201d... The defendant has told Tadday <em>in the past </em>that he would pour gasoline on her dog and light the dog on fire. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">It was within the court\u2019s discretion to believe that Tadday\u2019s apprehension was not caused by David\u2019s telephone calls on November 6 and 17, but rather from her previous relationship with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>This Court has consistently deferred to the reviewing judge in matters of probable cause determinations. In <em>State ex rel. Juhl v. District Court </em>(1938), 107 Mont. 309, 312-13, 84 P.2d 979, 981, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">Obtaining leave to file an information without a previous examination of the accused before a committing magistrate is not a mere perfunctory matter which should be granted as a matter of course, but rests in the sound discretion of the district judge, upon the showing made to him. ... An abuse of discretion materially prejudicing a substantial right of the accused would be grounds for reversal... the appellate court cannot presume that the trial court exceeded its authority or abused its discretion. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjY\">Based on the affidavit, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the State\u2019s motion for leave to file an information charging David with felony stalking.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We find no merit in the State\u2019s contention that the District Court\u2019s suggestion of alternative charges against David violated the separation of powers doctrine. Art. Ill, Sec.l, Mont. Const. The judge\u2019s closing remarks, \u201cI think there is an adequate remedy in this matter by breach of the restraining order or by breach of the Justice Court order at the time of arraignment in another case,\u201d did not constitute a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Such conduct did not infringe on the State\u2019s prosecutorial discretion. The District Court\u2019s denial of the State\u2019s motion was based upon a lack of probable cause and any statement concerning alternative options available to the State should not be construed as an attempt to dictate what charges the State may bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Since we uphold the District Court\u2019s decision, we need not address respondent\u2019s argument concerning the constitutionality of \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA. We affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-7\">JUSTICES HARRISON, GRAY, HUNT, TRIEWEILER, NELSON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
