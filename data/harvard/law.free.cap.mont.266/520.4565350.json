He asserts error in the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the alleged lesser included offense of negligent endangerment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">Charles Fisch (Fisch) was charged with aggravated assault, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-202(1), MCA. He pleaded not guilty and the case proceeded to a jury trial. In presenting its case, the State of Montana (State) contended that Fisch had knowingly or purposely caused serious bodily injury to his stepson, LaShaun Geehan (Geehan), by shooting him in the back with a .22 caliber rifle. Geehan testified that the shooting arose out of an argument he had with Fisch only moments before the shooting occurred. Fisch\u2019s position was that his actions constituted negligent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">The District Court and counsel settled jury instructions during the second day of the trial. The court refused Fisch\u2019s proposed instruction that the offense of negligent endangerment is a lesser included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>offense of aggravated assault; the court also refused other negligent endangerment-related instructions offered by Fisch.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The jury found Fisch guilty of aggravated assault. The District Court sentenced him to 15 years in the Montana State Prison on the aggravated assault charge, with 5 years suspended, and 7 years\u2019 imprisonment for using a weapon in the commission of the offense, to run consecutively. The court also designated Fisch a dangerous offender. Restitution in the amount of $16,160.94, for Geehan\u2019s medical expenses, was ordered as a condition of the suspended sentence. Fisch appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">Did the District Court err in refusing Fisch\u2019s proposed instruction that negligent endangerment is a lesser included offense of aggravated assault?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">A criminal defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense if, based on the evidence, the jury rationally could find him guilty of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater offense. Section 46-16-607(2), MCA; <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 118, 123, 832 P.2d 370, 373. That entitlement is premised on the offense actually constituting a lesser included offense and the existence of sufficient evidence to support the included offense. The issue before us here is the more fundamental question of whether the District Court erred in concluding that negligent endangerment is not a lesser included offense of aggravated assault under \u00a7 46-1-202(8)(c), MCA. I</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Three alternative definitions of \u201cincluded offenses,\u201d often referred to as lesser included offenses, are contained in \u00a7 46-1-202(8), MCA. Fisch offered his proposed instruction that negligent endangerment is an offense included in aggravated assault under subsection (c) of that statute, which provides that an included offense is one that \u201cdiffers from the offense charged only in the respect that a less serious injury or risk to the same person, ... or a lesser kind of culpability suffices to establish its commission.\u201d Section 46-1-202(8)(c), MCA. We have not previously addressed this specific statutory definition of an included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The offense of aggravated assault is committed if a person \u201cpurposely or knowingly causes serious bodily injury to another.\u201d Section 45-5-202(1), MCA. The offense of negligent endangerment is committed when a person \u201cnegligently engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another ....\u201d Section 45-5-208(1), MCA. Fisch argues that the offense of negligent endangerment requires a lesser mental state <em>and </em>a lesser standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>of harm than aggravated assault and, as a result, that negligent endangerment is a lesser included offense of aggravated assault under \u00a7 46-l-202(8)(c), MCA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The definition of included offense contained in \u00a7 46-l-202(8)(c), MCA, is written in the disjunctive and with an \u201conly\u201d qualifier. Thus, an included offense may differ from the offense charged by way of a less serious injury or a less serious risk or a lesser kind of culpability. In other words, an offense is an included offense under \u00a7 46-1-202(8)(c), MCA, if it differs from the charged offense in one, but only one, of the three ways set forth in the subsection. This careful drafting permits an offense which differs from the charged offense in only one significant respect regarding degree to be an included offense; at the same time, it prevents the \u201cinclusion\u201d of offenses which differ sharply in several respects from the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Fisch\u2019s underlying position is that two (or, perhaps, all three) of the subsection (8)(c) variations in degree exist between aggravated assault and negligent endangerment. Under an appropriate reading of the statute, it is clear that even if Fisch were correct as to the existence of these several differences, negligent endangerment would not be a lesser included offense of aggravated assault under \u00a7 46-1-202(8)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Moreover, Fisch\u2019s premise that the \u2018less serious injury\u201d criterion contained in \u00a7 46-l-202(8)(c), MCA, is met here vis-a-vis negligent endangerment and aggravated assault is incorrect. A less serious injury than the \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d upon which this charge of aggravated assault was based would be \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Indeed, the legislature has provided for an offense differing from aggravated assault with respect to the degree of injury, namely, assault. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-5-201(l)(a) - (b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Similarly, Fisch\u2019s argument that the \u2018less serious risk\u201d criterion of \u00a7 46-l-202(8)(c), MCA, is met here also fails. First, Fisch meshes the \u2018less serious injury or risk\u201d components into one; as discussed above, the construction of \u00a7 46-l-202(8)(c), MCA, does not support this approach. Second, the serious bodily injury upon which the aggravated assault charge is premised is totally unrelated to the seriousness of a \u201crisk\u201d defined in any statute. A \u201crisk\u201d element \u2014 of whatever degree \u2014 is altogether distinct from an \u201cinjury\u201d element; as used in the statute, a risk connotes creating a dangerous situation or condition, while an injury connotes the actual infliction of harm. Risks of varying degrees would compare an element such as the \u201csubstantial risk\u201d of death or serious bodily injury contained in the negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>endangerment definition with, for example, a mere \u201crisk\u201d of death or serious bodily injury. Here, Fisch\u2019s conduct \u2014 even if merely negligent \u2014 did not create a risk; it inflicted an actual injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Finally, Fisch equates the \u2018lesser kind of culpability\u2019 criterion in \u00a7 46-l-202(8)(c), MCA, to the mental state element of the two offenses. He reasons that the \u201cnegligently engages in conduct\u201d element of negligent endangerment is a lesser degree of culpability than the \u201cpurposely or knowingly causes\u201d element of aggravated assault. We need not resolve this question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Fisch is correct in this regard, this lesser kind of culpability would be the only trait <em>shared </em>by the two offenses; as discussed above, the other elements of the offenses are qualitatively different and unrelated. Section 46-l-202(8)(c), MCA, explicitly directs that an included offense may <em>differ </em>from the offense charged only in respect to one of the statutory variations.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The District Court correctly concluded that negligent endangerment is not a lesser included offense of aggravated assault under \u00a7 46-l-202(8)(c), MCA. As a result, no amount of evidence in support of that offense could have entitled Fisch to a negligent endangerment instruction under that statute. We hold, therefore, that the court did not err in refusing Fisch\u2019s proposed instruction on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Fisch also argues that negligent endangerment is a lesser included offense of aggravated assault under the definition contained in \u00a7 46-l-202(8)(a), MCA. A proper analysis of that issue would include application of the so-called <em>Blockburger </em>test for determining whether an offense is a lesser included offense of another offense. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>State v. Arlington </em>(Mont. 1994), 875 P.2d 307, 329, 51 St.Rep. 417, 433; citing <em>Blockburger v. United States </em>(1932), 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">As set forth above, however, Fisch did not offer his proposed instruction pursuant to \u00a7 46-l-202(8)(a), MCA, in the District Court. \u201cIt is axiomatic that a party may not change the theory on appeal from that advanced in the district court.\u201d <em>State v. Henderson </em>(Mont. 1994), 877 P.2d 1013, 1016, 51 St.Rep. 606, 607 (citation omitted). We decline to address the merits of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
