We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">Two issues are presented:</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">I. Did the District Court err by failing to dismiss the youth court action after DFS admitted that it failed to follow the statutory procedure of \u00a7 41-3-301, MCA (1991) \u2014 the 48-hour rule?</p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">II. Did the District Court err by awarding DFS temporary custody of B.K. and F.H. until age eighteen?</p>\n<p id=\"b61-16\">S.T. is the natural mother of J.K., B.K. and F.H. J.K. is currently eighteen years of age, while B.K. is thirteen and F.H. is five.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-17\">DFS has had contact with S.T. and her children since August 3, 1989. From late 1989 through early 1991, DFS was granted tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>rary custody of the children for four six-month intervals. During this time, S.T. signed four treatment plans, none of which were completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">In February 1991, DFS requested an additional six months temporary custody of the children. Prior to any hearing on the request, the parties entered a stipulation for family reunification and S.T. signed another treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Based on S.T.\u2019s minimal compliance with that treatment plan, and since S.T. signed a voluntary agreement to continue working with DFS, on October 3, 1991, DFS requested dismissal of the temporary custody order. From December 1991, to January 1992, various concerns surfaced over the children\u2019s stability, educational, emotional and health needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">On January 28, 1992, DFS, pursuant to the emergency protection statute \u2014 \u00a7 41-3-301, MCA \u2014 removed B.K. and F.H. from S.T.\u2019s home. J.K. refused placement and remained in the household. On February 10, 1992, DFS filed a petition for the termination of S.T.\u2019s parental rights and permanent custody of the three children. On February 13, 1992, DFS amended the petition to terminate S.T.\u2019s parental rights and sought permanent custody of B.K. and F.H. DFS also petitioned for temporary custody of J.K. until she reached age eighteen. DFS and S.T. also executed another treatment plan which S.T. did not complete during the eight months before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">On March 20, 1992, S.T. moved the District Court to dismiss the petition since DFS failed to file the termination and permanent custody petition within 48 hours after using the emergency placement statute \u2014 \u00a7 41-3-301, MCA \u2014 to take the children. The court denied this motion and the trial conimenced on November 20, 1992. The court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law and granted DFS temporary custody of B.K. and F.H. until age eighteen. B.K. and F.H. were put in foster care and S.T. was allowed visitation, while J.K. remained in the physical custody of S.T. subject to DFS supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Did the District Court err by failing to dismiss the youth court action after DFS admitted that it failed to follow the statutory procedure of \u00a7 41-3-301, MCA (1991) \u2014 the 48-hour rule?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">DFS conceded that the petition for termination and permanent custody was not filed within 48 hours of the children\u2019s emergency placement. On that basis, S.T. moved to dismiss the petition. The District Court denied S.T.\u2019s motion tb dismiss and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>a sanction of dismissal of a case involving kids to be protected is not appropriate ...[;] there would have to be some other remedies for violating [the 48-hour rule] other than dismissal of a petition</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The court carefully balanced the technical statutory requirements against the children\u2019s best interest and ultimately decided to protect the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">When, as here, a district court \u201cengages in discretionary action which cannot be accurately characterized as a finding of fact or conclusion of law[,]\u201d we review the district court\u2019s decision to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Matter of D.H. and F.H. </em>(1994), [264 Mont. 521], 872 P.2d 803, 806, 51 St.Rep. 386, 388 (citation omitted). While we consider DFS\u2019 conduct unconscionable \u2014 not filing a petition within <em>\u00bf </em>8 hours \u2014 the conduct does not warrant dismissal of the petition and is not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In matters involving abused and neglected children we have consistently held that a district court may protect the children\u2019s best interest despite procedural errors. <em>See Matter of S.P. </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 190, 196, 786 P.2d 642, 645-46 (held harmless error when DFS failed to provide father five days notice of hearing); <em>Matter of R.A.D. </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 143, 155, 753 P.2d 862, 869 (held no reversible error when court failed to grant fourth continuance to mother who was in a psychiatric hospital); <em>Matter of RM.B. </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 29, 33-34, 689 P.2d 281, 283 (held harmless error when court admitted hearsay); <em>Matter of C.LA. and J.A. </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 393, 399-400, 685 P.2d 931, 935 (held harmless error when court did not allow parents to cross-examine state witness as to the best interest of the children); <em>Matter of M.E.M. </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 192, 195-98, 679 P.2d 1241, 1243-45 (held no error when there were alleged violations of the Indian Child Welfare Act); and <em>Matter of A.J.S. </em>(1981), 193 Mont. 79, 86-87, 630 P.2d 217, 222 (held harmless error when the district court\u2019s final order of termination was twenty months after DFS removed the child from the home).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In this case, even though the petition was not filed until thirteen days after the emergency placement of the children, the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the children\u2019s best interest precluded dismissing the petition. Any error in not following the strict procedure of \u00a7 41-3-301, MCA, was harmless since the best interest of the children was the primary concern and since S.T.\u2019s due process rights were not violated. In fact, S.T. received notice of each hearing, was present at each hearing and presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>evidence through her court-appointed attorney at each hearing. The final termination hearing was held some eight months after the petition was filed and during that time S.T. was afforded another opportunity to complete a treatment plan. We hold that S.T.\u2019s rights were not prejudiced by the failure to file the petition within 48 hours and, thus, the District Court correctly denied her motion to dismiss the petition. We also sound a stern warning to DFS to strictly follow the statutory procedure in future cases or we will, in no uncertain terms, punish its conduct which may result in potential harm to abused and neglected children \u2014 the very children that DFS is supposed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Did the District Court err by awarding DFS temporary custody of B.K. and F.H. until age eighteen?</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">DFS petitioned the District Court for termination of S.T.\u2019s parental rights and permanent custody of B.K. and F.H. S.T. argues that the petition was factually insufficient to terminate her parental rights, since the petition alleged that she did not comply with a treatment plan. According to S.T. no treatment plan was in effect when the petition was filed and, thus, the District Court erred by not dismissing the petition for failure to state a cause of action. However, we note that after the petition was filed DFS and S.T. agreed to enter a treatment plan which S.T. had eight months to complete. She failed to complete the plan by the time of the final hearing. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it failed to dismiss the petition. The petition, on its face, stated a cause of action and facts were developed to prove that S.T. did not comply with the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Moreover, the District Court did not terminate S.T.\u2019s parental rights. Even though the court found that the evidence justified termination of S.T.\u2019s parental rights, the court \u2014 concerned with the children\u2019s best interest \u2014 granted DFS temporary custody until B.K. and F.H. reached age eighteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Once a district court determines that a child is a youth in need of care \u2014 abused, neglected or dependent \u2014 it may grant DFS temporary custody of that child until age eighteen. <em>Matter of A.H., T.M., and J.A.H. </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 323, 328-29, 769 P.2d 1245, 1249. Here, the District Court properly found that B.K. and F.H. were youths in need of care pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-102(11), MCA (1991). After a careful review of the record we hold that the District Court did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>discretion when it granted DFS temporary custody of B.K. and F.H. until age eighteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b65-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b65-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"A8c\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">I am satisfied that Justice Gray\u2019s dissent is more legally correct than is our opinion. I, nevertheless, concur in the Court\u2019s opinion only because I cannot conclude, on balance, that the right of the mother to parent should take precedence over the rights of the children to be free from abuse and neglect, when the deciding factor is a technical violation of the 48 hour filing deadline and where the mother has, otherwise, had ample opportunity for notice and hearing. In joining our opinion, however, I do not in anyway condone DFS\u2019 failure to comply with the statute; there is simply no justification for a public agency which is charged with the responsibility of protecting fundamental rights, to not comply with both the letter and spirit of the laws that govern its operations. As Justice Gray correctly points out, it is, perhaps, the unfortunate, but understandable, reluctance of the judiciary to stringently enforce the letter of the law when to do so might adversely affect the welfare of a child, that encourages and contributes to the sort of administrative laxity that brings this case before the Court. If the 48 hour deadline is unworkable, then the legislature should change it. Unless and until it does, however, the requirements of the law are clear, and DFS has the obligation to comply. Hopefully some future abused or neglected child will not suffer from DFS\u2019failure to recognize the seriousness of this situation, when his or her case becomes the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b65-8\">JUSTICE GRAY</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">I must respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion on issue 1, regarding whether the District Court erred by failing to dismiss the youth court action after DFS admitted it failed to follow the 48-hour time requirement contained in \u00a7 41-3-301, MCA (1991). Because it is my view that the District Court must be reversed on that issue, I would not reach issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Cases involving youths in need of care are among the most difficult faced by this Court. I have on a number of occasions joined the Court in allowing DFS to depart from relatively clear statutory requirements. On some of those occasions and not unlike my brethren, I suspect, I have done so because of the overriding and overwhelming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>importance of protecting the best interests of the children of Montana. In this case involving an emergency situation for which a clear and unequivocal statutory time frame has been imposed by the legislature and where we previously have warned DFS\u2019 predecessor agency regarding its failure to comply with the law, I cannot agree with the Court that it is sufficient to characterize DFS\u2019 conduct as unconscionable and issue another warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The statute at issue here needs no interpretation; it provides that, absent circumstances not at issue here, \u201c[a] petition shall be filed within 48 hours of emergency placement of a child ....\u201d Section 41-3-301(3), MCA (1991). Here, DFS admits that it did not meet the statutory requirement. On motion for dismissal by the natural mother, S.T., it is my view that the District Court was required to dismiss the action on the basis of DFS\u2019failure to comply with the clear statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The Court quotes the District Court\u2019s discomfort with dismissal under the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">[A] sanction of dismissal of a case involving kids to be protected is not appropriate ... [;] there would have to be some other remedies for violating the [48-hour rule] other than dismissal of a petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR1\">This is almost certainly the same kind of reaction most of the judiciary, including myself and this Court, has had to the prospect of dismissing a petition. At the very least, we are as judges extremely troubled at the idea that a child ultimately could be harmed by our requiring DFS to comply with the law. The problem with this approach is that it results in judicial amendment of legislative enactments; because of our fear, we conclude that dismissal of a case \u201cinvolving kids to be protected is not appropriate.\u201d Similarly, while we might wish \u2014 with the District Court \u2014 that there were some other remedy for a violation of the 48-hour rule by DFS, the legislature has provided no such remedy. Whatever our fears, the fact remains that the legislature has enacted a mandatory time frame within which DFS must file a petition in an emergency protective services situation pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-301, MCA (1991). It is our job to require adherence.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Furthermore, we previously have condemned disregard of the statutory 48-hour rule by DFS\u2019 predecessor agency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">[T]his Court strongly condemns the negligent disregard of [the predecessor statute] by the SRS and county attorney. By statute, a petition <em>shall </em>be filed within 48 hours following the emergency removal and placing of a youth in a protective facility. SRS failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>to comply in this case. SRS was acting under the guise of the law when it removed the children. SRS therefore has a duty to strictly adhere to the requirements of that same law. Removal of children from their parents is an area too sensitive to allow any abuse or noncompliance of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><em>In re Gore </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 321, 329, 570 P.2d 1110, 1115 (emphasis in original). This clear statement of the duty to comply with the statute apparently had no impact whatever in how state agencies regard the law and this Court. Yet, in the case now before us, the Court not only does not require adherence by dismissing DFS\u2019 petition, it ignores its own clear warning in <em>In re Gore </em>that the statute would be applied as written in the future. I simply cannot fathom this Court allowing itself, the district courts and the families of Montana to be held hostage by DFS in such a manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Moreover, the Court incorrectly applies an abuse of discretion standard to the District Court\u2019s action in determining whether to dismiss the petition for failure to comply with the 48-hour rule. While it is true that that standard applies to \u201cdiscretionary actions\u201d and was properly applied to the question of abandonment in <em>Matter of D.H. and F.H., </em>on which the Court relies, it is my view that no discretion was involved here because the statute is clear and unequivocal in requiring that a petition be filed within 48 hours. If the statute provided for the kind of \u201ccareful balancing\u201d between the statutory time requirement and the best interests of the children the Court seems to suggest would be appropriate, I would agree to the application of the abuse of discretion standard. The statute, however, does not so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Nor is the \u201cremedy\u201d or result here inappropriate or difficult to conceptualize. The DFS petition should be dismissed for failure to comply with \u00a7 41-3-301(3), MCA (1991), and the children returned to their home. If and when DFS is prepared to pursue the matter within legal strictures imposed by the legislature to protect the very fundamental and critically important rights of both the mother and the children, it should do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The courts of Montana have labored diligently to prevent potential harm to children by countenancing errors by DFS not permitted by applicable statutes. We have done so, as the Court observes, in matters \u201cinvolving abused and neglected children.\u201d But the operating premise seems to be based on an <em>ex ante </em>conclusion that the children are, indeed, abused and neglected. In other words, we allow DFS to far overstep its bounds presuming from the outset that DFS\u2019 deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>minations about the children are correct. In addition, none of the many cases cited by the Court for allowing such \u201cprocedural errors\u201d involves this most intrusive act by DFS of removing children from their parents and their home in advance of any court proceedings whatsoever; those cases involve procedural occurrences well after the initiation of court proceedings to oversee DFS\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">It is my view that this is the place where we must draw the line. We must recognize that parents have rights, too; that the children\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d do not automatically coincide with DFS\u2019view of those interests; that permitting DFS to act under an \u201cemergency\u201d statute designed to protect the rights of all cbncerned simply does not square with allowing it to simultaneously disregard the time requirements of that statute. As all of us are held accountable by the law for our actions, so must we hold DFS accountable to legal requirements imposed on <em>its </em>actions by the legislature. To do otherwise is to place an agency of government both above and beyond the law. Notwithstanding the importance of DFS\u2019 mission, I cannot agree with such a result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
