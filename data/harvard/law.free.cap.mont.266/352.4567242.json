We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly calculated Deshner\u2019s total temporary disability compensation rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Earl Deshner (Deshner) commenced employment with Town and Country Foods as a stocker in September, 1991 on a full-time basis with some weekly overtime hours. His starting salary was $5.00 per hour but in October of 1991, his salary was raised to $6.00 per hour. He received a $250.00 bonus on December 31, 1991 and on March 1, 1992, his salary was again increased, to $7.25 per hour. On March 17, 1992, he \u201csuffered an industrial injury arising out of and in the course of his employment with Town and Country Foods, Inc.\u201d Town and Country accepted liability and paid temporary total disability payments of $153.82 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Deshner filed a petition for hearing on March 8, 1993, contending that his weekly compensation benefits should be $199.89 per week based upon his actual wage at the time of the injury, which was $7.25 per hour. On September 2, 1993, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court filed its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment, stating that Deshner\u2019s total disability compensation rate should be $167.17 per week. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court based its calculations upon the claimant\u2019s four pay periods previous to his injury pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-701(3), MCA. Deshner\u2019s hourly wage during the four preceding pay periods was $6.00 per hour. From this conclusion of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, Deshner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The standard of review for conclusions of law is whether the lower tribunal correctly interpreted the law. <em>Steer Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-475, 803 P.2d 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">In order to determine the proper total temporary disability compensation rate (weekly compensation benefit) for Deshner, we review the applicable statutes. The following excerpts of statutes were in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>effect at the time of Deshner\u2019s injury and control the calculation of wages and weekly compensation benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">39-71-701. Compensation for temporary total disability - exceptions. (1) Subject to the limitation in 39-71-736 and subsection (4) of this section, a worker is eligible for temporary total disability benefits when the worker suffers a total loss of wages as a result of an injury and until the worker reaches maximum healing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">(3) Weekly compensation benefits for injury producing temporary total disability shall be 66 2/3% of the wages received at the time of the injury ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">39-71-123. Wages defined.

Deshner contends that at the time of the injury, his salary had been increased to $7.25 per hour, and that is the correct amount to be used to calculate his benefit. He also claims that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusion conflicts with the plain wording of \u00a7 39-71-701(3), MCA. Finally, he asserts that either subsection (a) or subsection (b) of \u00a7 39-71-123(3), MCA, should be applied, both authorizing a different calculation of the weekly compensation benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Town and Country counters that \u00a7 39-71-123(3), MCA, mandates that the four pay periods preceding Deshner\u2019s injury should be utilized to calculate his wages; Deshner\u2019s hourly rate for those pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>periods was $6.00 per hour. Town and Country states that claimant cannot rely on the language of \u00a7 39-71-701(3), MCA, which states that \u201ctemporary total disability shall be 66 2/3% of the wages received at the time of injury\u201d because the four preceding pay periods must be used in order to determine \u201cwages.\u201d Finally, Town and Country also states that subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 39-71-123(3), MCA, are inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The difficulty in the present case stems from the fact that the claimant was earning $6.00 per hour for the four pay periods prior to his injury but he was earning $7.25 per hour, a substantially higher wage, at the actual time of the injury. In general, a worker\u2019s hourly wage for the four preceding pay periods will be the same as his hourly wage at the time of the injury. Therefore, in most cases, \u00a7 39-71-701, MCA, which establishes weekly compensation benefits based on \u201cwages received at the time of the injury\u201d and 39-71-123, MCA, which establishes weekly compensation benefits based on the worker\u2019s salary over the four preceding pay periods, will not conflict. However, in this case, the conflict occurs because there is such a dramatic difference between the two salaries and because Deshner is entitled to be paid benefits which bear a reasonable relationship to his actual wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00a7 39-71-701(3), MCA, states that the weekly compensation benefit for an injury which produces a temporary total disability <em>shall </em>be 66 2/3% of the claimant\u2019s wages received <em>at the time of the injury. </em>Deshner\u2019s hourly wage at the time of the injury was $7.25 per hour, not the $6.00 per hour used by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Deshner was earning $6.00 per hour during the four pay periods prior to his injury. However, he received a raise and his salary increased to $7.25 per hour on March 1,1992. He was hired and maintained as a fulltime employee working 40 hours per week plus sporadic overtime. Using the formula provided under \u00a7 39-71-701, MCA, we calculate the following weekly compensation benefit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">$ 7.25 hourly wage at time of injury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfM\">x 40 hours worked per week</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aan\">$290.00 weekly wages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am7\">$290.00 weekly wages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5r\">x 66 2/3% percentage to be applied pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-701(3), MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4e\">$193.34 weekly compensation benefit</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The weekly compensation benefit for Deshner using the hourly wage he was actually earning at the time ofinjmy would be $193.34. However, this compensation rate does not take into account any overtime pay or bonus pay received by Deshner. On remand, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court may also consider whether and, if so, to what extent, overtime pay and bonus pay should be included in determining Deshner\u2019s final total temporary disability compensation rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The determination of $193.34 as the base compensation rate differs from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s calculation, which used a $6.00 hourly wage and totalled $167.17. The application of \u00a7 39-71-123(3), MCA, used by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, appears to conflict with \u00a7 39-71-701(3), MCA, in the instant case. Section 39-71-123(3), MCA, states that to determine the claimant\u2019s weekly compensation benefit, the average actual earnings for the four pay periods preceding the injury should be utilized. However, \u00a7 39-71-701(3), MCA, states that weekly compensation benefits shall be 66 2/3% of the claimant\u2019s wages \u201creceived at the time of the injury.\u201d Deshner argued, and we agree, that subsection (b) of \u00a7 39-71-123(3), MCA, which provides an exception to \u00a7 39-71-123(3), MCA, is applicable to the instant case, conforms with \u00a7 39-71-701(3), MCA, and authorizes the weekly compensation benefit calculated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Subsection (b) provides an exception to the standard use of the four preceding pay periods to determine the weekly compensation rate. The subsection states that if the claimant can show good cause as to why the use of the four pay periods does not accurately reflect the claimant\u2019s employment history, then additional pay periods can be used. According to Deshner\u2019s employment history with Town and Country, he was earning $7.25 per hour <em>at the time of his injury, </em>albeit earning $6.00 per hour for the preceding months. A calculation of his weekly compensation rate at an hourly wage of $6.00 does not adequately reflect his employment history. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court should have utilized a pay period which reflected his actual wage at the time of his injury, which was $7.25 per hour. Deshner has demonstrated that there is good cause to use a pay period which accurately reflects his actual wages at the time of the injury to determine his weekly compensation benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">This decision also conforms with the public policy of the State regarding wage-loss benefits. Section 39-71-105, MCA, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>(1) B]t is an objective of the Montana workers\u2019 compensation system to provide, without regard to fault, wage supplement and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole; they are intended to assist a worker at a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, <em>the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">A weekly compensation benefit calculated at $7.25 per hour bears a much more reasonable relationship to Deshner\u2019s <em>actual wages lost </em>as a result of his injury than does a calculation using $6.00 per hour. The appropriate total temporary disability compensation rate (or weekly compensation benefit) is $193.34, calculated by multiplying 66 2/3% by an hourly wage rate of $7.25 at 40 hours per week. Because we are unclear as to how, if at all, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court calculated Deshner\u2019s total temporary disability rate with respect to overtime pay and bonus pay, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court should consider these two issues on remand in order to determine Deshner\u2019s final compensation benefit rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court incorrectly determined the claimant\u2019s total temporary disability compensation rate because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court should have applied \u00a7 39-71-123(3)(b), MCA. We reverse and remand for entry of an order for temporary total disability benefits consistent with this opinion.
