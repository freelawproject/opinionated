Miller (\u201cappellee\u201d) filed a complaint for divorce against Jerome P. Miller (\u201cappellant\u201d). The court awarded temporary custody of the couple\u2019s two children, Kris and Kurtis, to appellee on October 15, 1993.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted the divorce on December 22, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">As part of that decree, the court included a shared parenting plan in which the parties shared the parental rights and responsibilities of both children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under this plan, the parties alternated months in which they had physical custody of the children with each parent having physical custody of both children for six months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellee was designated the residential parent of both children and both parties were appointed legal custodians of the children. Appellant was further required to pay appellee child support in the amount of $81.56 per week plus poundage.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">On September 5,1995, the court held a hearing on appellee\u2019s motion for change of custody. After hearing testimony from several witnesses who spoke on behalf of both appellant and appellee,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court decreed that appellee was to be the residential parent of Kris and appellant was to be the residential parent of Kurtis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court further determined that this agreement was subject to review in six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">On February 1, 1996, appellee filed a motion to change custody requesting that she be named residential parent of Kurtis. The court appointed a guardian <em>ad litem </em>at appellee\u2019s request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>On May 15, 1996, the court conducted an in-camera interview of seven-year-old Kurtis with the guardian <em>ad litem. </em>During the interview, the guardian gave the court his written recommendation for custody.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No record was made of the interview with Kurtis.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Thereafter, the court heard testimony from both parties and several witnesses who testified on behalf of appellant and appellee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant also introduced several exhibits from Kurtis\u2019s school in Bettsville.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court submitted the matter for consideration and on May 20, 1996, issued a judgment entry granting appellee\u2019s motion for change of residential parent. Appellant immediately filed a motion for reconsideration of this judgment as well as a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">On June 21, 1996, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. It is from these proceedings that appellant is appealing with the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">Assignment of Error No. 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred and abused its discretion when it relied on an incorrect standard, failing to require plaintiff to prove a change in circumstances and that the modification was necessary to serve the best interests of the child, and granting appellee\u2019s motion for a change of custody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">Under R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a), a trial court may not modify a prior custody decree unless it finds that a change in circumstances has arisen and the modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The inquiry into an initial custody decree, on the other hand, only requires the court to use the best interests of the child in rendering its decision. <em>Rowe v. Franklin </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 176, 180, 663 N.E.2d 955, 957-958. Appellant contends that the trial court erred when it classified the custody decree of January 17, 1996 as an initial decree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>R.C. 3109.21(F) defines an initial decree as the first decree allocating parental rights and responsibilities, whereas R.C. 3109.21(G) defines a modification as any subsequent decree modifying or replacing an earlier decree. Thus, the real issue is what type of decree was the January 17, 1996 decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The record reveals that the court originally designated appellee as the residential parent of both children as part of the couple\u2019s divorce decree, which was granted on December 22, 1993.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under R.C. 3109.04(D)(1)(d), any court-approved shared parenting agreement that is appended to the final divorce decree has immediate effect as a final decree of custody, subject to modification or termination. Therefore, the December 22, 1993 shared parenting plan became the first decree allocating parental rights and responsibilities between appellant and appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Consequently, the subsequent custody decree on January 17, 1996 was a modification of the initial custody decree and, therefore, required the trial court to use the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d test as well as find a change in circumstances pursuant to R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a). However, appellee maintains that regardless of the trial court\u2019s classification of the January 17 decree, the court nevertheless applied the best interests of the child test as well as a change of circumstances test in rendering its decision on May 20, 1996.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Despite the trial court\u2019s contention that a change of circumstances would have been met if it had applied that standard during the May 15, 1996 hearing, the record reflects that the trial court only used the best interests of the child standard in rendering its decision, as evidenced by its classification of the January 17, 1996 decree as temporary. In misclassifying the January custody decree, we find, the trial court acted unreasonably. See <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482-483, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1141-1142. Therefore, we find that the trial court erred in using an incorrect legal standard for modifying a prior custody decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">Assignment of Error No. 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred and abused its discretion by ruling that even if it relied on an incorrect legal standard, there was a change of circumstances established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>by appellee and the advantages of a change of custody were outweighed by the harm, and granting appellee\u2019s motion for a change of custody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">Assignment of Error No. 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence, and the trial court erred and abused its discretion by granting appellee\u2019s motion for a change of custody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The above assignments of error are being considered together due to their close relationship to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision in a child custody matter, an appellate court must uphold the decision absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Blakemore, supra. </em>An abuse of discretion constitutes \u201cmore than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Id., </em>5 Ohio St.3d at 219, 5 OBR at 482, 450 N.E.2d at 1142. Consequently, \u201c[t]he discretion which a trial court enjoys in custody matters should be accorded the utmost respect.\u201d <em>Miller v. Miller </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846, 849. Therefore, an appellate court may not independently review the weight of the evidence in the majority of cases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">In reviewing appellant\u2019s remaining issues, we are rather troubled at the lack of evidence found in the record to support the court\u2019s decision. Most disturbing is the missing guardian <em>ad litem </em>report, as the court admits in its judgment entry denying appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration that it relied on that report in making its decision despite the fact that it released only the last four pages of the report to both parties on the day of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">The court is correct in stating that a trial court does not err \u201cin considering the home-study report as evidence in the absence of sworn testimony\u201d about the contents of the report. <em>Sayre v. Hoelzle-Sayre </em>(1994), 100 Ohio App.3d 203, 209, 653 N.E.2d 712, 716. However, a court is authorized to admit such reports as testimony only when the contents of that report are made available to the parties and utilized by the court in accordance with R.C. 2317.39. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">R.C. 2317.39<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-12\">\u201cWhenever an investigation into the facts of any case, civil or criminal, pending at the time of such investigation in any court, is made, conducted, or participated in, directly or indirectly, by any court * * * and a report of such investigation is prepared for submission to the court, the contents of such report shall not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>considered by any judge wherein such case is pending * * * unless the full contents have been made readily available and accessible to all parties to the case or their counsel. * * * This section * * * shall prevent any judge from familiarizing himself with such contents in any manner unless this section has been fully complied with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In this case, the court released only the last few pages of the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>report to the parties. Moreover, the court did not release those pages until the day of the hearing, in further violation of R.C. 2317.39.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Clearly, the court violated R.C. 2317.39 regarding its consideration of the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>recommendation. Therefore, the recommendation was improperly considered by the trial court and cannot be used in determining whether a change of custody was warranted in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Turning to the remaining evidence, we note that under R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a), modification of a prior custody decree is provided for as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201cThe court shall not modify a prior decree allocating parental rights and responsibilities for the care of children unless it finds, based on facts that have arisen since the prior decree or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child, his residential parent, or either of the parents subject to a shared parenting decree, and that the modification is necessary to serve the best interest of the child. In applying these standards, the court shall retain the residential parent designated by the prior decree * * * unless one of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\"><em>u </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">\u201c(ni) The harm likely to be caused by a change of environment is outweighed by the advantages of the change of environment to the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">In construing R.C. 3109.04, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated that with respect to a modification of custody, the primary concern of the statute is the best interest of the child. <em>Gardini v. Moyer </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 479, 484, 575 N.E.2d 423, 426-427, citing <em>Birch v. Birch </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 85, 87, 11 OBR 327, 329-330, 463 N.E.2d 1254, 1256-1257. To determine what is in the best interest of a child, R.C. 3109.04(F)(1) lists several factors for consideration. Those relevant to this case include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">\u201c(a) The wishes of the child\u2019s parents regarding his care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-12\">\u201c(b) The wishes and concerns of the child, as expressed to the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-13\">\u201c(c) The child\u2019s interaction and interrelationship with his parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child\u2019s best interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201c(d) The child\u2019s adjustment to his home, school and community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">\u201c(e) The mental and physical health of all persons involved in the situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In this case, the record reflects that the child was acclimated to his father\u2019s home, school and community.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At the time of the hearing, Kurtis was currently involved in Little League baseball and swimming lessons. He was also performing well, both socially and academically, at school.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Despite these factors, appellee maintains that Kurtis and Kris\u2019s relationship had deteriorated to such an extent that a change of circumstances significant to support a change of custody had arisen. However, we find this contention to be without merit. The record does not reflect that the sibling relationship has deteriorated in any significant way since Kurtis has been living with appellant. On the contrary, all of the witnesses testified that Kurtis and Kris were close despite their age difference.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, under the terms of the January 17, 1996 decree, Kurtis and Kris were together every weekend<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> as well as one night every week. Therefore, the record does not reflect any significant deterioration in their sibling relationship that would warrant a change of custody in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Furthermore, the record does not reveal any evidence that the appellant was unsuitable to have custody. Nor does it reveal any benefit to the child from a proposed change in custody that would outweigh the risk of harm which may come about as a result of such a change. Therefore, the trial court erred when it granted custody of Kurtis to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second and third assignments are sustained. The judgment of the Seneca County Common Pleas Court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the law and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-11\">Shaw and Thomas F.

In its June 21, 1996 journal entry including findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court rejected the change of circumstances requirement and declared the January decision to have been a temporary decree due to its having reserved the right to review the decision in six months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b374-11\">.
