Plaintiffs-appellants, Sally A. Mermer and Dennis Grimshaw, appeal a decision which granted defendants-appellees. Medical Correspondence Services (\u201cMed.Cor\u201d), Smart Corp., and Hospital Correspondence Services (\u201cHCC\u201d), summary judgment on the fourth count of appellants\u2019 complaint, which asserted that appellees charged excessive and unconscionable fees in violation of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\u201cOCSPA\u201d), R.C. 1345.01 <em>et seq. </em>For the reasons discussed below, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The undisputed facts of this case are as follows. Appellants hired the law firm of Williams, Jilek, Lafferty &amp; Gallagher Co., L.P.A. (\u201cWJLG\u201d) to represent them in their personal injury claims. With the express, written authorization of their clients, WJLG requested relevant medical records from various hospitals\u2019 records departments in order to facilitate appellants\u2019 claims. Each request was forwarded to one of the appellees, who retrieved and copied the records, and sent them to WJLG along with an invoice showing the fees charged for the services. As a general practice, upon receipt of such an invoice, WJLG would pay the balance shown on the bill, and later deduct the costs of the copy service from the amount received on the claim. Under the retainer agreement between WJLG and appellants, appellants were still responsible to reimburse WJLG for the costs of the copy service in the event appellants did not recover under their personal injury claims. The charges about which appellants complain are as follows. Sally Mermer\u2019s medical records from Flower Memorial Hospital were copied by appellee Smart Corp. and included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">March 2,1993 15 pages $ 33.64</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">May 12,1993 318 pages $269.55</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\">July 22,1993 3 pages $ 22.72</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-11\">Nov. 10,1993 1 page $ 7.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">Further, Sally Mermer\u2019s medical records from Southwest General Hospital were copied by appellee Med.Cor, whose invoices included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-13\">April 21,1993 9 pages $31.80</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-14\">July 2,1993 2 pages $23.29</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">Dennis Grimshaw\u2019s medical records from St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center were copied by appellee Med.Cor and invoiced as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-16\">Feb. 9,1991 9 pages $31.80</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-17\">July 2,1993 2 pages $23.29</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-18\">In addition, Dennis Grimshaw\u2019s medical records from the Medical College of Ohio were copied by appellee HCC and invoiced in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>April 9,1992 2 pages $16.43</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">August 5,1992 2 pages $16.32</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Sally Mermer\u2019s personal injury case is still pending; thus, she has yet to pay WJLG for the costs of the copy service. Dennis Grimshaw\u2019s personal injury case has been concluded, and WJLG has deducted the costs of the copy service from his settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Originally, the complaint contained four claims. Counts I and III were dismissed on June 20, 1994. On October 12, 1995, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Count II (breach of contract) and Count IV (violation of the OCSPA). Appellants now appeal the granting of summary judgment on Count IV only, raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred, as a matter of law, in granting the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, because the obtaining of copies of medical records for use in a personal injury lawsuit is a consumer transaction within the meaning of the Consumer Sales Practice Act, R.C. 1345.01(A).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">In reviewing a ruling on a summary judgment motion, this court must apply the same standard as does the trial court. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198, 199. We are guided by the requirements set forth in Civ.R. 56(C):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">\u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. No evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule. A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from such evidence or stipulation and only therefrom, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, such party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">Moreover, \u201c[a] motion for summary judgment forces the nonmoving party to produce evidence on any issue for which that party bears the burden of production at trial.\u201d <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">In their sole assignment of error, appellants assert that the transaction of obtaining medical records for the purpose of pursuing a personal injury claim is covered by the OCSPA. Appellants contend that their express authorization to obtain the medical records was given for the sole purpose of facilitating their personal injury claims and that WJLG acquired these records strictly in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>representative capacity for appellants. Hence, appellants argue that because their purpose in obtaining the medical records was primarily personal, the transactions fall within the scope of the OCSPA. In contrast, appellees contend that WJLG\u2019s acquisition of the medical records was strictly for evidentiary purposes, integral to WJLG\u2019s role in pursuing appellants\u2019 claims, and therefore was strictly a business transaction between WJLG and appellees. Hence, appellees assert that appellants were not parties to the transaction and thus were not consumers pursuant to R.C. 1345.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The OCSPA defines a \u201cconsumer transaction\u201d as a \u201csale, lease, assignment, award by chance, or other transfer of an item of goods, a service, a franchise, or an intangible, to an individual for purposes that are primarily personal, family, or household * * R.C. 1345.01(A). The OCSPA was enacted by the General Assembly to provide relief to \u201cindividuals\u201d against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with consumer transactions and, as such, is to be liberally construed. <em>Buddies, Inc. v. Fair </em>(May 6, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 62433, unreported, 1993 WL 146591. Further, as stated in <em>Tomes v. George Ballas Leasing, Inc. </em>(Sept. 30, 1986), Lucas App. No. L-85-359, unreported, 1986 WL 11420:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">\u201c[T]he scope of the act is applicable to individuals who acquire items [services] from suppliers primarily for personal use, but is not so restrictive that it prohibits individuals from using the goods [services] in limited business settings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">While a law firm is \u201cin the business\u201d of pursuing lawsuits, this fact alone does not preclude the applicability of the OCSPA to the transaction at issue. In granting summary judgment, the court relied on the fact that appellants were not involved in the ordering of the copies, other than signing the authorization forms. However, this rationale ignores the fact that WJLG acted as appellants\u2019 agent in obtaining the records. An agency relationship exists \u201cwhen one party exercises the right of control over the actions of another,' and those actions are directed toward the attainment of an objective which the former seeks.\u201d <em>Hanson v. Kynast </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 171, 24 OBR 403, 494 N.E.2d 1091, paragraph one of the syllabus. In this case, it is clear that appellants hired WJLG to represent them in their personal injury claims. It is in this representative capacity, and with appellants\u2019 express written authorization, that WJLG acquired appellants\u2019 personal medical records. \u25a0 Since WJLG made the specific requests in their representative capacity for appellants, the resulting transactions actually occurred between appellants and appellees, not WJLG and appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">The lower court further relied on the fact that appellants did not receive invoices for the copies provided. However, the issue is not who receives the invoices, but, rather, the purpose behind the acquisition of the records. While it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>is true, as appellees suggest, that WJLG obtained the records for evidentiary use, the ultimate, fundamental goal, <em>i.e., </em>the purpose, for such use was the pursuit of appellants\u2019 personal injury claims. Appellants\u2019 purpose in hiring WJLG to facilitate their personal injury claims was to recover for their injuries and to be made whole. Appellants gave WJLG express authorization to acquire the medical records in furtherance of this purpose. Thus, the transactions in question represent a personal use as required by the OCSPA. Moreover, appellants themselves were ultimately responsible for the fees shown on the invoice. Here, David Grimshaw has already paid the cost of the services through a deduction in his settlement. Sally Mermer\u2019s personal injury claim is still pending; hence, she has yet to pay the costs of the services. Therefore, exclusion of the transaction from the realm of the OCSPA on these grounds is misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Appellants hired WJLG to represent them in their personal injury claims, gave WJLG express authorization, in its representative capacity, to obtain appellants\u2019 personal medical records to provide evidentiary support for their claims, and agreed to ultimately assume the costs for the services. Accordingly, appellants, through their agent, WJLG, were consumers in regard to the transactions in question, and the purpose of the transaction, restoration of appellants to their preinjury status, was primarily personal in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Further, while the trial court did not consider whether appellees qualify as suppliers pursuant to the OCSPA, such consideration is necessary to this analysis. As stated in <em>Garner v. Borcherding Buick, Inc. </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 61, 64, 616 N.E.2d 283, 285, \u201cA review of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act reveals that nothing in the statute provides that privity of contract is a prerequisite to the recovery of damages. Rather, the definition of a \u2018supplier\u2019 under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act includes those who engage in the business of effecting consumer transactions, whether or not they deal directly with the consumer.\u201d Here, while there exists no privity of contract between appellees and appellants, such privity is not necessary for the OCSPA to apply. In engaging in the business of providing clients with copies of medical records on a regular and continuous basis, appellees \u201cengage in the business of effecting consumer transactions.\u201d Therefore, appellees qualify as suppliers under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Construing the undisputed facts in this case most strongly in appellants\u2019 favor, this court finds that the transactions at issue were consumer transactions. Accordingly, the lower court erred in finding the OCSPA inapplicable and in granting summary judgment on that basis. Appellants\u2019 assignment of error is therefore well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">On consideration whereof, the court finds substantial justice has not been done the parties complaining. The judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Pleas is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further consideration consistent with this decision. Appellees are ordered to pay the court costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b757-6\">Handwork and Abood, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
