Products, Inc. (\u201cB.P.\u201d), by the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County. Appellant submits that the trial court erred in applying the products liability \u201coccasional seller\u201d exception to \u201coccasional manufacturers of products.\u201d A careful review of the record compels affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">B.P. was founded in 1982 as a manufacturer and seller of a variety of propane heaters and lanterns, gaslights, propane hoses, and other propane accessories. According to B.P.\u2019s President, Joseph W. Bondi, the company\u2019s products and accessories are neither manufactured nor sold as industrial machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">The instant case concerns a fixture assembly unit which was designed and constructed in 1982 by one of B.P.\u2019s founders, Myron Byers. B.P. initially used the unit in its own business to produce a component part for propane camping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>heaters. It subsequently contracted out the manufacture of the component part to Hi TecMetal Group, Inc. (\u201cHi Tec\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hi Tec borrowed the fixture assembly unit and used it in the production of the component part, without incident, both prior to and after B.P.\u2019s 1993 change in ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Appellant, an employee of Area Temps, Inc., started working at Hi Tec in January 1994. She primarily operated an air press machine, and occasionally, a washer. Appellant\u2019s supervisor assigned her to the fixture assembly unit on February 1, 1994. After operating the unit for a short period of time, appellant\u2019s placement of her little finger on the unit resulted in the amputation of the tip of the finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Appellant filed her original complaint against B.P. in June 1994. She alleged that B.P. was liable for defective manufacture or construction, defective design, failure to warn or instruct, failure to provide postmarketing warnings, and failure to conform to representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">B.P., in a motion for summary judgment, argued that the \u201coccasional seller\u201d doctrine embodied in <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267, prohibited appellant\u2019s products liability action. B.P. also suggested that the fixture assembly unit is not a \u201cproduct\u201d under R.C. 2307.71, thereby making appellant\u2019s products liability allegations refutable as well. Appellant countered that B.P. falls squarely within the R.C. 2307.71 statutory definition of \u201cmanufacturer.\u201d The trial court, citing <em>Wireman v. Keneco Distributors, Inc. </em>(May 27, 1994), Wood App. No. 93WD-78, unreported, 1994 WL 236189, granted judgment in favor of B.P.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">This accelerated appeal followed with appellant claiming that the trial court erred in expanding the \u201coccasional seller\u201d doctrine to B.P. She asserts that B.P. \u201cengaged in a business to design, formulate, produce, create, make, construct, assemble, or rebuild a product or a component of a product,\u201d and is thus a manufacturer subject to Ohio\u2019s products liability law. See R.C. 2307.71(I) and 2307.73(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">In <em>Wireman, </em>Marathon Oil Company (\u201cMarathon\u201d) installed storage tanks at a site when it converted a service station to a \u201cbulk plant.\u201d Marathon, several years later, designed and installed a vapor recovery system (\u201cVRS\u201d) on four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>storage tanks; the system was designed to prevent gasoline vapors from escaping into the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Marathon subsequently leased the plant to Keneco Distributors, Inc. (\u201cKeneco\u201d), then sold it \u201cas is\u201d to KDI Properties, Inc., Keneco\u2019s land-holding corporation. Pursuant to a contract entered into by Keneco and Marathon, the plant would still be used to distribute Marathon\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In 1990, Keneco engaged the services of a contractor with the purpose of extending the life of the storage tanks. Several subcontractors were hired, and one of the subcontractor\u2019s employees was killed when an explosion occurred in a tank. The explosion allegedly stemmed from the failure to use the VRS during a gasoline delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate filed a wrongful death suit against a multitude of parties, including Marathon. , The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Marathon.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The Wood County Court of Appeals focused on two issues in reviewing the grant of summary judgment. First, was Marathon exempt from products liability because it was only an occasional seller? Second, was the VRS a fixture rather than personalty as specified in R.C. 2307.71(L)(1)? The court stated that if the trial court properly found that Marathon was an occasional seller, and that the VRS was a fixture, the summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Regarding the first issue, the court of appeals recognized that Marathon was in the business of exploration, recovery, and refining petroleum products. It also sells the petroleum products, both wholesale and retail. Since Marathon neither licensed the design of the VRS nor sold a finished system except for those included in the sale of the plant, the court characterized the defendant as an \u201coccasional seller not subject to strict liability.\u201d Specifically, \u201cits design, manufacture and sale of vapor recovery systems [were] an act ancillary to its principal business.\u201d Finding that the VRS was also a fixture, the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Marathon\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The Supreme Court of Ohio, in a four-to-three decision, reversed this judgment in <em>Wireman v. Keneco Distributors, Inc. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 103, 661 N.E.2d 744. The court did so by addressing only the fixture-versus-personalty issue without any reference to Marathon as an \u201coccasional seller.\u201d Since the judgment was reversed, however, it is apparent that the Supreme Court did not accept the Wood County Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that no issue of material fact remained with regard to whether Marathon was subject to strict liability in connection with the VRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Justice Cook dissented from the <em>Wireman </em>majority\u2019s conclusion regarding Marathon, a dissent concurred in by Chief Justice Moyer and Justice Wright. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Justice Cook criticized the majority\u2019s failure to initially analyze whether Marathon was an \u201coccasional seller\u201d: \u201cthe majority appears to bypass the primary step of determining whether Marathon is a manufacturer of vapor recovery systems (\u2018VRS\u2019) within the meaning of R.C. 2307.71(I).\u201d <em>Wireman </em>at 110, 661 N.E.2d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Justice Cook recognized that the statutory definition of \u201cmanufacturer\u201d coincided with Section 402A of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 347-348 and the Restatement\u2019s public policy designs. <em>Id. </em>She then placed great emphasis on the definition\u2019s requirement that a person be \u201cengaged in a business\u201d and the obvious intent behind this requirement, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe legislature intended to exclude the occasional seller.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In Justice Cook\u2019s opinion, an isolated sale of a product, which is merely incidental to a particular business, is not subject to the liability scheme of R.C. 2307.71 through 2307.80. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Wireman </em>minority, finding that the majority\u2019s analysis was thus unwarranted, would have affirmed the judgment granted in Marathon\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>at 111, 661 N.E.2d at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">For reasons not expressed, the Supreme Court of Ohio found that Marathon may be subject to strict liability under Ohio\u2019s Product Liability Act. Although the trial court herein relied on the appellate opinion in <em>Wireman </em>in granting judgment in favor of B.P., the partial reversal of <em>Wireman </em>does not necessarily exclude an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Appellant fails to demonstrate that genuine issues of material fact remain for litigation with regard to whether B.P. is a manufacturer of the fixture assembly unit as required by R.C. 2307.71(I). The record shows that B.P. was not engaged in a business directly relating to the unit itself. At least in <em>Wireman, </em>Marathon designed the VRS to be used directly on its storage tanks. Appellant moreover fails to demonstrate the existence of genuine issues of material fact whether the unit was ever intended to be introduced into trade or commerce, and thus a \u201cproduct\u201d under R.C. 2307.71(L)(1). The trial court, therefore, properly entered summary judgment in B.P.\u2019s favor. <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095; <em>Johnson v. New London </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 60, 521 N.E.2d 793; <em>Temple, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b642-10\">Patton, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b642-11\">Dyke, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\">. Hi Tec also appears in the record as \u201cHi-Tech Metals.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-11\">. Although appellant named Hi Tec as a defendant in an amended complaint, the record fails to indicate that a complaint was served on this named defendant. Reviewability of this appeal is, therefore, not hindered by the absence of Civ.R. 54(B) language. See <em>Drexler v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 367, 609 N.E.2d 231; <em>Harris v.
