Wade, M.D., in this medical malpractice case. Appellants, June Pool et al., set forth the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the substantial prejudice of the plaintiffs in sustaining an objection to the use of a drug bulletin issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u2018FDA\u2019) in July 1974 and in not allowing testimony relative to actions taken by the FDA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the substantial prejudice of the plaintiffs by consistently excluding proper expert testimony under Evidence Rule 703.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-13\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s hostile demeanor toward the plaintiffs [sic ] case denied the plaintiffs a fair trial as guaranteed them under both the U.S. and Ohio State Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">On July 29, 1994, appellant June Pool, individually and in her capacity as parent and next friend of Sean Pool, a minor, filed a complaint against appellee. Appellants alleged that appellee was negligent in not properly informing June Pool of the risk of taking anticonvulsant medications during pregnancy. Appellants further alleged that as a result of this negligence, Sean Pool was born with multiple abnormalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">The case proceeded to trial in August 1995. The jury returned a verdict for appellee. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">In the first part of the first assignment of error, appellants contend that the trial court erred in sustaining an objection to the use of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) bulletin as an exhibit. In their brief, appellants admit that the FDA bulletin is hearsay, but argue that it was admissible under Evid.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>803(8), the hearsay exception for public records and reports. Hearsay is defined in Evid.R. 801(c) as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Unless an exception applies under Evid.R. 803 or Evid.R. 804, hearsay statements are not admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 802, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201cHearsay is not admissible except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by the Constitution of the State of Ohio, by statute enacted by the General Assembly not in conflict with a rule of the Supreme Court of Ohio, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court of Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Evid.R. 804 is inapplicable in this case. Evid.R. 803(8) provides an exception for the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">\u201cRecords, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth (a) the activities of the office or agency, or (b) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel, unless offered by defendant, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">One authority has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">\u201cThe purpose of subdivision (a) is to admit those records involving the simplest and least controversial application of the doctrine, namely, those containing simple factual assertions regarding the function of the official agency. Examples of evidence admissible as proof of the activities of official agencies include: accounting records or <em>[sic </em>] governmental agencies; dockets and journal entries of courts, legislative bodies and administrative tribunals; certificates of title, registry, death and birth; records of licensing agencies; and records of deeds and conveyances. * * * [D]ue to the simple and factual nature of these records, and their focus upon the <em>internal </em>function of the relevant agency, the risk of inaccuracy is greatly diminished, and thus they qualify for admission under subdivision (a).\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic; </em>footnote omitted.) Weissenberger\u2019s Ohio Evidence (1996) 409, Section 803.105.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3_\">A caveat to Subdivision (a) was noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">\u201cWhere the focus of the particular record is more <em>external </em>to the functioning of the agency, in that it largely concerns the activities and conduct of certain citizens, or events or transactions outside the operation of the agency or office, it should not be admitted under subsection (a).\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic; </em>footnotes omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 409-410, Section 803.105.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>In discussing Subdivision (b), this authority noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cIn general, subdivision (b) is designed to embrace primarily factual records in a variety of forms, and Rule 803(8)(b) may be used as a vehicle for the admission of records reflecting events, transactions and conditions of almost any sort. Notably, the Rule does not include records, or portions of records, that may be characterized as \u2018evaluations\u2019 or \u2018interpretations\u2019 of such events or transactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, Section 803.106.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">An important foundational requirement for admission of official records pursuant to Evid.R. 803(8)(b) is that the governmental employee or agent have personal knowledge of the event or condition described in the report. <em>Id. </em>Although Subdivisions (a) and (b) mirror the corresponding federal Evidence Rule, Ohio did not adopt federal Subdivision (c), which deals specifically with investigative reports of governmental administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The court in <em>State v. Humphries </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 589, 597, 607 N.E.2d 921, 926-927, held that evaluative and investigative reports are not admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule under Evid.R. 803(8)(b). See, also, <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc. </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 239, 535 N.E.2d 702. Both courts noted that the public-records exception under the Ohio Rules of Evidence does not encompass evaluative or investigative reports. <em>State v. Humphries, </em>79 Ohio App.3d at 597, 607 N.E.2d at 926-927; <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., </em>41 Ohio App.3d at 241-242, 535 N.E.2d at 704-706.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Additionally, in <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>41 Ohio App.3d at 242, 535 N.E.2d at 705-706, the court noted that the reports included statements made by lay people as well as statements made by the official agency. The court excluded the reports because they contained hearsay statements that were not firsthand observations of the official making the reports. In reaching this conclusion, the court quoted the following from 1 Weissenberger, Ohio Evidence, Section 803.108, at 95:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\u201c[N]either subdivision (a) nor (b) of Rule 803(8) embraces statements made by persons outside the official agency, i.e., private citizens. Where sources outside the agency have made statements or contributed information, the issue is one of multiple hearsay * * *.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">The <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>court held that for a document to be admissible under Evid.R. 803(8)(b), the observations of the reporter must occur pursuant to a legally imposed duty, the matters observed must be the subject of a duty to report, and the observations must be the firsthand observations either of the official making the report or of one with a duty to report to a public official. <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>State v. Vogelsong </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 354, 358-359, 612 N.E.2d 462, 465-466 (electronic file inadmissible under Evid.R. 803[8] when official had access to data but could not verify data\u2019s accuracy or method of input); <em>State v. Breeze </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 464, 472, 624 N.E.2d 1092, 1097 (\u201cData created by a secondary [nonpublic agency] source and placed into a police file is not automatically converted into a public record for purposes of the hearsay exception in Evid.R. 803[8].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><em>Wetherill v. Univ. of Chicago </em>(N.D.Ill.1981), 518 F.Supp. 1387, 1389, is useful in our analysis of Evid.R. 803(8). In <em>Wetherill, </em>the court examined the admissibility of a United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (\u201cHEW\u201d) report prepared by an <em>ad hoc </em>task force established to study the effects of the drug diethylstilbestrol (\u201cDES\u201d). The task force reviewed published and unpublished information on DES and made recommendations. The court, contrasting this report with an EEOC report held admissible in another case, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201cBut here the Report was based in large part on the task force\u2019s evaluation of the results of the experiments as themselves interpreted by sophisticated scientists. Moreover the task force also relied on many informal sources of evidence that were not based on first-hand observation. There is obviously a greater degree of trustworthiness in a report prepared by a trained EEOC investigator from lay accounts of an incident than in a task force\u2019s assessment of work done by experts combined with its evaluation of material from a wide variety of other non-expert sources.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The court also quoted the following from 4 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence 803(8)[02] at 803-198:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u201cWhen the statement was furnished by a layman without any duty to report, the requisite guarantees of reliability necessary for the official records exception to apply were missing, unless' some other hearsay exceptions might be satisfied * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1389-1390.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The court concluded that the report was inadmissible because it was based on evidence from numerous unofficial sources, \u201cmany of whom obviously had no \u2018duty imposed by law' to report such information.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">In applying the foregoing to the FDA bulletin in this case, this court finds that the bulletin contains hearsay statements which were not firsthand observations of the official making the report and further that the bulletin contains evaluative or investigative information from laypersons. Therefore, the FDA bulletin was not admissible under Evid.R. 803(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Accordingly, the first part of appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">In the second part of the first assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in not allowing expert testimony relative to the actions taken by the FDA. At trial, however, appellants did not proffer the substance of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>their expert\u2019s testimony would have been. The following is the relevant portion of the trial transcript of the direct examination of appellants\u2019 expert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201cQ: Do you have an opinion, Doctor, as to when there first came to be a general consensus in the field of medicine and science \u2014 concerning the fact that hydantoins cause birth defects in pregnancy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201c[APPELLEE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019ll let him answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u201cA: Um\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: If there was such a consensus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">\u201cA: Well, the \u2014 by 1974 the FDA\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">\u201c[APPELLEE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Objection as to what the FDA did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">Evid.R. 103(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-14\">\u201c(A) Effect of erroneous ruling. Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-15\"><em>a </em>* # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-16\">\u201c(2) Offer of proof. In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked. Offer of proof is not necessary if evidence is excluded during cross-examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">It is well settled that when a court has sustained an objection, a statement must be made as to what the expected answer would be in order that a reviewing court can determine whether the ruling is prejudicial. In the absence of a proffer, the exclusion of evidence may not be assigned as error, <em>State v. Gilmore </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 190, 191-192, 28 OBR 278, 279-280, 503 N.E.2d 147, 149-150, unless the substance of the excluded evidence is apparent from the context within which questions were asked. See, also, <em>Bilikam v. Bilikam </em>(1982), 2 Ohio App.3d 300, 305, 2 OBR 332, 337-338, 441 N.E.2d 845, 850-851. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the substance of the excluded testimony is not apparent from appellants\u2019 attorney\u2019s question and the expert\u2019s brief utterance before the objection. Thus, an offer of proof was needed to preserve the record for appeal. <em>Gannett v. Booher </em>(1983), 12 Ohio App.3d 49, 54, 12 OBR 190, 195-196, 465 N.E.2d 1326, 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">Accordingly, the second part of appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>In the second assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in its rulings regarding the admissibility of expert testimony under Evid.R. 703. Appellants cite five rulings: four that occurred during direct examination of one of their experts <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a fifth ruling during appellants\u2019 closing argument. Resolution of this assignment of error requires review of Ohio law concerning hearsay and learned treatises.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Hearsay was previously defined in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Hearsay testimony does not afford the opposing party an opportunity to confront and to cross-examine the out-of-court declarant, thereby depriving the party of the \u201cguaranty of truthfulness resulting from the oath of [the] declarant.\u201d <em>Potter v. Baker </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 488, 494, 55 O.O. 389, 392, 124 N.E.2d 140, 144. Furthermore, the opportunity to test the accuracy of the declarant\u2019s observations is not present when hearsay statements are admitted into evidence. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, hearsay statements generally lack indicia of reliability and are not admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The Ohio Rules of Evidence do not incorporate the learned-treatise exception to the hearsay rule incorporated in Fed.R.Evid. 803(18). Thus, in Ohio, learned treatises may not be admitted into evidence, and a witness may not quote from the treatise or refer to its title during direct examination. <em>Piotrowski v. Corey Hosp. </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 61, 15 O.O.2d 126, 173 N.E.2d 355, syllabus. As stated by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Ramage v. Cent. Ohio Emergency Serv., Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 97, 110, 592 N.E.2d 828, 838: \u201cIn Ohio, textbooks and other learned treatises are considered hearsay, may not be used as substantive evidence, and are specifically limited to impeachment purposes only.\u201d In regard to use of learned treatises for impeachment, the Ohio Supreme Court has also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">\u201cAccordingly, in Ohio, a learned treatise may be used for impeachment purposes to demonstrate that an expert witness is either unaware of the text or unfamiliar with its contents. Moreover, the substance of the treatise may be employed only to impeach the credibility of an expert witness who has relied upon the treatise or has acknowledged its authoritative nature.\u201d (Citation omitted). <em>Stinson v. England </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 451, 458, 633 N.E.2d 532, 539.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Beyond the hearsay problem, learned treatises are inadmissible because the opinions or conclusions contained therein are unverifiable, the technical language may not be understood by most triers of fact, the opinions or conclusions would be admitted into evidence without an oath of truthfulness, and the opposing party would be unable to cross-examine the person who gave the opinion or conclusion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Piotrowski v. Corey Hosp., </em>172 Ohio St. at 69, 15 O.O.2d at 130, 173 N.E.2d at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Evid.R. 703 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by him or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Ohio Evid.R. 703 differs from the federal rule in that the Ohio rule does not recognize a third basis for expert opinion: information supplied to the expert outside the record, \u201cif of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fed.R.Evid. 703. As one legal authority has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">\u201cMcCormick notes that under Federal Rule 703, the jury is asked to accept the expert witness\u2019s inference where it is based upon a hearsay assertion of fact which is, presumably, unsupported by any evidence at trial. The Ohio Rule embraces McCormick\u2019s criticism, and under Ohio Rule 703, the proponent of the expert must obtain the admission of the facts or data supporting the expert opinion before the opinion is properly rendered.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) Weissenberger\u2019s Ohio Evidence (1996) 305, Section 703.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">As the court in <em>Beavercreek Local Schools v. Basic, Inc. </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 669, 676-677, 595 N.E.2d 360, 365, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">\u201c[A] fine line must be drawn between an expert opinion which has incorporated the scholarly opinions of others, and the direct quotation of the opinions or conclusions of other experts, which is not permitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">The court in <em>Beavercreek Local Schools v. Basic, Inc., </em>71 Ohio App.3d at 677, 595 N.E.2d at 365, quoting from <em>Steinfurth v. Armstrong World Industries </em>(1986), 27 Ohio Misc.2d 21, 23, 27 OBR 206, 208-209, 500 N.E.2d 409, 412, also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">\u201cEven the mentioning of the titles of the articles would preclude the * * * [opposing party] from having the opportunity of adequate cross-examination as to the truth of the matters contained therein. It is apparent that the drafters of the Ohio Rules of Evidence intended to preserve inviolate a litigant\u2019s right to confrontation. They also were undoubtedly aware of how difficult it is for the average juror to grasp the fine distinction attorneys draw when admitting a piece of evidence when it is not offered for the truth contained therein, but merely for the purpose that a statement was made. As a result, direct quotation is not permitted under the Ohio Rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Appellants cite <em>Hart v. Lechnar </em>(June 7, 1991), Lucas App. No. L-89-276, unreported, 1991 WL 97313, in support of their argument. The case, however, does not support appellants\u2019 argument. In <em>Hart, </em>this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">\u201cWhen Lechnar\u2019s expert testified, he acknowledged that he relied on the Crowe article to formulate his conclusions. In addition, a portion of the article was read into evidence. <em>Both the reference to the specific article and the reading of a portion of the article into evidence were improper under Ohio law. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In this case, on direct examination, appellants\u2019 expert mentioned \u201cmedical literature.\u201d or \u201cthe literature\u201d or was asked about it, and appellee objected. It is apparent that appellee anticipated that the expert would next, improperly under Ohio rules, refer to specific medical treatises or articles and that appellee did not want to be in the position of \u201cunringing the bell\u201d by objecting after a specific reference had been made. This court has thoroughly reviewed the record. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, this court does not find that the trial court erred in sustaining appellee\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Accordingly, appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">In the third assignment of error, appellants contend that the trial court\u2019s hostility toward their case denied them a fair trial as guaranteed under both the United States and Ohio Constitutions. Appellants cite several instances as examples of the trial court\u2019s hostility toward their case. This court, after a thorough review of the record, finds no merit in appellants\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">The first example cited by appellants occurred during voir dire when a potential juror stated that one of her children had been born with clubfeet. The court questioned her about sympathy and objectivity in this case and then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * Do you know of any reason that your son was born with that defect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">\u201c[POTENTIAL JUROR]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Those things happen. I had a son that was born with a severe physical defect which has, of course, affected him through the years. Those things \u2014 mother nature sometimes fumbles the ball for no known reason. I can sympathize with you. But the only thing is, in the trial of this case, you must not let that affect your verdict if you are seated as a juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">\u201c[POTENTIAL JUROR]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Anybody else have any physical defect in either their own family or a member of their immediate family or close friends that in any way would affect your sitting as a juror?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Appellants assert that this exchange \u201cplanted seeds of doubt as to the Plaintiffs [sic ] theory into the minds of the jury.\u201d Appellants also assert that trial counsel expressed concern about the interaction noted above in an unrecorded sidebar shortly after the interaction. However, as noted, that sidebar was not recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">At issue in this case were birth defects and their causation. Thus, the trial court questioned potential jurors regarding birth defects. The trial court\u2019s comment, taken in context, was in response to the potential juror\u2019s answer that she did not know the cause of her son\u2019s defect. The trial court\u2019s comment constituted an acknowledgment of common knowledge: birth defect causation is not always known.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We find no prejudice in this comment by the trial court. Furthermore, any potential prejudice to appellants was offset by the trial court\u2019s jury instruction which cautioned the jurors against being influenced by any impression they had of what the trial judge thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">In regard to other examples cited by appellants as prejudicial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this court has thoroughly reviewed appellants\u2019 specific allegations as well as the entire trial transcript and does not find that appellants were denied their right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Evid.R. 611(A)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> recognizes the trial court\u2019s authority to exercise control over the courtroom. The trial court exercised such authority when one of appellants\u2019 experts prefaced his answer about the components of fetal hydantoin syndrome with the comment \u201cIt\u2019s a long list.\u201d The trial court then stated: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we confine it to the components claimed in this case,\u201d and appellants\u2019 trial counsel responded, \u201cFine.\u201d In another cited example, when appellants\u2019 counsel began questioning another expert about his responsibilities in the family court in New York, after this expert had already described his responsibilities, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Let\u2019s move on and get to the issues at hand. I\u2019m not interested, and I\u2019m sure the jury isn\u2019t interested, in the family court of New York. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Other examples include the trial court\u2019s request that another expert not \u201cramble\u201d but answer the question asked; the trial court\u2019s request that this same expert answer another question; and in a third example, when another expert, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>response to a query about his testimony in prior cases, began an explanation of why he testifies in litigation, the trial court stated, \u201cI take it your answer to the question would have been yes?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Some of the above examples involved testimony that was not relevant and some testimony that was redundant. This court finds no prejudice in the trial court\u2019s prodding of the witnesses and trial counsel to move the case along. See <em>Guziak v. Guziak </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 805, 817, 610 N.E.2d 1135, 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Appellants also cite examples of the trial court\u2019s comments to trial counsel, including the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u201c[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection. Leading, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: It is. Go ahead, though. It is leading. You lead quite often. Qq * * * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Other examples were when the trial court cautioned appellants\u2019 trial counsel not to repeat testimony when he either prefaced his questions with prior testimony or repeated questions already asked and answered. Another example concerned the trial court\u2019s response when appellants\u2019 trial counsel challenged the judge\u2019s ruling regarding appellants\u2019 trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">After a through review of the entire trial transcript, this court finds that the trial court exercised its authority pursuant to Evid.R. 611(A). In <em>Nabakowski v. 5400 Corp. </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App.3d 82, 90, 29 OBR 92, 100-101, 503 N.E.2d 218, 226-227, when the trial court interjected itself perhaps more often than necessary, the appellate court noted that the trial court \u201cshould have talked to counsel privately in a side-bar conference\u201d but concluded, \u201cThese acts do not demonstrate bias but are likely to occur when counsel has limited trial experience, or tempers flare.\u201d See, also, <em>Mobberly v. Hendricks </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 839, 846, 649 N. E.2d 1247, 1251-1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">This court concludes that many of the trial court\u2019s comments constituted efforts to keep the trial within reasonable bounds and/or were induced by behavior of counsel. Using the criteria in <em>State v. Wade </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 182, 188, 7 O.O.3d 362, 365-366, 373 N.E.2d 1244, 1248-1249,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> vacated on other grounds, (1978), 438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3138, 57 L.Ed.2d 1157, to determine whether the trial judge\u2019s comments were prejudicial, we conclude that, within the context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the proceedings, the trial judge\u2019s comments represented the proper exercise of his authority to maintain order in the courtroom and/or to monitor the presentation of evidence in accordance with Evid.R. 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Furthermore, although we find no prejudice, any potential prejudice to appellants was offset by the trial court\u2019s jury instruction which cautioned the jurors against being influenced by any impression they had of what the trial judge thought. This court finds without merit appellants\u2019 argument that the trial court\u2019s demeanor was prejudicial and denied them a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Accordingly, appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">On consideration whereof, the court finds that substantial justice has been done the party complaining, and the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellants are ordered to pay the court costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-9\">Melvin L. Resnick, P.J., Handwork and Sherck, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-10\">. In the first ruling cited, the objection occurred after the expert gave his response, and the trial court staled: \"Well, he\u2019s answered. Let it go.\" Thus, the trial court did not sustain the defense objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-13\">. One of appellants\u2019 trial attorneys, admitted to the practice of law in New Jersey and admitted <em>pro hac vice </em>for this trial, argued this basis for the admissibility of the expert\u2019s opinion at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b493-11\">. One cited example occurred during a sidebar conference and, thus, as admitted by appellants, presumably outside the hearing of the jury. We need not address this example.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b493-12\">. Evid.R. 611(A) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">\"The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b494-15\">. The Supreme Court of Ohio set forth this five-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-16\">\"(1) The burden of proof is placed upon the defendant to demonstrate prejudice, (2) it is presumed that the trial judge is in the best position to decide when a breach is committed and what corrective measures are called for, (3) the remarks are to be considered in light of the circumstances under which they are made, (4) consideration is to be given to their possible effect upon the jury, and (5) to their possible impairment of the effectiveness of counsel.\" <em>State v. Wade </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 182, 188, 7 O.O.3d 362, 365, 373 N.E.2d 1244, 1248.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
