O\u2019Neill, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">This timely appeal arises from a jury verdict finding defendant-appellant guilty of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A)(B) with a firearms specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">At or about 3:00 P.M. on January 11, 1993, the appellant was involved in a traffic accident with Clarence Jones. Jones was apparently at fault because, as he approached the intersection of Albert Street and McGuffey Road, Jones drove his automobile into the back of an automobile being driven by the appellant. The automobile that the appellant was driving was owned by Tracy Wilkes,' a notorious drug dealer. A passenger in Jones\u2019s car, his girlfriend, Nakia Lewis, testified at trial that Austin initially exited the car holding a handgun. However, because Austin and Jones knew each other and were on friendly terms, any ill feelings at the scene of the accident were quickly defused.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">Austin and Jones quickly notified Wilkes of what had happened, and the two each agreed to pay Wilkes $250 each for the damages to Wilkes\u2019s automobile. Austin and Jones then parted amiably. Sometime later, Austin was informed that Jones had expressed to persons that he was not going to contribute to payment for the damage to the Wilkes\u2019s car. Austin saw Jones driving his automobile about the Kimmel Housing Project. When Jones\u2019s car came to a stop, Austin entered the car, and then he and Jones proceeded to drive about. Austin testified that, as soon as he entered Jones\u2019s automobile, Jones started to berate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>him, cursing and threatening him. Austin went on to testify that, when Jones stopped at a traffic light, he reached down beside his left leg and drew a gun. When Austin saw the gun, he immediately feared that he was going to be killed and drew a gun from the pocket of his jacket and shot and killed Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The first assignment of error complains that the court erred in sustaining the prosecution\u2019s objection against allowing defendant to testify concerning what defendant knew about the character of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">During the direct examination of the appellant, the following dialogue took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">\u201cQ. Past the mall. Okay. Now, how do you know that Clarence Jones carried a gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">\u201cA. Because I seen him use it before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">\u201cQ. Seen him use it how?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\">\u201cA. Shot up a car before. It wasn\u2019t like \u2014 it was a car riding through and he had shot it up. That\u2019s what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-11\">\u201cQ. Ever seen Clarence mad before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-12\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-13\">\u201cQ. Mad at who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-14\">\u201cA. He was beating up LeShawn Carter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-15\">\u201cMR. BAILEY: Objection. I\u2019m going to ask to approach the bench to have a side bar for a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-17\"><em>ii </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-18\">\u201cMR. BAILEY: Your Honor, I also want to \u2014 I am giving the defense notice, I believe the defense has opened the door. He\u2019s bringing out the victim\u2019s propensity for violence and I believe he opens the door for the Defendant\u2019s character at this point for violence. He\u2019s claiming self defense and claiming now that the victim is of violent character, and it now opens the door as to cross examination of this witness as to any violent acts by the Defendant to rebut that type of testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-19\">\u201cMR. PALUMBARO [Counsel for the defendant]: Wait a minute. Okay. Might be right but only about testimony with regards to Clarence Jones not anybody else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: Albert, you can\u2019t impugn the character of the decedent without having your character being on board also at the same time. What is good for the goose has got to be good for the gander. If you\u2019re saying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>decedent was of a violent nature, you know the Defendant opens the door for himself at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">\u201cMR. PALUMBARO: Evidence of a violent and dangerous nature of a victim is generally admissible where the Defendant pleads self defense. Rebuttal evidence may then be offered by the prosecution that rebuttal evidence is the nature of the victim only not the Defendant in this case. We are not opening any door. We admit we had a gun. I\u2019ll stop that testimony right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I\u2019ll sustain your objection. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Initially, we somewhat question whether it is proper to raise this assignment of error. It would appear that counsel for the defendant abandoned his approach in attacking the character of the decedent. On the other hand, we do not find that there was any proffer by the appellant wherein the character of the decedent would have at least been placed before this court to determine whether there was any prejudice in the possible error. Regardless, we shall proceed to discuss and dispose of this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">A defendant arguing self-defense may testify about specific instances of the victim\u2019s prior conduct in order to establish the defendant\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-9\">\u201cA defendant, when arguing self-defense, may testify about specific instances of the victim\u2019s prior conduct in order to establish the defendant\u2019s state of mind. These events are admissible in evidence, not because they establish something about the victim\u2019s character, but because they tend to show why the defendant believed the victim would kill or severely injure him.\u201d <em>State v. Carlson </em>(1986), 31 Ohio App.3d 72, 31 OBR 112, 508 N.E.2d 999, paragraph one of the syllabus. See, also, <em>State v. Roderick </em>(1907), 77 Ohio St. 301, 82 N.E. 1082.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">We do not agree with the trial judge\u2019s ruling that if the defendant were to delve into the character of the decedent, the defendant would be opening the door to cross-examination or direct evidence relative to his character. Evid.R. 404(A)(1) sets forth an instance where the character of an accused may be examined.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\">\u201c(A) Character Evidence Generally. Evidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of his character is not admissible for the purpose of proving that he acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, subject to the following exceptions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-12\">\u201c(1) <em>Character of Accused. </em>Evidence of a pertinent trait of his character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same is admissible; however, in prosecutions for rape, gross sexual imposition, and prostitution, the exceptions provided by statute enacted by the General Assembly are applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-13\">\u201c(2) <em>Character of Victim. </em>Evidence of a pertinent trait of character of the victim of the crime offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>same, or evidence of a character trait of peacefulness of the victim offered by the prosecution in a homicide case to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor is admissible; however, in prosecutions for rape, gross sexual imposition, and prostitution, the exceptions provided by statute enacted by the General Assembly are applicable.\u201d Evid.R. 404(A)(1)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Evid.R. 404(A)(1) and (2) are mutually exclusive. When an accused injects the issue of the victim\u2019s character into the case, either by offering character evidence in accordance with Evid.R. 405 or by coupling self-defense with evidence of first aggression by the victim in a homicide case, the accused does not by virtue of these elections open the issue of the accused\u2019s own character. The issue of the accused\u2019s character is only introduced in accordance with the provisions of Evid.R. 404(A)(1) when the accused offers positive character evidence as prescribed by the procedures delineated in Evid.R. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Regardless of the foregoing error, we cannot conclude that the error had anything to do with the outcome of the trial. The appellant testified at the trial and portrayed his actions in defending himself from the victim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">\u201cA. And I had caught him and we got in the car. I was trying to strike a conversation with him about, umm, you know what happened, and what I heard because I talked to Tracy and Tracy said CJ said he wasn\u2019t paying nothing. And, umm, then after that I had tried to talk to him, and I got in the car with him, and I was like, you know, what\u2019s going on? And, umm, he was like, umm, man \u2014 I ain\u2019t trying to start talking foul at the mouth, you know \u2014 just going over, you know, asking\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">\u201cQ. What was he saying like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">\u201cA. Like, umm, I can say it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\">\u201cQ. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-11\">\u201cA. He was like, umm, \u2018Fuck you, like, fuck you. I ain\u2019t paying shit you mother fuckers. I ain\u2019t scared of all of you. You mother fuckers all going to learn. You all going to learn.\u2019 And then\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-12\">\u201cQ. He was talking like that to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-13\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-14\">\u201cQ. What was his tone of voice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-15\">\u201cA. It was high. The way he talked, you know, the way he talked normally, you could tell because, he, like, while he talked he was talking in a different tone. This was something new to me. And, umm, we got up on Bettman and increased his speed, you know, flew about \u2014 flew down Victor, and he was still flying. He going off. I\u2019m like, \u2018Slow down, man.\u2019 He was like, nope. He was like, nope. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>And he said, mother fucker, I\u2019m going to get you all.\u2019 And when he turned, you know, we got at the light, at the red light, he turned around just like this (indicating), pointed the gun at me, dead to my face. I seen a gun in my face. First instinct was to turn around and shoot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">\u201cQ. Where did he get the gun from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">\u201cA. Under his left leg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">\u201cQ. This happened pretty quick?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-9\">\u201cQ. Real quick?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-10\">\u201cA. Like I say, you know, I don\u2019t remember. All I know it happened fast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWJ\">\u201cQ. What type of gun was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-11\">\u201cA. It was a nine that he always used to carry. It was a nine. He carried it a lot, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-12\">\u201cQ. Saw him with that gun before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-13\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-14\">\u201cQ. Similar to the gun that you had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-15\">\u201cA. No, it was just \u2014 it was bigger than the gun I had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-16\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t know what type of gun it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-17\">\u201cA. Nope, it was a nine I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-18\">\u201cQ. Do you know what type of gun you had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-19\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-20\">\u201cQ. Do you know the model?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-21\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know the model but I know it was a smaller version.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-22\">\u201cQ. Smaller than what he had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-23\">\u201cA. Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-24\">\u201cQ. Come up to the light and you see a gun? What hand did he have the gun in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-25\">\u201cA. His left hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-26\">\u201cQ. Where did he get it from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-27\">\u201cA. From his left leg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-28\">\u201cQ. Then what did you do immediately?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>\u201cA. First when the gun was first drew I looked, and when I had turned this way the barrel was in my face, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">\u201cQ. Where was your hands?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">\u201cA. My hands was just like this (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">\u201cQ. You went into your coat\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\">\u201cAnd went in the coat pocket and pulled my gun. As I pulled my gun, I was shooting and at the same time I was trying to get the door open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\">\u201cQ. Car started to move?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">\u201cA. Car started to move. After I hit him the car moved and just ran into the thing and I think that\u2019s how the door got open. I don\u2019t know how the door got open to this day. That\u2019s the same thing I told them. I don\u2019t know how the door got open automatically, but I know I got it open somehow and I fell out of the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">The appellant did not fire in self-defense because of any background information he might have possessed relative to the character of the accused. He fired because of the immediate threat upon his life when the victim drew his gun and pointed it into the appellant\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">The first assignment of error is found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">The second assignment of error contends that the appellant\u2019s conviction should be reversed because the conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence and the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">Under assignment of error number one we have already set forth the appellant\u2019s version of the shooting which resulted in the victim\u2019s death. The prosecution called LaShawn Alita Jones. This witness was the mother of two children whose father was the decedent. This witness testified about meeting the defendant-appellant prior to the shooting.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-15\">\u201cQ. Now, when you went over to Linda Deltorio\u2019s, who was there when you went to drop off your children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-16\">\u201cA. Michael Austin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-17\">\u201cQ. Did you see him here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-18\">\u201cA. Yes, Ido.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-19\">\u201cQ. Point him out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-20\">\u201cA. Right there (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-21\">\u201cQ. Is this the man who you are referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">\u201cMR. BAILEY: May the record reflect that the witness identified the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-6\">\u201cBy Mr. Bailey</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">\u201cQ. Now, did you have any conversation with the Defendant at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUa\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">\u201cQ. What did he tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">\u201cA. When I walked in he told me \u2014 he says CJ \u2014 \u2018Tell CJ to chalk it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-10\">\u201cQ. \u2018Chalk it\u2019\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-12\">\u201cQ. \u2014means what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-13\">\u201cA. Take it as a loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-14\">\u201cQ. Take it as a loss. Chalk it up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-15\">\u201cA. Uh-hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-16\">\u201cQ. Do you know what he was talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-17\">\u201cA. No, not at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-18\">\u201cQ. Did he explain to you what he was talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-19\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-20\">\u201cQ. What did he tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-21\">\u201cA. He told me that, umm, earlier that day \u2014 I mean CJ had got into a car, got in a wreck at a gas station and, umm, what else? Umm, then from there he said that CJ better have his money, and I told him I was between them two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-22\">\u201cQ. Okay. Now when he told you that CJ better have his money, did he say what he would do if CJ didn\u2019t have his money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-23\">\u201cA. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-24\">\u201cQ. What did he tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-25\">\u201cA. He said he was going to shoot him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-26\">\u201cQ. Now, did he show you any type of a weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-27\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-28\">\u201cQ. What did he show you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-29\">\u201cA. He had a gun already in his, like, hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-30\">\u201cQ. What kind of gun was this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>\u201cA. Umm, it had a clip to it. I don\u2019t know. I ain\u2019t for sure. I\u2019m not for sure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The prosecution also presented witnesses who entered the decedent\u2019s car immediately after the shooting. Under direct examination, none of these parties said that they found a gun in the victim\u2019s car. Apparently, the jury afforded no weight or credibility to the defendant\u2019s recitation as to what happened at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">\u201cAn appellate court\u2019s function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Jackson v. Virginia </em>[1979], 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, followed.)\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">In its conclusion in the <em>Jenks </em>case, a unanimous Supreme Court stated, at 283, 574 N.E.2d at 510, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">\u201cMoreover, we have refined the standard of appellate review from a criminal conviction to reflect our rejection of the circumstantial evidence rule. An appellate court will no longer conduct a review of the evidence to determine if the state\u2019s theory of guilt is irreconcilable with any reasonable theory of innocence. If the jury is convinced that the prosecution has proven that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, we can require no more. Likewise, where an appellate court determines there is sufficient probative evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding, it should affirm the conviction. However, nothing in our decision today changes the reviewing court\u2019s duty, when called upon, to examine the record evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether there was substantial, probative evidence to support a guilty verdict. More important, nothing in this opinion alters the state\u2019s heavy burden in a criminal case, which remains proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The elements of murder, as set forth in R.C. 2903.02, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">\u201c(A) No person shall purposely cause the death of another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Appellant admitted before the jurors that he purposely caused the death of the decedent. However, he insisted that he caused the death of the decedent in defending himself. In his version, the defendant testified that the decedent drew a gun and pointed it at him, causing him to be fearful for his life. Following the shooting, a gun was not discovered on the body of the decedent or about him in his automobile. We can reasonably conclude that the jurors afforded no credibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>ty to the appellant\u2019s version of self-defense and instead simply found, which they were justified in doing, that he had purposely caused the death of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b804-7\">Gene Donofrio and Cox, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
