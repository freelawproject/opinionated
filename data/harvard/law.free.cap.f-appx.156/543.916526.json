He raises three issues on appeal, contending that: (1) the retroactive application of the remedial holding of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), violates ex post facto and due process principles; (2) the district court clearly erred in calculating his relevant conduct; and (3) his sentence, imposed by the district court after considering the sentencing guidelines as advisory, is unreasonable. Finding no merit to Monroe\u2019s claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-30\">In Monroe\u2019s first claim, he argues that his due process rights, in conjunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>with ex post facto principles, are violated by the imposition of a sentence under the Supreme Court\u2019s remedial decision in <em>Booker </em>(referring to the Court\u2019s opinion expressed through Justice Breyer, which makes the guidelines advisory rather than mandatory), rather than under the mandatory guidelines applicable at the time of his offense. We have thoroughly reviewed Monroe\u2019s claim and find it to be without merit based on the reasoning of our sister circuits. <em>See United States v. Dupas, </em>419 F.3d 916 (9th Cir.2005) (rejecting ex post facto claim); <em>United States v. Jamison, </em>416 F.3d 538 (7th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Lata, </em>415 F.3d 107 (1st Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 576 (5th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.2005) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Next, Monroe claims that the district court clearly erred in crediting the testimony of the confidential informant in his case and holding him responsible for a total of 27.89 grams of cocaine base. A district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantity attributable to a defendant is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999). The Government bears the burden of proving relevant conduct by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>76 F.3d 596, 604 (4th Cir. 1996). In calculating drug amounts, the court may consider any relevant information, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its accuracy. <em>United States v. Uwaeme, </em>975 F.2d 1016, 1021 (4th Cir.1992). Under the guidelines, drug quantities not specified in the counts of conviction are considered relevant conduct when they are part of the same course of conduct or common plan or scheme. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) (2004). We find that Monroe\u2019s previous sales of cocaine base to the confidential informant are sufficiently similar in degree and regularity to include these drug amounts in his relevant conduct. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 lBl.3, comment. (n.9(B)). We further find that the district court did not clearly err in determining the relevant conduct amount of drug quantity attributable to Monroe.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Finally, we note that Monroe\u2019s sentencing occurred on April 6, 2005, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker. </em>The district court, in sentencing Monroe, carefully and thoroughly applied the holding in <em>Booker. </em>The court sentenced Monroe only after considering and examining the -sentencing guidelines and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), as instructed by <em>Booker. </em>The court sentenced Monroe at the bottom of the applicable guideline range and well within the twenty-year statutory maximum. We cannot conclude under these circumstances that Monroe\u2019s 63-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Monroe\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
