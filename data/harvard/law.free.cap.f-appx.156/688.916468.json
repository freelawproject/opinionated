California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Laws has filed response briefs to counsel\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-26\">An independent review of the record reflects that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Laws\u2019s claim that his former trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to his guilty plea and waiver of his right to appeal is adequately developed, but not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-27\">Accordingly, Laws\u2019s motion for access to sealed documents in the record and his motion to proceed <em>pro se </em>on appeal are DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998). Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED and counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein; and this appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b714-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
