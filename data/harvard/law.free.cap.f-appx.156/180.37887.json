Joseph raises three arguments on appeal: (1) the district court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence transcripts of recorded statements; (2) the district court abused its discretion by limiting Joseph\u2019s cross-examination of a government witness; and (3) the district court sentenced Joseph in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because the district court did not abuse its discretion either by admitting the transcripts or by limiting cross-examination, we affirm Joseph\u2019s convictions. Because any statutory <em>Booker </em>error committed by the district court was harmless, we affirm Joseph\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AJAD\">On July 26, 2003, William Sampsel, a confidential informant working for the Drug Enforcement Administration, met with drug traffickers off the coast of the Bahamas to arrange the transport of cocaine and marijuana into the United States. Several men, possibly including Joseph, loaded Sampsel\u2019s boat with the drugs, and Sampsel was advised how to contact Joseph to drop off the drugs once they were inside the United States. Sampsel turned over the drugs to the DEA, but arranged the meeting with Joseph at the instruction of the DEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-12\">Several days later, Sampsel met with Joseph at a restaurant in Hollywood, Florida. The DEA taped their conversation, during which Sampsel and Joseph arranged to exchange the drugs at a warehouse the following day. The DEA also videotaped the meeting in the warehouse, and after Joseph began to load the cocaine in his vehicle, the DEA arrested him. Joseph and Michele Jean Francois, who was also present at the warehouse, were indicted on charges of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, attempt to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, and conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-13\">At trial, the defendants moved to exclude from evidence transcripts of the conversation at the restaurant and the meeting in the warehouse. They argued that the transcripts were inaccurate and that they erroneously identified one speaker to be Joseph. The district court denied the motion, but agreed to provide the following jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1408-14\">Ladies and gentlemen, in conjunction with any transcripts that are admitted during the course of this trial, I\u2019m going to read you an instruction that I\u2019ll ask you to follow with respect to any such transcripts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>As you have heard, this particular transcript has been identified as a typewritten transcript of the oral conversation that can be heard on a tape which I presume is going to be later admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-4\">This transcript also purports to identify the speakers engaged in the conversation. When the transcript is actually offered into evidence, I will admit it for the limited and secondary purpose of aiding you in following the content of the conversation as you listen to the tape recording when it is played, and also to aid you in identifying the speakers. However, you are specifically instructed that whether the transcript correctly or incorrectly reflects the content of the conversation or the identity of the speakers is entirely for you to determine based upon your own evaluation of the testimony ... you will hear concerning the preparation of the transcript and from your own examination of the transcript once it\u2019s presented to you in relation to your hearing the tape recording itself as the primary evidence of its own contents. And, if you should determine that the transcript is in any respect incorrect or unreliable, you should disregard it to that extent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-5\">Now, this is somewhat premature, because the tape hasn\u2019t been played yet and you don\u2019t have the transcripts to review yet, but, in anticipation of hearing them and seeing them and there is some reference being made to them, you should consider all of the testimony relating to the transcripts in conjunction with this instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">Joseph objected to the phrasing of the jury instruction, but the district court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-7\">The defendants presented evidence relating to the methods of transcription and the bias of the transcribers. Other speakers on the recordings testified that it was Joseph\u2019s voice on the tape, and Joseph cross-examined these witnesses. Francois introduced into evidence an alternate transcript of the recording, but Joseph chose not to offer his own. The district court repeated the jury instruction on several occasions. Joseph testified that it was not his voice on the recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-9\">Sampsel, the confidential informant, testified against the defendants. Joseph and Francois sought to introduce seventeen civil judgments that had been entered agajnst Sampsel during the 1990s on ,the ground that they were evidence of fraudulent activity. The district court conducted <em>voir dire </em>to determine whether the judgments were admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) and ruled that the judgments were inadmissible. During the hearing, Sampsel testified that he entered bankruptcy in \u201cthe late nineties;\u201d the defendants produced the bankruptcy judgment, and it was dated in 1993. The defendants sought to cross-examine Sampsel on this inconsistency in open trial. The district court ruled this line of questioning inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-10\">The jury acquitted Francois of all charges but convicted Joseph on the first and second counts of the indictment. The PSI calculated an offense level of 38 and an applicable guidelines range of 235-293 months. Joseph raised no factual objection to the PSI but argued that the sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court overruled the objection and said it considered the guidelines to be mandatory. The district court said it' \u201cbelieve[d] that a sentence at the upper end of the guideline range is necessary in this case in view of what [it] considered] the defendant\u2019s having perjured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>himself during the trial\u201d but, \u201cbecause of the high guideline range, an [enhancement for] obstruction [of justice] wasn\u2019t necessary in order to punish the defendant for having engaged in that conduct during the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-6\">This Court reviews the admission into evidence of transcripts of tape recordings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>578 F.2d 67, 69-70 (5th Cir.1978); <em>see also United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1376 (11th Cir.1993). We review limitations on the scope of cross-examination for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>168 F.3d 1234, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). We review preserved statutory <em>Booker </em>error for harmless error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-8\">Joseph raised three arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence transcripts of tape recorded and videotaped meetings. Second, Joseph argues that the district court abused its discretion in limiting his cross-examination of Sampsel, the confidential government informant. Third, Joseph argues that the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-9\">\n<em>A. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Admitting the Transcripts into Evidence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-10\">Joseph argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence transcripts of the conversation at the restaurant and the meeting in the warehouse. The procedure for challenging the accuracy of a transcript is well-established in this Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-11\">Initially, the district court and the parties should make an effort to produce an \u201cofficial\u201d or \u201cstipulated\u201d transcript, one which satisfies all sides. If such an \u201cofficial\u201d transcript cannot be produced, then each side should produce its own version of a transcript or its own version of the disputed portions. In addition, each side may put on evidence supporting the accuracy of its version or challenging the accuracy of the other side\u2019s version. Since the jury must always reconcile the discrepancies in the transcript(s) against the recording itself, the district court need not listen to the tape or decide whether a transcript is accurate before the transcript is given to the jury and the recording is played.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1410-12\"><em>United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1376 (11th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>578 F.2d 67, 69-70 (5th Cir.1978)). In the light of the precedents, Joseph\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-13\">The district court made available to the defendants each of the remedial procedures described in <em>Hogan </em>and <em>Wilson. </em>Francois proffered his own version of the transcript. Joseph presented testimony that purported to undermine the accuracy of the transcript. Both defendants cross-examined witnesses present during the taped meetings. Joseph even testified on his own behalf and denied his presence during the meetings. Moreover, the district court repeatedly instructed the jury, \u201c[S]hould [you] determine that the transcript is in any respect incorrect or unreliable, you should disregard it to that extent.\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the transcripts into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-14\">\n<em>B. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Limiting Cross-Examination of Sampsel.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-15\">Joseph argues that the district court abused its discretion in limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>cross-examination of Sampsel. Joseph contends that he should have been permitted to question Sampsel about false statements Sampsel made regarding the date of his bankruptcy during, <em>voir, dire, </em>but this argument fails. Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) provides, \u201cSpecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witnesses] character for truthfulness, other than conviction of crime, as provided in rule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 608(b). \u201cThey may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness [ ] concerning the witnesses] character for truthfulness or untruthfulness .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>It is within the discretion of the district court to \u201cpermit questioning about a witnesses] prior bad acts on cross-examination, if the acts bear on the witnesses] character for truthfulness.\u201d <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>168 F.3d 1234, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). But, \u201c[i]f the witness denies the conduct, such acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence and the questioning party must take the witnesses] answer, unless the evidence would be otherwise admissible as bearing on a material issue of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-4\">On appeal, Joseph contends that it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to bar Joseph from questioning Sampsel on his testimony during <em>voir dire. </em>We disagree. Although Joseph correctly asserts that cross-examination on matters \u201cconcerning the witnesses] character for truthfulness or untruthfulness\u201d is permissible, Fed.R.Evid. 608(b), this does not end our inquiry. Federal Rule of Evidence 403 permits the district court to exclude relevant evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury----\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403. The district court observed that it was not clear Sampsel \u201cintentionally made a false statement or whether he was mistaken!\u2019 Joseph could not introduce extrinsic evidence, <em>i.e., </em>Sampsel\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>testimony or the bankruptcy judgment, to prove the inconsistency, and the district court concluded that questioning on that matter would be of low probative value. Moreover, the district court permitted Joseph to impeach Sampsel on other grounds, including a pending charge of driving under the influence in Nevada. Because the discretion of the district court is \u201cespecially broad when it comes to controlling cross-examination for impeachment purposes,\u201d <em>United States v. Van Dorn, </em>925 F.2d 1331, 1335 (11th Cir.1991), we cannot say limiting cross-examination on this issue was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-8\">\n<em>C. Any Statutory Booker Error Was Harmless.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ALqq\">Joseph argues that the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error by sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines scheme. .The government concedes that the district court committed, statutory <em>Booker </em>error but \u2022 argues that the error was harmless. . We agree with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-10\">Statutory <em>Booker </em>error arises \u201cwhen the district court misapplies the Guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). When the defendant has preserved his objection to the constitutionality of the sentencing guidelines, we review for harmless error. <em>United States v. Mejia-Giovani, </em>416 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (11th Cir.2005). The burden is on the government to show that the statutory error was harmless, and that burden is to prove \u201cthat viewing the proceedings, in their entirety, ... the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">The government has established harmless error. At the sentencing hearing, the district court expressed its opinion that \u201c[Joseph] obviously perjured himself during trial,\u201d and the district court described Joseph\u2019s testimony as \u201cincredible.\u201d The district court explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t seek an enhancement for obstruction [of justice] when I saw the guidelines range, which I would have otherwise done since your client obviously perjured himself during the trial.\u201d The court concluded \u201ca sentence at the upper end of the guideline range is necessary in this case ... and, because of the high guideline range, an [enhancement for] obstruction [of justice] wasn\u2019t necessary in order to punish the defendant for having engaged in [perjury] during the course of the trial.\u201d Although the government only requested a midrange sentence of 247 months of imprisonment, the district court imposed a term of 276 months. Based on the statements made by the district court, <em>see Mejia-Giovani, </em>416 F.3d at 1326, and the sentence at the upper end of the guidelines range, we conclude that any statutory <em>Booker </em>error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-10\">We affirm Joseph\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1412-12\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1412-13\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1412-14\">The district court sentenced Joseph under a sentencing model that differs materially from the model <em>Booker </em>creates. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>406 F.3d 1261, 1281 (11th Cir.2005) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (explaining the difference between sentencing pre-<em>Booker </em>and <em>post-Booker.) </em>The difference in the two models is so fundamental, and-so striking, that the district judge in this case could not possibly have imagined what it would have been like to sentence Joseph using the new, <em>Booker </em>model. Among other things, the judge would have had to weigh, take appropriately into account, and make findings regarding the four sentencing objectives set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). What evidence the parties, especially the defendant, may have presented touching on these objectives we can hardly surmise, much less know. Finding harmless error under these circumstances is, in my view, purely arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-7\">I would vacate Joseph\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
