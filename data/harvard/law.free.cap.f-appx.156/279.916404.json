Culpepper was sentenced as a career criminal under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based on his three prior felony drug trafficking convictions, which were not alleged in the indictment and not admitted by him. Culpepper argues that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), renders the Sentencing Guidelines unconstitutional and that his sentence should have been calculated only on those facts established by the indictment and by the guilty plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Culpepper properly raised his <em>Blakely </em>claim in the district court. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). We review this issue <em>de novo; </em>we will reverse unless the government shows that any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1327 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The district court\u2019s application of the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, exposed Culpepper to an enhanced offense level and criminal history category. But this enhancement was based solely on the fact that he had three previous felony drug trafficking convictions. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court stated that the government need not allege in the indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had a prior conviction for a district court to use that conviction to enhance a sentence. \u201cThis conclusion was left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi [v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) ], <em>Blakely, </em>and <em>[United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ].\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir. 2005). Thus, the district court did not violate Culpepper\u2019s constitutional rights by applying the \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement based on his prior convictions. <em>See United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">But the district court did commit a statutory error under <em>Booker. See United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir.2005) (under <em>Booker, </em>two types of sentencing errors exist: \u201cone is constitutional and the other is statutory\u201d). The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. <em>Booker </em>statutory errors are subject to a less demanding harmless error test applicable to non-constitutional <em>errors. See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005). That standard re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>quires us to determine whether the error either did not affect the sentence or only had a slight effect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u201cThe non-constitutional harmless error standard is not easy for the government to meet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But here, the government has met its burden. After overruling Culpepper\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection and adopting the findings in the presentence investigation report, the district court denied Culpepper\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on his medical condition. Also important, the district court stated that it had imposed the sentence because the career offender enhancements <em>\u201cbring the sentence up enough </em>that the ... minimum sentence is appropriate.\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, the district court expressed a belief that Culpepper\u2019s sentence \u2014 at the bottom of the guideline range after applying the career offender enhancement \u2014 was the appropriate sentence. And the district court\u2019s conclusions evidence an unwillingness to sentence Culpepper below the guidelines range. These factors are enough to convince us beyond a reasonable doubt, on this record, that the district court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>error is harmless because the court would not have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme. In other words, the government has demonstrated that the district court\u2019s statutory error of applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion did not affect, or had but a slight effect, on the sentence Culpepper received.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\">. Culpepper also argues, for the first time on appeal, that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), renders unconstitutional 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b), which sets forth the penalties for various drug offenses based on drug quantity, because a judge at sentencing, and not a jury at trial, makes findings about drug quantity, which determines the maximum sentence. This claim is without merit. Culpepper was sentenced below the 20-year statutory maximum sentence permitted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C)\u2019s \"catchall provision\u201d: no <em>Apprendi </em>violation occurred. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250, 1269 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(en banc); see also United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1096-97, 1099-1101 (11th Cir.2002) (rejecting facial constitutional challenge to the penalty provision of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(g), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b), which is similar to the penalty provision in \u00a7 841(b)), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 909, 123 S.Ct. 1484, 155 L.Ed.2d 231 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b307-7\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AFi\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The district court sentenced Culpepper under a sentencing model that differs materially from the model <em>Booker </em>prescribes. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>406 F.3d 1261, 1281 (11th Cir.2005) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (explaining the difference between sentencing <em>pre-Booker </em>and <em>post-Booker.) </em>The difference in the two models is so fundamental, and so striking, that the district judge in this case could not possibly have imagined what it would have been like to sentence Culpepper using the new, <em>Booker </em>model. Having no such idea, the judge could hardly have opined that he would have given Culpepper the same sentences had he been using the <em>Booker </em>model.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">I would vacate Culpepper\u2019s sentences and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
