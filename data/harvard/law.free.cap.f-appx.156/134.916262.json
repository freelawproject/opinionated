Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court dismissed Elias-Jimenez\u2019s petition with prejudice because the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 did not apply due to the fact that the rights she asserted are not retroactively applicable on collateral review. Elias-Jimenez appeals the dismissal based on the savings clause, and also contends that the savings clause does not apply because her petition is based on a new constitutional rule recognized by the Supreme Court within the preceding year.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-21\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u00a7 2241. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">[a]n application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the movant. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense;\u201d and (3) \u201ccircuit court law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. All three criteria will be met only in the narrowest of circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The savings clause does not apply merely because a \u00a7 2255 motion would be barred as second or successive. <em>Id. </em>at 1245. We have held that the constitutional rule announced in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>\u201cfalls squarely under the category of new rules of criminal procedure that do not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 312, 163 L.Ed.2d 269 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Elias-Jimenez is precluded from seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not apply. Elias-Jimenez cannot meet the initial prong of the test in <em>Wofford </em>because her claim is based on Supreme Court decisions which we have held are not retroactively applicable on collateral review. We reject Elias-Jimenez\u2019s contention that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applies because her petition is based on a new constitutional rule recognized by the Supreme Court within the preceding year. The case she relies on has no bearing on \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause and addresses only the timeliness of an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Dodd v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 162 L.Ed.2d 343 (2005). Likewise, the other arguments Elias-Jimenez presents on appeal do not demonstrate that she has the right to proceed with her petition, because it is not covered by \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. After careful review of the record and the briefs of both parties, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
