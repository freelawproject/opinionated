Nugroho remained in the United States beyond that date without authorization. After the Immigration and Naturalization Service served Nugroho with a Notice to Appear, Nugroho sought relief from removal in the form of asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. A hearing was held in September 2003 during which Nugroho testified that he suffered persecution in Indonesia because of his Chinese ethnicity and Christian religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The Immigration Judge denied all of Nugroho\u2019s claims on several bases. First, he found that Nugroho\u2019s testimony was not credible based on information that his testimony was prepared by his immigration consultant. Second, even if his testimony was credited, the Immigration Judge found that Nugroho \u201cfailed to present facts that rose to the level of persecution as defined under the INA.\u201d The court also noted Nugroho\u2019s failure to call two available witnesses who could have supported his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Nugroho appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Nugroho claimed that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that his testimony was fraudulent or untrue and in finding that he had not met his burden of proof for asylum. On November 9, 2004, the BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">On November 23, 2004, Nugroho filed a motion to reopen and reconsider with the Board. Nugroho argued that the Board erred in failing to review his case by a panel of three judges. He again challenged the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision on his credibility and proof of persecution. Nugroho\u2019s motion was denied on January 31, 2005, on the basis that it failed to present any new information and did not address with specificity any error of fact or law. Nugroho filed this petition for review on February 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">The first issue we must consider is what order Nugroho has effectively appealed. As stated in <em>Zhang v. INS, </em>348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir.2003),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-13\">Under the IIRIRA, all final BIA orders must be appealed to this court within thirty days. 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1). This need to timely appeal is a strict jurisdictional requirement. See <em>Sankarapillai v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 1004, 1005-06 (7th Cir.2003) (collecting cases). Moreover, this time to appeal asylum orders continues to run despite [Petitioner\u2019s] motion to reopen and reconsider; these motions are appealed separately. See <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537,131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT9\">Accordingly, since Nugroho did not timely seek review of the BIA\u2019s November 9, 2004 decision, the order before us is the Board\u2019s January 31, 2005 decision denying his motion to reconsider and reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">A denial of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider is reviewed under a \u201chighly deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). Under this standard, even a decision we deem in error can be allowed to stand, \u201cso long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Pritchett v. INS, </em>993 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The BIA\u2019s decision on Nugroho\u2019s motion easily passes this standard. Nugroho\u2019s motion essentially rehashed his challenges to the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision, did not establish an error of fact or law, and did not raise any newly discovered facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Nugroho\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
