We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-19\">We review for abuse of discretion a dismissal without prejudice for failure to serve process. <em>Brown v. Nichols, 8 </em>F.3d 770, 775 (11th Cir.1993). Rule 4(m) provides, \u201cIf service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motion or its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the action without prejudice.... [I]f the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate period.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). Cross filed his complaint on January 25. On June 16, the period of 120-days to serve process elapsed. On June 20, the district court ordered Cross to show cause for his failure to serve process. Cross timely responded on June 27, and in his response, Cross stated his erroneous belief that the court would serve process for him. The district court dismissed his complaint on June 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-21\">A court may grant an extension to serve process for either \u201cgood cause\u201d or another sufficient ground. <em>Horenkamp v. Van Winkle &amp; Co., </em>402 F.3d 1129, 1132 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cGood cause\u201d exists \u201cwhen some outside factor such as reliance on faulty advice, rather than inadvertence or negligence, prevented service.\u201d <em>Prisco v. Frank, </em>929 F.2d 603, 604 (11th Cir.1991). Sufficient grounds other than \u201cgood cause\u201d are within the discretion of the district court as guided by the examples provided in the advisory committee\u2019s notes to Rule 4(m). <em>Horenkamp, </em>402 F.3d at 1132; Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(m), advisory committee\u2019s notes, 1993 amendments. Cross did not provide \u201cgood cause\u201d for his failure to serve process, and Rule 4(c)(1) provides that Cross, not the court, was responsible for service of process. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Cross\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
