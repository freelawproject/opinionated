No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">Defendant pled guilty in August 2000 to a drug trafficking offense in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The district court concluded that the appropriate Guideline range was 78 to 97 months imprisonment. Because the statutory mandatory minimum for the offense conduct was 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, Defendant was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Defendant appealed his sentence, but the appeal was dismissed based on a valid appeal waiver in Defendant\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">Some four years after Defendant\u2019s sentencing, Amendment 668, U.S.S.G.App.C Supp. (Amend.668) took effect. Amendment 668 modified the maximum base offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) for certain offenders who meet the criteria for mitigating role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2. Defendant maintains that Amendment 668 is a clarifying amendment and is applicable retroactively to allow for the reduction of his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">We review denial of a motion to reduce sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). A court may, after consideration of sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), reduce the term of imprisonment based on a later lowering of the sentencing range by the Sentencing Commission \u201cif such reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a), provides that reduction of a sentence because of a Guidelines amendment is consistent with Sentencing Commission policy and is authorized only if the amendment is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). And this Court has ruled that \u2014 consistent with Sentencing Commission policy \u2014 only amendments listed in \u00a7 1.1B.10(c) are subject to retroactive application in the context of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Diaz, </em>19 F.3d 1340, 1341 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Amendment 668 is not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). Defendant argues that Amendment 668 is a clarifying amendment and, as such, may be applied retroactively in the absence of \u00a7 1B1.10(c) listing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Whatever allowance our case law may make for retroactive application of clarifying amendments, such allowance has no application in the context of a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir.2003). Whether Amendment 668 is clarifying or substantive is of no consequence; \u201conly amendments, <em>clarifying or not, </em>listed under subsection (c) of \u00a7 1B1.10, and that have the effect of lowering the sentencing range upon which a sentence was based, may be considered for reduction of a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The district court committed no abuse of discretion. Because Amendment 668 is not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(e), it is not retroactively applicable and provides no support for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\"> Clarifying amendments \"clarify a guideline rather than make substantive changes.\" <em>United States v. Gunby, </em>112 F.3d 1493, 1499 n. 9 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
