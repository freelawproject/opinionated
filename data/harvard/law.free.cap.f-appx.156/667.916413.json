PerezIslas argues that the district court plainly erred in sentencing him under mandatory Sentencing Guidelines under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As Perez-Islas concedes, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 513 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Here, the district court erred by imposing a sentence pursuant to a mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 768; <em>see also Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-21 &amp; n. 9. However, Perez-Islas cannot establish that this error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Because Perez-Islas has not shown that his sentence likely would have been different, his <em>Booker </em>argument fails. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">Perez-Islas argues that the district court plainly erred in relying on the modified presentence report (PSR) in enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) by 16 levels for a prior removal after a conviction of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d based on his prior Texas conviction for aggravated robbery. We review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 356 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-16\">The district court was not permitted to rely on the characterization of the prior offense in the modified PSR in order to enhance Perez-Islas\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.2005). However, the statutory definition of Perez-Islas\u2019s prior conviction falls within U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of the type of crime for which the enhancement is warranted. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 29.03(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.(l)(B)(iii)). Robbery is a specifically enumerated \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for enhancement purposes under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.(l)(B)(iii)). Assuming that the district court did rely on the modified PSR\u2019s characterization of Perez-Islas\u2019s prior offense, such error did not affect Perez-Islas\u2019s sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>stantial rights because the statutory definition of the crime places it squarely within the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>Cf. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 273-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Finally, Perez-Islas argues that the indictment did not charge him with an offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) because it did not charge him with having a prior conviction for an aggravated felony. Perez-Islas concedes that his argument is foreclosed under <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but states that he raises it to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review because of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348. We must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.) (quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert, denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003). Therefore, Perez-Islas\u2019s argument must fail. <em>See id. </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
