Johnson, </em>105 Fed.Appx. 578 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1090, 160 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2005); <em>Pettiette v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1093, 160 L.Ed.2d 1061 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Pettiette argues that we should vacate her convictions and sentences and remand her case to the district court for a new trial because the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, by vacating our affirmance of her convictions and sentences, also vacated the district court\u2019s judgment against her. Following the grant of certiorari, this case was remanded to this court \u201cfor further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker.\u201d Pettiette, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1093. When a ease is remanded to this court from the Supreme Court in limited terms, we must confine our review to matters within those limitations. \u201cExcept that which we are mandated to review, our previous rulings are the law of the case and will not now be reconsidered.\u201d <em>Grad-sky v. United States, </em>376 F.2d 993, 996 (5th Cir.1967). This issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Alternatively, Pettiette argues that she is entitled to resentencing because the district court enhanced her sentence based on judge-found facts in violation of the Sixth Amendment. She acknowledges that she did not raise an objection based upon <em>Booker </em>or <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), prior to her earlier petition for rehearing in this court. We do not consider <em>Booker </em>claims raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing absent extraordinary circumstances. <em>United States v. Hemandez-Gonzalez, </em>405 F.3d 260, 261 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 202, 163 L.Ed.2d 201 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">Pettiette \u201cpoints to no remarks made by the sentencing judge that raise a reasonable probability that the judge would have imposed a different sentence under an advisory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262; <em>see also United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Accordingly, she has not shown that her sentence is plainly erroneous. <em>See Hemandez-Gonzalez, </em>405 F.3d at 262. Because she has not demonstrated plain error, the more demanding standard for extraordinary circumstances cannot be met. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">Johnson argues that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court enhanced his sentence based upon judge-found facts in violation of the Sixth Amendment. He acknowledges that he did not raise an objection based upon <em>Booker </em>or <em>Blakely </em>prior to his earlier petition for rehearing. While the sentencing court arguably committed plain error, Johnson has not shown \u201ca possibility of injustice so grave as to warrant disregard of usual procedural rules.\u201d <em>United States v. Ogle, </em>415 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Accordingly, he has not met the standard for extraordinary circumstances. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-17\">Johnson further argues that <em>Booker </em>allows for the imposition of a lesser sentence than the 25-year consecutive statutory minimum sentence he received for his conviction on the second count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a drug trafficking offense. He maintains that <em>Booker </em>allows for the imposition of a lesser sentence because there is not a strong connection between his real conduct and the severe sentence he received. Citing <em>United States v. Harris, </em>397 F.3d 404, 413-14 (6th Cir.2005), he further asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>that he should not be subject to the 25-year minimum sentence under <em>Booker </em>because the jury did not find all of the elements necessary for the imposition of that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The jury convicted Johnson of two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a drug trafficking offense and the district court sentenced Johnson to the statutory minimum sentences on those counts. Nothing in <em>Booker </em>allows a district court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 746-69. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Harris </em>is not applicable to this case because it addressed the impact of <em>Booker </em>on sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)(B)(i), while Johnson was sentenced to the statutory minimum sentence of 25 years of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i). The only required element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i) that the jury did not find was the fact of Johnson\u2019s prior conviction, and <em>Booker </em>does not prohibit the enhancement of sentences on this basis. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Johnson\u2019s and Pettiette\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED for the reasons stated in our initial opinion. For the reasons set forth in this opinion on remand, their sentences are also AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b666-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
