Lowe contends that the district court erred in sentencing him based on facts not admitted by him or found by a jury. Lowe was sentenced, however, after the Supreme Court issued <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>transcript of the sentencing proceedings reveals that the parties debated the reasonableness of the sentence recommended by the United States Sentencing Guidelines and that the district court was aware of its ability to sentence outside of the Guidelines range. Contrary to Lowe\u2019s contention, <em>Booker </em>requires the district court to determine the Guidelines range in the same manner as before <em>Booker, </em>including \u201cfinding all facts relevant to sentencing.\u201d <em>United, States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Whereas in this case the Guidelines were not applied in a mandatory fashion, such fact finding does not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
