Diaz argues that the district court erred in not granting him more of a reduction to his sentence because of: (1) the disparity in sentencing between him and his codefendants; (2) the fact that the career offender enhancement over-represented his actual prior criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>conduct; and (3) the substantial assistance that he had given the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">First, Diaz\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s refusal to grant downward departures for sentencing disparity and over-representation of his criminal conduct are not properly cognizable on appeal. This court has no jurisdiction to review a sentencing judge\u2019s denial of a downward departure unless that denial was based upon a belief that he had no authority to depart. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1342 (11th Cir.1997). <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[W]e lack jurisdiction to review the decision of the district court not to apply a downward departure.\u201d). Because the record clearly demonstrates that the district court was well aware of its authority to depart, those district court\u2019s rulings cannot be challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Second, Diaz\u2019s challenge to the extent of the departure for substantial assistance fails. This court reviews the extent of a district court\u2019s departure from the Guidelines for reasonableness. <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1245-1246. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), our review is guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. Considering the factors outlined in section 3553(a), the nature and circumstances of Diaz\u2019s offense, and the district court\u2019s detailed discussion of its reasons for the extent of the departure, we find Diaz\u2019s sentence to be reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Diaz\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
