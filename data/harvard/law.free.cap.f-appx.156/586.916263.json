Cherisson filed his notice of appeal on April 18, 2005, over nine months after the district court\u2019s dismissal of the motion, together with a separate motion of the same date to file his notice of appeal out of time. As the district court has not ruled on Cherisson\u2019s April 18, 2005 motion to file an untimely appeal, this court is without jurisdiction at this juncture to review the dismissal of the Rule 60(b) motion. Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of ruling on Cherisson\u2019s motion to file an untimely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-22\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
