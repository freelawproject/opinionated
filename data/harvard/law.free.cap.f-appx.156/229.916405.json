Singleton argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court erroneously imposed a sentence that exceeds the Sentencing Guidelines range and failed to address the statutory sentencing factors. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a). Because the district court did not commit plain error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">On April 16, 2001, Singleton was convicted of transportation of stolen goods, sentenced to five years of probation, and ordered to pay $6300 in restitution. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2314. Two years later, the court modified the conditions of his probation to include substance abuse treatment because Singleton was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, had failed to notify the probation officer of the arrest, and had tested positive for cocaine use. By March 2005, Singleton had been arrested again for driving under the influence of alcohol, pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>to the drunk driving charge, failed to notify the probation officer of the arrest, and failed to make restitution payments for five months. Singleton\u2019s probation officer petitioned the court to order Singleton to appear and show cause why his probation should not be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">At the probation revocation hearing, Singleton admitted the allegations in the petition,'and the court revoked his probation. The Sentencing Guidelines provided a range of three to nine months of imprisonment. The government recommended a one-year sentence because \u201cin-patient treatment, out[-]patient treatment, AA meetings, monitoring on a very regular basis[, and] two episodes of electronic monitoring\u201d had not prevented Singleton <em>from </em>abusing alcohol and endangering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>life of others. The district court imposed a sentence of twelve months of imprisonment because Singleton posed a danger to himself and others, Singleton did not attend treatment voluntarily, and the penalty for a DUI under the Georgia Code was one year of imprisonment. When the court invited objections, neither party objected to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Ordinarily, we review a sentence that exceeds the Guidelines range for revocation of probation for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1299 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002), but we review arguments first raised on appeal for \u201cplain error,\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). A defendant must show \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Singleton argues that the district court erred by entering a sentence that exceeds the Guidelines range and by failing to address the statutory factors when it sentenced him. A court may revoke a defendant\u2019s probation and impose a new sentence \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565; Fed. R.Crim.P. 32.1(d). When imposing a new sentence, a district court must consider (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant, (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed treatment, (4) the kind of sentences available, and (5) the guideline range. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">The district court did not commit plain error. First, the district court did not plainly err because it considered the statutory sentencing factors, i.e., the protection of the public, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C), the need for rehabilitative treatment, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D), the penalty for a DUI under Georgia law, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(3), and the range under the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(4). Second, the district court did not plainly err when it imposed a sentence higher than the Guidelines range because Singleton had repeatedly placed himself and others in danger and failed to benefit from supervised rehabilitation programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">We affirm Singleton\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
