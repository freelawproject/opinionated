Lattimore\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether Lattimore\u2019s sentence violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Lattimore filed a pro se supplemental brief, contending that his right to confront witnesses was violated. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-23\">Lattimore first asserts that the district court\u2019s conclusion that he was a career offender violated <em>Blakely. </em>This claim is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by a jury was not violated by district court\u2019s reliance on his prior convictions for purposes of sentencing as career offender); <em>see also United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 285-86 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that prior convictions could not be severed from their essential components, such as separateness, location, and dates of of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>fenses, and that, therefore, no finding of fact is made with respect to these inherent facts). Moreover, Lattimore did not challenge any factual findings regarding the prior convictions, and he did not dispute the factual basis for the district court\u2019s conclusions that he was a career offender. Accordingly, Lattimore\u2019s assertion that his career offender enhancement violated the Sixth Amendment is without merit. <em>See Collins, </em>412 F.3d at 523 (holding that, where defendant did not dispute any facts supporting the career offender status in district court, there is no constitutional violation in relying on defendant\u2019s prior convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Lattimore also challenges various other sentencing enhancements under <em>Blakely. </em>However, because Lattimore\u2019s career offender status determined his sentencing range, any improper factual findings regarding other enhancements did not impact his sentence. Thus, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Finally, Lattimore contends that the district court violated his right to confront the witnesses against him. However, Lattimore\u2019s guilty plea waived this claim. In fact, Lattimore was specifically informed of this fact during his guilty plea hearing, and he stated that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Lattimore\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, at Durham. Frank W. Bullock, Jr., District Judge. (CR-04-116).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-16\"> Lattimore's plea agreement contained an appellate waiver provision, but because the Government has failed to assert the waiver, we address the substance of Lattimore\u2019s claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
