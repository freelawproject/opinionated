Villalobos argues on appeal that the district court\u2019s consideration of his prior convictions in sentencing him violated his constitutional rights, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed\u00fcd 205 (2005). Villalobos also argues that the district court erred in refusing to depart downwards four levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-30\">A federal grand jury charged Villalobos with one count of unlawful re-entry after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Villalobos pled guilty to this offense, without the benefit of a plea agreement. During his plea colloquy, Villalobos did not admit to having any prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) set Villalobos\u2019s base offense level at eight, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). The PSI increased this offense level by 16 levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), because Villalobos previously was deported after a conviction for a felony crime of violence, that is, state convictions for burglary of a habitation and sexual assault. Based on a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of III, Villalobos\u2019s guideline range was 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Villalobos requested either a four-level downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based on the disparity between illegal re-entry defendants in Florida and similarly situated defendants in southwestern-border states that have early disposition programs, or a departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, because his case fell outside the heartland of cases involving \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) enhancements. Villalobos also raised constitutional challenges to the recommended \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) enhancement, as well as to the court\u2019s calculation of his criminal-history points, pursuant to <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker, </em>arguing that: (1) his prior convictions neither were charged in his indictment, nor stipulated to during his plea colloquy; and (2) the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), did not apply to a constitutional challenge to the application of \u00a7 2L1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The government responded that a discretionary \u00a7 5K3.1 departure was not warranted because the Middle District of Florida did not have an early disposition program, and the government had not received a benefit from an early disposition. The government also argued that, to the extent that Villalobos was raising constitutional challenges to his sentence, these challenges were foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">On April 18, 2005, at sentencing, Villalobos reiterated his objections to the use of his prior convictions in calculating his criminal-history points and in applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) enhancement, arguing that the court, instead, should sentence him based only on his offense level of eight. Villalobos also reiterated his motions for departure under \u00a7 5K3.1 and \u00a7 5K2.0. The government responded by submitting certified copies of the judgments of conviction for the convictions at issue, along with testimony by a fingerprint expert that Villalobos was the person convicted of these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">The district court summarily denied Villalobos\u2019s constitutional challenges and concluded that his resulting guideline range was 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court also denied Villalobos\u2019s motions to depart from this range, explaining both that no criminal defendant is entitled to early disposition and that Villalobos, unlike other defendants to whom the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>granted \u00a7 5K3.1 departures, did not deserve the departure. After the court considered the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, including Villalobos\u2019s discretionary-guideline range, it concluded that a sentence within this guideline range was appropriate. The court sentenced Villalobos to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">As discussed above, Villalobos is arguing on appeal that his sentence is unconstitutional because he was sentenced based on prior convictions that neither were charged in his indictment, nor admitted by him during his plea colloquy. Villalobos concedes that we have determined that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>that is, that the government is not required to charge prior convictions in an indictment, remains the law until the Supreme Court overrules it. Villalobos contends, however, that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been \u201cgravely wounded\u201d by subsequent opinions by a majority of the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and its progeny. Alternatively, Villalobos argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not applicable because, unlike the defendant there, he did not stipulate to the existence of any prior convictions. Citing to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shepard, </em>Villalobos also argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not applicable because he did not stipulate to the characterization of his prior convictions for burglary and sexual assault as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Because Villalobos raised his constitutional arguments in the district court, we review his sentence <em>de novo, </em>but will reverse it only if any error was harmful. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). We have concluded that the Supreme Court, in <em>Booker, </em>rejected the argument that, even when the federal guidelines are applied in an advisory fashion, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits the sentencing court from making factual determinations that go beyond a defendant\u2019s admissions.\u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2005). Here, because Villalobos was sentenced <em>post-Booker, </em>with the court treating the guidelines as advisory, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Regardless, even if Villalobos had not been sentenced under an advisory guideline scheme, he failed to show constitutional error under <em>Booker. </em>\u201cIn <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1013, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004). After the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>we held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law. <em>See Marseille, </em>377 F.3d at 1257-58 n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Moreover, prior to sentencing in the instant case, the Supreme Court, in <em>Booker, </em>reaffirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 756. Again, after <em>Booker, </em>we held that the decision in <em>Almenda</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>rez-Torres </em>was \u201cleft undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker, </em>\u201d and that \u201ca district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Also prior to sentencing, the Supreme Court reaffirmed in <em>Shepard </em>the \u201ccategorical\u201d approach to establishing a predicate prior conviction for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 1259-1263. In a separate section, a plurality of the Court explained that, while a dispute over whether a burglary was a violent felony for purposes of the Act could be \u201cdescribed as a fact about a prior conviction, it [was] too far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record, and too much like the findings subject to <em>Jones </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) ] and <em>Apprendi </em>to say that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">After the Supreme Court decided <em>Shepard, </em>we held, under plain-error review, that a district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) did not violate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005). In a footnote, we noted that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>must be followed because, while <em>Shepard </em>\u201cmay arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019s </em>holding regarding prior convictions, the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1316 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">Accordingly, insofar as the court\u2019s enhancement of Villalobos\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iii), and its calculation of Villalobos\u2019s criminal-history points under \u00a7 4A1.1, involved determinations that he had prior convictions, these determinations did not implicate the <em>Apprendi /Blakely \u00a1Booker </em>line of cases. Moreover, to the extent that Villalobos is contending that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not applicable because the government had to show that his prior conviction, in addition to existing, was a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d we also have rejected this argument. <em>See United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cwe find no merit in Gallegos-Aguero\u2019s argument that the Sixth Amendment requires that a jury, not a judge, must determine whether his prior conviction is within the category of offenses specified in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii)\u201d). Thus, no constitutional error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-18\">Villalobos also argues on appeal that the district court erred in refusing to depart downward four levels, pursuant to \u00a7 5K3.1, based on the sentencing disparity between re-entry defendants sentenced in the Middle District of Florida and similarly situated defendants sentenced in jurisdictions that have early disposition programs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Villalobos contends that this refusal (1) was contrary to the fundamental basis of the federal guidelines that similarly situated defendants should receive similar sentences, and (2) violated his right to equal protection of the law under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-19\">We may not review a district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart from a guideline range. <em>United States v. Pressley, </em>345 F.3d 1205, 1209 (11th Cir.2003). In <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>1241, 1245-46 (11th Cir.2005), we recently-determined that, <em>post-Booker, </em>we still lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart, \u201cso long as the district court did not incorrectly believe that it lacked the authority to apply a departure.\u201d When nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we will assume that the district court understood that it had authority to depart downward. <em>United States v. Chase, </em>174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Here, nothing in the record indicates that the district court believed that it lacked jurisdiction to depart. To the contrary, in denying Villalobos\u2019s \u00a7 5K3.1 motion to depart, the court explicitly stated that it had granted such departures in the past, but concluded that the departure was not warranted in the instant case. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision not to depart. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1245-6; <em>see also Chase, </em>174 F.3d at 1195.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\u2019s consideration of Villalobos\u2019s prior convictions in sentencing him did not violate his constitutional rights, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely, Booker, </em>or <em>Shepard. </em>We further conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward. We, therefore, affirm Villalobos\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">. Although Villalobos\u2019s indictment set forth the 20-year penalty provision under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) for aliens \"whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony,\u201d it did not specifically allege that Villalobos was removed subsequent to being convicted of an aggravated felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-13\">. Section 5K3.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides that, \"[u]pon motion of the [glovernment, the court may depart downward not more than 4 levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the Attorney General of the United States and the United States Attorney for the district in which the court resides.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\">. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that, \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b277-13\">. Villalobos has abandoned any arguments as they relate to his \u00a7 5K2.0 motion. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1275 (11th Cir.) (explaining that an argument not raised in an appellant's opening brief is deemed abandoned), ce<em>rt. </em>denied-U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 643,-L.Ed.2d-.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\">. Even if we had jurisdiction to review Villalobos's equal protection claim, he failed to raise it in the district court. Thus, our review of it only would be for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2005). Because Villalobos has failed to cite to authority from either the Supreme Court or this Court supporting this claim, no plain error occurred. <em>See United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding that, \"where neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has ever resolved an issue, and other circuits are split on it, there can be no plain error in regard to that issue\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
