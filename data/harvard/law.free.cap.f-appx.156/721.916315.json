The BIA affirmed without decision an order of the Immigration Judge finding that Teke failed to offer credible testimony tending to show that she had a well-founded fear of persecution on account of her political activities. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Immigration Judge who heard petitioner\u2019s testimony gave a number of plausible reasons why he found that her testimony was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">After carefully reviewing the record, we find the Immigration Judge\u2019s adverse credibility findings reasonable and supported by the record. We therefore deny Teke\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b747-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
