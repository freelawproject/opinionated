We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-17\">Carr contends that the sentence imposed by the district court was not reasonable. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and impose a sentence. If a court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the district court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). This court should review a sentence imposed pursuant to \u00a7 3553 to determine whether it is reasonable. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-20\">The district court imposed a sentence within the advisory guidelines range and below the statutory maximum<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for the offense and considered the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a). We have been given no reason why the sentence imposed was not reasonable. <em>Cf. United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-65, 767) (noting after <em>Booker, </em>sentencing courts should determine the sentencing range under the guidelines, consider the other factors under \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a reasonable sentence within the statutory maximum). Accordingly, we affirm Carr\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-16\"> The statutory maximum for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000) is ten years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
