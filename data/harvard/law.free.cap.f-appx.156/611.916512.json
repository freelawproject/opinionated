Our review of the record discloses that the Board\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>Consolidation Coal Co. v. Earl, </em>No. 04-0380-BLA (BRB Jan. 18, 2005). We grant Consolidation Coal\u2019s motion to strike the addendum to respondent\u2019s informal reply brief and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
