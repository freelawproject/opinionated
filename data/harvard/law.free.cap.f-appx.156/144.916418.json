Maestrelli took the position that the settlement constituted a material change in his economic circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">On appeal, Maestrelli contends that, under established principles of statutory construction, \u00a7 3664(k) should be construed broadly to allow a settlement between a defendant and a victim to constitute a \u201cmaterial change in the defendant\u2019s economic circumstances\u201d within the meaning of that provision. He argues that the primary goal of restitution is to compensate the victim, and that goal would be furthered by permitting district courts to discharge a defendant\u2019s restitution obligation based upon a settlement between he and the victim. Maestrelli also argues that, because the district court had encouraged him to reach \u201csome understanding\u201d with the victim, the court\u2019s decision that it lacked jurisdiction to ratify the private settlement by modifying the restitution order rendered the court\u2019s previous instructions a nullity. Finally, Maestrelli asserts that the court\u2019s decision violates the principle that statutes should be interpreted to avoid absurd results.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k), a defendant who is ordered by the district court to pay restitution may notify the court \u201cof any material change in the defendant\u2019s economic circumstances that might affect the defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution.\u201d And \u201c[u]pon receipt of the notification, the court may, on its own motion, or the motion of any party, including the victim, adjust the payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the interests of justice require.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>We have held that, while \u201crestitution resembles a judgment for the benefit of a victim, it is penal, rather than compensatory.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>983 F.2d 216, 220 (11th Cir.1993) (quotation omitted). Moreover, \u201c[r]estitution is not a civil matter; it is a criminal penalty meant to have strong deterrent and rehabilitative effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Hairston, </em>888 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir.1989). That argues against permitting private settlements to wipe out restitution orders that are entered as part of the penalty in a criminal case. Besides, the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing clearly indicated to Maestrelli that he was to pay the entire amount of restitution. He knew that when he negotiated the private settlement with the victim\u2019s assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We have held that prior civil settlements should be considered by the district court in formulating its restitution order. <em>See id. </em>(holding that the district court properly considered the civil settlement between the defendant and the victim and credited the defendant\u2019s restitution in the amount he paid toward the civil settlement). However, we have also held that a victim\u2019s receipt of partial compensation does not preclude the court from ordering more restitution. <em>United States v. Twitty, </em>107 F.3d 1482, 1493 n. 12 (11th Cir.1997) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that its settlement with the victim, in which the victim absolved the defendant of any future liability for the claims involved in the civil suit, precluded an order of restitution by the criminal court).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Maestrelli\u2019s position flies in the face of the plain language of \u00a7 3664(k), which provides no basis for the discharge of an entire restitution obligation on grounds of a negotiated partial payment. The clear language of \u00a7 3664(k) allows a defendant to notify the court of any change in his economic circumstances <em>that might affect his ability to pay restitution. </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k) (emphasis added). The last sentence of that provision states that, upon notification of changed economic circumstances that might affect the defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution, the court may \u201cadjust the payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the interests of justice require.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k). Maestrelli requested a discharge of his restitution based on an asserted change in his <em>obligation </em>to pay, not any change in his <em>ability </em>to pay. The statute permits a change based on the latter but not the former. Despite Maestrelli\u2019s numerous policy-based arguments contending that we should interpret \u00a7 3664(k) to allow a private settlement to constitute a \u201cchange in economic circumstances,\u201d we will not disregard the plain language of a statute or modify it to conform to our views of the best policy. <em>See United States v. Trainor, </em>376 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Harry v. Marchant, </em>291 F.3d 767, 772 (11th Cir.2002) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Even assuming that district courts could consider post-imposition settlements as they can consider pre-imposition ones, that would not compel the conclusion Maestrelli is due to be released entirely from the obligations of the restitution order. In pre-imposition circumstances we have held that partial compensation of the victim does not preclude the court from ordering restitution of the remaining amount. <em>See Twitty, </em>107 F.3d at 1493 n. 12. Therefore, even if settlements entered into after restitution has been imposed could be considered by the district court under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k), the court would be permitted only to credit the defendant\u2019s restitution order in the amount that had been paid in the settlement; it would not be authorized to discharge the restitution obligation completely, which is what Maes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>trelli sought. <em>See Hairston, </em>888 F.2d at 1355. The court did credit the $8,000 Maestrelli paid in the settlement against the balance owed on the total amount of restitution he had been ordered to pay; the court did so by noting in its order that he had paid $33,600 up to that date, a total amount which included the $8,000. That was the outer limits of the court\u2019s authority to grant Maestrelli any relief as a result of the $8,000 he had paid in the private settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">For these reasons, the district court did not err in determining that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k) it could not discharge Maestrelli\u2019s restitution obligation on the ground he asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
