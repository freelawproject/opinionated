The maximum sentence under \u00a7 1326(a) is two years, but the maximum sentence increases to twenty years under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) if the defendant was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony. The district court relied on Acosta-Sanchez\u2019s prior conviction to sentence him in excess of the two-year statutory maximum provided in \u00a7 1326(a). Acosta-Sanchez argues that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and its progeny, his sentence is illegal because the government failed to allege the prior conviction in the indictment. Acosta-Sanchez asserts that his prior conviction should have been treated as an element of the offense and included in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">Acosta-Sanchez concedes that this issue has been resolved against him by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed\u00fcd 350 (1998). Nevertheless, he contends that the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Apprendi </em>that it is \u201carguable that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided,\u201d suggests that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>may soon be overruled. He asserts that the Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), further undermine the rationale of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and call its continued validity into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">Because Acosta-Sanchez objected in the district court to the government\u2019s failure to allege his prior conviction in the indictment, we will review his claim <em>de novo. United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1276 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2001). In <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction in the context of the \u00a7 1326(b) increased-penalty provision is merely a sentencing factor that does not have to be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. at 247, 118 S.Ct. at 1233. The Court later held in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[ojther than a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. The Supreme Court also stated that \u201cwe need not revisit <em>[Almendar</em>ez-Torres]| for purposes of our decision today to treat the case as a narrow exception to the general rule.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">After <em>Apprendi </em>was issued, we considered its effect on <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and whether the government must allege a defendant\u2019s prior conviction in the indictment in order for the court to sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>him under the increased maximum penalty provision of \u00a7 1362(b)(2). <em>United States v. Guadamuz-Solis, </em>232 F.3d 1363, 1363 (11th Cir.2000). In upholding a defendant\u2019s sentence under circumstances similar to this case, we held that <em>\u201cAlmendarez-Torres </em>remains the law until the Supreme Court determines that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not controlling precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We recently revisited this issue, taking into consideration the effect of the <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely </em>decisions on <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>and reached the same conclusion, namely, that \u201c[the holding of <em>Almenda</em>rez-Torres] was left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). In another recent case, we addressed the issue in light of <em>Shepard </em>and held that \u201cthe Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>As a result, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We find no reversible error. As Acosta-Sanchez acknowledges in his brief, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>controls this case. Because the government is not required to allege a defendant\u2019s prior conviction in the indictment before he may be sentenced to an enhanced statutory maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), Acosta-Sanchez\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-20\">.
