She asserts that if past persecution is established, a well-founded fear of persecution is presumed unless the government can establish that conditions in the country have changed to such an extent that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of future persecution. Velasco then reiterates the factual testimony from her asylum hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-16\">We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction sua sponte whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). We have jurisdiction over a \u201cfinal order of removal,\u201d so long as the petition for review is filed within 30 days. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). The BIA\u2019s order on February 1, 2005, affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, was a final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). Because Velasco did not file her petition for review until April 28, 2005, more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s first order, her petition was not timely, and we lack jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition, in part, for lack of jurisdiction insofar as Velasco is seeking review of the IJ\u2019s determinations adopted by the BIA in its first order.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">Although Velasco does not state how her petition challenging the BIA\u2019s first order is timely, but to the extent she is arguing that the time for filing her petition was tolled pending the resolution of her motion to reconsider, this argument fails. In <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) the Supreme Court considered \u201cwhether the filing of a timely motion for reconsideration of a decision by the [BIA] tolls the running of the [statutory time] period for seeking judicial review of the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 115 S.Ct. at 1541 (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under INA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u00a7 106(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)). The Court concluded that \u201cdeportation orders are to be reviewed in a timely fashion after issuance, irrespective of the later filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider,\u201d and that \u201cthe filing of the reconsideration motion does not toll the time to petition for review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394-95, 115 S.Ct. at 1543-44. In <em>Dakane v. United States Attorney General, </em>399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir.2005) we recently applied <em>Stone </em>and noted that, because \u201cthe statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling\u201d based on the timely filing of a motion to reopen. <em>Id. </em>at 1272 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Because Velasco failed to file a petition for review within 30 days of the entry of the BIA\u2019s first order, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review any issues resulting from alleged errors in that order. However, because the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider is a separate final order of removal, and because she filed the petition for review within 30 days of that order, we do have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s second order.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">As noted above, Velasco\u2019s entire argument focuses on her underlying asylum claim. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Assa\u2019ad v. United States Attorney General, </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). A motion for reconsideration \u201cshall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (same). Judicial review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>See Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation omitted) (addressing a motion to reopen). The BIA abuses its discretion when its decision \u201c \u2018provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Mickeviciute v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 1159, 1162 (10th Cir.2003) (citation omitted) (addressing a motion to reopen). Motions to reconsider are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (discussing motions to reopen). Furthermore, \u201c[a] motion that merely republishes the reasons that had failed to convince the tribunal in the first place\u201d is inadequate to support a motion for reconsideration because it \u201cgives the tribunal no reason to change its mind.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir.2004). Finally, when a petitioner advances. no arguments in her brief regarding an issue, the petitioner abandons that issue, and we need not consider it. <em>See Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Velasco abandoned any claims regarding the order denying her motion for reconsideration by not raising them in her brief. Even if Velasco has not abandoned these claims, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying arguments that it previously had denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Upon careful review of the record on appeal and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. For the above reasons we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
