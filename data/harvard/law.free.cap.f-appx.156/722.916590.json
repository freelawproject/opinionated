By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Black is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-23\">Black contends that Vittor changed his medication and the dosage without first advising him of the alteration. He has not established that Vittor\u2019s actions evinced deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. <em>See Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985); <em>see also Vamado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Black also contends that the district court erred in not ordering the defendants to answer his interrogatories. He has not established that the district court abused its discretion in denying such discovery after the magistrate judge had issued his report and recommendation. <em>See Moore v. Willis Indep. School Dist., </em>233 F.3d 871, 876 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-24\">Black\u2019s appeal is thus without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith and denying Black IFP status on appeal, we deny the motion for leave to proceed IFP, and we DISMISS Black\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-25\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b748-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
