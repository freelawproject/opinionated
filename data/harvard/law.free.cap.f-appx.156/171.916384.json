Henry argues that her impairments, as demonstrated by her test results, attendance in special education classes, and an Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis, meet the requirements of section 112.05D of the Listings for mental retardation. Further, Henry contends that her impairments functionally equal the Listings, and that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred by not giving proper weight to Henry\u2019s treating psychologist, Dr. Reynolds\u2019s, opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-17\">This court must determine whether the ALJ\u2019s denial of Henry\u2019s application for benefits is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005). This court also reviews whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>See McRoberts v. Bowen, </em>841 F.2d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir.1988). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>sion.\u201d <em>Falge v. Apfel, </em>150 F.3d 1320, 1322 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted). \u201cIn other words, substantial evidence is \u2018more than a mere scintilla.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">A person under the age of 18 is disabled, and thus entitled to SSI benefits, if the person \u201chas a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe functional limitations, and which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(C)(i). Social Security regulations provide a three-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a child is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(a). <em>See Wilson v. Apfel, </em>179 F.3d 1276, 1277 n. 1 (11th Cir.1999). First, the ALJ must determine whether the child is engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Wilson, </em>179 F.3d at 1277 n. 1. If yes, the child is not disabled, but if no, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has a severe impairment. <em>Id. </em>If not, the child is not disabled. <em>Id. </em>If yes, the ALJ then considers whether the child has an impairment that meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the Listings of Impairments. <em>Id. </em>If the child satisfies a Listing, the child is conclusively disabled. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The ALJ found that Henry was not engaged in substantial gainful activity, and that her diagnosis of ADHD and her borderline intellectual functioning constituted \u201csevere\u201d impairments. Accordingly, the ALJ had to determine whether Henry\u2019s impairment meets or is functionally equivalent to section 112.05D of the Listings for mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Under section 112.05 of the Listings, mental retardation is \u201c[characterized by significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning. The required level of severity for this disorder is met when the requirements in A, B, C, D, E, or F are satisfied.\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 112.05. In relevant part, section D of Listing 112.05 requires \u201c[a] valid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70 and a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant limitation of function....\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 112.05D.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">\u201c[T]he ALJ is allowed some leeway to evaluate other evidence [other then I.Q. test score] when determining the validity of an I.Q. score.... \u201d <em>Lowery v. Sullivan, </em>979 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1992). An ALJ should examine whether the results of an I.Q. test are consistent with the other medical evidence and the claimant\u2019s daily activities and behavior. <em>See Popp v. Heckler, </em>779 F.2d 1497, 1499-1500 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Henry did not meet the requirements of section 112.05D of the Listings for mental retardation. Although Henry\u2019s testing scores fall within the range to meet the requirements of section 112.05D, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings that Henry is functioning at a higher level. <em>See Popp, </em>779 F.2d at 1499-1500. Upon evaluation of Henry\u2019s daily school activities, the ALJ found, and the records supports, that Henry takes some regular classes. Additionally, one of her teachers reported that she needs help but concentrates well on her work, even excelling at times, and she obtains low passing grades. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings that Henry is functioning at a higher level than her I.Q. scores demonstrate, and thus she does not meet the requirements of section 112.05D.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Next, Henry argues that her impairments functionally equal the Listings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>for mental retardation. In determining whether a child\u2019s impairment functionally equals a Listing, the regulations require consideration of six \u201cdomains,\u201d which are \u201cbroad areas of functioning intended to capture all of what a child can and cannot do.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(1). These six domains are: (1) acquiring and using information; (2) attending and completing tasks; (3) interacting and relating with others; (4) moving about and manipulating objects; (5) caring for yourself; and (6) health and physical well-being. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(b)(1)(i)-(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">To satisfy the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d standard, a child claimant must have \u201cmarked\u201d limitations in two domains or an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in one domain. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(d). A \u201cmarked\u201d limitation is defined as a limitation that \u201cinterferes seriously with [the] ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities,\u201d and is \u201cmore than moderate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(e)(2)(i). An \u201cextreme\u201d limitation is reserved for the \u201cworst limitations\u201d and is defined as a limitation that \u201cinterferes very seriously with [the] ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities,\u201d but \u201cdoes not necessarily mean a total lack or loss of ability to function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(e)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Henry\u2019s impairments are not functionally equal to the requirements of section 112.05D of the Listings for mental retardation. Evidence that Henry is able to do her homework, complete her class work, and participate in the science fair, supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that she does not have a marked or severe limitation in the first domain, acquiring and using information. Additionally, an examination of Henry found that her thought process was logical. Although Henry may need some assistance with reading, her teacher reported that she has a good attention span, is on task in class, and completes all of her assignments on time, supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding that she does not have a limitation in attending or completing task under the second domain. Henry does not have marked or severe limitations in the third domain of interacting with others; her teacher noted she gets along with her peers and teachers, and Dr. Tocci\u2019s evaluation showed she was cooperative and passive and demonstrated normal eye contact. As for the domain of moving about and manipulating objects, her motor activity was unremarkable. In the domain of caring for herself, Henry\u2019s mother stated that she is able to do so. Finally, in the domain of health and physical well-being, her mother reported, and the record shows, no physical problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Finally, Henry argues that the ALJ did not give proper weight to Henry\u2019s treating psychologist, Dr. Reynolds\u2019s, opinion. \u201cThe testimony of a treating physician must ordinarily be given substantial or considerable weight unless good cause is shown to the contrary. The [ALJ] must specify what weight is given to a treating physician\u2019s opinion and any reason for giving it no weight, and failure to do so is reversible error.\u201d <em>MacGregor v. Bowen, </em>786 F.2d 1050, 1053 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The ALJ did not explicitly state what weight he gave to Dr. Reynolds\u2019s opinion. However, the ALJ properly rejected Dr. Reynolds\u2019s interpretation of the I.Q. scores, finding that Henry was actually functioning at a higher level. <em>See Popp, </em>779 F.2d at 1499-1500. Additionally, contrary to Henry\u2019s position, Dr. Reynolds did not provide a firm diagnose of mental retardation, but rather gave a \u201cprovisional\u201d diagnosis of mild retardation. The ALJ did not dispute Dr. Reynolds\u2019s opinion that Henry has ADHD, and thus, the ALJ implicitly gave great weight to that diagnosis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Accordingly, the ALJ did not err in the weight he gave to Dr. Reynolds\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Because we conclude from the record that the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of Henry\u2019s application for SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
