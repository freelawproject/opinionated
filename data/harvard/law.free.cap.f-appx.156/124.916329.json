On appeal, Simmer-er argues that the district court erred in (1) denying his motion for a continuance, (2) admitting evidence of flight from law enforcement and giving a jury instruction as to flight, and (3) imposing an unreasonable sentence in excess of the Guideline range. He contends that, in imposing an unreasonable sentence, the court failed to (1) provide advance notice that it was contemplating a sentence in excess of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Guideline imprisonment range of 27-33 months, (2) apply the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion in order to avoid an <em>ex post facto </em>violation, and (3) accurately calculate the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\n<em>I. Motion for a Continuance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a request for a continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bowe, </em>221 F.3d 1183, 1189 (11th Cir.2000). The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees that any person brought to trial in any federal court must be afforded the right to assistance of counsel before he or she can be validly convicted and punished by imprisonment. <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2527, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). A trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for continuance may violate this right because it may infringe upon defense counsel\u2019s ability to prepare an adequate defense. <em>See United States v. Verderame, </em>51 F.3d 249, 251 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cThere are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To show a violation of the right to counsel as the result of a denial of a motion for continuance, a defendant must show that the denial resulted in specific substantial prejudice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Simmerer\u2019s motion for a continuance. Although Simmerer listed several grounds as to why he needed a fifth continuance,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his motion failed to articulate how he would suffer specific prejudice if the motion was denied. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">\n<em>II. Intentional Flight</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqO\">A. <em>Admissibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">\u201cThe ultimate decision on admissibility of flight evidence rests with the trial judge, whose exercise of discretion will not be overturned absent a showing of clear abuse.\u201d <em>United States v. Blakey, </em>960 F.2d 996, 1001 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cEvidence of flight is admissible to demonstrate consciousness of guilt and thereby guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1000. However, the probative value of such evidence diminishes \u201cif the defendant has committed several unrelated crimes or if there has been a significant time delay between the commission of the crime or the point at which the accused has become aware that he is the subject of a criminal investigation, to the time of flight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1000-01. Evidence of flight is probative as circumstantial evidence of guilt if the following four inferences can be confidently drawn: \u201c(1) from the defendant\u2019s behavior to flight; (2) from flight to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Myers, </em>550 F.2d 1036, 1049 (5th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that in admitting the evidence of Simmer-er\u2019s flight, the district court did not abuse its discretion. Based on the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>surrounding Simmerer\u2019s arrest, one can make inferences (1) from his behavior to flight; (2) from flight to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged. <em>Myers, </em>550 F.2d at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>B. Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We review the legal correctness of a jury instruction <em>de novo, </em>but defer on questions of phrasing absent an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000). District courts generally have broad discretion in formulating jury instructions as long as the charge as a whole accurately reflects the law and the facts. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we will not reverse a conviction on the basis of a jury charge unless the issues of law were presented inaccurately or the charge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process. <em>Id. </em>We examine \u201cwhether the jury charges, considered as a whole, sufficiently instructed the jury so that the jurors understood the issues and were not misled.\u201d <em>United States v. Starke, </em>62 F.3d 1374, 1380 (11th Cir.1995) (quotation omitted). We have \u201cconsistently approved the inclusion of a jury instruction on flight.\u201d <em>United States v. Borders, </em>693 F.2d 1318, 1327 (11th Cir.1982). An appropriate jury instruction on flight should correctly caution the jury that it is up to it to determine whether the evidence proves flight and what weight should be accorded to such a determination. <em>See id. </em>at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not err in instructing the jury regarding intentional flight because the jury instruction accurately reflected the law. The jury instruction in the instant case mirrors the jury instruction on flight that we upheld in <em>Borders, </em>and it correctly cautioned the jurors that it was up to them to determine whether the evidence proved flight and the weight, if any, to be accorded such a determination. <em>See id. </em>at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\n<em>III. Sentence in Excess of the Applicable Guideline Range</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">\n<em>A. Notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s prehearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure. The notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">The Supreme Court has held that before district courts can depart upward on a ground not identified either in the presentence report or in a prehearing submission by the government, the courts must, under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32, give parties reasonable notice that they are contemplating such a ruling and the grounds on which the departure is based. <em>Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 138-39, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 2187, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991). However, in <em>Bums </em>the Supreme Court was addressing an upward departure under the then mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, not a post-<em>Booker </em>variance under an advisory system. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">Because Simmerer failed to raise this issue in the district court, we review the argument on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328 (11th Cir.2005). To prevail under this standard, the appellant must prove the following three requirements: (1) there must be an error; (2) that error must be plain; and (3) the plain error must affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1328-29. Once the appellant proves these three elements, we may notice the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. Nonetheless,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">an error cannot meet the plain requirement of the plain error rule if it is not clear under current law. From that principle flows the law of this circuit that, at least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\"><em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">There is no precedent from this court or from the Supreme Court establishing that Fed. R. Crim P. 32 applies to a <em>post-Booker </em>upward variance. In the \u201cabsence of any controlling precedent\u201d supporting Simmerer\u2019s proposition that there was error, <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003), the district court\u2019s failure to give notice in compliance with Rule 32 cannot be plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\n<em>B. Ex Post Facto Violation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"An6\">\u201cThe <em>ex post facto </em>clause prohibits the enactment of statutes which make more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Abraham, </em>386 F.3d 1033, 1037 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation and alterations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 417, 163 L.Ed.2d 318 (2005). Recently, we reviewed a defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial provisions, if applied retroactively, would increase the sentence authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict and, therefore, constitute an <em>ex post facto </em>law in violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1306-07 (11th. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005). We determined that, when the appellant committed the offense of conviction, \u201cthe recognized state of the law looked to the U.S.Code as establishing maximum sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307-08. We further explained that, before <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) was decided, every federal court of appeals had held that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) did not apply to guideline calculations made within a defendant\u2019s statutory maximum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1308. Thus, we concluded that the defendant, who was sentenced within his statutory range, had sufficient warning to satisfy <em>ex post facto </em>concerns. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">The record demonstrates that Simmerer did not preserve this issue below, and he cannot prevail now because in this instance there was no plain error. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1328-29. Simmerer\u2019s sentence did not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause because (1) he was sentenced to a term less than the statutory maximum, and (2) he had sufficient warning of the possible maximum sentence under the U.S.Code. <em>See Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">\n<em>C. Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 749-51, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Court decided that the appropriate remedy was to excise two specific statutory provisions which made the Guidelines mandatory, thereby rendering the Guidelines advisory only. 125 S.Ct. at 764. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>explained that, \u201c[w]ithout the \u2018mandatory\u2019 provision, the Act nonetheless requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals\u201d contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>Section 3553(a) provides that district courts imposing a sentence must first consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, and the kinds of sentences and sentencing range established by the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We are required to \u201creview for unreasonableness\u201d a sentence imposed post-<em>Booker. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765 (quotation and alteration omitted); <em>see also United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that <em>\u201cBooker </em>established a \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard for the sentence finally imposed on a defendant\u201d). We have stated that the district court is obligated \u201cto calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178. \u201cAfter it has made this calculation, the district court may impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as the sentence is reasonable____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>we recently conducted a review of an appellant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness and explained that the sentence must be reasonable in the context of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). 422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). In conducting our review, we stated that it does \u201cnot apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process; rather, we review the final sentence for reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1245. In addition to discussing the nature and circumstances of the offense and Winingear\u2019s criminal history, we specifically noted that the sentence imposed was \u201cone-tenth the length of the twenty-year statutory maximum sentence,\u201d and held that the sentence was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s sentence in this case was reasonable. The judge in sentencing Simmerer to 60 months imprisonment explained in great detail why the Guideline range was inadequate. The judge explicitly relied on factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). Moreover, Simmerer\u2019s sentence is only one-sixth the length of the 30-year statutory maximum. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. Furthermore, Simmerer\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable because the court incorrectly calculated his sentencing range when it gave him two additional criminal points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d) is without merit. These two criminal history points are immaterial to the Guideline range calculation because, with or without these points, his criminal history category would still have been III and the Guideline range would still have been 27 to 33 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the district court did not err when it (1) denied Simmerer a fifth continuance of trial, (2) admitted evidence of intentional flight, (3) gave a jury instruction on intentional flight, and (4) imposed a sentence in excess of the applicable Guideline range. The 60-month sentence did not violate <em>ex post facto </em>principles and was not unreasonable. Moreover, Simmerer could not establish that the court\u2019s failure to provide him reasonable notice of the sentence was plain error. Accordingly, we affirm Simmerer\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">.
