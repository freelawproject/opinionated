We affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">1. Section 1252(b)(5) of Title 8 is the exclusive statutory method of determining Vasquez-Cruz\u2019s claim of citizenship; and this claim must be brought as a petition for review of a final order of removal in this Court. Petitioner failed to assert his claim of United States national status in this Court within thirty days of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). In fact, Vasquez-Cruz formally waived his right to appeal the February 20, 2002 immigration judge\u2019s order of removal and was removed to Mexico on February 21, 2002. The thirty-day deadline for filing a petition for review of a final order of removal is jurisdictional. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">2. Because we could have determined Vaquez-Cruz\u2019s claim on direct review, and he failed to pursue that avenue of relief before filing his habeas petition in the district court, dismissal of his habeas petition is appropriate. <em>See Lee v. Gonzales, </em>410 F.3d 778, 785 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
