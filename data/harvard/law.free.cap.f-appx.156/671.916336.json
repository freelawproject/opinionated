Belasco, federal prisoner # 15787-083, appeals from the district court\u2019s denial and dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging the method used by the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) for calculating good-time credits. Belasco sought an accelerated release based on his own method of calculation. During the pendency of this appeal, Belasco completed his imprisonment term, and he has been released from the BOP\u2019s custody. The issues Belasco has raised on appeal have thus been rendered moot by his release. <em>See Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-25\">Accordingly, this appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
