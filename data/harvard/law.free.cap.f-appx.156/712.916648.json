She was sentenced to 37 months incarceration, a sentence which was, in all respects, affirmed by this court. <em>United States v. Lozano-Tamez, </em>90 Fed.Appx. 79 (5th Cir.2004)(per curiam). Subsequently however the Supreme Court vacated Lozano-Tamez\u2019s sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 1419, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Jimenez-Velasco v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1110, 160 L.Ed.2d 989 (2005). Thereafter, this court directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing to determine whether, based on <em>Booker, </em>Lozano-Tamez\u2019s sentence had been rendered constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-20\">Lozano-Tamez concedes that she did not object to her sentence either on the grounds: (1) that the judge enhanced her sentence based on facts admitted by her or proven beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury, see <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), nor (2) premised on the fact that she was sentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines when they were understood to be mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 764-65. Therefore, Lozano-Tamez\u2019s sentence will be reviewed for plain error. Our plain error inquiry involves four related prongs: (1) there must have been an error; (2) that was clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>obvious; and (3) said error affected the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). If the foregoing elements are satisfied, a reviewing court would properly find plain error if: (4) a demonstration is made that the error seriously affected \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">We conclude that there has been no <em>Booker </em>error in this case. Lozano-Tamez\u2019s 37 month sentence was at the bottom of the Sentencing Guidelines \u2014 given that her Criminal History Category was I and Total Offense Level was 21 \u2014 thus no showing can be made that she was subjected to a sentence <em>enhancement </em>based on conduct not admitted by her or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, given that the onus is placed on her to establish that \u201cthe sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521, we find nothing in the record remotely suggests that she has met this burden. Moreover, we are also unpersuaded by Lozano-Tamez argument that the sentencing error in this case was \u201cstructural,\u201d as this argument has already been foreclosed by this court. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Lozano-Tamez\u2019s sentence must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b739-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
