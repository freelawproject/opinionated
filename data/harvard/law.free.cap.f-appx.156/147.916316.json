Acklin appeals his 18-month sentence, pursuant to his guilty plea, for conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 1344.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Acklin specifically argues (1) that the district court erred in calculating loss under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, (2) that the district court improperly shifted to him the burden of disproving conduct supporting the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, (3) that the district court violated his due process and confrontation rights by relying on evidence presented at a prior sentencing hearing at which he was not present, and (4) that he should be resentenced in the light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Our review of the district court docket shows that Acklin now has served his full term of imprisonment. So, these issues \u2014 challenges to the calculation and imposition of his sentence \u2014 have become moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 118 S.Ct. 978, 983, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (stating that, once a defendant\u2019s sentence has expired, \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole \u2014 some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction-must exist if the suit is to be maintained\u201d); <em>De La Teja v. United States, </em>321 F.3d 1357, 1362-63 (11th Cir.2003) (refusing, in habeas case, to address issue that had become moot by event occurring after filing of suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">We are aware that Acklin also was sentenced to a three-year term of supervised release. But Acklin violated some of the conditions of his supervised release with conduct unrelated to the underlying offense of conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 29 August 2005, the district court revoked Aeklin\u2019s supervised release, committed him to Bureau of Prisons custody for seven months, and specified that no supervised release was to remain at the end of Addin\u2019s custody with the BOP. Thus, nothing remains of Acklin\u2019s initial term of supervised release or of his underlying sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">We are mindful that Acklin is to make $153,182.37 in restitution to the victims of the check fraud scheme. And the record does not indicate that Acklin has discharged his restitution obligations. But Acklin in his appellate brief does not direct substantive argument to the restitution order: he, in passing, only mentions this order twice in passing as a fact of the case. Thus, he has abandoned a challenge to the restitution order. <em>See United States v. Mejia, </em>82 F.3d 1032, 1036 n. 4 (11th Cir.1996) (deeming abandoned an argument not raised in appellant\u2019s briefs).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>In sum, we no longer can give meaningful relief to Addin on the issues he has raised on appeal: these issues now are moot. And he has abandoned a challenge to the restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\">. Acklin was recruited by codefendant Dennis Wilson to cash checks in a \"hub and spoke\u201d counterfeit check ring. Wilson, one of the \"hubs\u201d, would supply counterfeit checks to a group of check cashers, or \"spokes.\u201d Acklin, a \"spoke\u201d, would use false identification to cash fake checks; and he received a portion of the proceeds as payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-14\">. In April 2005, Acklin began violating the conditions of his supervised release (1) by testing positive for the use of illegal drugs and (2) by failing to report for urine screens and to attend drug treatment sessions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-15\">. In any event, the restitution amount differs from the district court\u2019s loss calculation of $158,910.73.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
