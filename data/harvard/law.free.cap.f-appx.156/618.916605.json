We affirm all rulings of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">The City contests the district court\u2019s finding that the officers were entitled to back pay, insisting that such finding was not supported by the record. That finding, however, was supported by the officers\u2019 trial testimony. Given the deference we afford the district court\u2019s credibility determinations and the fact that the testimony supports the ruling, the district court\u2019s finding on the matter is plausible and not clearly erroneous. <em>See Barfield v. Madison County, Mississippi </em>212 F.3d 269, 271 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Mireles v. Frio Foods, Inc., </em>899 F.2d 1407, 1413 (5th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">The officers assert that the district court erroneously admitted the hearsay testimony of Sgt. Mark Mulla. The officers argue that they were prejudiced by this evidentiary ruling, because the court relied heavily on Mulla\u2019s testimony in reducing by one-half their compensable time. The district court, however, based the amount of compensation it awarded the officers on the December 2000 settlement reached between the New Orleans Police Department and the City\u2019s Civil Service Commission, which authorized one-half hour per work day of compensable time for canine officers. Consequently, even if we assume without granting that the district court erroneously admitted Mulla\u2019s testimony, that error was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61; <em>Cozzo v. Tangipahoa Parish Council</em>\u2014President <em>Gov\u2019t, </em>279 F.3d 273, 292 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">Finally, Lee argues that the district court erred in rejecting his retaliation claim on the basis that he did not suffer an adverse employment action. Lee did not establish, however, that his transfer to the Tactical Unit resulted in the loss of compensation, duties, or benefits. Standing alone, his subjective belief that he was transferred to a less prestigious position is insufficient to prove an adverse employment action. <em>See Pegram v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 272, 283 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b645-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
