On appeal, Vargas-Gutierrez challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a minor-role reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines is subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal, while its factual findings must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1192 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201c[T]he ultimate determination of role in the offense is also a fundamentally factual determination entitled to due deference and not a legal conclusion subject to de novo review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938. The defendant has the burden of establishing his minor role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The Sentencing Guidelines permit a two-point decrease of a defendant\u2019s offense level if the court finds the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the crime. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(b). To determine whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: [1], the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, [2], [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. In looking to relevant conduct, \u201cthe district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. \u201cIn making the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the sentencing judge has no duty to make any specific subsidiary factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. \u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d Id. at 945 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Vargas-Gutierrez argues that he is entitled to a minor-role reduction because his only role in the conspiracy consisted of introducing one of his co-defendants to a drug supplier. As the district court acknowledged, however, Vargas-Gutierrez and one of his co-defendants who cooperated prior to Vargas-Gutierrez\u2019s cooperation provided conflicting stories concerning co-defendant Gerardo Torres-Lugo\u2019s participation in the conspiracy. The earlier cooperating co-defendant immediately upon arrest identified Torres-Lugo as the supplier, while Vargas-Gutierrez waited over four months to reveal the existence of a different person.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Vargas-Gutierrez argues the district court accorded too much weight to the timing of his cooperation with the government\u2019s investigation. We disagree. From our review of the sentencing transcript, it is clear that Vargas-Gutierrez simply did not meet his burden to establish <em>by a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>preponderance of the evidence </em>his minor role in the offense. The district court highlighted the conflicting versions of events and concluded that \u201csomething doesn\u2019t fit well\u201d with Vargas-Gutierrez\u2019s version. On this record, we cannot say the district court clearly erred by denying a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\">. In its brief, the government argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction based on the appeal-waiver provision in Vargas-Gutierrez\u2019s plea agreement. We previously rejected this exact argument twice, when we denied the government's motion to dismiss and when we denied its motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
