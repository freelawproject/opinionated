Munoz argues that the district court plainly erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on a Texas conviction for aggravated assault. Munoz contends that the enhancement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>improper because Texas law provides that a conviction for aggravated assault may be based on conduct that is merely reckless. As the United States Sentencing Commission has identified aggravated assault as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, by imposing the sentence enhancement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2., comment. (n.1(b)(iii)); <em>see United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 253, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005); <em>see also United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 317 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Munoz\u2019s contention that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), should be interpreted to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is foreclosed by existing circuit precedent; however, Munoz raises the issue to preserve it for Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). We must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
