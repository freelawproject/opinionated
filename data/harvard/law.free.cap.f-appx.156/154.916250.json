Smith, a federal prisoner, appeals his 151-month sentence for possession with intent to distribute a quantity of crack cocaine and cocaine hydrochloride, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Smith was sentenced as a career offender, based in part on a state felony conviction for possession of a counterfeit substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">On appeal, Smith argues that this conviction was not a controlled substance offense, and thus, the government did not meet its burden of proving that he had two previous felony convictions for controlled substance offenses as described in U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2, the career offender portions of the sentencing guidelines. According to Smith, the term \u201ccounterfeit substance,\u201d used in \u00a7 4B1.2, must be defined through 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(7). Smith contends that the definition in \u00a7 802(7) does not include non-drug imitation substances such as the one he was convicted of possessing. Smith\u2019s second argument in favor of interpreting \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 &amp; 4B1.2 through \u00a7 802(7) is that the sentencing commission lacked the authority to include crimes that were not defined in the same manner as the United States Code within the career offender provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Bracciale, </em>374 F.3d 998, 1003 n. 5 (11th Cir.2004). The burden of proof for establishing that a sentence enhancement is warranted lies with the government. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1440 (11th Cir.1998). A defendant is a career offender if(1) he was at least 18 years old when convicted of the instant offense, (2) the instant offense is \u201ca felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offence,\u201d and (3) he has \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). We have held that, in determining whether a state felony is a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1, we must \u201clook at the elements of the convicted offense, not the conduct underlying the conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>89 F.3d 1501, 1505 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">According to \u00a7 4B1.2, a \u201c \u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits [...] the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). The Georgia Controlled Substances Act provides that it is unlawful for any person to possess, sell, manufacture, or possess with intent to sell a counterfeit substance. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16 \u2014 13 \u2014 30(i). The Act further provides that a person who sells a counterfeit substance is guilty of a felony punishable by not less than one year\u2019s imprisonment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">Smith was convicted of possessing a counterfeit substance with intent to sell. This was an offense under a state law that prohibited the possession of a counterfeit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>substance, and was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. As such, the elements of the offense match the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 &amp; 4B1.2. This offense is sufficient to count towards Smith\u2019s career offender status. <em>See Frazier, </em>89 F.3d at 1505.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">This interpretation is not modified by the statutory definitions contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(7). Section 4B1.1, background, of the sentencing guidelines states that \u00a7 4B1.1 implements the career offender directive contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, background. However, it also states that, \u201cin accord with its general guideline promulgation authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a)-(f), and its amendment authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o) and (p), the Commission has modified this definition in several respects.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, background. Nothing in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994 prevents the sentencing commission from using its authority in this manner. Moreover, as the Commission has expressly stated that the definitions have been modified, it would be inappropriate to read them as narrowly as Smith contends they should be read.
