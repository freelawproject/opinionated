Estelan argues that the district court (1) applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that Estelan\u2019s post-arrest statements were voluntary; (2) abused its discretion in denying Estelan\u2019s objection to the government\u2019s introduction of expert testimony from a Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) agent regarding drug-distribution amounts, pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 702; and (3) plainly erred in counting prior state convictions, which the court had found to be constitutionally invalid for purposes of enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, in calculating Estelan\u2019s criminal-history points. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">Estelan filed three motions to suppress post-arrest statements. In his first suppression motion, he argued that, on December 22, 2003, after he was arrested, and after he invoked his right to remain silent under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444-45, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), law enforcement officers (1) continued to question him, and (2) secretly recorded conversations he had with family members. In Estelan\u2019s second suppression motion, he contended that his post-arrest statement on December 22, 2003, in which he admitted to possessing drugs recovered during the execution of a search warrant, also should be suppressed because it was the product of unlawful threats and intimidation by law enforcement officers, that is, the product of an officer\u2019s threat to arrest his mother and sister if he did not admit ownership of the drugs. Finally, in Estelan\u2019s third suppression motion, he again contended that the post-arrest statements he made to officers on December 22, 2003,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should be sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>pressed because they were (1) obtained in violation of his right to remain silent, and (2) the result of unlawful threats and intimidation by officers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The government responded that, on November 18, 2003, officers did not threaten to arrest members of Estelan\u2019s family if Estelan refused to claim ownership of the drugs and firearms that the officers had recovered. The government also responded that an officer\u2019s statement on December 22, 2003, that is, that he might arrest Estelan\u2019s mother and sister for possessing drugs, was not unduly coercive because the officer had probable cause to make these arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate issued a report, recommending that all of Estelan\u2019s suppression motions be denied. Although the record on appeal does not contain a transcript of this evidentiary hearing, Estelan did not challenge in his objections to the magistrate\u2019s report the magistrate\u2019s factual findings, at least as they relate to Estelan\u2019s arguments on appeal. Moreover, Estelan has failed to argue on appeal that these factual findings were erroneous, plainly or otherwise. <em>See United, States v. Warren, </em>687 F.2d 347, 348 (11th Cir.1982) (explaining that the absence of objections to the magistrate\u2019s report, prepared pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), limits appellate review of factual findings to plain error or manifest injustice). We, therefore, conclude that Estelan has abandoned any challenges to the following factual findings by the magistrate in her report.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Officer Brian Hermanson, an officer with the Lake Worth Police Department since October 1991, and a member of a special investigation unit that focuses on narcotics and gang activity, testified that, on November 18, 2003, at approximately 12:26 p.m, he helped execute a search warrant at a residence in Lake Worth, Florida. When the officers arrived at this residence, they knocked and announced their presence. On hearing a door slam, the officers entered the residence. Another officer found Estelan in the restroom, bent over a toilet containing a large piece of cocaine base. Estelan\u2019s mother and another person also were present in the residence. After Estelan was arrested and advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he told Officer Hermanson that the firearms and drugs found in a drawer in the bedroom of the residence belonged to him. The officers neither used force against Estelan, nor threatened to arrest his family members. Moreover, Estelan was lucid, had normal speech patterns, and did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">Officer Sanjay Raja, an officer with the West Palm Beach Police Department since February 2004, testified that, on December 22, 2003, as part of his previous employment with the Lake Worth Police Department, he executed a search warrant of this same residence. On entering the resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>dence, he observed Estelan\u2019s mother, Violette Estelan, in the living room, in close proximity to a stack of boxes, on top of which officers ultimately recovered in plain view a dime-size piece of cocaine base, weighing approximately. 1 grams. The officers executing the search warrant also recovered cocaine base in a compact-disc case and $725 in a small refrigerator in the north bedroom. Estelan\u2019s sister, Wilda Estelan, arrived at the residence during this search, at which time she identified the north bedroom as her bedroom and agreed to call Estelan.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Officer Raja further stated that, when Estelan responded by coming to the residence, Estelan was detained, was advised of his rights, and waived his right to remain silent. Officer Raja then informed Estelan what contraband the officers had recovered from the residence, along with explaining that they did not want to arrest anyone who was not involved with the drugs. When Officer Raja asked Estelan if he was involved with the drugs, Estelan gave conflicting answers over his ownership of the drugs. The officers then took Estelan outside the residence and questioned him while he was sitting next to his mother and sister. Although Estelan first stated that the drugs belonged to him, and not his mother and sister, he recanted this statement within minutes. During this questioning, Estelan again appeared lucid, had normal speech, was clear eyed, did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and did not request an attorney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Estelan, who was 21 years\u2019 old and had completed the 11th grade at the time of the evidentiary hearing, also testified, stating, among other things, that Officer Hermanson informed him, after his November 18, 2003, arrest, that the officers would have Estelan\u2019s mother and grandmother deported and/or arrested for possession of the drugs and guns if Estelan did not admit to owning this contraband. Although both his mother and grandmother were legal residents, Estelan still feared for their freedom. Estelan also testified that, on December 22, 2003, he admitted to owning drugs recovered from the residence only because he was scared that his mother and sister would be arrested. Additionally, the magistrate noted that, in a videotape of Estelan\u2019s November interrogation, Estelan appeared relaxed and \u201claid back,\u201d and he did not ask about his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The magistrate determined, among other things, that, the post-arrest statement made on November 18, 20003, was not coerced because Officer Hermanson\u2019s testimony, that he did not threaten to arrest Estelan\u2019s family members, was more credible than Estelan\u2019s contrary testimony. The magistrate also concluded that Estelan\u2019s waiver of his right to remain silent on December 22, 2003, was voluntary, despite that Estelan testified that the officers threatened, otherwise, to arrest his mother and sister, because the officers had found cocaine base in plain view of Estelan\u2019s mother and drugs in the bedroom occupied by Estelan\u2019s sister. The magistrate concluded that, based on these facts, the officers had probable cause to arrest these family members for possession of drugs, and their threat to do so, therefore, was not coercive. The magistrate also explained that her review of the videotapes of the November interrogation of Estelan, during which Estelan was relaxed and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>not ask about his family, showed that Estelan voluntarily waived his right to remain silent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court summarily adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and denied all of Estelan\u2019s suppression motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">At trial, the government offered the following additional evidence. Officer Neil Honkala, an officer with the Lake Worth Police Department, testified that, on November 18, 2008,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> when he entered the residence in question to execute a search warrant, he heard a toilet flushing and determined that the restroom door was locked. When Officer Honkala attempted to kick the restroom door open, Estelan, who was inside the restroom, forcefully slammed the door shut. Officer Honkala eventually forced the door open, at which time he observed the toilet flushing and several large pieces of cocaine base inside it.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Officer Hermanson testified, and the parties stipulated, that, after the officers arrested Estelan and searched the residence on November 18, 2003, they recovered miscellaneous documents in Estelan\u2019s name on the dining room table and in the top drawer of a dresser in the residence\u2019s north bedroom. The officers also found cocaine base and powder in the top drawer of the same dresser, as well as a loaded semiautomatic pistol on the top shelf of a closet inside the north bedroom, and a loaded assault rifle wrapped in a football jersey in another bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Officer Raja also testified at trial, explaining that, on December 22, 2005, in addition to the dime-size amount of cocaine base that the officers recovered from the living room, they discovered in one of the bedrooms a small unplugged refrigerator containing $725 in cash and an open CD case containing more cocaine base. When Estelan\u2019s 14-year-old sister entered the residence during this search, the officers instructed her to call Estelan, gave her and Estelan\u2019s mother <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and handcuffed them outside the apartment. When Estelan arrived at the apartment, he also was handcuffed and given <em>Miranda </em>warning, after which Estelan was informed that, based on the locations of the drugs found in the residence, the officers had probable cause to arrest his mother and sister. After giving conflicting statements inside the residence, Estelan was taken outside the residence, where he stated, in front of his mother and sister, that he owned the drugs and that the officers should release these family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">After being re-sworn, Officer Herman-son additionally testified that, on January 3, 2004, on two separate occasions, a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) of the Lake Worth Police Department, while being videotaped, made undercover buys of cocaine base from Estelan. Estelan was not arrested on this date because of the ongo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ing nature of the investigation and the police department\u2019s need to keep the Cl\u2019s identity confidential. Officer Raja also testified again, after being re-sworn, stating that, on January 22, 2004, pursuant to a federal arrest warrant for Estelan, Officer Raja and other officers attempted to arrest Estelan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Estelan ran away from them, Officer Raja observed Estelan throw a small fluorescent object over a fence. After apprehending Estelan and searching the area where Estelan threw this object, Officer Raja discovered a fluorescent green Excedrin bottle containing a substance that the government later confirmed was cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Furthermore, during trial, the government sought to qualify Special Agent Richard Bonner, a special agent with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), as \u201can expert in street level narcotics and trafficking and specifically in crack cocaine and cocaine powder.\u201d Special Agent Bonner testified that, as an agent with the DEA for approximately four years and four months, he had (1) received specialized training in the distribution and trafficking of illegal drugs, particularly with Schedule I and II controlled substances; (2) participated in hundreds of investigations involving the distribution of cocaine base; and (3) interviewed in excess of 100 persons involved in the illegal distribution of cocaine and cocaine base. Prior to serving in his current position, Special Agent Bonner also had been employed for approximately eight years as a police officer, working extensively on narcotic cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">On questioning by Estelan, Special Agent Bonner conceded that he never had published articles on street-level dealing of cocaine base, nor been subject to peer review or evaluation. Special Agent Bonner also agreed that his methodology for his opinions was based solely on his training, observations, and experiences. Estelan then objected to Special Agent Bonner testifying as an expert witness, arguing that the government had failed to meet Rule 702\u2019s requirements for such testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court overruled this objection, summarily explaining that, after examining caselaw both from this Court and the Supreme Court, it had concluded that this expert testimony was admissible under Rule 702.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Special Agent Bonner then testified on how cocaine base typically is sold and why the amounts of cocaine base that were recovered from the toilet, drawer, and refrigerator in Estelan\u2019s residence, and the cocaine base contained in the Excedrin pill bottle that Estelan threw over the fence, were indicative of distribution, instead of personal use. On May 5, 2004, the jury convicted Estelan of all counts in his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Prior to sentencing, Estelan filed a denial of the three prior state convictions on which the government was relying in attempting to statutorily enhance his sentence, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>taehing copies of the transcripts of his change-of-plea hearings, Estelan argued that these convictions were constitutionally invalid because (1) they were the result of guilty pleas that were not knowing and voluntary, and (2) he did not receive effective assistance of trial counsel. The government opposed Estelan\u2019s denial, arguing that the plea transcripts and the plea-waiver forms showed that Estelan received effective assistance of counsel, and that his pleas followed the requirements outlined in <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Also prior to sentencing, a probation officer prepared a PSI, recommending that Estelan\u2019s offense level be set at 28, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6), and that it be increased two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), because Estelan possessed a dangerous weapon. The PSI also included that Estelan had nine criminal-history points, which included seven points, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(c), based on Estelan\u2019s prior convictions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and two additional points, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(e), because he committed the instant offense less than two years from his date of release from custody for a prior offense. With a total offense level of 30 and a criminal history category of IV, Estelan\u2019s guideline range was 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">On January 19, 2005, at sentencing, Estelan renewed his objection to the court\u2019s reliance on three prior convictions for purposes of statutorily enhancing his sentence under \u00a7 851. After hearing arguments from counsel and extensive testimony from Estelan, the court determined that these prior convictions could not be used to support a statutory sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 851, because the \u201cplea colloquies [did not] measure[] up to the requirements of due process,\u201d and the government had not shown that Estelan, during the state allocutions, had fully understood \u201cwhat he was doing [and] the nature of his acts.\u201d The court, however, noted that it was not finding that Estelan\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective. The court also restated, without objection, the PSI\u2019s calculations, including that Estelan had a criminal history category of IV, and a resulting guidelines range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">The court then considered the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including Estelan\u2019s discretionary guideline range. In doing so, the court stated that it had \u201clooked carefully at [Estelan\u2019s] prior convictions, what they consisted of, the way they were treated and so on.\u201d The court ultimately sentenced Estelan to a total sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, 4 years\u2019 supervised release, and a $625 special assessment fee. When the court asked Estelan if he had any new objections to the court\u2019s pronouncement of his sentence, Estelan answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Issue 1: <em>Estelan\u2019s Post-Arrest Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">Estelan argues that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress post-arrest statements he made to law enforcement officers on November 18 and December 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>2003, because the court did not look at the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether these statements were voluntary. Estelan contends that the court, instead, focused entirely on its conclusion that the officers had probable cause on December 22, 2003, to arrest Estelan\u2019s mother and sister. Without identifying what circumstances the court ignored, Estelan also asserts that, if the court had examined the totality of the circumstances, it would have concluded that his post-arrest statements were not the product of his free and rational choice. Finally, Estelan claims that, because the post-arrest statements were the \u201conly real evidence that the government had that the drugs and firearms belonged to [him],\u201d and because the government failed to show that these statements did not contribute to his convictions, the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u201c[We] review[ ] a district court\u2019s factual findings supporting the denial of a motion to suppress for clear error, and in the light most favorable to the [g]overnment. The application of the law to the facts is reviewed <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1295 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the government may not use an involuntary confession against a defendant in a criminal trial. <em>Id. </em>We focus our voluntariness inquiry \u201con whether the defendant was coerced by the government into making the statement: The relinquishment of the right [to remain silent] must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice[,] rather than intimidation, coercion or deception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal marks and quotations omitted). Moreover, \u201c[t]he district court must consider the totality of the circumstances in assessing whether police conduct was \u2018causally related\u2019 to the confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Under certain circumstances, police deception invalidates an accused\u2019s waiver of his right to remain silent. <em>Thompson v. Haley, </em>255 F.3d 1292, 1296 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Rogers v. Richmond, </em>365 U.S. 534, 81 S.Ct. 735, 5 L.Ed.2d 760 (1961) (in a habeas case, a confession was involuntary when the police pretended that, if the defendant did not confess, the defendant\u2019s ailing wife would be arrested)). However, in <em>Thompson, </em>we determined that a law enforcement officer\u2019s statement to a habeas petitioner that his codefendant girlfriend might face the electric chair if the petitioner did not confess to committing a murder did not render the petitioner\u2019s post-arrest statement involuntary because the petitioner\u2019s girlfriend had voluntarily implicated herself in the murder prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest. <em>Thompson, </em>255 F.3d at 1296. We explained that, under these circumstances, the officer had probable cause to arrest the petitioner\u2019s girlfriend and the officer\u2019s statement of this fact to the petitioner, therefore, did not constitute coercion. <em>Id. </em>at 1297.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Similarly, in <em>Martin v. Kemp, </em>760 F.2d 1244 (11th Cir.1985), we examined a habeas petitioner\u2019s argument that his guilty plea was involuntary because it was prompted by police threats to bring charges against the petitioner\u2019s young, pregnant wife. <em>Id. </em>at 1247-48. Although we ultimately determined that the record was unclear on whether the police had probable cause to file charges against the petitioner\u2019s wife at the time this threat was made and that remand, thus, was warranted, we clarified that whether a threat to prosecute a third party is coercive depends upon whether probable cause exists to believe that the third party has committed a crime at the time that the threat is made. <em>Id. </em>at 1248-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Here, to the extent Estelan is arguing that the court should have conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ed that his post-arrest statement on November 18, 2003, was coerced because he testified that he made this statement only because officers threatened, otherwise, to arrest members of his family, the court, through adopting the magistrate\u2019s report, determined that testimony denying such threats were made was more credible. Because \u201c[t]he credibility of a witness is in the province of the factfinder,\u201d we \u201cwill not ordinarily review the factfinder\u2019s determination of credibility.\u201d <em>See United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). Moreover, Estelan has not challenged Officer Hermanson\u2019s credibility on appeal, and a review of the record does not show that the court clearly erred in making this finding. Indeed, the court noted that, in the videotape of Estelan\u2019s November interrogation, Estelan appeared relaxed and \u201claid back,\u201d and he did not ask about his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In examining Estelan\u2019s December 22, 2003, post-arrest statement, Officer Raja admitted during the evidentiary hearing that he informed Estelan on this date what contraband the officers had recovered from the residence, along with explaining that they did not want to arrest anyone who was not involved with the drugs. Officer Raja, however, also testified that, when he entered the residence in question, he observed Estelan\u2019s mother in the living room, sitting in close proximity to cocaine base that was in plain view. Moreover, Officer Raja recovered cocaine base and $725 in cash from a small refrigerator in the room that Estelan\u2019s sister identified as her bedroom. Thus, similar to the facts in <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Martin, </em>probable cause existed to arrest Estelan\u2019s mother and sister for possession of drugs, and Officer Raja\u2019s statement to that effect did not result in Estelan\u2019s December post-arrest statement being involuntary. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>355 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir.) (explaining that \u201cconstructive\u201d possession is sufficient to prove the possession prong under \u00a7 841(a), and that constructive possession in drug cases is established \u201cby showing ownership or dominion and control over the drugs or over the premises on which the drugs are concealed\u201d (quotation omitted)), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 999, 125 S.Ct. 626, 160 L.Ed.2d 456 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Furthermore, to the extent Estelan is arguing that the court erred in denying his suppression motions because the court failed to examine the totality of the circumstances, and that these combined circumstances should have compelled the court to rule otherwise, as discussed above, a court must consider the totality of the circumstances in assessing whether a confession was voluntary. <em>See Thompson, </em>422 F.3d at 1295. Estelan, however, neither raised this argument in the district court, nor has he identified on appeal other factors that rendered his statements involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Regardless, the record reflects that the court, although focusing primarily on Estelan\u2019s arguments relating to threats to arrest his family members, examined the other circumstances surrounding both of the post-arrest statements. Indeed, in summarizing the testimony given during the evidentiary hearing, the court specifically noted that (1) the November search was conducted at 12:26 p.m. in the afternoon; (2) the officers on this date, in addition to not threatening to arrest his family members, did not use force against him; and (3) Estelan was lucid, had normal speech patterns, and did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The court also included that, during the December incident, Estelan appeared lucid, had normal speech, was clear eyed, did not appear .to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and did not request an attorney. In addition, the court noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Estelan was 21 years\u2019 old and had completed the 11th grade at the time of the evidentiary hearing. Thus, we conclude that the district court considered the totality of the circumstances, and it did not err in admitting at trial Estelan\u2019s post-arrest statements.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Issue 2: <em>Expert Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3k\">Estelan also argues that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion to exclude the expert testimony of DEA Agent Bonner regarding drug-distribution amounts when the government faded to show that the testimony met the requirements for admission of scientific expert testimony under Rule 702 and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Estelan explains that, in overruling his objection to this expert testimony on an issue that was critical to three of his convictions, the court ignored the facts that the expert could not identify the facts and data that were the basis for his opinion, could not explain what method he used in reaching his opinion, and conceded that whatever method he used had not been subjected to peer review and publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We will reverse when a district court\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>ruling \u201camount[s] to an abuse of discretion that affected the outcome of a trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>415 F.3d 1257, 1266 (11th Cir.2005). An abuse of discretion can occur where the district court applies the wrong law, follows the wrong procedure, bases its decision on clearly erroneous facts, or commits a clear error in judgment. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201cthe task of evaluating the reliability of expert testimony is uniquely entrusted to the district court under <em>Daubert, </em>\u201d and we \u201cgive[s] the district court considerable leeway in the execution of its duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and marks omitted). Moreover, this rule is applicable whether the court admits or excludes expert testimony, and even if the <em>Daubert </em>issue is outcome determinative. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Rule 702 includes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asx\">Fed.R.Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">In <em>Daubert, </em>the Supreme Court generally discussed the district court\u2019s role as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>gatekeeper in determining whether expert testimony on scientific matters is admissible under Rule 702. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 589, 113 S.Ct. at 2794-95. The <em>Daubert </em>Court also set out a list of \u201cgeneral observations\u201d for determining whether expert testimony is sufficiently reliable to be admitted under Rule 702, including (1) whether it can and has been tested; (2) whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) what its known or potential rate of error is, and whether standards controlling its operation exist; and (4) whether it is generally accepted in the field. <em>Id. </em>at 593-94, 113 S.Ct. at 2796-97. The <em>Daubert </em>Court, however, clarified that federal courts should not apply these factors rigidly, but instead should use them as \u201cflexible\u201d guidelines in applying Rule 702. <em>Id. </em>(explaining that \u201c[m]any factors will bear on the inquiry, and we do not presume to set out a definitive checklist or test\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999), the Supreme Court subsequently elaborated on the flexible nature of this inquiry, explaining that <em>Daubert\u2019s </em>list of specific factors neither necessarily nor exclusively applies to all experts or in every case. <em>Id., </em>526 U.S. at 141, 119 S.Ct. at 1171. Whether the <em>Daubert </em>opinion factors are even pertinent to assessing reliability in a case will \u201cdepend[] on the nature of the issue, the expert\u2019s particular expertise, and the subject of his testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 119 S.Ct. at 1175. The <em>Kumho </em>Court further explained that it could:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">neither rule out, nor rule in, for all cases and for all time the applicability of the factors mentioned in <em>Daubert, </em>nor [could it] now do so for subsets of cases categorized by category of expert or by kind of evidence. Too much depends upon the particular circumstances of the particular case at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">We have determined that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kumho </em>means that \u201cexpert testimony that does not meet all or most of the <em>Daubert </em>factors may sometimes be admissible.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>415 F.3d at 1268. Indeed, in <em>Brown, </em>we concluded that a court did not abuse its discretion in admitting expert testimony from two government witnesses on the chemical structure of certain drugs, which testimony the experts explained was \u201cbased on their knowledge, skill, and experience,\u201d and on \u201csufficient facts and data,\u201d even though the government failed to show <em>Daubert </em>factors such as \u201ctestability\u2019 and peer review. <em>Id. </em>at 1268-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">In the instant case, the court overruled Estelan\u2019s objection to Special Agent Bonner\u2019s testimony, as \u201can expert in street level narcotics and trafficking and specifically in crack cocaine and cocaine powder,\u201d on how cocaine base typically is sold and why the amounts of cocaine base that were recovered from the toilet, drawer, and refrigerator from Estelan\u2019s residence, and the cocaine base in the Excedrin pill bottle, were indicative of distribution, instead of personal use. Special Agent Bonner conceded that he never had published any articles on street-level dealing of cocaine base, nor been subject to peer review or evaluation. Special Agent Bonner also agreed that his methodology for his opinions was based solely on his training, observations, and experiences. Thus, similar to the facts in <em>Brown, </em>the government failed to establish all of the factors discussed in <em>Daubert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Regardless, as discussed above, \u201cexpert testimony that does not meet all or most of the <em>Daubert </em>factors may sometimes be admissible.\u201d <em>See Brown, </em>415 F.3d at 1268. The government elicited from Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Agent Bonner that, as an agent with the DEA for approximately four years and four months, he had (1) received specialized training in the distribution and trafficking of illegal drugs, particularly with Schedule I and II controlled substances; (2) participated in hundreds of investigations involving the distribution of cocaine base; and (3) interviewed in excess of 100 persons involved in the illegal distribution of cocaine and cocaine base. Special Agent Bonner also stated, without any challenges, that he previously had been employed for approximately eight years as a police officer, working extensively on narcotic cases, and that, as a result of this training and experience, he had become familiar with the conduct and trafficking techniques of street-level narcotic distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Furthermore, \u201c[t]he rule is well-established that an experienced narcotics agent may testify about the significance of certain conduct or methods of operation unique to the drug distribution business.\u201d <em>See United States v. Butler, </em>102 F.3d 1191, 1199 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). In <em>Butler, </em>we concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing testimony that money seized was packaged in \u201cdealer folds\u201d \u2014 a manner of packaging peculiar to drug dealers. <em>See id. </em>Similarly, in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>870 F.2d 612 (11th Cir.1989), we determined, albeit prior to <em>Daubert, </em>that the district court did not err in admitting as expert opinion a police officer\u2019s testimony on drug dealing in Tallahassee, Florida, when the officer had been a police officer for over six years, had worked for the majority of this time in an area of the city where the major law enforcement problem was cocaine base, had arrested approximately 100 suspects for cocaine base offenses, and, for 8 months prior to his testimony, and had been a member of a police unit whose sole responsibility was to investigate cocaine base offenses. <em>See id. </em>at 613. Because Special Agent Bonner also offered uncontested testimony that he had extensive training and experience in the trafficking of cocaine base, we conclude that the court did not err in admitting his expert testimony on drug-trafficking amounts. <em>See Brown, </em>415 F.3d at 1266.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">ISSUE 3: <em>Criminal-History Points</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Estelan last argues that the court plainly erred when it used prior convictions that it had declared constitutionally invalid in calculating Estelan\u2019s criminal history category. Citing to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, comment. (n.6) and <em>United States v. Cornog, </em>945 F.2d 1504, 1509 (11th Cir.1991), Estelan contends that, when a district court finds that a prior conviction is constitutionally invalid for a purpose other than criminal history, it also must exclude that conviction and its corresponding sentence \u201cfrom all of its criminal history calculations.\u201d Estelan also asserts that this error was plain because his resulting higher guideline range created a reasonable prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ability of a different outcome at sentencing. Moreover, Estelan summarily asserts that use of a constitutionally infirm criminal conviction to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">When a defendant raises an argument for the first time on appeal, such as here, our review is only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cUnder plain error review, which is authorized by Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b), federal appellate courts have only a limited power to correct errors that were forfeited because they were not timely raised in the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1270-71 (internal quotations and marks omitted). Thus, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.... Even then, we will exercise our discretion to rectify the error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1271 (internal quotations and marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">In <em>Cornog </em>\u2014 the case relied on by Estelan \u2014 we examined a defendant\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s inclusion in its calculation of his criminal-history points convictions that the court had determined were constitutionally invalid for purposes of sentencing the defendant as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Cornog, </em>945 F.2d at 1508-09. We concluded that, \u201cif the [district] court properly held that the convictions were invalid \u2014 and therefore could not be counted \u2014 then it was bound to exclude them from all of its criminal history calculations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1509. We further explained that this rule was true, even though the collateral inquiry undertaken by the court in determining the defendant\u2019s career-offender status was discretionary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">In the instant case, both parties agree that, although the court determined that three of Estelan\u2019s prior felony convictions were constitutionally invalid for purposes of enhancing his statutory sentence under \u00a7 851, the court counted these convictions in calculating Estelan\u2019s criminal-history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1. Moreover, the government is not challenging the fact that the inclusion of the three criminal-history points from these convictions resulted in Estelan having a criminal history category of IV, and a guideline range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment, instead of a criminal history category of III, and a guideline range of 121 to 151 months imprisonment. Instead, the government is arguing that this calculation was not erroneous under this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Cornog </em>because <em>Cornog </em>was decided prior to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s 1990 amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 \u2014 the guideline that specifies what convictions count in a defendant\u2019s criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Indeed, when we decided <em>Cornog </em>in 1991, Application Note 6 to \u00a7 4A1.2 read in part: \u201cConvictions which the defendant shows to have been constitutionally invalid may not be counted in the criminal history score.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.6) (1990). Note 6, however, was amended in November 1993 to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">Sentences resulting from convictions that (A) have been reversed or vacated because of errors of law or because of subsequently discovered evidence exonerating the defendant, or (B) have been ruled constitutionally invalid in a prior case are not to be counted. With respect to the current sentencing proceeding, this guideline and commentary do not confer upon the defendant any right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>attack collaterally a prior conviction or sentence beyond any such rights otherwise recognized in law <em>{e.g., </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 expressly provides that a defendant may collaterally attack certain prior convictions).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.6) (1993) &amp; (2003). Based on a similar earlier amendment,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>in <em>United States v. Roman, </em>989 F.2d 1117 (11th Cir.1993), held that the revised \u00a7 4A1.2 does not authorize a sentencing court to inquire into the constitutional validity of a prior conviction, unless the defendant adduces evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the conviction used to enhance his sentence is presumptively void, which cases \u201care small in number and are perhaps limited to uncounseled convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Unlike the facts in <em>Roman, </em>however, Estelan challenged at sentencing the constitutional validity of three prior convictions under \u00a7 851 \u2014 a statutory exception that the amendment to Application Note 6 explicitly discussed. <em>(See </em>Rl-66; R6 at 562); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.6) (1991). Indeed, we have explained that \u00a7 851(c) specifically sets forth a procedure by which a defendant who is subject to a statutory sentence enhancement may challenge the constitutionality of an earlier conviction that is the basis for the enhancement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Mikell, </em>102 F.3d 470, 477 (11th Cir.1996). The 1991 amendment to Application Note 6, therefore, did not affect our holding in <em>Cornog, </em>at least to the extent that the evidentiary hearing in which the sentencing court examined challenges to the constitutional validity of prior convictions was conducted under \u00a7 851. Thus, contrary to the government\u2019s response on appeal, the court\u2019s counting under \u00a7 4A1.2 of three convictions that it had found to be constitutionally invalid under \u00a7 851 was erroneous under <em>Cornog, </em>and this error was plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Nevertheless, Estelan has failed to show that this error substantially prejudiced him. To establish substantial prejudice, Estelan has the burden of showing that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability of a different result\u201d if the court had not erred in calculating his criminal-history points. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.) (applying plain-error test to error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). \u201c[W]here the effect of an error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate \u2014 where we would have to speculate \u2014 the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Here, other than stating that his guideline range should have been 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, instead of the 135 to 168 month range that the court considered, Estelan has not cited to authority showing, or even explained, why he was substantially prejudiced when the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>sentenced him to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Cf. United States v. Richardson, </em>166 F.3d 1360, 1361-62 (11th Cir.1999) (reversible plain error occurred where the difference in the defendant\u2019s enhanced guideline range of 180 to 188 months was much greater than his unenhanced range of 70 to 87 months). Indeed, in discussing why it was imposing <em>post-Booker </em>a 135-month sentence, the court explained that it had considered \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors, and that it had \u201clooked carefully at [Estelan\u2019s] prior convictions, what they consisted of, the way they were treated and so on.\u201d <em>(See </em>R6 at 638); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.6) (instructing that \u201cthe criminal conduct underlying any conviction that is not counted in the criminal history score may be considered pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category)\u201d). Thus, although the court erred in calculating Estelan\u2019s guideline range, Estelan failed to establish that this error substantially prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that Estelan\u2019s post-arrest statements were voluntary and, thus, in denying Estelan\u2019s motions to suppress them. The court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Estelan\u2019s objection to the government\u2019s introduction of expert testimony from Special Agent Bonner regarding drug-distribution amounts. Furthermore, although the court did plainly err in calculating Estelan\u2019s criminal-history points, Estelan has failed to establish that such error resulted in any prejudice. We, therefore, affirm Estelan\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-10\">. Although the magistrate judge in her report and recommendation construed Estelan\u2019s third suppression motion as challenging post-arrest statements Estelan made on November 18, 2003, Estelan clarified in his objections to this report that his third suppression motion involved the post-arrest statement he made on December 22, 2003. Thus, to the extent Estelan is challenging on appeal the post-arrest statement he made on November 18, 2003, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>arguably did not raise this challenge in the district court. Nevertheless, because the magistrate addressed this statement in her report, and because the government has not argued that this challenge is newly raised on appeal, we also will treat Estelan\u2019s suppression motions as covering statements made on both dates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\">. The district court, in adopting the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, denied Estelan's motions to the extent he was arguing that they were obtained after he invoked his right to remain silent. Because Estelan has not challenged this determination on appeal, we deem any arguments on it abandoned. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1275 (11th Cir.) (explaining that an argument not raised in an appellant\u2019s opening brief is deemed abandoned), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 643, -L. Ed.2d - (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">. Officer Raja also conceded that, after he spoke with Estelan\u2019s mother and sister about the possibility of arresting them, and after the officers transported Estelan to the police station, he permitted these family members to speak to Estelan, with their conversations \"surreptitiously videotaped,\u201d with the hope that Estelan would admit to them that he owned the drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\">. Estelan objected to this report, arguing that the fact that he made post-arrest statements did not establish that he voluntarily waived his right to remain silent. Estelan contended that he testified that he was threatened with the arrest of family members on November 18, 2003, and that the government did not claim that the officers had probable cause to arrest members of his family on this date. He also argued that the officers did not have probable cause to arrest his mother and sister on December 22, 2003, because (1) the probable cause affidavits for both search warrants were based solely on Estelan\u2019s illegal activity, (2) his mother and sister were not arrested after the first search revealed both drugs and guns in their residence, (3) the cocaine base recovered from the cluttered living room was a small amount; and (4) the cocaine base recovered from his sister\u2019s room was in a closed container.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b217-12\">. Although the government asked Officer Honkala about a search on November 13, 2003, it, presumably, was referring to the November 18, 2003, search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b218-5\">. Although Officer Raja first stated that he arrested Estelan in January 2, 2004, he subsequently clarified that the arrest occurred on January 22, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\">. In addition to raising at trial his objection to Special Agent Bonner's expert testimony, Estelan filed pretrial a motion to exclude this testimony. The court, however, did not address this motion until the trial had commenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b218-12\">. The court also denied Estelan\u2019s objection to the introduction of this expert testimony to the extent Estelan was relying on Fed.R.Evid. 401 and 403. Because Estelan has not challenged this ruling on appeal, we deem any arguments on it abandoned. <em>See Levy, </em>416 F.3d at 1275.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b218-13\">. The government had filed a pretrial notice, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, notifying Estelan of its intent to rely on three of his prior state felony drug convictions in seeking an en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>hanced sentence in the instant offense, as required in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">. These prior convictions included three convictions that Estelan had denied and that the court eventually found at sentencing to be constitutionally invalid for purposes of relying on them to statutorily enhance Estelan\u2019s sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, that is, (1) two consolidated state convictions in Palm Beach County, Florida, for felony sale of cocaine, in Case Nos. 02-14569CFA02 and 02-2291CFA02, on May 30, 2003; and (2) a state conviction in Palm Beach County, Florida, for felony possession of marijuana, in Case No. 03-10472CFA02, on October 10, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\">. As discussed above, the government argues that, even if the court erred in denying Estelan\u2019s suppression motions and in admitting his post-arrest statements, this error was harmless. The Supreme Court has determined that an erroneous admission of a coerced confession can be harmless error. <em>See Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 295, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1257, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991). However, in determining whether a coerced confession was harmless error, the Supreme Court explained in <em>Arizona </em>that \"[a] confession is like no other evidence.\u201d Indeed, \"the defendant\u2019s own confession is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him.\u201d <em>See Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 296, 111 S.Ct. at 1257 (quotation and marks omitted). Here, we need not determine the issue of harmless error because no error occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b222-12\">. Although Estelan included in the heading for this argument that the court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the \"fingerprint evidence\u201d met the requirements of Rule 702 for admission as scientific expert testimony, he failed in his discussion to explain or cite to the record in support of this contention. Thus, it appears that the inclusion of this contention was not intended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b224-5\">. Alternatively, as the government contends, the reversal is not warranted because the admission of this evidence did not affect the outcome of Estelan\u2019s trial. <em>See Brown, </em>415 F.3d at 1266; <em>see also United States v.

In addition to Special Agent Bonner\u2019s testimony on drug-distribution amounts, evidence at trial that demonstrated Estelan's intent to distribute included (1) on November 18, 2003, officers recovered cocaine base and powder in the same bedroom as a loaded Glock model 30, .45 semiautomatic pistol; (2) on December 22, 2003, officers recovered from the same refrigerator cocaine base and $725 in cash; and (3) on January 3, 2004, on two separate occasions, a Cl made undercover videotaped buys of cocaine base from Estelan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\">.
