In A-6550-95, the employer appeals from a June 17, 1996 judgment awarding Richard Street <em>1%% </em>permanent partial disability. In A-6551-95, the employer appeals from a judgment awarding Michael Serpe 25% permanent partial disability. In both cases, the Division determined that Street and Serpe, career longshoremen who were in their sixties, suffered from chronic obstructive lung disease due to their work-related exposure to noxious substances. We consolidate these appeals for the purpose of this opinion because they present a common legal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">The common issue involves an amendment to New Jersey\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The amendment (sometimes referred to as chapter 74), effective on July 22,1994, changed the definition of employee contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36. It redefined \u201cemployee\u201d to eliminate from coverage under the Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">employees eligible under the federal \u201cLongshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,\u201d 44 Stat. 1424 (33 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 901 <em>et seq.), </em>for benefits payable with respect to accidental death or injury, or occupational disease or infection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>[L. </em>1994, c. 74, \u00a7 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Prior to adoption of the amendment, there was concurrent jurisdiction under the federal and state acts requiring compensation of maritime workers for job-related injuries. <em>See Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>715, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2432, 65 L.Ed.2d 458 (1980). As a result of the amendment, a New Jersey maritime employee is limited to seeking compensation under the federal act. The issue is whether the amendment applies retroactively to bar claims under the New Jersey Act which had been filed before the amendment\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In the present cases, Street's and Serpe\u2019s petitions had been filed in 1992, two years before adoption of the amendment. The compensation judge in each case denied the employer\u2019s motions to dismiss, ruling that the amendment did not apply retroactively. The employer appeals from those rulings, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The general rule of statutory construction followed by New Jersey courts favors prospective application of statutes. <em>Gibbons v. Gibbons, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>515, 521, 432 A.2d 80 (1981). The purpose behind this rule is to give people fair notice of the laws that they are expected to follow; they cannot be expected to obey laws that have not yet been enacted. <em>See Id. </em>at 522, 432 A.2d 80 (citing 2 Sutherland, <em>Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 41.02 at 247 (4th ed.1973)); <em>accord Phillips v. Curiale, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>608, 615, 608 A.2d 895 (1992). The presumption in favor of prospective application of statutes is strongest in criminal cases due to the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto application of penal laws that would impose \u201cpunishment for an act that was not punishable at the time it was committed, or ... additional punishment to that then prescribed.\u201d <em>Kendall v. Snedeker, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 286-87, 530 A.2d 334 (App.Div.1987) (quoting <em>Matter of Coruzzi, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>557, 578, 472 A.2d 546, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>802, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>56, 83 L.Ed.2d 8 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">However, this general rule of statutory construction is not to be applied \u201cmechanistically\u201d to every case. <em>Gibbons, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 522, 432 A.2d 80. Our Supreme Court has articulated three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>exceptions to the general rule against retroactive application of a statute: (1) when the express or implied legislative intent required retroactive application because it was \u201cnecessary to make the statute workable or to give it the most sensible interpretation\u201d; (2) when the statute is \u201cameliorative or curative\u201d; or (3) when the \u201cexpectations of the parties\u201d warrant retroactive application. <em>Id. </em>at 522-23, 432 A.2d 80. Even if one of these exceptions applies, however, a statute should not be given retroactive application if it would result in \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d to one of the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 523,432 A.2d 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The employer contends that the first exception, legislative intent, applies. The employer argues that the Legislature expressed its intent that chapter 74 be applied retroactively when it provided that the amendment \u201cshall take effect immediately.\u201d <em>L. </em>1994, c. 74, \u00a7 2. We disagree. That language begs the question in this case, which is whether the amendment, though effective immediately, applies to claims filed prior to its effective date. <em>See Bunk v. Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>176, 194, 676 A.2d 118 (1996) (noting that a provision in legislation that \u201cit would take effect immediately\u201d not a \u201cclear indication of whether it was intended to apply to claims that were pending on the date of its enactment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Chapter 74 eliminates a remedy under New Jersey\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, thereby interfering with an antecedent right. The general rule is that courts will not give retrospective operation to such a statute absent an unequivocal expression of legislative intent to the contrary. <em>See Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Rosenthal, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>372, 381, 102 A.2d 587 (1954) (citing <em>Hastings v. H.M. Byllesby &amp; Co., </em>293 <em>N.Y. </em>413, 57 <em>N.E.2d </em>737, 740 (1944)); <em>accord, Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>69, 95, 577 A.2d 1239 (1990). Chapter 74 contains no expression of any intent to divest the Division of Worker\u2019s Compensation of jurisdiction over claims pending on the amendment\u2019s effective date. Because retroactive application to hundreds of pending claims would have had a severe impact on all petitioners, especial<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ly on those petitioners such as Serpe and Street, whose claims had been pending for long periods of time, we are persuaded that had the Legislature intended to effect a dismissal of those claims, it would have expressed that intent explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Under the second exception to the general rule, the term \u201cameliorative\u201d refers only to criminal laws that effect a reduction in a criminal penalty. <em>Kendall, supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 286-87, 530 A.2d 334. The term \u201ccurative\u201d encompasses a wider class of statutes; it refers to acts and amendments intended to correct \u201cinadvertence or error in the original enactment of a statute or in its administration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 530 A.2d 334 (quoting 2 Sutherland, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 41.11 at 410). Under the curative exception, an amendment to a statute may be applied retroactively if it merely carries out or explains the intent of the original statute, but does not alter the intended scope or purpose of the original act. <em>Id. </em>at 287-88, 530 A.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In <em>Kendall, supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 283, 530 A.2d 334, we refused to apply retroactively an amendment that eliminated the interspousal bar from the recovery scheme of the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund, thus denying relief to a passenger injured in an uninsured car driven and owned by his wife. We held that the amendment was not curative because elimination of the interspousal bar expanded the category of persons eligible to recover from the fund. <em>Id. </em>at 289-90, 530 A.2d 334. This was a change in the law, not an attempt to clarify or carry out the original statute. <em>Id. </em>at 290, 530 A.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In explaining our refusal to apply the amendment retroactively, we criticized two Law Division opinions that failed to recognize the distinction between the terms \u201cameliorative\u201d and \u201ccurative,\u201d as used in <em>Gibbons, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 515, 432 A.2d 80. <em>Kendall, supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 288-89, 530 A.2d 334. We also explained the meaning of the term \u201cimprove,\u201d as used by the <em>Gibbons </em>Court when referring to curative enactments. <em>Ibid. </em>We ruled that <em>Hart v. Fox, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>564, 499 A.2d 553 (Law Div.1985) (retroactively applying amendment that excluded from reimbursement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>county welfare agency all compensatory damages awarded for minor\u2019s personal injury), and <em>Cokenakes v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 505 A.2d 243 (Law Div.1985) (retroactively applying statute governing primacy of personal injury coverages when there is no primary insurer), both erred in invoking the curative exception for statutes that constituted clear changes in the law. <em>Kendall, supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 288-89, 530 A.2d 334. We observed that in both opinions, the Law Division mistakenly invoked the curative exception merely because an amendment was deemed to have \u201cimproved\u201d a statutory scheme. <em>Ibid. </em>Under such an expansive approach, every amendment would automatically be subject to retroactive application because the Legislature presumably seeks to \u201cimprove\u201d the statutory scheme every time it amends a statute. <em>Ibid. </em>This would run counter to the notion of fairness that led to the presumption in favor of prospective application and to the narrowly circumscribed exceptions to the rule. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In a curative exception case closely analogous to the present one, <em>Brown v. State Dept. of Personnel, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 607 A.2d 1354 (App.Div.1992), plaintiff appealed from a decision denying him a veteran\u2019s preference on the competitive list for a firefighter position. The issue was whether to apply retroactively an amendment to the veteran\u2019s preference statute that added to the definition of \u201cveteran\u201d persons who had participated in the Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, and Desert Storm missions. <em>Id. </em>at 85, 607 A.2d 1354. We held that the amendment was not curative because it did not clarify, improve, or correct a misapplication of the original law. <em>Id. </em>at 90, 607 A.2d 1354. Rather, it \u201ccreated a new class of veterans with substantive rights that did not previously exist.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Applying these principles to the present case, we conclude that chapter 74 is not curative.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Petitioner Street subpoenaed and presented the testimony of John Kearns, Jr. Kearns was senior vice-president of risk management for Maher Terminals, a maritime employer. Kearns testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>fied that he had chaired a group titled The New Jersey Coalition of Maritime Employers (Coalition). The Coalition\u2019s objective was to induce the Legislature to exclude longshoremen\u2019s compensation claims from coverage under New Jersey Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and to shift those claims exclusively to compensation under the federal act. To achieve this objective, the Coalition hired a lobbyist.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Kearns drafted the bill that became chapter 74. The bill was adopted as Kearns had drafted it, with one exception: chapter 74 contains the word \u201cinfection\u201d which Kearns had not included in his draft. Kearns testified that the lobbyist advised the Coalition that the bill would not pass if the union, the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, opposed it. According to Kearns, he procured the ILA\u2019s approval, or at least its neutrality. Consequently, the bill passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Kearns also testified regarding the retroactivity issue. Kearns did not discuss retroactivity with the union leaders because he \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was going to be retroactive.\u201d Kearns estimated that prior to the adoption of the bill approximately 1,500 longshoremen lung cases were pending in the New Jersey Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation. According to Kearns, the union would have \u201ckilled\u201d the bill if its effect would have been dismissal of the pending cases. Kearns stated that neither he nor the Coalition intended that the amendment be applied retroactively to pending cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Although Kearns\u2019 testimony has no legal significance regarding the Legislature\u2019s intent in adopting chapter 74, it does have some historical value regarding the third exception to the general rule of prospective applications. The third exception considers the parties\u2019 expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We are persuaded that the expectations of the parties do not warrant retroactive application of the amendment. To the contrary, petitioners, whose claims had been pending for two years before adoption of the amendment, would have a legitimate expectation that those claims would be resolved under New Jersey\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>compensation law, and that they would be spared the burden, that is, the injustice, of refiling their claims in the federal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The employer also contends that petitioners did not carry their burden of proof regarding disability. This contention is without merit. The compensation judge\u2019s findings are supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
