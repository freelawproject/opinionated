In its complaint, Trump alleges that Meridian unlawfully stopped payment on a personal money order the bank had issued to a James Haas, Jr., in the amount of $35,000. Haas cashed the personal money order at Trump\u2019s casino for gaming proceeds. Trump returned the money order to Meridian, the drawee bank. Meridian refused to honor the money order, marking it \u201cpayment stopped,\u201d since Haas had insufficient funds in his account with Meridian to cover the $35,000 instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In dismissing the complaint, the motion judge concluded that the money order was a personal check and that Meridian had not \u201caccepted\u201d it under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-409(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On appeal, Trump argues that: (1) Meridian could not stop payment on the money order, \u201cprejudicing the rights of a holder in due course\u201d; (2) Meridian \u201caccepted\u201d the money order by marking it \u201cpayment stopped\u201d and by use of its printed name and logo on the face of the instrument; (3) as a holder in due course, Trump \u201cshould not suffer due to Meridian\u2019s negligence\u201d in issuing the instrument; and (4) <em>Newman v. First Nat\u2019l State Bank of Toms River, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>598, 414 A.2d 1367 (App.Div.1980), relied on by the motion judge, is distinguishable or should be overturned. We reject the arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On December 13, 1994, Haas deposited two checks in the amount of $20,000 and $22,000, respectively, into the Meridian account of J.E. Haas-Mid-Way Equipment Co. The checks were drawn on a Mid-Way Equipment Co. account at Commerce Bank. Meridian credited the J.E. Haas-Mid-Way Equipment Co. account for the full amount of the two checks and forwarded them to Commerce Bank for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">On December 15, 1994, Haas purchased a $35,000 personal money order from Meridian. Meridian\u2019s name and logo are printed on the upper left-hand side of the money order. The money order is also stamped: \u201cNOT VALID FOR MORE THAN $35,000.\u201d It is made payable to the order of \u201cJim Haas\u201d; it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>clear from the record when the name of the payee \u201cJim Haas\u201d was inserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Haas signed the money order in the bottom right-hand corner of the document. On December 15, 1994, he presented the signed instrument to Trump and was given $35,000 in cash for use at Trump\u2019s gaming tables.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">On December 16, 1994, the Mid-Way Equipment Co. checks drawn on the Commerce Bank account were returned to Meridian unpaid with a notation that the Mid-Way Equipment Co. account had been closed. Meridian debited its J.E. Haas-Mid-Way Equipment Co. account for the amount of the returned checks which resulted in a $38,584 overdraft. On December 20, 1994, Trump presented Haas\u2019 personal money order to Meridian for payment. Meridian dishonored the order, placing a \u201cpayment stopped\u201d notation on it, since the J.E. Haas-Mid-Way Equipment Co. account contained insufficient funds to cover the amount of the money order. It was thereupon returned to Trump\u2019s bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">As stated, the motion judge held that the personal money order was a personal check as opposed to a cashier\u2019s check and that Meridian, as the drawee, was not liable on the money order until it accepted it. He found that Meridian did not accept the money order merely because its name is printed on the face of the order or because it had stamped \u201cpayment stopped\u201d on its face when the money order was dishonored. The judge also observed that he was bound by <em>Newman, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 604, 414 A.2d 1367, which held that a personal money order is a check and that a bank should not be deemed to have accepted a money order merely because its name and logo are printed on the face of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">A personal money order has been described as an instrument \u201cfor the convenience of anyone who does not have an ordinary cheeking account and needs a safe, inexpensive and readily accepted means of transferring funds.\u201d <em>Sequoyah State Bank v. Union Nat'l Bank of Little Rock, </em>274 <em>Ark. </em>1, 621 <em>S.W.</em>2d 683, 684 (1981) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>(Dudley, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is a public perception that personal money orders are the equivalent of cash or have the credit of the issuing bank behind them. <em>See Unger v. NCNB Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>540 So.2d 246, 247 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1989); <em>Mirabile v.

Murray, <em>Revised Articles 3 and U of the Uniform Commercial Code: A Friendly Critique, </em>47 <em>U. Miami L.Rev. </em>337, 342 (1992). However, this perception is at odds with legal reality.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">One glance at the typical mail order catalogue or newspaper and magazine advertisements for mail order merchandise shows that merchants typically equate money orders with certified and cashier\u2019s checks; merchants who will not accept personal checks are happy to accept money orders. To their misfortune, this confidence is misplaced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Prior to the 1995 revisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the UCC (L.1995, c. 28), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-101 to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-504,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> personal money orders were not defined and thus were considered something of a \u201cmaverick\u201d instrument. <em>Newman, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 601, 414 A.2d 1367. However, we held in <em>Newman, supra, </em>that a personal money order \u201chas the characteristic of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>check in that it constitutes \u2018a draft drawn on a bank and payable on demand.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting former N.J.S.A 12A:3-104(2)(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Former N.J.S.A 12A-.3-409, effective during the pertinent time period here, provided that a drawee bank will not be liable on an unaccepted check or draft:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">(1) A cheek or other draft does not of itself operate as an assignment of any funds in the hands of the drawee available for its payment, and the drawee is not liable on the instrument until he <em>accepts </em>it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbL\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Former N.J.S.A 12A:3-410(1) defines \u201cacceptance\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">the drawee\u2019s signed engagement to honor the draft as presented. It must be written on the draft, and may consist of his signature alone. It becomes operative when completed by delivery or notification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">Moreover, under the former <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-401, no person is liable on an instrument unless his signature appears thereon. A signature is made by use of any name, \u201cincluding any trade or assumed name, upon an instrument, or by any word or mark used in lieu of a written signature.\u201d Former <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-401(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">This statutory scheme makes clear that, despite a payee\u2019s expectation that the drawee bank will pay a check, the bank has no obligation to the check holder to pay it unless and until the bank has accepted it. <em>See </em>2 James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, <em>Uniform Commercial Code </em>\u00a7 16-6a n. 2 and \u00a7 16-6b (4th ed.1995). Even if the drawee \u201carbitrarily dishonors a check, the payee or holder ordinarily has no cause of action against the drawee bank on the instrument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 16-6b.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">We applied these former provisions of the UCC in <em>Newman, supra, </em>where defendant Lois Sykes purchased a money order and sought to stop payment on it after it was lost. 173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 600, 414 A.2d 1367. The issuing bank stopped payment and the individual who had cashed the money order sued the bank for its face amount. <em>Id. </em>at 600-01, 414 A.2d 1367. Observing that a personal money order is the equivalent of a personal check, we held that payment may be stopped on the money order if it had not been paid, accepted or certified. <em>Id. </em>at 601-03, 414 A.2d 1367 (citing former <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:4-403(1)). We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Although acceptance of an instrument is generally manifested by such words as \u201caccepted\u201d in the case of a draft, or \u201ccertified\u201d in the case of a check, the Code expressly provides that an acceptance may consist of the drawee\u2019s signature alone. <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-410(1). However, it is essential that the instrument at least contain the signature of the drawee. See 2 Anderson, <em>Uniform Commercial Code </em>(2 ed.1971), \u00a7 3-410:6 at 978; <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-401(1). The money order purchased by Sykes was not signed by any authorized representative of the bank, nor did it bear the signature of the bank. The mere fact that the printed name of the bank appeared on the face of the money order was not sufficient to constitute its signature and therefore was not an acceptance of the instrument for payment within the purview of <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-401(1). Consequently, Sykes, as the purchaser of the money order, had the right to stop payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\"><em>[Newman, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 604, 414 A.2d 1367.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Further, we held that issuance of a personal money order, \u201cjust as any check or draft,\u201d did not of itself constitute an assignment of funds in the hands of the bank available for its payment. <em>Ibid. </em>(citing former <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-409(1)). We therefore concluded that the \u201cbank was not liable on the instrument until it accepted it.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">We agree with the motion judge that <em>Newman </em>is dispositive. Although <em>Newman </em>involved a customer\u2019s stop-payment, and not a stop-payment or dishonor by the drawee bank, its holding turns on the concept of \u201cacceptance\u201d of the personal money order by the drawee bank as a predicate to its obligation to honor the instrument. That analysis applies here. Meridian did not \u201caccept\u201d or \u201ccertify\u201d the personal money order prior to its dishonor. There is no \u201csignature\u201d of Meridian on the face of the instrument, nor is there any other indication that Meridian \u201cassented in writing to the order of the drawer.\u201d New Jersey Study Comment 1 on former <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-410. The mere fact that Meridian\u2019s name and logo were printed on the instrument \u201cwas not sufficient to constitute its signature and therefore was not an acceptance of the instrument for payment within the purview of <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-401(1).\u201d <em>See Newman, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 604, 414 A.2d 1367. In our view, the name and logo were nothing more than a commercially acceptable means of identifying the institution issuing the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Further, we reject plaintiffs argument that Meridian accepted the money order by stamping \u201cpayment stopped\u201d on its face. Meridian\u2019s action in stamping the money order \u201cpayment stopped\u201d is in fact a clear and obvious indication of an intent to dishonor the instrument, and nothing more. It logically cannot be deemed to constitute acceptance. Moreover, the fact the money order was stamped \u201cNOT VALID FOR MORE THAN $35,000\u201d does not change the result. This notation can be fairly deemed merely as an expression of limitation on the authority of the party signing and delivering the money order. It certainly cannot be deemed a \u201csigned engagement to honor the draft as presented.\u201d Former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-410(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Finally, we reject Trump\u2019s argument that acceptance is shown by the fact that the purchase of the money order was a \u201csale\u201d and that the money order was drawn not on Mid-Way Equipment Co.\u2019s, but Meridian\u2019s account. In <em>Newman, supra, </em>we did not focus upon the fund created to pay the money order. Instead, we adopted the rationale of <em>Garden Check Cashing Serv., Inc. v. First Nat\u2019l City Bank, </em>25 A.D.2d 137, 267 N.Y.S.2d 698, 702-03, <em>aff'd o.b., </em>18 N.E.2d 941, 277 N.Y.S.2d 141, 223 <em>N.E.2d </em>566 (1966), that in purchasing a money order an individual deposits a sum with a bank and essentially receives one blank check. <em>Newman, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 601-02, 414 A.2d 1367; <em>contra Rose Check Cashing Serv., Inc. v. Chemical Bank New York Trust Co., </em>40 <em>Misc.2d </em>995, 244 N.Y.S.2d 474, 477 (N.Y.Civ.Ct.1963), <em>aff'd, </em>43 Misc.2d 679, 252 N.Y.S.2d 100 (N.Y.Sup.1964) (holding that no deposit is created upon the issuance of a money order because it is in the nature of a sale. Instead, the funds to pay the money order immediately come within the bank\u2019s exclusive control and ownership).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The 1995 revisions to Articles 3 and 4, although not directly applicable here, lend support to our holding and the continued viability of Newman\u2019s analysis and result. Revised <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-104f defines a check to include a money order: \u201cAn instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>another term, such as \u2018money order.\u2019 \u201d The UCC comment 4 to revised <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-104 explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cMoney orders\u201d are sold both by banks and non-banks. They vary in form and their form determines how they are treated in Article 3. The most common form of money order sold by banks is that of an ordinary check drawn by the purchaser except that the amount is machine impressed. That kind of money order is a check under Article 3 and is subject to a stop order by the purchaser-drawer as in the case of ordinary checks. <em>The seller bank is the drawee and has no obligation to a holder to pay the money order.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">As one author noted, the revisions to Article 3 of the UCC support a bank\u2019s right to dishonor a money order if it has not accepted it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">[T]he inclusion of personal money orders within the definition of an ordinary check (at Revised section 3-104(f)) rather than inclusion as a form of cashier\u2019s check (at section 3-411) means that such money orders are subject to customer stop payment orders and can be dishonored like an ordinary check. This applies only to money orders signed by the purchaser as drawer; of course a bank money order or similar bank draft (drawn by the issuing bank) would be treated as a cashier\u2019s or teller\u2019s check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">[Alvin C.

Murphey, Jr., <em>Revised Article 3 and Amended Article 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code: Comments on the Changes They Will Make, </em>46 <em>Ark. L.Rev. </em>501, 526-27 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">It is true that a number of courts have held that a personal money order should be treated like a cashier\u2019s check; therefore, a bank, on its own initiative, may not stop payment on a personal money order it has issued. <em>See </em>e.g., <em>Sequoyah State Bank, supra, </em>621 S.W.2d at 684; <em>Unger, supra, </em>540 So.2d at 247; <em>Rose Check Cashing Serv., Inc., supra, </em>244 N.Y.S.2d at 477; <em>Interfirst Bank Carrollton v. Northpark Nat\u2019l Bank of Dallas, </em>671 <em>S.W.2d </em>100, 103 (Tex.App.1984). <em>Cf. State ex rel. Babcock v. Perkins, </em>165 <em>Ohio St. </em>185, 134 N.E.2d 839, 842 (1956) (holding that a bank money order is equivalent to a cashier\u2019s check and is issued by the bank and paid from the bank\u2019s funds).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>In our view, these cases should be given little weight. As stated, the revisions to Article 3 of the UCC that define a personal money order as a check mean that the purchaser or drawer of a personal money order may stop payment on it and \u201cthe drawee may dishonor it without liability to the holder.\u201d Murphey, <em>supra, </em>46 <em>Ark. L.Rev. </em>at 526. Thus, these revisions would change the reasoning and the result of such cases as <em>Sequoyah State Bank, supra. Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Trump next argues that, as a holder in due course of the money order \u201cit should not suffer due to Meridian\u2019s negligence in issuing the instrument as [Meridian] did not follow its own procedure nor use ordinary care.\u201d This claim is predicated on the fact that Meridian purportedly failed to follow its own internal procedures requiring that, before a money order is sold, there are sufficient funds in the customer\u2019s account to cover it.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Trump\u2019s status as a holder in due course meant that it took the instrument free from essentially all claims by others and all defenses of any party to the instrument with whom the holder has not dealt. Former N.J.S.A 12A:3-305; <em>see also </em>comments on former N.J.S.A 12A:3-305. But these rights and protections do not come into play unless and until the drawee bank accepts the instrument. <em>See </em>former <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-409(1) and revised <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-408. Absent acceptance of the instrument by Meridian, Trump\u2019s sole remedy is against Haas, the drawer of the purchase money order.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Moreover, we are satisfied that any claim of negligence based on Meridian\u2019s failure to adhere to its internal procedures was subsumed by former <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A-.4-402, which makes a payor bank liable to its \u201ccustomer\u201d for damages proximately caused by the \u201cwrongful dishonor of an item.\u201d Only the purchaser of a personal money order, the \u201ccustomer,\u201d has a claim when the dishonor occurs through the \u201cmistake\u201d of the payor bank. <em>Ibid. </em>Compare revised <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:4-402 (\u201cA payor bank is liable to its customer for damages proximately caused by the wrongful dishon- or of an item\u201d). And <em>see </em>comments to revised <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-402.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>It is true that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:1-103 provides that \u201cprinciples of law and equity\u201d supplement the UCC, unless displaced by particular provisions. <em>Accord Western Union Tel. Co. v. Peoples Nat\u2019l Bank in Lakewood, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>272, 276, 404 A.2d 1178 (App.Div.1979); <em>Demos v. Lyons, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 499, 376 A.2d 1352 (Law Div.1977). This provision may be interpreted as permitting a claim of negligence under the UCC absent a specific provision preempting such a claim. But a party asserting that a bank has acted negligently must demonstrate that the bank owed a duty to that party which has been breached, <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Turf Club, Inc. v. Bank of W. Jersey, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 203, 385 A.2d 932 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>506, 391 A.2d 520 (1978), and that there is a causal connection between the bank\u2019s action and the party\u2019s loss. <em>Western Union Tel. Co., supra, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 276, 404 A.2d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Plaintiff relies on <em>New Jersey Steel Corp. v. Warburton, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>536, 655 A.2d 1382 (1995), for the proposition that Meridian owed such a duty and breached it in failing to follow its internal procedures. However, <em>New Jersey Steel Corp. </em>is inapposite. That case involved a scheme conceived by defendant Warburton under which, as an independent consultant, he stole checks from New Jersey Steel, forged them and deposited them into his personal account. <em>Id. </em>at 539, 655 A.2d 1382. New Jersey Steel\u2019s claim against defendant Midland Bank, the depository-payor bank, was that it had accepted the forged checks for deposit without following its own procedures for inspection of check endorsements. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 655 A.2d 1382. The bank\u2019s liability was predicated on the violation of two specific provisions of the UCC: (1) former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-406(3), involving the bank\u2019s lack of ordinary care in \u201cpaying the item(s)\u201d; and (2) former <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-406, in negligently contributing to the making of an unauthorized signature. <em>Id. </em>at 544-45, 655 A.2d 1382. <em>New Jersey Steel Corp. </em>is distinguishable because here Meridian breached no statutory standard of care owed to its customer expressly established by the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\">For a discussion of negotiable instruments generally and the treatment of money orders, see J.P.

The revision of Article 3 \"attempts to resolve the problem of how to handle instruments like personal money orders\u201d for which there previously were no special provisions, resulting in differing treatment by the courts.

On June 1, 1995, the revisions to Articles 3 and 4 of Title 12A became effective in New Jersey. L.1995, c. 28.
