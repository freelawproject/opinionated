(Top Grade) and Forist Distributors, Inc. (Forist) for legal fees in connection with a federal criminal indictment and trial. The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $500,000. Defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial was denied. On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contend in varying arguments that the <em>alleged </em>oral agreement that they would guarantee the legal fees was not valid and that the vote by six-to-two on two of the jury findings was invalid under the New Jersey Constitution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The salient proofs introduced at trial are as follows. Lipari, the former Mayor of Passaic, is the founder of Top Grade and Forist. In 1991, he became the subject of a federal investigation. He hired plaintiff to represent him in that investigation. On July 25, 1991 Lipari executed a written retainer agreement with plaintiff and paid a retainer fee of $85,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The investigation encompassed various activities of Lipari, his children and defendants. Plaintiff handled pre-indietment legal issues, and responded to grand jury subpoenas for various documents and testimony regarding defendants and Lipari\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">By 1992 Lipari had gifted most of his shares in defendants to his children. Nevertheless, Lipari continued to retain dominant management and operational control over both corporations. He received a weekly salary of $5,000 from each corporation. Two of Lipari\u2019s children worked for defendants. Marilyn Manganello, Lipari\u2019s daughter, was vice president and secretary of defendants. She started working for them in 1985 when she was seventeen and became vice president that year or the following year. She did the bookkeeping and handled the accounts payable and receivable. Marilyn\u2019s responsibilities increased as Lipari became more involved with his mayoral duties. In 1990 and 1991 she dealt with customers, negotiated prices, inspected incoming meat for acceptability, and dealt with health inspectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">James Lipari, Lipari\u2019s son, was president of both corporations. He started working for them in 1980, at the age of seventeen and just out of high school. By 1990 he ran the manufacturing plant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>and hired and supervised employees. In 1991 he owned sixty percent of the shares of both corporations, Marilyn owned thirty percent, and Lipari owned ten percent. James\u2019s and Marilyn\u2019s shares had been \u201cgifted\u201d to them by Lipari.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Marilyn received a salary of $2,000 per week and James a salary of $3,000 per week. Defendants acknowledged in their interrogatory answers that Lipari, on behalf of defendants, \u201csigned numerous documents, including letters, checks and forms,\u201d and \u201cin some instances\u201d may have \u201cacted on behalf of the corporation^]\u201d when entering into \u201ccontractual agreements\u201d with third parties. Marilyn could not recall an objection by her or James to any action or decision Lipari made concerning defendants\u2019 business before his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Lipari was the primary contact for one of Top Grade\u2019s larger accounts. In addition, in the year preceding his indictment, Lipari negotiated a commission arrangement with one of defendants\u2019 meat suppliers. At the time of his federal trial Lipari was solely responsible for Forist\u2019s only account, but he was not principally responsible for generating the majority of Top Grade\u2019s accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Justin Walder was a partner in plaintiff. According to Walder, in their first meeting in 1991, Lipari told him about a federal investigation that related to his position as mayor and had \u201csome relationship\u201d to defendants. Lipari was concerned about protecting defendants because two of his children were working very hard for them. Defendants were identified with him personally, and adverse publicity about defendants might scare away the large public companies that were a major part of defendants\u2019 business. A written retainer letter was executed, and $35,000 was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In March 1992, Lipari was indicted by a federal grand jury. He entered into a second retainer agreement with plaintiff dated March 17, 1992. The terms were substantially identical to those in the first retainer letter, except that the retainer was $175,000. Lipari signed the retainer agreement and paid the $175,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Marilyn, James, and defendants were not indicted. Plaintiff responded in answers to interrogatories that in 1992 Lipari indicated to Walder \u201cthat he and [defendants] would make payment for all legal services rendered to [him]\u201d by plaintiff, and that the services rendered to him were for defendants\u2019 benefit as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Marilyn acknowledged speaking with Walder before each of her two grand jury appearances, during which she testified concerning her work for defendants. She also acknowledged in her deposition testimony that she had said she understood that Walder was representing defendants and her as well as Lipari.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In November 1992 the federal prosecution of Lipari ended in conviction. The sentence included a prison term and .a $186,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Plaintiff never sent bills to either defendant at its business address. However, from July 1991 through November 1992, plaintiff received twenty-five checks from Top Grade totalling $421,271.01 and six checks from Forist totaling $73,927.48. During that period plaintiff also received two checks from Lipari totalling $20,000 and one cashier\u2019s check for $30,000. Plaintiff admitted that no written agreement existed between it and either corporation \u201cother than the checks submitted by defendants,\u201d which were \u201cconsistent with ... Lipari\u2019s promises and agreements\u201d for defendants to pay his bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Other correspondence between plaintiff and defendants, plus correspondence between plaintiff, defendants\u2019 accountants, banks, and suppliers confirmed that plaintiff performed at least some services for defendants in connection with the federal grand jury proceedings, including defendants\u2019 production of subpoenaed documents. Walder testified that \u201cLipari clearly asked me and authorized that I handle\u201d that matter. He added that he was authorized to accept service of all the federal subpoenas for Lipari\u2019s children, and he helped them prepare to testify about defendants\u2019 business and their roles in it. No other attorney represented defendants or Lipari\u2019s children in the federal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>James testified that defendants decided to lend Lipari money for legal bills and the fine when Lipari \u201cran out of money.\u201d James certified that defendants\u2019 payments of some of Lipari\u2019s legal expenses reflected only loans to Lipari rather than defendants\u2019 agreement to be directly responsible for them. He said that Lipari as a ten-percent shareholder had no authority to make such a commitment. Further, he said that neither Lipari nor plaintiff asked either of the corporations to guarantee payment of Lipari\u2019s legal expenses. However, James added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">As a practical matter, in light of his continued incarceration, failing health and the unlikelihood of his having the ability to earn substantially [sic] in the future due to the impact of the negative publicity surrounding this affair and his criminal conviction, I was doubtful that my father would ever have the ability to repay these monies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">James also averred that during the pendency of the federal case Lipari\u2019s \u201cpersonal savings were exhausted\u201d and he had \u201cnowhere else to turn\u201d but to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">There is no documentation of the alleged loans between defendants and Lipari other than notations to that effect in defendants\u2019 check registers. Marilyn was shown some documents, one of which she identified as an October 31, 1991 asset statement for Forist, with a loan receivable in the amount of $2,477.35. Forist\u2019s October 1992 asset statement had the same $2,477.35 loan receivable, plus a $5,000 loan receivable for stockholders. Top Grade\u2019s September 30, 1991, asset statement showed a loan receivable from Lipari with a balance of zero, and its September 1992 asset statement showed a loan receivable of $10,525. Further, Forist\u2019s October 1993 asset statement showed a $30,000 loan receivable from Lipari, and Top Grade\u2019s September 1993 asset statement showed a $70,525 loan receivable from Lipari.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">According to Walder, Lipari told him on various occasions that while he might have a temporary difficulty in paying his bills, he had never \u201cstuck anybody\u201d in his life, his children were aware of the bills, and defendants would pay the bills. At least once Lipari said that defendants would have funds to pay the bills after \u201crunning a warehouse sale.\u201d Nicholas Dottoli, a private investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tor hired by plaintiff to help with defending Lipari in the federal action, testified that Lipari had told him the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Walder treated the fact that defendants were paying Lipari\u2019s bills as confirmation of Lipari\u2019s control over defendants. Walder testified that \u201c[n]othing was ever put in writing\u201d because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">I accepted what he told me, it was his company. It was clear to me he controlled his kids, he controlled that company in every way, because he was a very strong father and a good father, I suspect, but I took him at his word____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">... I knew he controlled the companies by his actions. I did not know the precise share holding. It was my belief that Joseph Lipari gave some shares to his children. It would not surprise me, and I don\u2019t recall specifically that he tried to divest himself of ... shares with his children over a period of year\u2019s, for whatever reasons, but there is no[ ] doubt in my mind that he controlled those companies and his children did what Joseph Lipari requested that they do____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Walder also believed that Lipari\u2019s control was demonstrated by Lipari\u2019s annual salary of half a million dollars from defendants and his responsibility for their largest customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">On May 4, 1993, plaintiff sent a letter addressed to Lipari and defendants at defendants\u2019 business address, and also addressed to Lipari at his home address claiming $502,455 in unpaid legal fees. The letter stated that \u201clegal fees have been paid to this firm by each of you\u201d and described the right to seek fee arbitration before plaintiff would file a lawsuit to collect its fees. Defendants acknowledged receipt of a demand for payment by plaintiff but that they did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Raymond Brown testified for plaintiff as an expert in trial practice. He said that it is a normal practice that a closely-held corporation pays the legal bills \u201crendered to their principals\u201d because most individuals defending against a complex federal case must \u201cresort to a family-held corporation or to other family agencies in order to pay\u201d their legal bills. In his experience the arrangement was usually not reflected in a writing, in part to avoid publicly linking the family business to the case. His own retainer agreements usually did not specify who would pay because it was understood that \u201cthe ordinary defendant has to rely on his family, his small business, and whatever to pay me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Based on this evidence, the eight-member jury unanimously answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question whether plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the credible evidence that defendant Lipari promised that the two corporations would pay for the legal fees involved in representation of the criminal case. The jury unanimously valued plaintiffs services at $500,000. However, the jury split six to two in finding that plaintiff proved by clear and convincing evidence that the promise \u201chad as its leading object or main purpose to benefit [defendants],\u201d and that the promise \u201cwas of little or no benefit to Joseph Lipari.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Defendants contend that the oral guaranty is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. They argue that a January 5, 1996 amendment to the Statute of Frauds, which did not incorporate the case-law exception for oral guarantees invalidates that exception and that under the time-of-decision rule the new statute controls. Further, defendants urge that more recent decisions hold that the exception for oral guarantees is not available for guarantees of obligations for legal fees. We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The Statute of Frauds in effect at the time of trial provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">No action shall be brought upon any of the following agreements or promises, unless the agreement or promise, upon which such action shall be brought or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or by some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">b. A special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another person!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-5 (amended by <em>L. </em>1995, c. 360, <em>\u00a7 8, </em>effective January 5, 1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">In <em>Schoor Assoc. v. Holmdel Heights Constr. Co., </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>95, 101-02, 343 A.2d 401 (1975), our Court set forth the \u201cleading object\u201d or \u201cmain purpose\u201d exception to the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">\u201cWhen the leading object of the promise or agreement is to become guarantor or surety to the promisee for a debt for which a third party is and continues to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>primarily liable, the agreement, whether made before or after or at the time with the promise of the principal, is within the statute, and not binding unless evidenced by writing. On the other hand, when the leading object of the promisor is to subserve some interest or purpose of his own, notwithstanding the effect is to pay or discharge the debt of another, his promise is not within the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">[Id at 102, 343 A.2d 401 (quoting 2 <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 366, at 273-74 (1950)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Contrary to defendants\u2019 representations, neither <em>In re Travarelli, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>431, 662 A.2d 572 (App.Div.1995), nor <em>DeGraaff v. Fusco, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315, 660 A.2d 9 (App.Div.1995), called for special treatment of guarantees to pay legal fees, as neither case involved a guarantee to pay the legal fees that another person incurred under a valid retainer agreement. Instead, they both turned on the absence of a retainer agreement. <em>Travarelli, supra, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 436-38, 662 A.2d 572; <em>DeGraaff, supra, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 320, 660 A.2d 9. Moreover, neither case even mentioned the <em>Schoor </em>case or the \u201cleading object\u201d exception to the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">As of January 5,1996, the Legislature deleted paragraph b from <em>N.J.S.A </em>25:1-5, thereby removing guarantees from the list of \u201cagreements or promises\u201d on which actions were barred in the absence of a writing. <em>L. </em>1995, c. 360, \u00a7 8. However, as of the same date it enacted a new coordinate statute requiring guarantees to be in writing: \u201cA promise to be liable for the obligation of another person, in order to be enforceable, shall be in a writing signed by the person assuming the liability or by that person\u2019s agent.\u201d <em>L. </em>1995, c. 360, \u00a7 6 (codified as <em>N.J.S.A </em>25:1-15).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">While the Legislature\u2019s repeal of particular statutory language ordinarily invalidates a case law doctrine based on an interpretation of that language, <em>see IFA Ins. Co. v. Waitt, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>621, 624-27, 637 A.2d 941 (App.Div.) (significant change to statute demonstrated Legislature\u2019s rejection of a doctrine that courts established by interpreting the prior statutory language), <em>certif. denied, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>295, 642 A.2d 1004 (1994), in this case the Legislature replaced the provision in question with a similar one.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u201cIt is a principle of statutory construction that when the Legislature re-enacts a statute which has been judicially construed, it adopts that judicial interpretation.\u201d <em>Smith v. U.S. Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>454, 463, 467 A.2d 584 (App.Div.1983), aff<em>'d sub nom. Poswiatowski v. Standard Chlorine Chemical, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>321, 475 A.2d 1257 (1984). That same principle applies when the Legislature re-enacts a substantive statutory provision with changes that make no functional difference. <em>See Quaremba v. Allan, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>1, 14, 334 A.2d 321 (1975) (when Legislature modifies statute without changing the language construed in prior judicial decisions, Legislature is presumed to accept continuing validity of those decisions); <em>State v. Burns, </em>159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>539, 545, 388 A.2d 987 (App.Div.1978) (where Legislature made no substantive change in statute following judicial interpretation of it, presumption of legislative familiarity with judicial decisions meant that lack of substantive change in the construed language signalled continuing acceptance of the judicial interpretation); <em>see also Calabro v. Campbell Soup Co., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>149, 164, 581 A.2d 1318 (App.Div.1990) (\u201cThe intention to change a long-established rule or principle is not imputed to the Legislature absent a clear manifestation.\u201d), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>278, 597 A.2d 83 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The legislative history merely describes the contents of the new provisions and notes the changes they represent. It contains no statement indicating that the Legislature had in mind any greater purpose, and it makes no reference to <em>Schoor </em>or the leading object doctrine. <em>See Senate Jud. Comm. Statement to </em>A. <em>1550 </em>(February 6, 1995); <em>Assembly Jud., Law and Pub. Safety Comm. Statement to A. 1550 </em>(November 21, 1994); <em>Sponsor\u2019s Statement to </em>A. <em>1550 </em>(March 15, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Consequently, in the absence of a meaningful difference between the former and current statutes, we reject defendants\u2019 contention that the Legislature intended to invalidate <em>Schoor. </em>Although the Legislature repealed the particular language that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Schoor </em>interpreted, it simultaneously enacted substantially similar language that is susceptible to the same interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The \u201ctime-of-decision\u201d rule is the \u201cwell-established principle that an appellate court on direct review will apply the statute in effect at the time of its decision, at least when the legislature intended that its modification be retroactive to pending cases.\u201d <em>Kruvant v. Mayor and Council of Cedar Grove, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>435, 440, 414 A.2d 9 (1980). It is inapplicable here, because the absence of a substantive difference between <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-15 and the former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:l-5(b) means there is no \u201cchanged\u201d or \u201cnew\u201d provision, and hence no question about whether the Legislature intended to apply such a provision retroactively. <em>Cf. Kruvant, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>435, 414 A.2d 9 (general discussion of time-of-decision rule); <em>Lake Shore Estates v. Denville Township Planning Bd., </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>580, 605 A.2d 1106 (App.Div.1991) (same), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>394, 605 A.2d 1073 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Defendants also contend that plaintiffs proofs failed to meet the requirements of the <em>Schoor </em>test. Defendants appear to argue that the trial judge should have granted their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the main purpose of their guarantee to pay Lipari\u2019s bills was for Lipari rather than the corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">In order to satisfy the <em>Schoor </em>exception to the Statute of Frauds, one must show that the \u201cleading object of the promisor is to subserve some interest or purpose of his own.\u201d <em>Schoor, supra, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>at 102, 343 A.2d 401. Here, Marilyn\u2019s and James\u2019s testimony about the continued association of Lipari with defendants\u2019 business in the minds of some of their customers gave defendants a reason to help Lipari fight potential convictions that would harm their reputation and induce some customers to stop doing business with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">In answer to interrogatories on the verdict sheet, the jury found that the \u201cleading object or main purpose\u201d of the promise to pay Lipari\u2019s legal bills was to benefit defendants and \u201cwas of little or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>no benefit to\u201d Lipari. We must defer to the jury\u2019s judgment, and not substitute our own unless it \u201cclearly appears that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-1; <em>see Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 6-7, 258 A.2d 706 (1969). We find no miscarriage of justice to warrant our interference. The trial judge properly denied defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Defendants also claim that their failure to adopt a corporate resolution renders the guarantee ineffective. Further, defendants urge that the guarantee was void for lack of consideration because neither they nor Lipari received a new benefit for the guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">We disagree with these contentions. Initially, we note that defendants failed to raise these contentions below and we need not address them on appeal. <em>See Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973). Even if we do address them, it is clear that the corporation laws require a resolution for a guarantee only if the guarantee has no apparent business purpose: \u201cA corporation may give a guaranty <em>not in furtherance of its direct or indirect business interests </em>only when authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of all of the votes cast by the holders of each class and series of shares entitled to vote thereon.\u201d N.J.S.A 14A:3-3(1) (emphasis added). While the guaranty must be supported by consideration, the benefit to the guarantor\u2019s business need only be slight, even when the guarantee is a \u201cmere promise to pay an antecedent debt of another.\u201d <em>Great Falls Bank v. Pardo, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 400-01, 622 A.2d 1353 (Ch.Div.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542, 642 A.2d 1037 (App.Div.1994); <em>see also Ross v. Realty Abstract, </em>50 <em>N.J.Super. </em>147, 153-54, 141 A.2d 319 (App.Div.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Here, defendants\u2019 guaranty was accompanied by plaintiffs agreement to provide legal service. The jury\u2019s finding that defendants\u2019 leading object in issuing the guarantees was their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>business interest resolves both of defendants\u2019 claims. That finding led to a conclusion that defendants had had a self-protection interest in guaranteeing the payment of Lipari\u2019s legal bills, because of their good will associated with Lipari. That interest was the consideration. In addition, defendants do not contest that plaintiff represented defendants in producing documents or preparing their officers, James and Marilyn, for grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We turn now to defendants argument that the verdicts on two jury questions, rendered by votes of six jurors to two were invalid. Defendants contend that the New Jersey Constitution requires a verdict to be rendered by five-sixths of the jury, and that the constitutional infirmity of a verdict rendered by only three-fourths of the jury is cognizable as plain error. Plaintiff claims that defendants agreed to accept a jury vote of six to two in \u201can unrecorded general discussion\u201d in which the court recommended that the parties let the two alternate jurors deliberate and accept verdicts reached by a vote of at least six jurors. Defendants dispute this and insist that what transpired was in fact no more than a failure to object on the part of defendants\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Our Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate; but the Legislature shall authorize the trial of civil causes by a jury of six persons. The Legislature may provide that in any civil cause a verdict may be rendered by not less than five-sixths of the jury.\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, U 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">A civil jury \u201cshall consist of six persons unless the court for good cause shown shall order a jury of 12 persons,\u201d <em>R. </em>1:8 \u2014 2(b), but it may also consist of \u201csuch other number as may be stipulated to.\u201d 12. l:8-2(d). Such a jury may render its verdict \u201cby five-sixths of the jurors unless the parties stipulate that a verdict or finding by a smaller majority of the jurors shall be taken as the verdict or finding of the jury.\u201d <em>R. </em>l:8-2(c). The Legislature has similarly provided that \u201cat least five-sixths of the jurors shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>render the verdict unless the parties stipulate that a smaller majority of jurors may render the verdict.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B.-23-17 (effective June 5, 1995). The statutes do not prohibit a civil jury of more than six members; they allow the court to empanel more than six, and compel the dismissal of jurors only when more than the \u201cprescribed\u201d number are still sitting at the end of the court\u2019s charge. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:23-3 (effective June 5,1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Recently, we explained that our constitution and rules do not mandate in all instances a verdict by five-sixths vote, but allow the parties to accept a verdict rendered by a lesser percentage; <em>Petrolia v. Estate of Nova, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>585, 589-90, 666 A.2d 163 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>516, 673 A.2d 276 (1996). We noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">Although the constitutional and statutory provisions guaranteeing a jury trial require a minimum jury of six persons in a civil case, the parties may stipulate to proceed with less than the minimum number or more than the minimum number, <em>R. </em>l:8-2(d), and may even agree to have the ease decided by a smaller majority of the jurors than five-sixths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 590, 666 A.2d 163.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">In the charge to the jury, the trial judge reviewed the questions that were asked of the jury. He instructed that on each question there must be six votes. The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">I want to know folks on that whether your vote is six to two, seven to one, or eight to zero. For it to be a valid vote I need at least six of you, but it can be any six. So for question one you could have the first six, for question two you could have the middle six of you, for question three you could have the last six of you. So I don\u2019t care where I get the six, but I need at least six of you for each vote____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">At the conclusion of the charge, the judge asked counsel if they had any objections. Both plaintiffs counsel and defendants\u2019 counsel responded that they had none, inferentially agreeing with the above statement. Furthermore, the transcript of the hearing on defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial reveals that defendant failed to raise as a point of error the jury vote. We deem this to be confirmatory of the parties\u2019 intentions at the time of trial and jury deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Unlike the typical instance of \u201cplain error\u201d exception to <em>Rule </em>2:10-2, defendants\u2019 acquiescence or inaction itself obviously led the court to believe that its openly-communicated recommendation as to the eight-person jury vote and its jury charge on that subject was agreeable. If the defendants had an objection to the procedure used, that objection should have been made known to the judge prior to jury deliberations. The judge could readily have reduced the jury to six persons, or altered the vote instruction. Under these circumstances, we do not agree with defendants\u2019 belated objection. To do so would condone a tactic of inducing error, awaiting the outcome, and then raising the issue on appeal when the outcome is unfavorable. We find no plain error to justify reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In so ruling, we recommend that an agreement to have a case decided by less than five-sixths of a jury panel be specifically articulated upon the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\"> Defendant Joseph Lipari did not appeal the judgment against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
