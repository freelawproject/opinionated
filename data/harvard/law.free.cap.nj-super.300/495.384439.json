The trial court\u2019s opinion is reported at 291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 677 A.2d 824 (Law Div.1996). Defendant\u2019s primary contention is that <em>N.J.SA </em>39:5-3, which provides for issuance of a summons within 30 days for a violation of Title 39 offenses, bars his conviction under the circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Here is how the issue arises. On August 20, 1994, defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50, and issued summons 101749. Because, however, he provided the police with someone else\u2019s identification and did not advise the police of his true identity, the summons was issued in the name of the other person. There is no dispute, however, that defendant received the summons on that date and knew that the charge was against him. On the return court date, August 30, 1994, defendant failed to appear and a notice was sent to the individual whose identity defendant had used. When that person appeared on the second court date, September 13, 1994, the arresting officer realized he was not the defendant and the summons was dismissed. After defendant\u2019s real identity was finally determined, a new summons was issued on October 5,1994. It is defendant\u2019s position that, because this summons was issued more than 30 days after the infraction, it is barred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Judge Conte concluded that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5-3 did establish a period of limitation for the issuance of a summons under Title 39. But he rejected defendant\u2019s claim that the charge against him was time-barred. In doing so, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">[D]efendant\u2019s argument that the summonses should be dismissed ... fails since the defendant was issued a summons at the scene of the violation on August 20,1994, albeit in the wrong name. The fact that the summons was issued in the name of Michael Ottomanelli does not change the fact that defendant was personally issued process thereby giving him sufficient notice of the violation so that he was not forced to defend a stale claim. Therefore, process was issued within thirty days of the occurrence as directed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5-3 and defendant\u2019s convictions for <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50 and 39:3-39c must not be reversed on statute of limitations grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">[291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 496, 677 A.2d 824.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">We agree with this rationale. <em>And see State v. Sirvent, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>279, 289-90, 686 A.2d 1202 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Judge Conte also concluded that <em>R. </em>3:23-8(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> would authorize the amendment of the original summons to substitute defendant\u2019s name, notwithstanding its dismissal. 291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>498-99, 677 A.2d 824. Indeed, he concluded that \u201cthe Superior Court on appeal from the municipal court conviction has a duty to amend the original complaint pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:23-8(c)----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 677 A.2d 824. We have substantial question as to the application of <em>R. </em>3:23-8(c) to resurrect a dismissed summons. In this respect, we believe the judge\u2019s reliance upon <em>State v. Henry, </em>56 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 151 A.2d 412 (App.Div.1959), is misplaced. That case concerned the use of <em>R. </em>3:23-8(c) to amend a viable existing summons more than 30 days after its issuance. Simply put, the initial summons here had been dismissed. We do not read <em>Henry </em>to permit amendments to a previously dismissed summons. Most assuredly, we did not there hold that a Superior Court judge <em>must </em>amend a dismissed summons and specifically disapprove the <em>dicta </em>to that effect in the judge\u2019s opinion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-11\"> In pertinent part, <em>R. </em>3:23-8(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The appeal shall operate as a waiver of all defects in the record including any defect in, or the absence of, any process or charge laid in the complaint, and as a consent that the court may, during or before the hearing of the appeal, amend the complaint by making the charge more specific, definite or certain, or in any other manner____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-16\"><em>See also R. </em>7:10-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
