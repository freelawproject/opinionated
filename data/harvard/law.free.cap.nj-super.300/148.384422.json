At the time of the alleged slander, plaintiff Thomas J. Biondi was Chairman of the New Jersey Board of Examiners of Master Plumbers (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Board). Defendant Antoine Nassimos regularly attended the Board\u2019s public meetings, apparently acting as a liaison between the New Jersey Society of Professional Energy and Environmental Contractors (NJSPEEC) and the Board. On September 23, 1993, Nassimos attended a public meeting at which the Board announced a decision that Joseph Fichner, Jr., a licensed master plumber and member of the NJSPEEC, had committed various acts of occupational misconduct, fraud and misrepresentation. See <em>In re Fichner, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>459, 462-65, 677 A.2d 201 (1996). Based on these violations, the Board ordered Fichner to pay substantial fines and to make restitution to various customers, and also imposed \u201can inactive five year suspension\u201d of his license. Later in the meeting when the public was given the opportunity to speak, Nassimos charged the Board with improperly releasing information about its decision in the <em>Fichner </em>matter prior to taking official action. Nassimos also charged that it was improper for plaintiff, as a member of the Board, to be affiliated with the New Jersey Association of Plumbing, Heating &amp; Cooling Contractors. According to plaintiff, Nassimos then said \u201cwords to the effect of: T have information that the Chairman, Mr. Biondi, has mob connections and that if I don\u2019t stop complaining against him and the Board, he will order a hit on me.\u2019 \u201d In response, plaintiff said to Nassimos: \u201cI think you\u2019ve overstepped your bounds. I might have to consult an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">On November 3, 1993, plaintiff filed this action against Nassimos and the NJSPEEC. Plaintiffs complaint alleged that Nassimos\u2019 statement that plaintiff \u201chas mob connections\u201d and would \u201corder a hit\u201d on him was \u201cintended by Mr. Nassimos and were understood by the listeners to indicate and designate someone as a member of organized crime, as the perpetrator of uncounted serious crimes, as one who makes his living through a life of crime, as one who directs others to commit crimes, ... and as one who is involved in crimes including, but not limited to murder, extortion, gambling and bribery of public officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>After the trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, a trial was commenced before a jury. However, the trial court declared a mistrial shortly before the close of plaintiffs case. Prior to the second trial, defendants renewed their motion for summary judgment. At oral argument on the motion, plaintiffs counsel conceded that he did not have any \u201cspecial damages\u201d and was \u201cstuck with a slander per se case.\u201d This time the court granted defendants\u2019 motion, concluding that a statement that a person has \u201cconnections with [the] mafia\u201d does not constitute an allegation of criminal activity and therefore does not constitute slander <em>per se. </em>Plaintiff appeals from the summary judgment dismissing his complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">At the outset, we note that the issue presented in this appeal is not whether Nassimos\u2019 statements that plaintiff has \u201cmob connections\u201d and may \u201corder a hit\u201d upon him are defamatory but rather whether they constitute \u201cslander <em>per se.\u201d </em>We have no doubt that a jury could find these statements to be defamatory, that is, as \u201ctending] so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.\u201d <em>Ward v. Zelikovsky, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>516, 529, 643 A.2d 972 (1994) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 559 (1977)); <em>see Bufalino v. Associated Press, </em>692 F.2d 266, 269 (2nd Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>1111, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2463, 77 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>1340 (1983); <em>Clemente v. Espinosa, </em>749 <em>F.Supp. </em>672, 677 (E.D.Pa.1990); <em>Privitera v. Town of Phelps, </em>79 <em>A.D.2d </em>1, 435 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>402, 405-06, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>53 N.Y.2d 796 (1981). In fact, it is possible that such statements could be found to be defamatory per <em>se, </em>that is, to so clearly denigrate a person\u2019s reputation that a court could decide that the statements are defamatory without submitting the issue to the jury. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Lawrence v. Bauer Publ'g &amp; Printing Ltd., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>451, 458-60, 446 A.2d 469, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>999, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>358, 74 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>395 (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">However, plaintiff cannot prevail merely by showing that Nassimos\u2019 statements were defamatory because he has not offered any evidence of the type of damages generally required to establish a cause of action for slander. To establish a slander claim under the common law, a plaintiff is required to show \u201cspecial damages,\u201d which is defined as \u201charm of a material or pecuniary nature.\u201d <em>Ward v. Zelikovsky, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 643 A.2d 972. Plaintiff admittedly has no evidence that he suffered such \u201cspecial damages\u201d as a result of Nassimos\u2019 statements. Moreover, even if our Supreme Court were prepared to modify the common law rule requiring special damages to establish a cause of action for slander by allowing a plaintiff in a slander action, as in most libel actions, see <em>Sisler v. Gannett Co., Inc., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>256, 281, 516 A.2d 1083 (1986), to prove any form of actual damage to reputation, either pecuniary or non-pecuniary, see David A. Anderson, <em>Reputation, Compensation and Proof, </em>25 <em>Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. </em>747, 749 (1984); Rodney A. Smolla, <em>Law of Defamation </em>\u00a7 7.08 (1986), plaintiff presented no evidence that he suffered any damage to his reputation as a result of Nassimos\u2019 outburst at the Board meeting. Plaintiff testified at his deposition that when he attended a meeting of the New Jersey Association of Plumbing, Heating and Cooling Contractors, other members referred to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>as \u201cDon Thomasso\u201d and \u201cGodfather,\u201d asked whether they had to \u201ckiss [his] ring,\u201d and insisted that he sit at the head of the table. However, plaintiff did not show the kind of damage to reputation ordinarily required to establish a cause of action for defamation, because he did not present evidence that anyone had refused to associate with him or that any of his business or personal relationships had been \u201cseriously disrupted.\u201d <em>Sisler v. Gannett Co., Inc., supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 516 A.2d 1088; <em>see also Ward v. Zelikovsky, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 542, 643 A.2d 972. Therefore, his claim is maintainable only if Nassimos\u2019 statements constituted slander <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The slander <em>per se </em>doctrine is limited to defamatory statements which impute to another person (1) a criminal offense; (2) a loathsome disease; (3) conduct, characteristics or a condition that is incompatible with his business, trade or office; or (4) serious sexual misconduct. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 570-574 (1977); <em>see Gnapinsky v. Goldyn, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>243, 250, 128 A.2d 697 (1957). If a defamatory statement constitutes slander <em>per se, </em>a plaintiff may establish a cause of action not only without proving \u201cspecial damages,\u201d that is, damages of a pecuniary nature, but without proving any form of actual damage to reputation. <em>Ward v. Zelikovsky, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 540-41, 643 A.2d 972. This is sometimes referred to as the \u201cpresumed damages\u201d doctrine. <em>Sisler v. Gannett Co., Inc., supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 516 A.2d 1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The slander <em>per se </em>doctrine has been severely criticized by scholarly commentators, who recommend the elimination of both, the \u201cpresumed damages\u201d rule applicable to slander <em>per se </em>cases and the \u201cspecial damages\u201d rule applicable to all other slander cases. Anderson, <em>supra, </em>25 <em>Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. </em>at 749, 774-78; Smolla, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.08. The commentators conclude that these archaic common law rules should be replaced by a single uniform rule that a plaintiff must prove actual damage to reputation, either pecuniary or non-pecuniary, to establish any cause of action for defamation. One commentator states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>[The] legitimate purpose [of defamation law is] compensating individuals for injury to reputation. Requiring proof of harm would reduce defamation to this purpose. The actual injury rule would bring defamation into line with the rest of tort law, which does not purport to punish wrongdoing or regulate activity in the absence of injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">[Anderson, <em>supra, 25 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. </em>at 774.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"><em>See also </em>2 Fowler V. Harper et al., <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 5.14 at 116 (2d ed.1986); <em>Prosser on Torts, supra, </em>\u00a7 112 at 797 (5th ed.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Our Supreme Court has taken note of these scholarly criticisms of the slander <em>per se </em>doctrine but deferred consideration of its elimination to \u201canother time\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">Commentators discourage the continued existence of slander <em>per se </em>categories and specifically disagree with the rule that parties need prove no special damages for those types of slander. Requiring proof of special damages requires a plaintiff to demonstrate harm to reputation from an alleged defamatory statement. The trend of modem tort law is to focus on the injury not the wrong and the slander <em>per se </em>categories are a relic from tort law\u2019s previous age. Because the goal of defamation law should be to \u201ccompensat[e] individuals for harm to reputation,\u201d the trend should be toward elimination not expansion of the <em>per se </em>categories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">We leave for another time whether we should eliminate slander <em>per se. </em>Today we decide only that we will not expand the four slander <em>per se </em>categories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">[Ward <em>v. Zelikovsky, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 541, 643 A.2d 972 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Therefore, even though the slander <em>per se </em>doctrine continues to be a part of New Jersey\u2019s law of defamation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court\u2019s characterization of the doctrine as \u201ca relic from tort law\u2019s previous age\u201d and its conclusion that \u201cthe trend should be toward elimination ... of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the <em>per se </em>categories,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>suggests that lower courts should invoke the slander <em>per se </em>doctrine only in cases where it clearly applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Plaintiff argues that Nassimos\u2019 statements that he has \u201cmob connections\u201d and would \u201corder a hit\u201d upon Nassimos unless Nassimos stopped complaining about plaintiff and the Board constituted slander <em>per se </em>because they implied that he had committed a crime. The Restatement of Torts describes this category of slander <em>per se </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">One who publishes a slander that imputes to another conduct constituting a criminal offense is subject to liability to the other without proof of special harm if the offense imputed is of a type which, if committed in the place of publication, would be</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">(a) punishable by imprisonment in a state or federal institution, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">(b) regarded by public opinion as involving moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\"><em>[Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 571 (1977).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">However, it does not constitute slander <em>per se </em>\u201cto suggest that another is capable of committing a crime\u201d or \u201cto charge another with a criminal intention or design, if no criminal act is charged.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 571 cmt. c (1977). .</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">We are satisfied that a statement that a person has \u201cmob connections\u201d does not constitute an assertion that he has committed a crime. It is not uncommon for the mass media to report that an entertainer or other celebrity has \u201cmob ties\u201d or \u201cmob connections.\u201d The ordinary understanding of such a story is not that the celebrity himself has committed crimes but rather that he associates with criminals. Consequently, even though a statement that a person has \u201cmob connections\u201d may be defamatory, it is not slander <em>per se </em>because it does not allege the commission of a crime. <em>See Privitera v. Town of Phelps, supra, </em>485 N.Y.S.2d at 404-05; <em>contra Clemente v. Espinosa, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">Nassimos\u2019 further alleged comment that he had information plaintiff would \u201corder a hit on me\u201d if Nassimos did not \u201cstop complaining against him and the Board\u201d is not slander <em>per se </em>because it merely alleges plaintiff\u2019s intention to commit a crime sometime in the future rather than a past criminal act. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 571 emt. c. Although plaintiff argues that this comment implied that he was a member of an ongoing criminal enterprise because only such a person could \u201corder a hit,\u201d we believe that such a comment could be just as easily construed to mean that plaintiff would ask his \u201cmob connections\u201d to kill Nassimos as a favor or in exchange for the payment of money. <em>Cf. Nunez v. A-T Fin. Info., Inc., </em>957 <em>F.Supp. </em>438, 441 (S.D.N.Y.1997) (\u201cIn assessing a claim of slander <em>per se, </em>... [ijnnuendo is not available to enlarge the meaning of the statement beyond the significance expressed by the words themselves.\u201d). The circumstance that Nassimos\u2019 comment was uttered in the midst of a heated personal attack upon plaintiff, as Chairman of the Board, for allegedly leaking information about a decision in a pending disciplinary matter, reduces the possibility that the audience reasonably could have understood Nassimos was asserting that plaintiff had committed a crime. <em>Cf. Ward v. Zelikovsky, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 532, 643 A.2d 972 (\u201cIf the comment occurred during an argument or is an outburst unrelated to the general topic of discussion, ... a reasonable listener is less likely to accord to the challenged statement its literal meaning.\u201d). In view of the disfavor with which the slander <em>per se </em>doctrine is currently held, courts should not permit speculative inferences regarding the possible meaning of an alleged defamatory statement to support a verdict in favor of a plaintiff who is unable to show any actual damage to his reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The NJSPEEC filed a cross claim for indemnification against Nassimos, a counterclaim against plaintiff, and a third party complaint against the Board, improperly designated as the \"Department of Consumer Affairs.\" However, these claims have all been dismissed, so the summary judgment in favor of defendants constitutes a final judgment which is appealable as of right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\"> We note that confusion is sometimes caused by the fact that the term \u201cper se\u201d is used in connection with two quite distinct concepts in the law of defamation. The term \u201cdefamation per se\u201d refers to a statement whose defamatory meaning is so dear on its face that the court is not required to submit the issue to the jury. <em>Lawrence v. Bauer Publ'g &amp; Printing, Ltd., supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 459, 446 A.2d 469. On the other hand, \u201cslander per se,\u201d the doctrine involved in this appeal, refers to four categories of slander which are considered so clearly damaging to reputation that a plaintiff may establish a cause of action without presenting any evidence of actual damage to reputation. <em>Ward v. Zelikovsky, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 643 A.2d 972; <em>see generally, </em>Rodney A. Smolla, <em>Law of Defamation </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7.04, 7.06[2] (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b185-12\"> Missouri and Kansas have eliminated slander <em>per se </em>and the corollary \u201cpresumed damages\u201d rule. Consequently, these states now require a showing of actual damage to reputation to establish any cause of action for defamation. <em>Nazeri </em>v. <em>Missouri Valley College, </em>860 S.W.2d 303, 308-10, 312-13 (Mo.1993); <em>Zoeller v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em>17 <em>Kan.App.2d </em>223, 834 P.2d 391 (1992); <em>see also Walker </em>v. <em>Grand Cent. Sanitation Inc., </em>430 <em>Pa.Super. 236, </em>634 A.2d 237, 242-44 (1993), <em>appeal denied, </em>539 <em>Pa. </em>652, 651 A.2d 539 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-13\">We also note that the First Amendment precludes an award of presumed damages for a defamatory statement involving an \u201cissue of public concern.\u201d <em>See Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., </em>472 <em>U.S. </em>749, 757-61, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2939, 2944-46, 86 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>593, 601-04 (1985); <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 <em>U.S. </em>323, 348-50, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2997, 3011-12, 41 L.Ed.2d 789, 810-11 (1974). However, defendants have not argued that Nassimos' statements about plaintiff involved any \u201cissue of public concern.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
