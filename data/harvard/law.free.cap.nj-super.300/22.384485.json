Live-In Companions assigned Kenneth Mack to attend to Ailon in Maria\u2019s absence. While Maria was away, Mack abandoned Ailon and stole several items from her home. Plaintiffs brought this action against Live-In Companions, its owner and director, Bonnie Oechsle, and her husband, Joseph Oechsle, seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, conversion and invasion of privacy. At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, the trial court dismissed all of Ailon\u2019s claims and all of the claims against Joseph Oechsle. The trial court also dismissed Maria\u2019s claim for breach of contract and her demand for punitive damages. At the close of all the evidence, the trial court dismissed Maria\u2019s remaining claims for negligent hiring and consumer fraud. Judgment was entered accordingly. Plaintiffs appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Plaintiffs were married in 1947. Early in the marriage, Ailon suffered a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, leaving him totally disabled and in need of \u201caround-the-clock\u201d care.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In September 1993, Maria retained Live-In Companions to care for Ailon during her absence while on a trip. In her discussions with Bonnie Oechsle, Maria emphasized the nature and extent of Ailon\u2019s needs. Maria stressed that she was looking for someone who was \u201cvery reliable\u201d to feed, bathe and attend to the personal needs of her husband and to administer the appropriate medication for his heart and for preventing seizures. Bonnie responded that Maria could \u201cdepend\u201d on Live-In Companions because of the high quality of its employees. Maria also had received a brochure from Live-In Companions which represented that its \u201creliable employees\u201d would \u201cassist with washing, dressing and helping individuals as needed\u201d and would \u201cprovide friendship [and] someone to talk to and be there\u201d when the primary care-giver could not. The brochure also contained the representation that \u201c[a]ll employees [were] supervised and a close relationship [was] maintained between [the] employees, clients, client\u2019s families, and [Live-In Companion\u2019s] administration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">On the day of Maria\u2019s trip, Live-In Companions assigned Kenneth Mack to care for Ailon. Bonnie had hired Mack in May 1993, based upon the recommendation of one of Live-In Companion\u2019s trusted employees. Although Mack had represented on his application for employment that he had not been convicted of a \u201cfelony\u201d in the last seven years, he had a formidable record of criminal and disorderly persons convictions for offenses ranging from possession and distribution of cocaine to shoplifting, trespassing, and receiving stolen property. In response to questions propounded in the application, Mack had indicated that he did not have a driver\u2019s license. It was Bonnie\u2019s practice to \u201cpre-screen\u201d applicants by conversing with them on the telephone and to conduct pre-hiring interviews. No further investigation was generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>undertaken. Bonnie stressed that she would not have hired Mack had she known of his checkered history.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">While Maria was away, Mack abandoned Ailon and stole various items, including Maria\u2019s automobile. Fortunately, family members quickly discovered the problem, but both Maria and Ailon claimed that they were emotionally traumatized by the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">On appeal, plaintiffs advance a plethora of arguments attacking the Law Division\u2019s pretrial and trial decisions. For the purpose of clarity, we do not treat these claims chronologically. Instead, we first address plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the trial court erred by dismissing their claims for consumer fraud and negligent hiring. We find merit in these contentions and reverse and remand for a new trial on these counts. We reject the remainder of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Initially, we consider plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the trial court erroneously dismissed their claim of consumer fraud. The trial court granted an involuntary dismissal because it viewed Bonnie\u2019s statements and the representations made in the Live-In Companion brochure as mere \u201cpuffery.\u201d We disagree with this conclusion and reinstate plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">We begin our analysis with the operative language of the Consumer Fraud Act <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-8 to -48). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-11\">The act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice, deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or the knowing, concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or real estate, or with the subsequent performance of such person as aforesaid ... is declared to be an unlawful practice;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">Under the Act, the word \u201cmerchandise\u201d includes \u201cservices ... offered, directly or indirectly to the public for sale.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The statutory language is to be liberally construed in favor of consumers. <em>Cox v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. 2, </em>15, 647 A.2d 454 (1994); <em>Barry v. Arrow Pontiac, Inc., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>57, 69, 494 A.2d 804 (1985); <em>Levin v.

The legislative objective was to protect the public from sharp practices and dealings in the marketing of real estate, goods, and services. <em>Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 533, 672 A.2d 1190 (App.Div.), <em>leave to appeal granted, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>64, 679 A.2d 652 (1996). Toward that end, the Act was broadly designed to protect the consumer, even when the merchant acts in good faith. <em>D\u2019Ercole Sales, Inc. v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>11, 23, 501 A.2d 990 (App.Div.1985); <em>Skeer v. E.M.K. Motors, Inc., </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>465, 470, 455 A.2d 508 (App.Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The necessary predicate to application of the Act is the commission of \u201cany unconscionable commercial practice.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8\u20142; <em>see also Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 533, 672 A.2d 1190.

Where, as here, the representation is affirmative, the Act permits recovery of the consumer\u2019s loss and imposition of treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees, <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:8-1(a), \u201cwithout any showing of an intent to deceive or even negligence\u201d on the part of the defendant. <em>Ibid.; see also Strawn v. Canuso, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>43, 60, 657 A.2d 420 (1995); <em>Cox v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 17-18, 647 A.2d 454; <em>Chattin v. Cape May Greene, Inc., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>520, 522, 591 A.2d 943 (1991) (Stein, J. concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">We do not regard the statements contained in the brochure or those made by Bonnie as \u201cexaggerated elaim[s] of quality,\u201d <em>Miller v. American Family Publishers, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 81, 663 A.2d 643 (Ch.Div.1995), or as \u201cunactionable [declarations] of opinion,\u201d <em>Byrne v.

Anderson Remodeling Co., </em>253 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>655, 191 <em>III.Dec. </em>699, 702-04, 624 N.E.2d 887, 890-92 (1993), <em>appeal denied, </em>155 <em>Ill.2d </em>561, 198 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>540, 633 <em>N.E.2d </em>2 (1994); <em>see also Totz v. Continental Du Page Acura, </em>236 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>891, 177 <em>Ill.Dec. 202, </em>211, 602 <em>N.E.2d </em>1374, 1383 (1992). In reaching this conclusion, we point to Maria\u2019s statements to Bonnie in which she explicated Ailon\u2019s substantial needs, and Bonnie\u2019s strong assurances that such needs would be met. Viewed as a whole and taken in context, the statements respecting the reliability of Live-In Companion\u2019s employees and the quality of services to be provided could reasonably have been perceived as declarations of fact. <em>See R. </em>4:37 \u2014 2(b). The trial court erred by granting defendants\u2019 motion for a dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, <em>see Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5-6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969), we also find that the trial court erred by dismissing the claim for negligent hiring. An employer who negligently hires or retains in his employ an individual who is incompetent or unfit for the job \u201cmay be liable to a third party whose injury was proximately caused by the employer\u2019s\u201d failure to exercise due care. <em>Di Cosala v. Kay, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>159, 170, 450 A.2d 508 (1982). \u201cThe reasoning that has impelled the recognition of this cause of action ... follows from tort principles of negligence and foreseeability as well as from firmly established [rules] of agency and vicarious liability.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The existence of this tort is not confined within the narrow principles of <em>respondeat superior. Id. </em>at 172, 450 A.2d 508. The claim of negligent hiring addresses a different wrong than that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>sought to be redressed by the application of principal-agent principles. <em>Ibid. </em>The tort of negligent hiring focuses instead upon the risk created by exposing members of the public to a potentially dangerous individual. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, \u201cthe scope of employment limitation on liability which is a part of the <em>respondeat superior </em>doctrine is not implicit in the wrong of negligent hiring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172-73, 450 A.2d 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">It has been said that '\u201c[o]ne dealing with the public is bound to use reasonable care to select employees competent and fit for the work assigned to them and to refrain from retaining the services of an unfit employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172, 450 A.2d 508 (quoting <em>Fleming v. Bronfin, </em>80 A.2d 915, 917 (D.C.Mun.App.1951)). \u201cAccordingly, the negligent hiring theory has been used to impose liability in cases where the employee commits an intentional tort, an action almost invariably outside the scope of employment, against the customer ... where the employer either knew or should have known that the employee was violent or aggressive, or that the employee might engage in injurious conduct toward third persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 450 A.2d 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The cause of action thus has two fundamental requisites. The first involves the knowledge of the employer that the employee is dangerous or otherwise unfit for the assigned task. An employer will be held liable only where he \u201cknew or had reason to know of the particular unfitness, incompetence or dangerous attributes of the employee and could reasonably have foreseen that such [characteristics] created a risk of harm to other persons.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The second requisite is that, \u201cthrough the neigligence of the employer in hiring the employee, the latter\u2019s incompetence, unfitness or dangerous characteristics proximately caused the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174, 450 A.2d 508. Applying these principles, we conclude that plaintiff presented a <em>prima facie </em>ease of negligent hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">A reasonable trier of fact could have concluded from the evidence that defendants failed to exercise due care in hiring Mack. Of course, \u201c[fjoresight, not hindsight, is the standard by which one\u2019s duty of care is to be judged.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Usdin Louis Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>525, 529, 591 A.2d 959 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Hill v. Yashin, 75 N.J. </em>139, 144, 380 A.2d 1107 (1977)), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>386, 599 A.2d 163 (1991). We also acknowledge that at the time Mack was hired, his criminal record was not accessible to defendants. Although the parties have devoted much time and effort presenting their respective positions on the subject, it is reasonably clear that prior to its amendment on July 1, 1994, <em>see L. </em>1994, c. 60, \u00a7 4, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>53:1-20.6(a) authorized the Superintendent of State Police to adopt rules and regulations pertaining to \u201ccriminal history background checks,\u201d <em>see L. </em>1985, c. 69, \u00a7 2, and pursuant to that authority, the Superintendent promulgated <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:59-1.1, <em>see </em>17 <em>N.J.R. </em>2282 (Sept. 16, 1985), barring non-governmental agencies from having access to such information. Although Executive Order No. 9, issued by then Governor Hughes in 1963, permitted \u201cany person ... demonstrating] a legitimate reason\u201d to examine criminal investigation records, <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:59-1.1 apparently restricted access to governmental agencies. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 argument, Executive Order No. 123, issued by then Governor Kean in 1985, did not allow nongovernmental agencies to have access to records of criminal convictions. It merely allowed the dissemination of information pertaining to a person\u2019s arrest. Piercing the maze of seemingly conflicting statutes, orders and regulations on the subject, we tend to agree with defendants\u2019 contention that records of criminal convictions were not accessible to the general public at the time of Mack\u2019s hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">More problematical is the question whether defendants could have obtained copies of the disorderly persons complaints of shoplifting that had been filed against Mack at the time he was hired. Rule 1:38 provides that \u201c[a]ll records ... required by statute or rule to be made, maintained or kept on file by any court, office or official within the judicial branch of government shall be deemed a public record and shall be available for public inspection and copying____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>53:1-15 provides that persons arrested for shoplifting must be fingerprinted, and copies of the relevant documents, together with photographs, other required descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>tions, and a history of the offense must be forwarded to the State Bureau of Investigation. However, the statute does not indicate whether such information is available to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Also problematical is the question whether defendants could have obtained information about Mack\u2019s drug convictions from the Division of Motor Vehicles. Mack\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended because of his convictions for possession and distribution of cocaine. All records of the Division of Motor Vehicles are public records \u201cavailable for examination by the citizens of New Jersey.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:18-11.3(a); <em>see also N.J.A.C. </em>13:18-11.4(b)(1). However, no evidence was presented indicating whether or not those records contain information concerning drug convictions, and, if so, whether such information was accessible to the general public at the time that Mack was hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Putting aside these issues, we are persuaded that a jury question was presented whether defendants made adequate inquiry into Mack\u2019s background before hiring him. Liability of an employer is not to be predicated solely upon failure to investigate the criminal history of an applicant. <em>See Ponticas v. K.M.S. Invs., </em>331 <em>N.W.2d </em>907, 909 (Minn.1983). The totality of the circumstances surrounding the hiring must be considered in determining whether the employer exercised due care. <em>Ibid.; compare Search EDP, Inc. v. American Home Assurance Co., </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>537, 632 A.2d 286 (App.Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>466, 640 A.2d 848 (1994), <em>with Sandvik, Inc. v. Statewide Sec. Sys., </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>272, 469 A.2d 955 (App.Div.1983), <em>certif. denied, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>296, 475 A.2d 590 (1984). Whatever else might be said, a jury could reasonably conclude that defendants\u2019 pre-hiring investigation of Mack was deficient in light of the critical nature of the work performed by employees of Live-In Companions. It is certainly arguable that \u201c[i]f an employer wishes to give an employee the indicia of authority to enter into the living quarters of others, it has the responsibility of first making some inquiry with respect to whether it is safe to do so.\u201d <em>Tallahassee Furniture Co. v. Harrison, </em>583 So.2d 744, 751 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1991) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Williams v. Feather Sound, Inc., </em>386 So.2d 1238, 1240 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1980), <em>review denied, </em>392 So.2d 1374 (Fla.1981)), <em>review denied, </em>595 So.2d 558 (Fla.1992). Such an argument is particularly compelling in this case because the customers of Live-In Companions were commonly helpless and ripe for abuse. In these circumstances, the trier of fact reasonably could find that the sketchy and meager application form was wholly insufficient to yield adequate information pertaining to the applicant\u2019s background, criminal history and experience. The jury also could reasonably find that a proper investigation would have disclosed Mack\u2019s propensity to violate the law and his general lack of fitness to perform the considerable responsibilities required of Live-In Companion\u2019s employees. We conclude that a jury question was presented and that the trial court erred by dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">As we noted earlier, the trial court dismissed all of Ailon\u2019s claims. We agree that Ailon was not the direct victim of the consumer fraud. The misrepresentations were made to Maria to induce her to enter the agreement with defendants. However, Maria arguably was acting as Ailon\u2019s agent. Although Maria entered into the contract with defendants, Ailon was the party who was actually injured by the alleged fraud. We thus reinstate Ailon\u2019s claim for consumer fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We also reinstate Ailon\u2019s claim for negligent hiring. Maria retained the services of Live-In Companions. However, defendants\u2019 alleged negligence proximately caused harm to Ailon who was the focus of the care-providing agreement. We believe that defendants\u2019 duty of care was owed to both Maria and Ailon. Whether a duty exists \u201cis ultimately a question of fairness.\u201d <em>Goldberg v. Housing Auth. of Newark, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>578, 583, 186 A.2d 291 (1962). \u201cWhen the court determines that a duty exists and liability will be extended, it draws judicial lines based on fairness and policy.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Gwinnell, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>538, 544, 476 A.2d 1219 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>(1984). \u201cNegligence is tested by whether the reasonably prudent person at the time and place should recognize and foresee an unreasonable risk or likelihood of harm or danger to others.\u201d <em>Rappaport v. Nichols, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>188, 201, 156 A.2d 1 (1959). A tortfeasor is generally held answerable for the injuries which result in the course of events from his negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 203,156 A.2d 1. We perceive no sound basis for excepting Ailon\u2019s claim from that general principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We are sensitive to the potential for duplicative recovery of damages. However, we are satisfied that carefully crafted jury instructions can obviate that danger. We thus reverse the trial court\u2019s involuntary dismissal of Ailon\u2019s claims for consumer fraud and negligent hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments. Initially, we find no merit in plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment dismissing their cause of action for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Negligent infliction of emotional distress consists of \u201cnegligent conduct that is the proximate cause of emotional distress in a person to whom the actor owes a legal duty to exercise reasonable care.\u201d <em>Decker v. Princeton Packet, Inc., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>418, 429, 561 A.2d 1122 (1989). Intentional infliction of emotional distress consists of \u201cextreme and outrageous conduct [which] intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another.\u201d <em>Buckley v. Trenton Sav. Fund Soc\u2019y, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>355, 366, 544 A.2d 857 (1988) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 46 (1965)). Our Supreme Court has said that \u201c[t]he severity of the emotional distress raises questions of both law and fact,\u201d and that the trial judge \u201cdecides whether as a matter of law such emotional distress can be found, and the jury decides whether it has in fact been proved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 544 A.2d 857; <em>accord Decker v. Princeton Packet, Inc., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 430, 561 A.2d 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>We agree with the trial court that plaintiffs did not show the severity of emotional harm required to underpin a cognizable claim. <em>See Trisuzzi v. Tabatchnik, </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 26, 666 A.2d 543 (App.Div.1995). While both plaintiffs were \u201cacutely upset\u201d by reason of the incident, their emotional distress was not \u201csufficiently substantial to result in physical illness or serious psychological sequelae.\u201d <em>Eyrich v. Dam, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 253, 473 A.2d 539 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>583, 483 A.2d 127 (1984); <em>see also Gautam v. De Luca, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 399, 521 A.2d 1343 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>39, 532 A.2d 1107 (1987). We add for the sake of completeness that the conclusions reached by plaintiffs\u2019 expert were properly excluded as \u201cnet opinions.\u201d <em>See Saunderlin v. E.I. DuPont Co., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>402, 416-17, 508 A.2d 1095 (1986). The witness\u2019s bare conclusions were wholly unsupported by factual evidence. <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 524, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981); <em>Dawson v. Bunker Hill Plaza Assocs., </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>309, 323-25, 673 A.2d 847 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>569, 683 A.2d 1164 (1996); <em>Jimenez v. GNOC, Corp., </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>533, 540-43, 670 A.2d 24 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>374, 678 A.2d 714 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We also find no error in the trial court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claim for invasion of privacy. \u201c[0]ne who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of privacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Figured v. Paralegal Technical Servs., Inc., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>251, 256, 555 A.2d 663 (App.Div.1989) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 652B (1977)), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>666, 583 A.2d 350 (1990). Here, plaintiffs invited Mack into their home. No evidence was presented supporting the claim of an unlawful intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Equally without merit is plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the trial court erred by dismissing their claim for conversion. Mack\u2019s theft of plaintiffs\u2019 property was not within the scope of his employment. In any event, the loss associated with Mack\u2019s unlawful taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>constitutes one of the elements of damages included in plaintiffs\u2019 claim for negligent hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the trial court erroneously dismissed their claim for breach of contract. Our examination of the record discloses that plaintiffs acquiesced in the dismissal of their contract claim. We thus decline to consider the issue. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indent. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">We are entirely unpersuaded by plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Joseph Oechsle was improperly dismissed as a defendant. Joseph was neither a founder, director, president nor moving force of Live-In Companions. He was named vice-president, secretary and treasurer of the corporation \u201con paper\u201d when the business was incorporated, but he remained largely inactive. Moreover, no evidence .was presented indicating that Joseph took part in any of the activities leading to the hiring or assignment of Mack. There was absolutely no basis to hold Joseph liable for either negligent hiring or consumer fraud. The trial court was correct in dismissing the claims against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Finally, we conclude that the trial court was correct in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claim for punitive damages. \u201cTo warrant a punitive award, the defendant\u2019s conduct must have been wantonly reckless- or malicious.\u201d <em>Nappe v. Anschelewitz, Barr, Ansell &amp; Bonello, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>37, 49, 477 A.2d 1224 (1984). As phrased by our Supreme Court, \u201c[t]here must be an intentional wrongdoing in the sense of an \u2018evil-minded act\u2019 or an act accompanied by wanton and willful disregard of the rights of another.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although defendants might have been negligent in hiring Mack, there is no evidence that their conduct was reckless. <em>See, e.g., Enright v. Lubow, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58, 76, 493 A.2d 1288 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>376, 517 A.2d 386 (1986), <em>reconsidered and aff'd, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>306, 521 A.2d 1300 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>193, 528 A.2d 19 (1987). Nor was there any evidence that defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations were made with malice or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>in a reckless fashion. We discern no basis to disturb the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The judgment of the Law Division is affirmed in part and reversed in part. The matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
