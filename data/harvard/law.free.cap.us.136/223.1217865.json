The assignment statute is remedial in its nature and intended to prevent preferences, as the statute of fraudulent conveyances is aimed at frauds, and both' must be liberally construed, in the very nature of things, in order to accomplish the purposes for which they were enacted.

S. 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The determination of these questions is governed by the law of Missouri, where the deed of trust Was made, and the parties to it .resided. In ascertaining the construction and effect of section 351 of the Eevised Statutes of the State of 1879, which is supposed to affect the case, it is important to bear in mind the law of Missouri- as it existed before those statutes were enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The Supreme Court of Missouri in 1852, speaking by Mr. Justice Gamble, said: \u201cIt is not necessary to quote books for the purpose.of showing that a debtor in failing circumstances may give a preference to one or- more of his creditors to the exclusion of others; and that such disposition of his effects is not impeachable on the ground of fraud, because it embraces all his property;\u201d and accordingly upheld assignments by insolvent debtors of all their property to 'pay particular creditors. <em>Cason </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>15 Missouri, 378, 381; <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>16 Missouri, 596, 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>It was also well settled by the decisions of that court, that each partner, by virtue of the relation of partnership, and of the community of right and interest of the partners, had full power and authority to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of all personal property belonging to the partnership, for any purpose within the \u25a0 scope of the partnership business, and might therefore, without the concurrence of his copartners, mortgage the partnership property by deed of trust, to secure the payment of a partnership debt; <em>Clark </em>v. Rives, 33 Missouri, 579; <em>Keck </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>58 Missouri, 532; although one partner, without the concurrence of his copartners, could not delegate to a stranger the right of the partnership to administer the partnership effects, and therefore could not make a general assignment of all the property of the partnership for distribution by the assignee among the partnership creditors, retaining no equity of redemption in the partnership. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>5 Missouri, 463; <em>Hook </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>34 Missouri, 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The statutes of Missouri restricting voluntary assignments have always been construed rather strictly by the Supreme Court of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">By the earliest statute upon the subject, \u201cin all cases in which any person shall make a voluntary assignment of his lands, tenements, goods, chattels, effects and credits, or any part thereof, to any person, in trust for his creditors or any of them, it shall be the duty of the assignee \u201d to file an inventory of the assigned property in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court of the county in which the assignee resides. Missouri Rev. Stat. of 1845, c. 10, \u00a7 1; reenacting Act of February 15, 1841, \u00a7 1, Missouri Laws of 1840-41, p. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">. In the Revised Statutes of 1855, c. 8, \u00a7 1, that section was reenacted, and at the end of the chapter this section was added: \u201c \u00a7 39. Every provision in any assignment, hereaft\u00e9r made in this State, providing for the payment of one debt or liability in preference to another, shall be void; and all debts and liabilities, within the provisions of the assignment, shall be paid <em>pro rata </em>from the assets thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The Supreme Court of Missouri repeatedly and uniformly held that, taking those two sections together, \u00a7 39 only pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>hibited preferences among the creditors designated- in an assignment, either of the whole or of part of the debtor\u2019s property, but did not invalidate partial assignments for the benefit of some of the creditors of the assignor, and was so far inefficient to prevent preferences among creditors; and the court observed: \u201cIf the legislature wish to strike at the root of the evil, they must go back to an old principle of the common law, which permits a debtor to prefer one creditor to another, and which privilege can be effected in a variety of modes other than those referred to in our statutes concerning assignments.\u201d <em>Shapleigh </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>26 Missouri, 322, 326; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>McAllister, </em>30 Missouri, 327; <em>Many </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>31 Missouri, 91; <em>State </em>v. <em>Benoist, </em>37 Missouri, 500, 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">An act of February 13, 1864, repealed \u00a7 39 of the act of 1855, and enacted that \u201c every assignment hereafter made in this, State,\u201d under the provisions of the act of 1855, \u201c shall be for the benefit of all creditors who shall present and prove up their claims under the provisions of said act, and all debt's and liabilities so proved and allowed shall be paid <em>pro rata </em>from the assets thereof.\u201d Act of February 13, 1864, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9,-. Missouri Laws of 1863-64, p. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In 1865 this provision was reenacted in this form : \u201c Every voluntary assignment of lands, tenements, goods, chattels, effects and credits made by a debtor to any person in trust for his creditors shall.be for the benefit of all the creditors of the assignor, in proportion to their respective claims.\u201d Glen. Stat. of 1865,-c. 112, \u00a7 1; 1 \"Wagner\u2019s Stat. (3d ed.) 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In 1878 the construction and effect of this provision were drawn in judgment before the Supreme Court of Missouri in <em>Crow </em>v. <em>Beardsley, </em>68 Missouri, 435, where a debtor had conveyed his* stock of merchandise by a deed of trust, in no respect differing from the one now before us, to secure the payment of certain of his creditors. - It was contended that the provision of the. statute, just quoted, avoided all conveyances of property which gave a preference among creditors. But it was held that.while that provision had a wider- scope than \u00a7 39 of the act of 1855, and was designed to prevent any preference of -creditors -by assignment,\u201d yet it did not avoid deeds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>trust, in the nature of mortgages, which were only,securities for, the payment of debts. The court clearly pointed out the distinction between assignments and deeds of trust in the nature of mortgages, saying: \u201c An assignment is more than a security for the payment of debts; it is an absolute' appropriation of property to their payment.\u201d \u201c The distinction is that an assignment is a conveyance to a trustee for the purpose of raising funds to pay a debt, while a deed of trust in the nature of a mortgage is a conveyance in trust for the purpose of securing a debt, subject to a condition of defeasance. The deed in question heye is, therefore, a deed of trust in the \u25a0 nature' of \u00e1 mortgage\u201d\u2019 68 Missouri, 437,438. Upon these reasons it was adjudged that the deed was not within the statute concerning assignments, and could not be avoided by. a creditor not named in it, except for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The section there construed was afterwards reenacted, in the same words, in \u00a7 35\u00a3 of the Revised Statutes of 1879, which were the statutes in force when the deed of trust, in this case was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The only embarrassment in the present case has been occasioned by the course of decision in the Circuit Court of the United States within the State of Missouri, originating in a case decided in 1882 by an opinion of Judge Krekel with the concurrence of Judge McCrary. <em>Martin </em>v. Hausman, 14 Fed. Rep. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In that case, the debtors assigned and transferred their whole stock in trade by a deed which declared that ,it' was made to secure certain debts therein mentioned, but directed, the'assignee to proceed at once to sell,the property, and out df the proceeds to pay the' debts as they matured, and provided that after they had been fully paid \u201c this deed shall be released,\u201d and reserved no right of redemption to the assignors.- Upon a review of the decisions of the Supreme Court of. Missouri, and especially <em>Shapleigh </em>v. <em>Baird, State </em>v. <em>Benoist </em>and <em>Crow </em>v. Beardsley, above cited, it was held that-,', as the deed did not purport to be a security for a debt, leaving an equity of redemption in the grantors, and empowering the trustee to sell only if the-debts specified should , not be paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>at maturity, but conveyed the property absolutely to the trustee, to be sold for the payment of the debts' named and-preferred in it, it was not a mortgage security, but an assign-, ment for the -benefit of creditors; and Judge Krekel. laid down this general rule: \u201c A debtor in Missouri, under its legislation and adjudications thereon, may, though he be insolvent at the time, prefer-one or more of his creditors by securing them; but he cannot do it by an instrument conveying the whole of his property to pay one or more creditors. Instruments of the latter class will be-- construed as falling .within the assignment laws, and as for \u25a0 the benefit of all creditors, whether named in the assignment Or not.\u201d 14 Fed. Rep. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The rule thus laid- down has since been followed by the same and other judges in the Federal courts within the - State of Missouri, and has be\u00e9n extended (in disregard of the adjudication of the Supreme Court of. the State in <em>Crow </em>v. <em>Beardsley) </em>so as to hold a deed of trust, in the nature of a mortgage, of all the personal property of the debtor, to be a voluntary assignment, within the meaning and effect of the Missouri-statute. <em>Dahlman </em>v. Jacobs, 16 Fed. Rep. 614 ; <em>Kellog </em>v. Richardson, 19 Fed. Rep. 70; <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Dittman, </em>21 Fed. Rep. 15; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Corby, </em>21 Fed. Rep. 737; <em>Kerbs </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>22 Fed. Rep. 693; <em>Freund </em>v. <em>Yaegerman, </em>26 Fed. Rep. 812, and 27 Fed. Rep. 248; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>21 Fed. Rep. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">That rule, as thus -construed and applied, has not, however, .always been approved in the Circuit Court. In <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Dittmam,, </em>above cited, Mr. Justice Brewer, then Circuit-Judge, confessed .that, if it were a new question, his own conclusion would- be different, and in harmony with the decisions in <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>3 C. E. Green, 13, 28 ; <em>Farwell </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>26 Iowa, 381; <em>Doremus </em>v. <em>O\u2019Hara, </em>1 Ohio St. 45; <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>1 Ohio St. 237, and other cases; and declared that he should follow, th\u00e9 rule, as having been established by the course of the decisions in the courts of the United States within the State of Missouri, until there should be some authoritative construction of the statute by the Supreme Court\u201cof the United States, qr by the Supreme .Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>of the State. 21 Fed. Rep. 17. See also <em>Perry </em>v. Corby, 21 Fed. Rep. 737 ; <em>Freund </em>v. Yaegerman, 27 Fed. Rep. 248; <em>Elgin Co. </em>v. Meyer, 30 Fed. Rep. 659; <em>Weil </em>v. Polack, 30 Fed. Rep. 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The decision in <em>Crow </em>v. <em>Beardsley </em>has always been treated in all the courts of the State as settling the law of Missouri upon the subject. It has been followed by the St. Louis Court of Appeals in <em>Holt </em>v. Simmons, 16 Mo. App. 97, and by the Kansas City Court of Appeals in <em>Sampson </em>v. Shaw, 19 Mo. App. 274, and in <em>Smith &amp; Keating Co. </em>v. Thurman, 29 Mo. App. 186 ; and ft has been approved and acted' on by the Supreme Court of Missouri in a very recent case, in which the court, after repeating and enforcing the reasoning upon which <em>Crow </em>v. <em>Beardsley </em>proceeded, said: \u201c The assignment law of Missouri is not, in letter or spirit, a bankrupt or insolvent debtor\u2019s act. A debtor, whether solvent or insolvent, may, in good faith, sell, deliver in payment, mortgage or pledge the whole or any part of his property for the benefit of one or more of his creditors, to the exclusion of others, even though such transfer may have the effect of delaying them in the col-, lection of their debts. Its terms in no way qualify the rule by which the character of this instrument is to be determined. Eeading the instrument then as a whole, in the light of the circumstances, under which it was executed, was it intended as a security, or as an. absolute unconditional conveyance, <em>in prcesenti, </em>to the grantee of all the grantor\u2019s interest in the property, both legal and equitable, to the exclusion of any equitable right of redemption.?\u201d And it was accordingly, .adjudged that the assignment law was inapplicable to a deed of trust, conveying all the debtor\u2019s property, real and personal, (except his homestead and household furniture, and a horse and buggy,) to a trustee in trust to secure the payment of part of his debts for which he was liable either as principal or as surety,' which appeared to the court, upon a view of all its provisions as applied to the facts of the case, to be \u201cnot an absolute indefeasible assignment of all the grantor\u2019s title, both legal and equitable, in the property \u2018in trust for his creditors; \u2019 but .a deed of trust to secure the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ment of debts and other liabilities, in which the grantor has an interest in the property conveyed;\u201d for the protection of which \u201cequity gives him a right of redemption,-though no clause of defeasance was inserted in the deed.\u201d <em>Hargadine </em>v. Henderson, 97 Missouri, 375, 386, 387, 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\">The question of the construction and effect of a statute of a State, regulating assignments for the benefit of creditors, is a question upon which the decisions of the highest-court of the State, establishing a rule of property, are of controlling authority in the courts of the United States. <em>Brashear </em>v. <em>West, </em>7 Pet. 608, 615; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>17 Wall. 351; <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Fulton, </em>91 U. S. 479, 485; <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>2 Black, 532, 534; <em>Jaffray </em>v. <em>McGehee, </em>107 U. S. 361, 365; <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Bain, </em>133 U. S. 670, 686; <em>Randolph's Executor </em>v. <em>Quidnick Co., </em>135 U. S. 457. The' decision in <em>White </em>v. <em>Cotzhausen, </em>129 U. S. 329, construing a similar statute of Illinois in accordance with the decisions of the Supreme Court of that State as understood by this court, has therefore no bearing upon the case at bar. The fact that similar statutes are allowed different effects in different States is immaterial. \u25a0 As observed by Mr. Justice Field, speaking for this court, \u201c The interpretation within the jurisdiction of one State becomes a part' of the law of that State,.as much so as if incorporated into the body of it by the legislature. If, therefore, different interpretations are given in different States to a similar local law, that law in effect becomes by the interpretations, so far as it is a rule for our action, a different- law in one State from what it is in the other.\u201d <em>Christy </em>v. <em>Pridgeon, </em>4 Wall. 196, 203. See also <em>Detroit </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>135 U. S. 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">In the present case, there can be no doubt that the deed of trust, conveying the personal property of the partnership to secure the payment of its debts therein named, and reserving in the clearest terms a right of redemption to the grantors, by providing that if they shall pay those debts the deed shall be void, as well as by authorizing the trustee to sell the property only in case of their failing to pay those debts or any part thereof for five days after they become .-p\u00e1yable, was, according to the settled course of- decision ,in the courts of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>of Missouri, a mortgage -only, and not an assignment under the statute relied on; and therefore, according to the decisions in Missouri, cited at the beginning of this opinion, (no fraud being proved or suggested,) an instrument which one partner had the inherent authority to bind the partnership by, \u25a0although his copartners did not join in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The deed of trust, executed by. and with the consent of two of the three partners, being a valid mortgage, and not an assignment, within the meaning of the statute, the fact that the third partner had authorized his copartners to execute an assignment, which was never executed, cannot affect the validity or the. operation of the deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Nor did the simultaneous appointment of a receiver of the partnership property at the suit of one of the' partners alter the nature of the' deed of trust, or transform it into a voluntary assignment, within' the meaning of the statute of Missouri, as construed by the Supreme Court of the State. A receiver derives his authority from the act of the court appointing him, and ..not from the act of the parties at whose suggestion or by whose consent he is appointed; and the utmost effect of his appointment is to put the property from that time into his custody as an officer of the court, for the benefit of the party ultimately proved to be entitled, but not \u2022to change the title, or even the fight of possession, in the \u25a0property. <em>Skip </em>v. <em>Harwood, </em>3 Atk. 564; <em>Anon. </em>2 Atk. 15; <em>Wiswall </em>v. Sampson, 14 How. 52, 65; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Boston, Hartford </em>&amp; <em>Erie Railroad, </em>107 Mass. 1, 28; <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>67 Missouri, 315; <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>11 Mo. App. 275, 281. And in the present case, the three banks have claimed and received payment of the full amount of their debts from Stewart, as trustee under the mortgage, and not as receiver under the appointment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The necessary conclusion is, that each of the questions \u25a0certified must be answered in the negative, and that the decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the bill must be'</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u2019 The Chief Justice, having been of Qounsel, and Me.
