The interest which Columbus Thaw took in the real estate under his father\u2019s will during the life of his mother was a remainder in fee after the termination of her life, and was not an estate in possession until after the death of his mother.

The Maryland act of 1798, c. 101, sub-chapter 12, provides, in \u00a7 6, that every guardian appointed by the court having the care of real estate, shall, within three months after executing his bond, procure the said estate to be viewed and reported on by two skilful, discreet persons, not related to either party, and appointed by the orphans\u2019 court, who shall- take an oath to appraise the same .without favor or prejudice, and shall estimate the annual value thereof, and set down what improvements, etc., are on the land, and their condition, etc., and shall make a -certificate of all they have done, and the same shall be returned by the guardian to the orphans\u2019 court within three months.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-9\">Section 7 provides that \u201c No guardian shall commit waste on the land; but the court may, on his application, allow him to cut down and sell wood and account for the sa.me, in case it shall deem the same advantageous or necessary for the ward\u2019s education and maintenance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-10\">Section 8 provides- that the guardian shall either cultivate or lease such real estate, or may with the court\u2019s approbation, undertake the estate on his own account and be answerable for .the annual value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-11\">Section '9 provides that the guardian shall account for all profit and increase of the estate, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Section 10 is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-4\">\u201c And once in each year, or oftener if required, a guardian shall settle an account of his trust with the orphans\u2019 court; and the said court shall ascertain, at discretion, the amount of the sum to be annually expended in the maintenance and education of the orphan, regard being had to the future situation, prospects and destination of the ward; and the s\u00e1id pourt, if it shall deem it advantageous to the ward, may allow the guardian to exceed the income of the estate, and'to make use of his principal, and to sell part of the same, under its order: Provided, nevertheless, That no part of the real estate shall, on account of such maintenance or education, bo diminished without the approbation of the Court of Chancery or General Court, as well as of the orphan\u2019s court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-5\">This\u2018proviso is claimed by the counsel for the .defendant to confer upon the orphans\u2019 court plenary power, upon the <em>ex parte </em>petition of the guardian, without bill or citation of any kind to the infant, to pass a decree for the sale of his real estate upon an <em>ex parte </em>ratification of the decree by the late Circuit Court, and this in the face of the express provision in the same act establishing the orphans\u2019 court, \u201c that the said orphans\u2019 court shall not, under any pretext of incidental power, or constructive authority, exercise any jurisdiction whatever not expressly given by this or some other law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-6\">We deny the correctness of this interpretation. Looking at the specific and guarded provisions of that act to protect the rights of an infant in respect to his personalty and to his slightest interest in the realty, such as the cutting and selling wood therefrom, or its careless cultivation even, it is beyond reason and belief that the same legislative body should, in the same act, have intended to confer upon the orphans\u2019 court, to which it positively prohibited the exercise of any incidental or constructive jurisdiction, authority to sell the infant\u2019s realty, including' timber and improvements, without the slightest direction as to the manner of sale or the proceedings by which the same was to be effected. \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-7\">The authority, if any, must be expressly conferred. Where are the words found which give any such express grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>power ? The \u2022 brief proviso, negative in its terms, <em>\u201c </em>that no part of the real estate shall, on account of such maintenance and education, be <em>diminished </em>without the approbation of the Court of Chancery or General Court,- as well as of the orphans\u2019 court,\u201d is the sole expression in the law upon which our opponents rely as the grant of such power. The words-<em>sell </em>or <em>sold </em>do not occur in it. If it was intended to confer the power to <em>sell </em>real estate it would have said so, as nothing was to be taken by implication. The acts of Congress of 1843, 5 Stat. 621, c. 87, and 1856, 11 Stat. 118, c. 163 (Rev. Stat. D. O. \u00a7\u00a7 968, 973), relating to the sale of real estate of infants, etc., explicitly treat the proceeds of such sale as real estate standing in the place of that which was sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-5\">In the Maryland system of jurisprudence at that time there was no necessity to confer such power upon the orphans\u2019 court, nor could any exigency arise wherein the interest of infants could demand its exercise ;\u25a0 for whenever there was a proper occasion for the sale of the realty, the guardian could procure such sale through the more guarded and appropriate proceedings of a Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-6\">The courts of Maryland have-maintained the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of that State, independent of statute, to decree the sale of an infant\u2019s real estate upon a proper showing, and through proper proceedings. In <em>Corrie's Case, </em>2 Bland, 488, Chancellor Bland says it has always been admitted that the Chancellor of Maryland was invested with all the powers in relation to infants with which the Chancellor of England had been clothed. To the same effect are <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>11 G. &amp; J. 87; <em>Downin </em>v. <em>Sprecher, </em>35 Maryland, 474; <em>Long </em>v. <em>Long, </em>62 Maryland, 33; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Peabody Heights Co., </em>65 Maryland, 388.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-7\">The office of that proviso was this; <em>after </em>a sale through a Court of Chancery, to authorize the application of the proceeds of the sale, by the concurrent action of the Court of Chancery and the orphans\u2019 court, to such maintenance and education. \u25a0 In this way the act supplied a seeming defect in the then existing law whenever a case should arise where the infant\u2019s personal estate was insufficient for his support and education <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>but the instances are- numerous which- show with what caution the realty was allowed to be encroached upon, -especially as its possession was a qualification to vote or to hold office; - and until the act of 1785, c. 80, \u00a7 9, authorized the guardian to apply a tenth part of his ward\u2019s personal estate, annually, for his education, no part of the principal of the personalty could be so used. ' The orphans\u2019 courts were generally presided over by laymen presumably unqualified to supervise, especially without specific statutory directions, \u2019 the often complicated proceedings, as practised in a Court of Chancery, for the sale of real estate and the protection of all the rights and interests involved. There are numerous Maryland decisions showing how jealously the orphans\u2019 court was excluded from control over, or interference with, real estate. <em>Stewart </em>v. Patterson, 8 Gill, 46; <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Burch, </em>9 Gill, 79.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-4\">It is argued, in avoidance of the fact that the practice pursued in this case was never adopte'd in Maryland, that after the organization of the courts in the District of Columbia they were not bound to follow the Maryland courts in their construction of the act in question. We do not deny that the District judiciary , is independent of that of Maryland. We only maintain that the adjudications and practice in the State where the act was originally passed, and where it remained in force, certainly until 1816, and from which it was, in 1801, adopted as the law of this District, are most persuasive, if not conclusive, arguments in favor of the construction which they have placed upon the act. <em>Metropolitan, Railroad </em>v. Moore, 121 U. S. 558.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-5\">We deem it wholly irrelevant to the argument what may have been the opinion or practice upon this question in any other jurisdiction than that of Maryland, as the only point in the argument is to shed light upon the intention of the legislative body which passed, the act under consideration, and that intention must be judged by the occasion supposed then and there to exist for- its passage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-6\">Before closing this point of our argument we would call attention to section 16 of sub-chapter 12 of the act of 1798, which provides that \u201cnothing in this act contained shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>construed to affect the general superintending power exercised by the Court of Chancery with respect- to trusts.\u201d As will appear when we come to comment upon the will of Joseph Thaw, the estate with which the orphans\u2019 court attempted to deal in this case, was a trust estate during the life of Mr. Thaw, and therefore came within the inhibition above quoted.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-5\">II. As to the effect of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1843, entitled \u201cAn act-to provide in certain -cases for the sale of real estate of infants within the District of Columbia.\u201d 5 Stat. 621, c. 87; incorporated in Rev. Stat. D. C. \u00a7 957. This act was passed more than a year before the proceedings were instituted by Mrs. Thaw which resulted in the alleged sale, and about four years before the sale is supposed to have taken place, no date of sale anywhere appearing. It was in full force at that time, and we confidently claim that it superseded . any authority that can possibly be held to have been granted by the act of 1798 to the orphans\u2019 court to decree the sale of the real estate in question, and furnished the course of proceeding necessary to be pursued to accomplish that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-6\">There is no exigency .supposed to be provided for by the former act that is not included in the later one, which is broader in its scope, more definite in its provisions and ample in every way to accomplish, by a better and safer method, everything that can possibly be contemplated by the former. On well-settled principles of statutory construction, the former law, so far as it related to the subject-matter covered by the latter, was superseded and repealed by it. <em>United States </em>v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88 ; <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>97 U. S. 46.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-7\">A similar act was passed in Maryland in 1816, and amended by act of 1818 providing for the sale of a part or the whole of an infant\u2019s real, estate through the guarded proceedings of a Court of Chancery whenever it shall appear to the court, after hearing and examination, etc., \u201c that it will be for the interest and advantage of the infant\u201d to sell the same, and proceedings for the .sale of infant\u2019s realty in that State have ever since been required\u2019 by its courts to conform to the provisions of that law, though, like the act -.of 1843, it contains no repealing clause, and its title is to authorize the sale in \u201c cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>therein mentioned,\u201d as that of the act of 1843 is to authorize it in \u201c certain cases.\u201d <em>Hunter </em>v. Hatten, 4 Gill, 115 ; <em>S. C. </em>45 Am. Dec. 117; <em>Williams\u2019s Case, </em>3 Bland\u2019s Ch. 186, 203, 204.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-4\">In closing. this point we will add that the practice in this District has now come into conformity with what we claim to he the only practice for the sale of an infant\u2019s reffi estate which has any legal warrant, as is shown by the list of cases filed by us and made part of the record and by a' comparison of the numbers and dates of those cases with- those of the list filed by the defendant; and we do not think that a practising attorney would now ask, or the court grant, an order of sale upon proceedings similar to those pursued in this case; yet what is the law now, in that respect, was the law in 1844 and 1848, when the proceedings relied upon by the defendant were instituted and prosecuted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-5\">III. Whatever construction may be placed upon the acts of 1798 and 1843, we contend that the record totally fails to show jurisdictional facts sufficient to empower the orphans\u2019 court to divest the plaintiff in error, then an infant, of his interest in the property in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-6\">The proceedings in the orphans\u2019 court and in the Circuit Court of the District consist only of brief docket entries and of the certified copy of a petition in the former court by Mrs. Thaw, not even describing herself as guardian, with a decree thereon, exhibited in the Circuit Court, and there, without any other pleadings or parties, summarily approved. \u25a0 The record of these doings is meagre, informal and deficient. We are well aware that, in courts whose jurisdiction is not questioned, such deficiencies are overlooked and often \u00e1upplied by intendment and presumption. The authorities quoted to show what great informalities in such cases.are disregarded! we do not answer, because we do not dispute them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-7\">But we claim that the orphans\u2019 court, at the time of these proceedings, was an \u2022 \u201c inferior court,\u201d in that sense which required everything -necessary to give jurisdiction to be shown in its record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-8\">If is expressly made so by the act establishing it, which provides that \u201c the said orphans\u2019 court shall not, under pretext of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>incidental power, or constructive authority, exercise any jurisdiction whatever not expressly given by this or some other law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-5\">\u25a0Among the numerous decisions showing with what strictness this principle has been enforced, we cite the fqjllowing: <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Burch, </em>6 H. &amp; J. 67; <em>Townshend </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>9 Gill, 90; <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Ogle, </em>4 Maryland Ch. 425; <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>6 Maryland, 347; <em>Yeaton </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>5 Pet. 224, 230.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-6\">Referring back to the provisions of the act of 1798, as given under point I of this brief, we see with what specific safeguards the real estate of an infant is surrounded' by sections 6, 7, 8 and 9. Then when we come to section 10, under which the alleged sale in this case is claimed to have been made, we find these safeguards still further maintained. Down to the <em>proviso, </em>for which'such potency is claimed, this section is one single provision of the law, the several parts of which are 'Separated only by commas and semicolons \u2014 in fact, it is one single sentence of which all the clauses are interdependent. It would seem necessary, therefore, that the court should have the account required of the guardian, if not the report of the appraisers as per section 6, in order to know the condition of the estate and to determine the annual sum to be expended for' the orphan. The language of the statute makes this a <em>condition precedent, </em>and surely it is only a reasonable condition for the sale of an orphan\u2019s realty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-7\">The proviso which immediately follows and qualifies the provisions of the act of 1798 commented on above has been construed to authorize the extraordinary proceedings shown in this case, that is to say, a simple petition by Mrs. Thaw, the guardian, though not stating that she is or acts as such, in the orphans\u2019 court, and a decree thereon; and a certified copy of this petition and decree exhibited in the Circuit Court and there approved summariljq <em>ex, parte, </em>eventuating in the docket entry in the chancery rules No. 4, case No. 344, of date October 4, 1844. This is the whole case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-8\">We deny the validity of this interpretation of the law of 1798. The jurisdictional facts must appear on the face of the proceedings; the judgment of a court without jurisdiction is void, and its proceedings must be in accordance with the funda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>mental and. well-established principles of practice. Especially is this so of courts of limited jurisdiction, as we have shown abov\u00e9. <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Burdick, </em>1 Hill, 130; <em>S. C. </em>37 Am. Dec. 299; <em>Thatcher </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>6 Wheat. 119; <em>Eliott </em>v. <em>Peirsol, </em>1 Pet. 328; <em>Bank of the United States </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>8 Pet. 128 ; <em>Shriver\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>2 How. 43; <em>Hickey\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>3 How. 750 ; <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>8 How. 495 ; <em>Windsor </em>v. <em>Mc Veigh, </em>93 U. S. 274.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-5\">IY. As to the interests of the infants in the property at the time of the alleged sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-6\">By the will of Joseph Thaw the widow was invested with a life estate \u201c <em>in trust </em>for the equal benefit and maintenance of herself and of her daughter Columbia and of her son Columbus.\u201d In the same clause it was provided that if either or both the children should die before the mother, she should hold the property, <em>during her natural life, in trust, </em>for the equal benefit of herself and the surviving child, and in case of the death of both children then \u201cfor her own sole use and benefit.\u201d This part of the will is explicit in creating a life estate only, and in raising a <em>trust </em>of that estate for the benefit of all three as long as the mother should live.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-7\">Now, at the time of Mrs. Thaw\u2019s application to the orphans\u2019 court in 1844, this trust estate for her life was in existence, separate and distinct from the remainder in fee. If the property was sold under the decree of that court this trust was included and disposed of by Mrs. Thaw\u2019s :deed. But if any thing in this case be certain and undeniable, it is that the orphans\u2019 court was wholly without any jurisdiction over trust estates. Maryland act of 1798, c. 101, sub-ch. 12, sec. 16. We think this point decisive of the whole case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-8\">That clause of the will which gives to the two children, and to their heirs and assigns, all the estate real, and personal, that shall remain after the death of the mother, would undoubtedly have given the children a <em>vested </em>remainder in fee, if that had been all. But this clause is followed by another, which says, \u201cif both of my said children shall die before their mother, then, on .the demise of the last survivor of them, I give and bequeath to my beloved wife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Eliza, to her heirs and assigns forever, for her own proper benefit, all my estate of every description.\u201d Be it observed, that this last clause does not devise the property to the mother in the event of the children dying <em>without issue, </em>but simply on the condition of their dying before her. If both had married and had children and then died before the mother, we presume the last clause of the will would have prevailed, and the mother would have taken the estate. Did she not have an interest in remainder by virtue of this last clause giving the estate to her and her heirs, an event quite possible to happen? If the estate in remainder might take effect in her, it could not have been vested at the same time in the children. Powell on Devises, Y ol. I, 206, and Yol.

or he may, with the court\u2019s approbation, undertake the estate on his own account, and be answerable for the annual value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">By \u00a7 9, \u201cevery guardian shall account for all profit and in- - crease'of the estate, or annual value as aforesaid, and shall not be answerable for any loss or decrease sustained without his fault, to be allowed by the orphans\u2019 court.\u201d -</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Section 10 (upon the construction and effect of which this case turns) is as follows: \u201c And once in each year, or oftener if required, a guardian shall settle an account of his trust with the orphans\u2019 court; and the said court shall ascertain, at discretion, the amount of the sum to be annually expended in the maintenance and education of the orphan, regard being had to the future situation, prospects and destination of the ward; and the said court, if it shall deem it advantageous to the ward, may allow the guardian to exceed the income of the estate, and to make use of his principal, and to sell part of the same, under its order: provided, nevertheless, that no part of the real estate shall, on account of such maintenance or education, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>be diminished without the approbation of the Court of Chancery, or General Court, as well as of the orphans\u2019 court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">By \u00a7 11, \u201con the first account to be rendered by a guardian, he shall state the property by him received from an executor or administrator, or otherwise. belonging to his ward, and every increase, and the profits thence arising, if any.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">By \u00a7 12, \u201c in case the personal property of a ward shall consist of specific articles,\u201d \u201c the court, if it shall \u25a0 deem it advantageous for the ward, may at any time pass an order for the sale thereof for ready money, or on credit, the purchaser, with security, giving bond to the said ward, bearing interest.\u201d By \u00a7 13, \u201c every account of a guardian shall state his expenditures in maintaining and educating the ward, not exceeding the income of the estate, unless allowed by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">By \u00a7 15, on the ward\u2019s arrival at age, the guardian shall exhibit a final account to the orphans\u2019 court, and shall deliver up, agreeably to the court\u2019s order, to the ward, \u201c all the property of such ward in his hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">By \u00a7 16, \u201c nothing in this act contained shall be construed to affect the general superintending power exercised by the Court of Chancery with respect to trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">By \u00a7 20 of sub-chapter 15, it is declared that \u201cthe said orphans\u2019 court shall not, under pretext of incidental power or constructive authority, exercise any jurisdiction whatever not expressly given by this act, or some other law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">The statute of Maryland of 1798, by the terms of its final section, took effect on June 1, 1799, and was to continue in force until the end of the year 1801; and it was continued in force in the District of Columbia, and equity jurisdiction was vested in the- Circuit Court of the United States of the District, by the act of Congress of February 27, 1801, c. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5. 2 Stat. 105, 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">On consideration of \u00a7 10 of sub-chapter 12 of the statute of 1798, in connection with the other sections of that sub-chapter, and in the light of the previous law of Maryland upon the subject, we concur in the final conclusion of the court below, that the orphans\u2019 court, with the approval of the Circuit. Court of the United States of the District of Columbia sitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>in chancery, had power to order a sale of the real estate of infant wards for their maintenance and education.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">By the terms of that section, the orphans\u2019 court, upon settling the guardian\u2019s account annually or oftener, \u201c shall ascertain, at discretion, the amount of the sum to be annually-expended in the maintenance and education of the orphan, regard being had to the future situation, prospects and destination of the ward; and the said court, if it shall deem it advantageous to the ward, may allow the guardian to exceed the income of the estate and to make use of his principal, and to sell part of the same, under its order: provided, nevertheless, that no part of the real estate shall, on account of such maintenance or education, be diminished without the approbation of the Court of Chancery, or General Court, as well as of the orphans\u2019 court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The orphans\u2019 court is thus empowered to allow the guardian, for the suitable maintenance and education of the ward, to exceed \u201c the income of the estate,\u201d and-to use and sell part of the principal thereof. The words \u201cthe estate,\u201d in their natural and legal meaning, include the whole property of the ward in the guardian\u2019s hands ; and the words \u201c the property,\u201d \u201cthe estate\u201d and \u201cthe income of the estate\u201d are habitually and repeatedly used in that sense, both in other sections (\u00a7\u00a7 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15) of the same sub-chapter, and in the earlier statute of 1785, c. 80, \u00a7 9, as appears in the passages already quoted from each of those statutes. Wherever an authority to sell is intended to be limited to personal property, -it is so expressed, as in \u00a7 9 of the statutes of 1785, and in \u00a7 <em>12 of </em>the statute of 1798. Compared with the express restriction of the authority to sell any part of the principal to \u201cpersonal estate \u201d in the act of 1785, the omission of any such restriction in the act of 1798 strongly tends to show that it was purposely omitted in the latter act.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">This conclusion is confirmed by the-proviso \u201cthat no part of the real estate shall, on account of such maintenance or education, be diminished without the approbation of the Court of Chancery, or General Court, as well as of the orphans\u2019 court.\u201d As observed by Air. Justice Story, speaking for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>court, \u201c the office of a proviso, generally, is either to except something from the enacting clause, or to qualify or restrain its generality, or to exclude some possible ground of misinterpretation of it, as extending to cases not intended by the legislature to be brought within its purview.\u201d <em>Minis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>15 Pet. 423, 445. The insertion of this proviso, therefore, manifests the understanding and intention of the legislature that real estate was and should be included in the preceding general authority to order a sale of part \u201c of the estate,\u201d except so far as qualified by the proviso. Indeed, if that authority did not include real estate, the proviso would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The fiecessary construction of the whole section, including the proviso, appears to us .to be that express authority is thereby granted to the orphans\u2019 court to order a sale of any part of the ward\u2019s estate, real or personal, for his maintenance and education; but that, before any sale of real estate can be made for this purpose, the order of the orphans\u2019 court shall be approved by the Court of Chancery or the General Court. Whether the property to be sold for this purpose is personal or real, the application is to be made to the orphans\u2019 court, and the order granted by that court in the first instance. In the case of personal property, no action of any other court is required. In the case of real estate, the order of sale, after being passed by the orphans\u2019 court, must be presented to and approved by the Court of Chancery or the General Court; but no separate suit need be instituted in either of those courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">' This construction has prevailed in fihe courts of the State of Maryland, as well as in those of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In <em>Goltier\u2019s Case, </em>which is reported in 3 Bland, 200, note, and an authenticated copy of the proceedings in which has been filed in this case and sent up with the record, a petition presented in December, 1810, to the orphans\u2019 court of Cecil County in the State of Maryland, by a father and guardian, alleged that his infant children and wards had become entitled, in right of their mother, to one-ninth part of a grist mill and about one hundred and forty acres of land in that county, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>other owners of which, after consulting with the petitioner, had \u201c concluded that a sale of the said mill and lands would be highly^- advantageous to all the persons interested,\u201d and had contracted to sell them to one. Alexander Scott for the sum' of $6424.25, provided the petitioner should be able to convey his children\u2019s part; and that the petitioner believed that such a sale would \u201c much promote the interest and welfare of his said children, and enable him to educate and support them more to their advantage than if no such sale were to be made; \u201d and therefore prayed the orphans\u2019 court to \u201c order that he may be able to make the necessary conveyance.\u201d On December 12, 1810, the orphans\u2019 court, \u201c on due consideration of the allegations contained in the rvithin petition,\u201d was \u201c of opinion that the sale prayed for was to the advantage of \u201d the wards, \u201c and should be confirmed, and that the petitioner be authorized to make conveyance of that part of his wards\u2019 real estate.\u201d In the Court of Chancery, six days afterwards, Chancellor Kilty-signed a decree, which in the authenticated copy, quoted in 4 Mackey, 370, is stated as follows: \u201c Under power vested in this court by the act of 1798, c. 101, sub-ch. 12, \u00a7 7, the above order of the orphans\u2019 court is approved.\u201d This decree, as printed in. 3 Bland/ 200, note, differs only in substituting \u00a7 10 for \u00a7 7. That it was not made under the act of 1785, c. 72, \u00a7 12, is quite clear, because no partition was sought, as well as because the petition was addressed to the orphans\u2019 court, and not to the Court of Chancery, in the first instance. <em>Tilly </em>v. <em>Tilly, </em>2 Bland, 436, 438 and note. Both versions of the decree agree in stating that it was made under the power vested in the Court of Chancery by the act of 1798, c. 101,' sub-chapter 12; and \u00a7 7 of that sub-chapter concerns only the- cutting and sale of standing wood by authority of the orphans\u2019 court, without requiring the approval of any other court. The inference is irresistible, that the insertion of \u00a7 7 in the record of the decree was a clerical error, and that the decree was really made, as Chancellor Bland understood it to have been, under \u00a7 10, for the better support and education of the wards.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The Court of Appeals of Maryland, in 1828, decided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the value of buildings constructed on the land of a ward by direction of his guardian, and under order of the orphans\u2019 court, at an expense exceeding the income of his estate, real and personal, could not be recovered from the ward, because section 10 of the act of 1798 did not empower the orphans\u2019 court to order any part of the principal of the ward\u2019s estate to be applied to any other purpose than his support and maintenance. But the court added: \u201c\u2022 Should an application of the personal estate not suffice to maintain and educate suitably to the future destination of the ward, then such maintenance and education may also induce an application of a part of the real estate, with the approbation of the Court of Chancery or General Court, as well as the orphans\u2019, court.\u201d <em>Brodess </em>v. Thompson, 2 Harris &amp; Gill, 120, 126, 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Chancellor Bland, in a case decided in the same year, cited those two cases and expressed a similar opinion. <em>Williams's Case, </em>3 Bland, 186, 199, 200, 207. In 1841 the Court of Appeals said: \u201c According to our laws a guardian cannot encroach on the capital of his ward\u2019s estate without the order of the orphans\u2019 court, nor can the real estate be diminished but by the approbation of the Court of Chancery.\u201d <em>Hatton </em>v. <em>Weems, </em>12 Gill <em>&amp; </em>Johns. 83, 108. And it is admitted on all hands, that the Circuit Court of the United States of the District of Columbia, and its successor, the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, have always interpreted the section in question according to what -we now hold to be its true construction and effect. 5 Mackey, 213; 4 Mackey, 383, 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">It is argued for the plaintiff, that so much of the Maryland act of 1798 as concerned the sale of the real estate of infants has been repealed by the act of Congress of March 3, 1843, c. 87, entitled \u201c An act to provide in certain cases for the sale of the real estate of infa.nts- within the District of Columbia,\u201d by which it. is enacted that when \u201c the guardian of any infant shall think that the interest of his or her ward will be promoted by the sale of his or her real estate, or any part thereof, it shall be lawful for such guardian\u201d to bring a suit in equity in the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, in which the infant shall be made a party, and shall be represented by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>guardian <em>ad </em>litem,, and the facts alleged in the bill, whether admitted or not, shall be proved by disinterested witnesses, and the court, upon being satisfied that \u201c the interest of the infant manifestly requires the sale of his real, estate, or any part thereof,\u201d and that \u201cby such sale the rights of others will not be violated,\u201d may decree a sale, in which case the proceeds of the sale shall be invested and applied for the benefit of the infant, \u201c either in the purchase of real estate, or in such manner as the court shall think best,\u201d and upon his death shall descend as real estate. 5 Stat. 621, 622 ; Rev. 'Stat. <em>D. </em>C. \u00a7\u00a7 957-968.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">But this act contains no express repeal of the Maryland act of 1798 ; it does not mention the maintenance or education of infants, but authorizes the safe of their real estate whenever their interest' manifestly requires it; its chief purpose evidently is to authorize a change of investment; and it cannot be presumed to have been intended to take away the authority of the orphans\u2019 court, when discharging its appropriate duty of ascertaining the amount proper to be expended for an infant\u2019s maintenance and education, to order a sale of hi's real estate for this single object with the approval of the Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">There is nothing in the nature of the interest that these children took under the will of their father, which should prevent a sale of it under the statute of 1798, when necessary for their maintenance and education. That statute is not restricted to legal estates, or to estates in possession. The effect of. the testator\u2019s dispositions, though obscured by some confusion and superfluity of language, was to give the legal estate in all his land to his widow for life; the equitable and beneficial estate for her life to her and the two children, or the survivors of them, in equal shares; and the legal estate in remainder, after the death of the widow, to the two children, in fee; with two limitations over in fee, by way of executory devise, (neither of which impaired the precedent estates, or ever took effect,) the one, of the share of a child, dying before the mother, to the surviving child; and the other, of the whole estate to the mother, in case she should survive both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>children. The legal estate in remainder in the children, which nothing but their own death before the determination of the widow\u2019s life estate could' prevent from vesting in possession, vested in them from the death of the testator, subject to be divested by their dying before the widow. <em>Doe </em>v. Considine, 6 Wall. 458, 476 ; <em>McArthur </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>113 U. S. 340, 379. Their legal. estates in remainder, as well as their equitable estates for life, were present interests, which mighf be sold for their maintenance and education.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The records of the orphans\u2019 court, and of the Circuit Court of the'United States of the District of Columbia sitting in chancery, produced from the proper custody, clearly prove the following facts: Mrs. Thaw, who by the will of her husband was appointed, executrix thereof, and guardian of their two children, and exempted from giving bond as executrix, gave bond as guardian on March 24, 1844. On March 29, 1844, she presented to the orphans\u2019 court a petition on oath, representing that she had paid all her husband\u2019s debts, and that the property left by him was insufficient to support her and the children, and praying for an order of sale of the real estate for the relief of her - immediate wants and for the support and education of the children. On that petition, the orphans\u2019 court, on the same day, by an order reciting that it had heard and considered the case <em>\u201c </em>on the petition, exhibits, accompanying proofs and representation of Eliza V. Thaw in her capacity of guardian and executrix,\u201d decreed that, provided the Circuit Court of the United States of the District of Columbia sitting as a Court of Chancery should by proper order approve thereof, she should be authorized, as guardian of the children and for herself, to make sale and conveyance of the said real estate, first giving bond for the performance of the trust thereby imposed upon her, and immediately after the sale making repoi\u2019t thereof to the court. On or about April 29, 1844; a copy of that petition and order, duly certified by the register of wills, was filed on the chancery side of the Circuit Court of the United States of the District of Columbia. On October 12, 1844, the order of the orphans\u2019 court was approved by the Circuit Court sitting in chancery, as is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>shown by the entry on its docket or minute book, which, in the absence of any extended record, is competent and conclusive proof of its doings. <em>Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore Railroad </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>13 How. 307, 331. On May 17, 1845, the petitioner gave bond with sureties for the performance of the trust imposed upon her by the order so approved.. The dates of the sale and of the report thereof to the orphans\u2019 court do not appear. But it does appear, by the minutes , of its proceedings, that on January 21, 1848, there was filed in and approved by that court a \u201csale of real estate of Joseph Thaw, deceased,\u201d which, in the absence of evidence of any other sale of his real estate having been ordered or made, must be inferred to have been a report of this sale. All the facts recited in the deed executed by Mrs. Thaw to Agricol Favier on March 17, 1848, are thus proved by independent evidence, the competency of which is beyond doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The objection that the petition presented by Mrs. Thaw to the orphans\u2019 court was irregular and insufficient to support the jurisdiction of that court, because it asked for a sale of the land for the benefit of the petitioner, as well as of her wards, is sufficiently. answered by Mr. Justice Cox, delivering the judgment below, as follows: \u201cIt is true that the guardian, in her application, confused somewhat her own interests with those of the wards, and alleged the insufficiency of the property to support <em>herself </em>and the children as a ground for selling, and asked the sale as well to relieve <em>her own immediate wants </em>as for the support of the children. But it is fair to read this part of the application as referring to her own undivided interest for life in the property. It is not to be read as an application to sell the estate of the children for her support. It is also true' that the court had no jurisdiction over the wife\u2019s interest in the property, and could not pass title to it by its decree. But if the wife chose to unite in the sale and convey her interest, which she must be held to have done, we see no reason why the court could not decree a sale of the share of the infants.\u201d \u201c And if there was error in the form of the decree because it embraced the widow\u2019s interest also, it did not affect its efficacy as to the interest of the infants, but was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>harmless and inoperative error not to be noticed collaterally. The only question that could arise would be as to the proper apportionment of the proceeds between the mother and the wards. But this question could only arise after the sale, and would not affect the transfer of title.\u201d 5 Mackey, 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The petition and the order of the orphans\u2019 court thereon, fairly and reasonably construed, show that a sale of the infants\u2019 interest in the'real estate under the Avill of their father hvas prayed for and ordered as necessary for their maintenance and education. So far as concerned- the interest of the infants, therefore,- the court had before it everything that was n\u00e9cessary to support its jurisdiction. In this form of proceeding,</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u25a0 the guardian sufficiently and fully represented the infants, and no notice to them was required by the statute of Maryland or by any general rule of laAv. The Avant of proof of such notice, or of any record of the evidence on Avhich the orphans\u2019 court proceeded in making the order, or the chancery court in approving it, or of any subsequent accounting by the guardian for ' the proceeds of the sale, is immaterial. The orders of those courts within their jurisdiction were conclusive proof in favor of the. purchaser and grantee at the sale, and cannot be collaterally impeached on any such ground. <em>Thompson </em>v. Tolmie, 2 Pet. 157; <em>Grignon </em>v. <em>Astor, </em>2 How. 319; <em>Comstock </em>v. Crawford, 3 Wall. 396; <em>McNitt </em>v. Turner, 16 Wall. 352; <em>Mohr </em>v. <em>Manierre, </em>101 U. S. 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The cases, on which the plaintiff relies, of <em>Bank of United States </em>v. Ritchie, 8 Pet. 128, and <em>Hunter </em>v. Hatton, 4 Gill, 115, 124, were wholly different. Both were cases of decrees in equity upon suits <em>inter partes </em>in the ordinary form. In the one case, the decree was directly attacked by bill of review, in the nature of a -writ of error; and in the other case, a notice required by express statute had not been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
