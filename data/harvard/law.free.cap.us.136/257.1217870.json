The District Court of Connecticut has no jurisdiction to try Mr. Palliser for the offence charged against him. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gulteau, </em>1 Mackey, 498. The offence was complete when the letter was mailed. The fact that the person to whom it was addressed lived in Connecticut makes no difference. Mr. Palliser has a constitutional right to a trial in' the Southern'District of New York, where he resides and is known.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-7\">. The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution is as follows: \u201c In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury'of the State and District wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, arid to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.\u201d This amendment is to be construed liberally in view of its history and the rights which it is designed to protect.

S. 616.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>It is supplementary to a clause of the Constitution as originally ratified in section 2 of Article HI. \u201cThe trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crime shall have been committed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-5\">These constitutional provisions cannot be nullified by any statute of the United States. Consequently, if section 731 of the Revised Statutes conflicts witlrthem, it is unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-6\">But. that statute does not cover the case at bar. Mr. Palliser\u2019s alleged' crime was complete when the letter was mailed in New York. <em>United States </em>v.

S. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">But he was rightly remanded to custody, because the return shows that he was charged with \u00e1 crime against the laws of the United States and within the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States for the District of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">By section 5451 of the Revised Statutes, \u201c every person who promises, offers or gives, or. causes or procures to be promised, offered or given, any money or other thing of value, or makes or tenders any contract, undertaking, obligation, gratuity or security for the payment of money, or for the delivery or conveyance of anything of value to any officer of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>States,\u201d \u201cwith intent to influence him to commit or aid in committing, or to collude in or allow any fraud, or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud on the United States, or to induce him to do or omit to do any act in violation of his lawful duty, shall he punished\u201d by fine and imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">By the act of June 17,-1878, c. 259, \u00a7 1, \u201cno postmaster of any class, or other person connected with the postal service, entrusted with the sale or custody of postage stamps, stamped envelopes or postal cards, shall use or dispose of them in the payment of debts or in the purchase of merchandise or other. salable articles, or pledge or hypothecate the 'same, or sell or dispose of them except for cash,\u201d on pain of being- deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished accordingly. 20 Stat. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">By this statute, postmasters are peremptorily forbidden, not only to dispose of postage stamps in the payment of debts or in the purchase of commodities, pr to pledge them, but to \u201c sell, or dispose of them \u00abexcept for cash.\u2019! The word \u201c cash\u201d in this statute, as in common speech, means ready money, or money in hand, either in current coin or other legal tender, or in bank bills or checks paid and received as money, and does not include promises to pay money in the future. A sale on credit is not, ordinarily speaking, and in the. absence of any evidence of usage,- a sale for cash, within the meaning of. that word as used in statutes or contracts. <em>Muller </em>v. Norton, 132 U. S. 501; <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>8 Vermont, 252; <em>Steward </em>v. <em>Scudder, </em>4 Zabriskie, 96; <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>6 Maryland, 37; <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>28 Grattan, 165, 175; <em>Farr </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>Rich. Eq. Cas. 122, 131; <em>Meng </em>v. Houser, 13 Rich. Eq. 210, 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The petitioner relies on the following passage in an opinion delivered by Mr: Justice'Swayne: \u201cLife insurance is a cash business. Its disbursements are all in money, and its receipts must necessarily be in the same medium. This is the universal usage and rule of all such companies.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Hancock Ins. Co., </em>92 U. S. 161, 164. But the only point decided in thaf case was that an agent of an .insurance-company could not, unless authorized by the company, apcept personal property as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>money in payment of a -premium ; no question arose or was considered as to the premium note; and it cannot reasonably be inferred that the learned justice meant to intimate that a premium note was cash or money, before the amount thereof was paid by the insured and received by the insurance company, according to the terms of their contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"Abf\">The substance and effect of the letter written and sent by the petitioner, in behalf of himself and his partners, to De Wolf as postmaster, was to ask him whether, if they should send him from five to ten thousand circulars in addressed envelopes, he would put postage stamps on them and send -them out, at the rate of fifty to one hundred daily ; and to promise him that, if he would do so, and would' render them a statement of his doings and an account of the stamps used, they would remit to him the price of the stamps. If we take five thousand, the smallest number of circulars proposed to be sent by the petitioner to the postmaster, .and one hundred, the largest number suggested to be sent o.ut by the postmaster daily, it would require fifty days for the postmaster to send out the circulars; and the petitioner would thus be allowed an average credit, of at least twenty-five days on his payments to the postmaster for five thousand .postage stamps ; and- the postmaster would receive and retain a commission on the sale of as' many stamps, Avhich neither he nor any other postmaster would retain if the circulars were mailed by the petitioner at the post-office in New York or any other post-office where the postmaster was paid by a salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">If this letter was not an offer of money to the postmaster, It was clearly a tender of a contract for the payment of money to him, with intent to induce him to sell postage stamps for credit, in violation of his lawful duty; and therefore came within \u00a7 5451 of the Revised Statutes, above quoted. A promise to a public officer, that if he will do. a certain unlawful act he shall be paid a certain compensation, is an offer to bribe him to do- the unlawful act; and an offer of a contract to pay money to \u00e1 postmaster for an unlawful sale by him of postage stamps on credit is not the less within the statute, because the portion of that money which h.e would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ultimately have the right to retain, by way of commission, from the United States, would be no greater than he would have upon a lawful sale for cash of an equal amount of postage stamps.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The remaining and more interesting question is whether the' .petitioner can be tried for this offence in the District of' Connecticut\".</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The petitioner relies on those provisions of the Constitution of the United States Avhich declare that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to be tried by an impartial jury of the State and District wherein the crime shall have been committed. Art. 3, sect. 2; Amendments, Art. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">But the right thereby secured is not a right to be tried in the district where the accused resides, or even in the district in which he -is personally at the time of committing the crime, but in the district \u201c Avherein the crime shall have been committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-O\">Reference wrns made in argument to the question, often disputed, Where an indictment for murder shall be tried, when a person mortally Avounded in one jurisdiction after-wards dies in another jurisdiction ? See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macloon, </em>101 Mass. 1, and authorities there cited; <em>The Queen </em>v. Keyn, 2 Ex. D. 63; 11 Amer. Law Rev. 625 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>16 Kansas, 475 ; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guiteau, </em>1 Mackey, 498. ' But there the original unlawful act is not only done by the offender, but reaches the person at whom it is aimed, in one jurisdiction; and it is the subsequent effect only Avhich takes place in another jurisdiction. We have no occasion now to consider such \u00e1 case, beyond observing that before the Declaration of Independence provision had been made by statute, both in England and in Ireland, for trying such cases in either jurisdiction, and Avas never supposed to be inconsistent in principle with the provision of Magna Charta, c. 14, for trial by a jury of the. vicinage. 1 East P. C. <em>366; </em>1 Gabbett\u2019s Crim. Law, 501.' It is universally admitted that Avhen a shot fired in one jurisdiction strikes a person in another jurisdiction, the offender may be .tried where the shot takes effect,\" and the only doubt is .whether he can be tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>where the shot is fired. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Coombes, </em>1 Leach, (4th ed.) 388; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>2 Sumner, 482; <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>3 Denio, 190, 207, and 1 N. Y. 173, 176, 179 ; Cockburn, C. J., in <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Keyn, 2 </em>Ex. D. 233, 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">When a crime is committed partly in one district and partly in another, it must, in order to prevent an absolute failure of justice, be tried in either district, or in that one which the legislature'may designate; and Congress has accordingly provided that \u201cwhen any offence against the United States is begun in one judicial district and completed in any other, it shall be deemed to have been committed in either, and may be dealt with, inquired of, tried, determined and punished in either district, in the same manner and as if it had been actually and wholly committed therein.\u201d Eev. Stat. \u00a7 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">When an offence is committed by means of a communication through the post-office, the sender has sometimes, as appears by the cases cited for the petitioner, been held to be punishable at the place where he mails the letter. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Worrall, 2 </em>Dall. 384; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bickford, </em>4 Blatchford, 337; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Williams, 2 </em>Campbell, 506; <em>The King </em>v. <em>Burdett, </em>3 B. <em>&amp; </em>Ald. 717, and 4 B. <em>&amp; </em>Ald. 95; <em>Perkins Case, 2 </em>Lewin, 150 ; <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Cooke, 1 </em>Fost. <em>&amp; </em>Finl. 64; <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>12 Q. B. D. 23; <em>S. C. </em>15 Cox Crim. Cas. 343. But it does not follow that he is not punishable at the place where the letter is received by the person to whom it is addressed: and it is settled by an overwhelming weight of authority that he may be tried and punished at that place, whether the unlawfulness of the communication through the post-office consists in its being a threatening letter'; <em>The King </em>v. <em>Girdwood, </em>1 Leach, 142; <em>S. C. 2 </em>East P. C. 1120; <em>Esser's Case, 2 </em>East P. C. 1125; or a libel; <em>The King </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>7 East, 65; <em>S. C. </em>3 J. P.

Y. 173; <em>Foute </em>v. <em>State, </em>15 Lea (Tenn.) 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The only decision to the contrary, cited for the petitioner, is one in which the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, upoh the authority- of a former case in the same court in which no opinion is reported, held that where a letter containing a forged check was'put in the post-office at Baltimore, addressed to a person in Washington, there was no uttering of the forged paper in Washington. <em>United States </em>v. Plympton, 4 Cranch C. C. 309; citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>2 Cranch C. C. 296. In <em>Dana's Case, </em>7 Ben. 1, a warrant to remove to the District of Columbia a person alleged to have printed a libel in a newspaper published in New York, and circulated by his authority in the District- of Columbia, was refused by Mr. Justice Blatchford, then District Judge, not because the offence could not be punished in the District of Columbia, but because the law of that District provided for its prosecution by information only, and was therefore unconstitutional. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Comerford, </em>25 Fed. Rep. 902, an indictment on \u00a7 3893 of the Devised Statutes, for \u201cknowingly depositing or causing to be - deposited \u201d in the post-office at New York a letter containing obscene matter in a sealed envelope addressed to a person in Texas, was quashed, not merely for want of jurisdiction in Texas, but because the court field that the act did not constitute an offence under' that statute, in accord with the decision of this court at the \u2022present term, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>135 U. S. 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In the case before us, the offence charged being an offer of money, or a tender of a contract for the payment of money, contained in a letter mailed in New York and addressed to-a postmaster in Connecticut, to induce him to violate his official duty, it might admit of doubt whether any offence against the laws of the United States was committed until the offer or tender was known to the postmaster and might have influenced his mind. But there can be no doubt at all that, if any offence was committed in New York, the offence continued to be committed when the letter reached the- postmaster in Connecticut ; and that, if no offence was committed in New York, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u2022an offence was committed in Connecticut; and that, in either aspect, the District Court of the United States for the District of Connecticut had jurisdiction of the charge against the petitioner. Whether he' might have been indicted in New York is a question not presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
