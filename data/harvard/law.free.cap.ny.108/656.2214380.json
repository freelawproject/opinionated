The killing was conceded, and no attempt-was made to justify or excuse it, but the whole contest at the trial turned upon the inquiry whether the act was deliberate- or a sudden and unreflecting outbreak of passion. Evidence-was given tending to show that the defendant was subject to severe headaches, and fits resembling the known effects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>epilepsy, and that he had made one or two attempts at suicide, but no claim or defense of insanity was interposed. The circumstances were relied on to make, more probable the prisoner\u2019s testimony that he fired the shot, which took the fife of William Roy, without forethought and upon an instantaneous. impulse. The jury, however, were so satisfied that the act was characterized by some degree of deliberation as to have disbelieved his statement to the contrary; and they rendered a verdict of murder in the first degree which the General Term have affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-4\"><em>\u201c </em>The prisoner asks us to review the facts under the law of 1887, amending section 528 of the. Code of Criminal Procedure, and to determine upon such review whether the verdict shall stand. The prosecutor insists that the amendment by its terms has no application to this appeal, and relies upon its provision that \u2018 the amendments herein shall not affect any appeal taken to or pending in the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals at the time this act shall become a law.\u2019 The appeal to the Supreme Court was taken before the amendment, but that to this court after its enactment. It is possible, to construe the terms of the amendment distributively, and we think we ought to do so and not deny to the prisoner the review upon the facts which he seeks by any nice or critical construction of the amendment. Nevertheless, after having read carefully the whole of the evidence given upon the trial, we have reached the same conclusion upon the question of deliberation which prevailed with the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-5\">The balance of the opinion is taken up with a discussion of the testimony.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b677-6\"><em>L.
