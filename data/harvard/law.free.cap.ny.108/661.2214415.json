Lynch as executor of the estate of James, Lynch, deceased, to defendant Price, upon the ground that the same were transferred by said executor without authority, and also to set aside a subsequent transfer of said stock by Price to defendant Howlett.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b682-4\">The following is the <em>mem. </em>of opinion in the case:</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b682-5\">\u201c The opinion of the court at Special Term and the opinion of the General Term upon appeal from its decision (39 Hun,. 394), sufficiently justify the judgment now before us, unless the trial court erred in rejecting against the objection of the-defendant, certain evidence which, as appellant now contends, would show that the plaintiff had parted with all her interest, in the property involved in this action. The testimony of the. plaintiff, taken before trial, shows among other things that she-was a nun of the Roman Catholic Church \u00a3 and a member of' the Society of the Sacred Heart.\u2019 Upon cross-examination, by defendant\u2019s counsel she said \u00a3 everything is in common with, us, nothing belonging to ourselves.\u2019 Asked \u00a3 is there any condition as to the distribution of property belonging to one entering the sisterhood,\u2019 the plaintiff objected as immaterial and incompetent, and she said, \u00a3 whatever property we have-after our vows are taken, belongs to the society.\u2019 She also-stated that the regulations in regard thereto were printed, that, each member had a copy, and that she in joining the society agreed to \u00a3 perform and assent to all the regulations laid down in the order.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b682-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The objection was renewed, <em>\u2018 </em>that the evidence is inadmissible on the ground that it is secondary, the regulations being in writing.\u2019 She stated that she brought the action because \u00a3 I thought it was my duty to the society to which I belonged to' do it.\u2019 The testimony indicates only that so far-as might be she had ceased to be earthly minded, and with a. desire to be wholly occupied with her future obligations, was. willing to devote her substance to the interests of the order to which she belonged. It fails to prove any. transfer effectual even between the parties, and goes no farther than to show a. subjection of her will, but no manifestation of it by any legal or valid form. No transfer of title was estabhshed, if we; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>take her words in the broadest sense. But in any view the objection that better evidence existed as to what she had really done was a good one, and the trial judge committed no error in sustaining it. The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was meritorious, her resort to a court of equity necessary, the points made against her recovery are, in view of the consideration already given to them by the court of original jurisdiction and by the General Term, invalid and suggest no reason for a continuance of the litigation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b683-4\">\u201cThe judgment appealed from should,therefore, be affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b683-5\"><em>Louis Marshall </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b683-6\"><em>WilUam G.
