Y. 148); \u00a3 any departure from that rule is certain to produce surprise, confusion and injustice.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-7\">\u201cIt was said- by Judge Earl in <em>Southwick </em>v. <em>First Nat. B'k, of Memphis </em>(61 How. Pr. 170), that 1 pleadings and a distinct issue are essential in every system of jurisprudence, and there can be no orderly administration of justice without them. If a party can allege one cause of action and then recover upon another, his complaint will serve no useful urpose, but rather to ensnare and mislead his adversary.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-8\">It does not appear that thes theory upon which this action was determined was mentioned or referred to upon the trial, and its first appearance occurs in the opinion of the referee, wherein1 he says: \u00a3 It is true that upon this view the plaintiff recovers upon a somewhat different cause of action from that stated in the complaint,\u2019 and this is followed by the suggestion that the pleadings \u00a3 may' be amended or deemed amended to conform to the proof.\u2019 This is to ignore the whole office of a pleading and compel parties to try their cases in the dark, informing them for the first time after the wrong is irremediable of the issue which they should have tried. The pleadings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>were not amended and they could not lawfully be amended in a material respect except at a time which would give the party against whom the amendment is allowed a right and opportunity to meet by proof the allegations made against, him. There are cases which having proceeded in disregard of the pleadings and wherein the whole case has been presented by both parties in their proofs without objection, in which an amendment has been allowed, after the evidence is closed,, to conform the pleadings to the proofs; so also where the court, can see that a trial has been had upon the real issue without, objection, it will not disturb a recovery upon the ground that, it was not embraced in the pleadings; but when the objection has been properly taken or.an exception presents the question it is fatal to a recovery that it does not conform in all material respects to the allegations of the pleadings.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-4\">The balance of the opinion is taken up with a discussion of\" the evidence, the court coming to the conclusion that it did not warrant the finding of the referee that the defendant, agreed with the plaintiff to erect a building either by himself or through a club, or that plaintiff\u2019s plans were accepted or adopted within the meaning of those terms in the contract,, as found by the referee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b673-5\"><em>Ed/uoard W.
