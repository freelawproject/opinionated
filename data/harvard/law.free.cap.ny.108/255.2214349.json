In case of the death of C. leaving no issue, the will directed the executors to -sell the residuary estate and convert the same into money; $5,000 of the proceeds the testatrix gave to them in trust as a perpetual fund to be kept at interest, and the interest to be paid \u201c for the relief of poor and destitute persons residing in Malone village.\u201d The balance was given to a religious society named. In an action brought by C. for a construction of the will <em>held, </em>that the will created a valid trust in favor of plaintiff during her life, with the legal estate in the trustees for that period; that so much of the income, if any, as was not required for plaintiff's support during her minority, was payable over to her when of age, and so there was no direction for accumulation; that the most that could be claimed for plaintiff is, that by reason of the invalidity of the gifts over, the testatrix died intestate as to a contingent remainder in her estate and plaintiff became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>seized thereof; that conceding this to be so (as to which <em>quiere), </em>as such remainder is contingent upon her death without leaving issue, and so is an interest she herself can never enjoy, the action was not maintainable.

(Laws of 1879, chap. 316; Laws of 1880, chap. 345, \u00a7 3, sub. 9, \u00a7 4; 3 R. S. Bank\u2019s [7th. ed.] 2284, <em>note) </em>The jurisdiction of equity over trusts gives it authority to construe wills whenever necessary to guide the action of the trustee. <em>(Wager </em>v. <em>Wager, </em>89 N. Y. 161.) The trust attempted to be created by the will is illegal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>void. The accumulations cannot be held for the benefit of others ultimately entitled to the estate. The income can only be accumulated during plaintiff\u2019s minority, for her sole benefit, and must be paid to her at majority. <em>(Pray </em>v. <em>Hegeman, </em>92 N. Y. 508; 1 R. S. 726, \u00a7\u00a7 37, 58; id. 773, \u00a7 3; <em>Kilpatrick </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>15 N. Y. 326; <em>Manice </em>v. <em>Manice, </em>43 id. 303.) The attempted bequest to the poor of Malone in perpetuity by the fifth clause is void. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>43 N. Y. 487.) So also in one-half the residue sought to be given to the church by the sixth clause. (Laws of 1860, chap. 369.) The estate thus undisposed of descended at once to the plaintiff. <em>(Kerr </em>v. <em>Dougherty, </em>79 N. Y. 328; <em>Lefevre </em>v. <em>Lefevre, </em>59 id. 435.) The contingent interests of any unborn children of this unmarried plaintiff in no way interfere with this result. <em>(Brevoort </em>v. <em>Brevoort, </em>70 N. Y. 136; <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Mitehell, </em>17 id. 210; <em>Christie </em>v. <em>Phyfe, </em>19 id. 345; <em>In re N. Y. L. &amp; W. R. Co., </em>Ct. of Ap. March 22, 1877, N. E.

A remainder in four-sixths of the real estate contingent upon the death of the daughter leaving no descendant her surviving, was not embraced in the trust as the devisees were incapable of taking, and this remainder was not disposed of by the will. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>46 N. Y. 144, 168, 169; 2 R. S. 729, \u00a7 22 [7th ed.], 2182.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-6\"><em>W. P. Cantwell </em>respondent in person.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXB\">The court will not entertain an action for the construction of a will, unless it involves a valid trust. (<em>Wager </em>v. <em>Wager, </em>21 Hun, 93; <em>S. C. </em>89 N. Y. 161; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>4 Abb. [N. C.], 275; <em>Stinde </em>v. <em>Ridgeway, </em>55 How. 301; <em>Trow </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>59 id. 214.) In other words, the plaintiff cannot use the trust, as a pretext for an action, and at the same time, claim that it is invalid; for the action, in its very nature, is simply advisory as to the execution of the trusts conceded to be valid. <em>(Marlett </em>v. <em>Marlett, </em>14 Hun, 314; <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>63 N. Y. 221, 229, 232; <em>Bowers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>v. <em>Smith, </em>10 Paige, 193; <em>Post </em>v. Hover, 33 N. Y. 593; <em>Dill v. Wisner, </em>88 id. 160.) There is no present occasion for this action. The court will not entertain an action of this-character, unless questions of present importance demand it. <em>(Bowers </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>10 Paige, 203; <em>Onderdonk </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>34 Barb. 111; <em>Parks </em>v. Parks, 9 Paige, 109, 122.) A demurrer is proper, and will be sustained when the complaint shows no-reason for calling on the court to intervene. <em>(Topf v. Weigers, </em>3 Law Bul. 103; Cited Gould\u2019s Dig. 1881, 354.) It is the duty of' the court to carry into effect the intent of the testatrix, if such intent can be collected from the whole instrument, and is consistent with the rules of law. (1 R. S. 748, \u00a7 2; 3 R. S. [7th ed.], \u00a7 2205; <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>9 Paige, 116; 3 Sandf.

Whenever the purpose of the testator-can be carried out as to a valid provision, the invalidity of others, will not affect it. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>43 N.

Y. 573.) The trust in favor of Carrie J. Horton is valid. (3 R. S. [7th ed.], \u00a7 55, 2181; id., \u00a7 37, 2178; id., \u00a7 3, 2257; id., \u00a7 15, 2176; <em>Pray </em>v. <em>Hegeman, </em>92 N. Y. 508; <em>Barbour v.

The legal title-vests in the executors as trustees. <em>(Donovan </em>v. <em>Van De Mark, </em>78 N. Y. 244; <em>Tiers </em>v. <em>Tiers. </em>32 Hun, 184, 189; 98 N. Y. 568.) The children of Carrie J. Horton, if any such there shall be, caunot be bound, or their rights affected, by a judgment in this case. <em>(Monarque </em>v. <em>Monarque, </em>80 N.

Flanders </em>for respondent, Cantwell.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3-D\">The complaint is not so framed as to give the court jurisdiction to pass upon the provisions of the will in question, and to make a judicial determination of their construction and validity. <em>(Chipman </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>63 N. Y. 230.) Carrie J. Horton has no standing, in court as a plaintiff, and is legally incapable of maintaining this action. She has no interest in any question which can be litigated herein. <em>(Moore v. Hegeman, </em>72 N. Y. 376; <em>Barbour </em>v. <em>De Forest, </em>95 id. 13; <em>Amory </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>9 id. 411; <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>47 id. 396; <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>63 id. 230, 235.) Ho material question exists in which the appellant Carrie J. Horton is interested in any manner or to any degree whatever. <em>(Parks </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>9 Paige, 120, 122; <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>10 id. 203; <em>Onderdonk </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>34 Barb. 111, 112; <em>Monarque </em>v. <em>Monarque, </em>80 N. Y. 320; <em>Marlett v. Marlett, </em>14 Hun, 313.) The trust created by the will is valid. <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>Hegeman, </em>72 N. Y. 376; <em>Pray </em>v. <em>Hegeman, </em>92 id. 508; <em>Barbour </em>v. <em>De Forest, </em>95 id. 313; <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>47 id. 396; <em>Amory </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>9 id. 403.) Where in a will a word not intended has been used and it appears that another certain word was intended, the court has power, and it is its judicial duty, to put upon the will the construction that was evidently to express, wherever and however the question shall legitimately arise, and the necessity shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>exist for judicial action upon it. <em>(Hall </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>23 Hun, 334; <em>Lottimer </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>61 How. 360; <em>Roseboom </em>v. <em>Roseboom, </em>81 N.

Ch 295; Post v. <em>Hover, </em>33 N. Y. 593.) The obvious intention of the will is that Carrie J. Horton shall have the whole net income of the estate, wisely and prudently providing, that during her minority the executors shall control the amount of the expenditure. <em>(Post </em>v. <em>Hover, </em>33 N. Y. 593; <em>Du Bois </em>v. <em>Bay, </em>35 id. 162; <em>Kilpatrick </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>15 id. 508; <em>Pray </em>v. <em>Hegeman, </em>92 id. 508; <em>Barbour </em>v. <em>De Forest, </em>95 id. 13.). A void trust, which is separated from valid trusts contained in the same instrument, will not affect those which are valid, when the trust adjudged to be invalid is distinct from the-other dispositions of the will, and subordinate to them, and not an essential part of the general scheme. <em>(Manice </em>v. <em>Manice, </em>43 N.

A careful perusal of both enactments must lead to the conclusion that the later act covers the subject of the earlier one and was plainly intended to furnish the law thereon. And by section 1867, the article in which section 1866 is contained, is made to apply to wills made before as well as those made after it takes effect, which is another strong argument in favor of the conclusion that the act of 1879 was meant to be repealed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>In such case the later statute repeals by implication the earlier one. <em>(Heckman v. Pinkney, </em>81 N. Y. 211; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jahne, </em>103 id. 182, 194.) It is argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the act of 1879 is saved from repeal by virtue of the provision of the act, chapter 245 of the Laws of 1880, entitled \u201cAn act repealing certain acts and parts of acts.\u201d That act repealed in so many words chapter 238 of the Laws of 1853, the first section of which was amended by the act of 1879. By subdivision 9 of section 3 of the repealing act of. 1880, it was enacted, that, \u201c the repeal of any provision of the existing laws which has been amended by a subsequent provision of those laws, <em>not expressly repealed by this act, </em>does not affect the subsequent provision.\u201d The act of 1879 was not expressly repealed by the repealing act of 188.0, and hence was not affected by the passage of that act. That provision has, however, no effect upon the general rule of law as to the repeal of statutes by implication, and therefore does not in any way alter the effect which the passage of a later statute covering the whole subject has upon an earlier statute upon the same subject, although the later contains no express wordsof repeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Holding as we do that sections 1866 and 1867 do thus cover the subject and were intended to take the place of the act of 1879, it was thereby repealed although not repealed in terms by the act of 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Hnder section 1866 of the Code of Civil Procedure, already alluded to, we do not think this action can be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In the will in question there is a plain and undoubtedly valid trust created in favor of the daughter of the testatrix, the plaintiff herein, for her life and of substantially the whole of the estate, real and personal, of which the testatrix died seized, and after the plaintiff\u2019s death the remainder in fee to her children or to their issue if dead. It is only in case there shall be no children or issue at the death of the plaintiff that the provision is made for the poor of Malone and for the corporation defendant. Thus in regard to the whole of this estate the plaintiff is simply a <em>cestui que trust </em>and will remain so during all her life, the legal estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\"being in trustees under a valid trust to pay over to her the rents and profits so long as she lives. We think there is no force in the criticism that the trust is void because the balance of the rents and profits, if any, during her minority, not required for the support of the plaintiff, is or may be added to the corpus of the estate and interest obtained therefrom for the <em>cestwi que trust. </em>There is no direction for an accumulation, and the whole of such balance, if any remain, must be paid over to her when of age according to the terms of the will as we think. Assuming the\" validity of this trust therefore, about which there can in reality be no room for dispute or argument, what interest has this plaintiff in any other question ?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The plaintiff claims that the bequest to the poor of Malone, which is made to depend upon the contingency of her death without children, is void. There may be no doubt about that proposition, and for the purpose of the argument here it has been conceded by the defendants. She also claims that the devise of the balance of the estate (upon the same contingency) to the corporation defendant is void, to the extent of one-half thereof by reason of the provisions of chapter 360 of the Laws of 1860, prohibiting under certain limitations the devise of more than one-half of the testator\u2019s estate to any religious corporation. The counsel for the corporation defendant, for the same purpose, has conceded the invalidity of the devise to it, to the extent of one-half. Assuming therefore the invalidity of the bequest and devise, the plaintiff further claims that she is the absolute owner of the $5,000, and the surplus over one-half of the estate. If this claim were even questionable, if it were possible to found a fair argument in relation to it, there would be ground for the plaintiff\u2019s contention that such an action as this would lie to obtain a construction of the devise. But it is not alone a case where a claim is made in regard to \"the character of a devise that the court under this section of the Code can take jurisdiction. There must be some color of a question for construction before the court can be called' upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>to construe the devise. Here we have no doubt that the plaintiff\u2019s claim of absolute ownership of the $5,000, and the balance-over one-half of the estate, based updn the invalidity above mentioned has no foundation whatever and does not furnish even the color of an argument for such construction. The most that can be argued plausibly for the plaintiff is that by reason of the invalidity of the bequest of $5,000, and of the one-half of the surplus to the corporation defendant, the testatrix died intestate as to a contingent remainder in her estate to that amount, because it was undisposed of by her will, and upon her death this remainder passed to her heir who is the-plaintiff herein, and she became at once seized of such interest. That interest is a remainder contingent upon the plaintiff\u2019s own death without children or representatives of children. (See <em>White </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>46 N. Y. 144.) In other words it is an interest which she never can herself enjoy because of the-existence of a valid trust in the whole estate which is to continue under all contingencies during h\u00e9r life, and then the estates goes to her children if she leave any. All that she could do would to sell such interest, if she could find any one to buy it, or dispose of it by her will. This she can do now. We do not-think that one who stands in such a relation to property can maintain an action for the construction of a devise in regard to it under section 1866'of the Code. The testamentary disposition of real property, or of an interest therein, the validity, ' construction or effect of which may be determined under the-above-quoted section, and where its invalidity is sought to be determined, must be a disposition of some interest in real estate which may possibly be enjoyed in actual possession (if the-invalidity of such disposition be decreed) during the lifetime of the person who seeks the aid of the court in construing the devise of such real estate or interest therein. In this case the contingency upon which alone the question can arise may never occur, for the plaintiff may marry and have children who (or their issue) may be living at her death, in which case-they take the fee and the contingency never happens. It is-not a case where any practical benefit can arise to the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>in having this will authoritatively construed as to the devise-of the real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00a1Nor do we think the plaintiff makes out any case under the general rules which obtain in a court of equity for the construction of wills. The foundation of such jurisdiction rests on the jurisdiction which a court of equity has over- trusts. <em>(Chipman, </em>v. <em>Montgomery, 68 N. </em>Y. 221; <em>Wager </em>v. <em>Wager, </em>89 N. Y. 161.) In her general character as an heir-at-law of her mother the plaintiff, if she claims that the trust for her life is void, claims in hostility to the will and cannot maintain an action to obtain a construction thereof. <em>(Chipman </em>v. <em>Montgomery, supra.) </em>Here the trustee under the will creating a trust for the life of the plaintiff, is in possession of the estate recognizing the validity of the trust, and assuming to carry out its provisions. The claim of the plaintiff to the absolute ownership of the $5,000, and the surplus over one-half of the balance of the estate, we have seen rests on no colorable foundation, and hence it is seen that she is under no circumstances entitled to obtain from the executors any personalty other than the rents and profits, which the executors do not claim themselves but acknowledge the right of the plaintiff to receive, and which they propose to pay over in accordance-with the terms of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The case is wholly unlike that of <em>Wager </em>v. <em>Wager (supra), </em>for there the widow (who was also the executrix) against whom the action was commenced by the next of kin and heirs-at-law of her husband, claimed that by the terms of the bequest in the will of her husband, she owned the whole property which he left at his death, and she therefore took possession of the same in her own right and claimed to hold it to the exclusion of the plaintiff and the other heirs and next of kin. This court held that the plaintiffs had a right of action; that as to the-personalty an executor was always a trustee, and any one claiming an interest in such personalty either as legatee under the will, or as entitled to it under the statute of distribution, might when the executor claimed such interest in his own right bring suit to settle the construction and ascertain the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u25a0of the provisions of the will so far as plaintiff\u2019s interests were concerned, and to enable them to obtain from the executors .such portions of the estate as they were entitled to. This is no such ease. The plaintiff is entitled to none of the personalty \u2022of the estate and never will he, except as it comes to her in the \u00a1shape of rents and profits from the hands of the trustees under the will, the provisions of. which they assent to, declare the validity of and are engaged in carrying out.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In thus coming to the conclusion that the plaintiff cannot maintain this action, it was necessary to some extent to construe the will in order to see what the status of the plaintiff is with regard to it, and hence to determine whether she could maintain this action. What has been said as to the interest of the plaintiff in the estate consequent upon the in validity of the bequests above mentioned, cannot of course conclude any one not a party to this action or properly represented herein. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Whether the plaintiff took as heir-at-law of her mother an interest in the contingent remainder above described, or whether it goes to the heirs of the mother who will be such when the plaintiff dies without children, we do not assume .authoritatively to decide. We only say that such interest is the most (if any) that the plaintiff takes in the mother\u2019s estate (outside of and beyond the trust), if it be assumed that the bequests spoken of are void. That she does take even that \u2022estate we do not for we cannot decide so as to bind those who might claim it on the happening of the contingency and as the then heirs of the testatrix as against the heirs or grantees of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Lastly, in this discussion, we have assumed that the word my,\u201d as used in the fourth clause of the will, should read \u25a0\u201cher.\u201d That this is the true construction to be placed on the will cannot, as we think, admit of doubt. The testatrix is \u25a0providing for the contingency of the death of her daughter leaving issue at her (the daughter\u2019s) death, and the whole context makes it perfectly plain that the death spoken of is the \u2022death of her daughter after her own decease, and not the death -of any issue of the daughter during the lifetime of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Upon the whole case we think there is no practical or present controversy to be determined, and the contingency may never arise in which the question can become a practical one, and even then, if it do hereafter arise, there is no certainty there will be any contest whatever in regard to it. At any rate the matter is, so far as the plaintiff is concerned, a purely abstract one, and courts do not sit to determine abstract questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">For these reasons the judgment of the Supreme Court, should be affirmed, with costs payable as therein directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
