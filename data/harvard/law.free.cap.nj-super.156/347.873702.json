Super, and in which defendant was a passenger. Also defendant sought to suppress evidence seized from his person after the vehicle had been stopped by police. The motion was denied. The propriety of said denial is the sole issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">On July 18, 1975, at about 5:00 a.m., Newark Police Sergeant Eaymond McGuinness and Patrolman Daniel Helber were on routine patrol, traveling east on 14th Avenue in their squad car. While passing through the intersection of 14th Avenue and Bergen Street the officers noticed a white, 1966 Chevrolet come to an \u201cerratic stop\u201d at the light on Bergen Street with a \u201cloud screech of brakes.\u201d The officers then made a \u201cU-turn\u201d and noticed that the vehicle had turned onto 14th Avenue, traveling eastward in the westbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">At this point they stopped the vehicle and Patrolman Helber asked the driver, William Super, to produce his license, registration and insurance card. Sergeant McGuinness stood near the rear of the ear. The registration showed that the car belonged to Super\u2019s mother. A \u201croutine check\u201d of the license plate number and Super\u2019s driver\u2019s license revealed that Super was \u201cwanted on a bench warrant.\u201d Super was then arrested and asked the officers if defendant McDaniel could take the car. However, the officers decided \u201cto take the whole thing down to the Precinct\u201d and defendant \u201crequested to go along to take the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">It was decided that Sergeant McGuinness would drive Super and defendant to the precinct station in the squad car and that Patrolman Helber would drive Super\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\u201cEor protection\u201d Helber frisked both men and discovered a \u201cbulge\u201d in defendant\u2019s left trouser pocket. Defendant pulled the object from his pocket at the request of Patrol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>man Helber and it appeared to be a ball of \u201ctissue paper\u201d containing nine, empty glassine envelopes. Defendant explained that his sister found the envelopes somewhere and he had taken them from her. Although defendant had not been arrested at this point, \u201c[a]fter finding the glassine bags [the officers] brought him down [to the precinct] so that [they] could further check him\u201d and release the car to him. Sergeant McGuinness noted that he could have released the car to defendant on the spot, but decided to bring the car down to the station \u201crather than tie up the air.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">After the vehicles were brought to the precinct Patrolman Helber and another \u201cwent out to make a search of the car * * * for valuables or any contraband * * *.\u201d Helber explained further that the search was \u201cpartially for valuables\u201d because the officers did not want to be held liable for any personal property which the car might have contained. During the course of the search the officers discovered 47 glassine bags of heroin wedged behind the back of the front seat. Hone was visible upon a \u201cplain view\u201d of the interior of the ear. After the contraband was found, the officers left the vehicle and placed Super and defendant under arrest. At trial they discovered bags of heroin and the empty glassine envelopes were introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The theory advanced by the State below, and that relied upon by the trial judge in denying defendant\u2019s suppression motion, was that the search and seizure at issue were undertaken pursuant to a \u201croutine check or inventory\u201d and thus were not violative of defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State on appeal advances an alternative justification, as well: <em>i.e., </em>the search and seizure were justified by \u201cprobable cause\u201d and \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\n<em>Inventory search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Implicit in the trial judge\u2019s holding herein are two \u201cfindings,\u201d each representing a mixed question of law and fact: (a) the officers were justified in impounding the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger and (b) the subsequent \u201csearch\u201d was not a \u201cpretext concealing an investigatory police motive.\u201d <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 <em>U. S. </em>364, 376, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>3092, 3100, 49 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1000 (1976). In <em>Opperman </em>Chief Justice Burger, expressing the view of five members of the court, upheld the inventory of a vehicle lawfully impounded by police for violations of municipal parking ordinances. The inventory, undertaken pursuant to \u201cstandard police procedures,\u201d revealed a bag of marijuana located in the glove compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Justice Burger, after noting that the police are often justified in taking custody of vehicles \u201c[i]n the interests of public safety,\u201d declared that an inventory of such vehicles is also justified in order to protect the owner\u2019s property, to protect the police against claims over lost or stolen property and to protect the police from \u201cpotential danger.\u201d 428 <em>U. S. </em>at 368-369, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>3092. He stated that \u201cthis Court has consistently sustained police intrusions into automobiles impounded or otherwise in lawful police custody where the process is aimed at securing or protecting the ear and its contents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 3098.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">And, in relating the rule to the facts in that case, he declared :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">The Vermillion police were indisputably engaged in a caretaking search of a <em>lawfully impounded </em>automobile. Cf. United States v. Lawson, 487 <em>F. </em>2d 468, 471 (CA8 1973). The inventory was conducted only after the car had been impounded for multiple parking violations. The owner, having left his car illegally parked for an extended period, and thus subject to impoundment, was not present to make other arrangements for the safekeeping of his belongings. The inventory itself was prompted by the presence in plain view of a number of valuables inside the car. As in Oady, there is no sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>gesti\u00f3n whatever that this standard procedure, essentially like that followed throughout the country, was a pretext concealing an investigatory police motive, [at 375-376, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 3099; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Justice Powell, in a concurring opinion, expanded on the rationale underlying the constitutional validity of a warrant-less inventory search:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">Inventory searches * <em>* * </em>are not conducted in order to discover evidence of crime. The officer does not make a discretionary determination to search based on a judgment that certain conditions are present. Inventory searches are conducted in accordance with established police department rules or policy and occur whenever an automobile is seized. There are thus no special facts for a neutral magistrate to evaluate, [at 383, 96 S. <em>Ct. </em>3092.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In <em>Cooper v. </em>California, 386 <em>U. S. </em>58, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>788, 17 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 730 (1967), the Supreme Court upheld the inventory of a vehicle impounded under the authority of a state forfeiture statute, where the owner had been arrested on a narcotics charge. The court held that it would be \u201cunreasonable to hold that the police, having to retain the car in their custody for such a length of time, had no right, even for their own protection, to search it.\u201d 386 <em>U. S. </em>at 61-62, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 791. Similarly, in <em>Cady v. </em>Dombrowski, 413 <em>U. S. </em>433, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>2523, 37 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 706 (1973), it was held that the search of a vehicle thought to contain a police officer\u2019s revolver was not unreasonable where' police exercised a \u201cform of custody\u201d over the vehicle by towing it off the shoulder of a highway. The court noted that the vehicle was disabled and the operator, being intoxicated (and later comatose), \u201ccould not- make arrangements to have the vehicle towed and stored.\u201d 413 <em>U. S. </em>at 443, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2529. See also, <em>Harris v. United </em>States, 390 <em>U. S. </em>234, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>992, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1067 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Thus, in finding that a valid inventory search has taken place, the\u2018court must determine whether there existed \u201creasonable and proper justification\u201d for the impoundment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>of the vehicle in the first instance. <em>State v. Montague, </em>73 <em>Wash. 2d </em>381, 438 <em>P. 2d </em>571, 574 (Sup. Ct. 1968); see <em>State v. Jones, </em>122 <em>N. J. Super. </em>585, 600 (Cty. Ct. 1973); <em>People v. Sullivan, </em>29 <em>N. Y. </em>2d 69, 323 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 945, 950, 272 <em>N. E. </em>2d 464, 468 (Ct. App. 1971). Reasonable justification may be had through authority granted by statute or by the circumstances attending the initial stop itself. See, <em>e. g., State v. Singleton, </em>9 <em>Wash. App. </em>327, 511 <em>P. </em>2d 1396, 1399 (App. Ct. 1973); <em>cf. State v. Slockbower, </em>145 <em>N. J. Super. </em>480, 485 (App. Div. 1976), motion for leave to appeal granted 74 <em>N. J. </em>255 (1977). \u201cIf impoundment is not necessary, then the concomitant search is unreasonable.\u201d <em>State v. Goodrich, Minn., </em>256 <em>N. W. </em>2d 506, 510 (Sup. Ct. 1977). <em>Tolbert v. State, </em>348 <em>So. 2d </em>623 (Fla. App. Ct. 1977); <em>Granville v. State, </em>348 <em>So. </em>2d 641 (Fla. App. Ct. 1977); <em>State v. Hardman, </em>17 <em>Wash. App. </em>910, 567 <em>P. </em>2d 238 (1977); <em>State v. Bales, </em>15 <em>Wash. App. </em>834, 552 <em>P. </em>2d 688 (App. Ct. 1976); <em>People v. Landa, </em>30 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 487, 106 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>329 (D. Ct. App. 1973); <em>cf. Commonwealth v. Randle, Pa. Super., </em>375 <em>A. </em>2d 76 (Super. Ct. 1977); <em>Commonwealth v. Brandt, </em>244 <em>Pa. Super. </em>154, 366 <em>A. </em>2d 1238 (Super. Ct. 1976). Requiring that the decision to impound a vehicle must be either reasonable under the circumstances or made pursuant to statutory authorization in order to sustain an inventory search is warranted by the Supreme Court\u2019s insistence that police have <em>\"lawful custody\u201d </em>of the vehicles in such cases. (Emphasis added). See <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In <em>State v. Slockbower, supra, </em>the Appellate Division upheld the inventory search of a car impounded after police arrested the operator for driving while on the revoked list. The trial judge had suppressed the results of the inventory, noting that the police had \u201cno valid reason\u201d to impound the car, since they could have simply locked it and left it on the street. In reversing, the Appellate Division held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Having removed defendant from tlie ear and assumed control over it, they merely complied with police regulations when they impounded and inventoried the car. Furthermore, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4\u2014 136 would appear to permit the police: to remove and store a motor vehicle which cannot be moved by the operator, or is improperly parked and left unattended upon a roadway. Nor are the police circumscribed by express statutory authority to impound motor vehicles. The inherent power of the police tO' impound motor vehicles may arise in a myriad of factual situations too numerous to attempt to define. [145 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 485]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In a ease such as that at bar there is no general, statutory authority which gives police the right to impound a vehicle stopped on the street. See generally <em>State v. Jones, supra. Cf. State v. Hock, </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>526, 533-534 (1969), <em>cert. </em>den. 399 <em>U. S. </em>930, 90 <em>S. Ct. </em>2254, 26 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 797 (1970). Here \u2014 unlike <em>Slockbower </em>\u2014 <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4^136 has no real relevance since defendant or his codefendant could have moved the vehicle to a lawful parking area and locked it. Also, police here had the alternative of turning the car over to defendant McDaniel. <em>Slockbower </em>would seem to indicate that merely because the police did not avail themselves of this opportunity, the impoundment is not thereby rendered unreasonable. However, <em>Slockbower </em>is distinguishable. There, police only had the option of either impounding the car or leaving it on the street, exposing it to possible theft. 145 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 486. Here, by contrast, police had a third alternative: turning the vehicle over to defendant in accordance with the operator\u2019s wishes. Defendant was on the scene and willing to accept responsibility for it. Also, the State\u2019s claim on appeal that defendant might have been intoxicated is belied by the actions of the officers themselves, who were ready'to turn the vehicle over to him shortly after the initial stop. Indeed, there was never even any reference to intoxication at the suppression hearing, and at oral argument here the State conceded that defendant was not intoxicated. In these circumstances the decision to \u201cimpound\u201d the car \u2014 and apparently return it immediately after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>inventory to defendant \u2014 was not reasonable. Nothing in the record shows this conduct to have been necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Moreover, even if the majority decision in <em>Slockbower </em>could, in some degree, be read to support the officers\u2019 decision to impound the ear, it would appear that such ail interpretation would contravene the well-reasoned decisions in other jurisdictions which have addressed this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>People v. Landa, supra, </em>30 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 487, 106 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>329, police stopped defendant for driving with a broken taillight. During a check on defendant\u2019s identification the police learned that he was wanted on an \u201coutstanding traffic warrant.\u201d Thereafter, they arrested defendant, impounded his car and, during an inventory, discovered drugs and firearms therein. In holding that the discovered contraband must be suppressed, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">However, the drugs, bullets and firearms found in defendant\u2019s vehicle should have been suppressed as having been seized as the result of an unlawful search. We conclude under the circumstances of this ease that the deputies\u2019 custodial care of defendant\u2019s vehicle after his arrest was neither necessary nor propel*. The People's burden of establishing the necessity for the taking and the inventory (People v. Nagel, 17 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 492, 497. 95 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>129; Virgil v. Superior Court, 268 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d 127, 132, 73 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>793) was not met. While police have authority to impound a vehicle under proper circumstances pursuant to section 22651(h), Vehicle Code, and defendant was alone in his car, neither his arrest on the warrant nor the circumstances surrounding the original detention and subsequent arrest had any connection with the necessity for police custodial care of Ms vehicle. Defendant had turned from Olympic Boulevard onto a side street where he. was stopped. Xotliing in the record shows that the car was stolen or subject to forfeiture, or illegally parked and could not have been locked and left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>unattended. The situation would have been no different had defendant himself voluntarily parked the vehicle, locked and .left it. (People v. Nagel, 17 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 492, 498, 95 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>129.) [106 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>at 331-332]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Bales, supra, </em>15 <em>Wash. App. </em>834, 552 P. 2d 688, the court noted that \u201creasonable cause \u00a1for impoundment\u201d may arise if the car is .obstructing traffic, mechanically defective, stolen, abandoned or otherwise where, under the facts and circumstances, \u201creasonable grounds\u201d exist. 552 P. 2d at 689. See also,. <em>State v. Singleton, supra, </em>511 P. 2d at. 1399-1400. And in <em>Tolbert v. State </em>and <em>Granville v. State, supra, </em>the court suppressed evidence seized during an inventory and emphasized that the police could have left the car on the street or notified the owner thereof. In <em>State v. Goodrich, supra, </em>the court held that the officer\u2019s refusal to release the car to defendant\u2019s mother and brother, after defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated, rendered impoundment unreasonable. The court noted that the police officer\u2019s contention that he was merely safeguarding defendant\u2019s car was without foundation since defendant \u201cobviated that necessity\u201d by assuming all responsibility for his property himself by arranging to have his mother or brother drive it home. 256 <em>N. W. </em>2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The common theme underlying these cases and others \u2014see generally, Annotation, \u201cInventory Search of Impounded Vehicle,\u201d 48 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 537 (1973)\u2014is that something more must be shown to justify impoundment of a car than that it would otherwise be left unattended. There must be a showing that some reasonable necessity prompted the impoundment. This is a salutary rule, for otherwise police would be authorized to freely stop a ear for a minor traffic infraction, impound it and search it with impunity. Surely such a circumstance is not consonant with the Fourth Amendment. As the court in <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>554 <em>F. </em>2d 1331, 1339 (5 Cir. 1977), said: \u201cThe fourth amendment is not crushed by the four wheels of an automobile; automobiles do not work a forfeiture of privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Lastly, the police herein noted that \"in all probability\u201d the vehicle would have been released to defendant following impoundment and inventorying. In light of this fact it cannot be said that there existed reasonable necessity for impounding the car since the police themselves planned to release it shortly thereafter. The only apparent purpose for the impoundment was to provide the police with an opportunity to search the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Besides showing that impoundment is reasonably necessary, it is also the burden of the State to demonstrate that the inventory search was undertaken in order to fulfill any or all of the three \u201cneeds\u201d announced by the court in <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, supra. </em>As Justice Powell observed in his concurring opinion, it is precisely because a,n officer conducts an inventory under <em>routine </em>procedures to protect himself and the arrestee, and thus makes no \u201cdiscretionary determination\u201d to search or not, that Fourth Amendment prohibitions are not offended by such procedures. 428 <em>U. S. </em>at 383, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>3092. Conversely, where the search is nothing more than a \u201cpretext\u201d and a subterfuge to make a general, exploratory search, the Fourth Amendment does apply and will invalidate the search. <em>Id. </em>at 376, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>3092.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Evidence that a search characterized as an \u201cinventory\u201d is in reality a full-blown investigatory search subject to Fourth Amendment strictures may be found under the \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d of the search itself. <em>Opperman, supra </em>at 375, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>3092. In <em>United States v. Edwards, supra, </em>the court noted that the alleged \u201cinventory\u201d search turned up stolen checks beneath the carpet of defendant\u2019s car, \u201chardly a likely place for valuables.\u201d 554 <em>F. </em>2d at 1338. The evidence was thereafter suppressed. In <em>State v. Gluck, </em>83 <em>Wash. </em>2d 424, 518 <em>P. </em>2d 703 (Sup. Ct. 1974), the court held that a search of defendant\u2019s car was not sustainable under an inventory theory, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">The record here reveals merely that the officers at trial asserted that they \u201cpalled an inventory search of the vehicle for personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>property.\u201d The record does not indicate that the officers made a complete list of other items in the vehicle nor was it asserted that the' officers completely searched, both under the hood and in the trunk, the entire vehicle after they found the incriminating bag. Without more, it cannot fairly be characterized as an inventory search. [518 <em>P. </em>2d at 707]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">And in <em>People v. </em>Rutovic, <em>Colo., </em>566 <em>P. </em>2d 705 (Sup. Ct. 1977), the court struck down a search of defendant\u2019s car where the officer involved noted that he was \u201choping to find\u201d contraband in the car. The court said of the \u201cinventory\u201d: \u201cIts focus was accusatory, being an exploration seeking to discover incriminating evidence against the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Under the facts of the case at bar, we conclude that the \u201cinventory\u201d undertaken by the officers was nothing more than a pretext for an exploratory investigation. As noted previously, the impoundment could serve no other purpose than to provide grounds for a search, since the officers intended to release the car to defendant, anyway. Second, the officers themselves became suspicious of defendant after finding the empty, glassine envelopes in his pocket \u2014 thus, the motivation for the search. Third, Patrolman Helber implied at the suppression hearing that the \u201cinventory\u201d ceased after the contraband was found. Fourth, the contraband was discovered wedged behind the back of the front seat \u2014 hardly a likely place for valuables. Fifth, the officer noted that the search was undertaken, in part, to discover any \u201ccontraband\u201d which might have been in the car. Eo inventory sheet was presented at the suppression hearing, nor were any police directives concerning \u201croutine\u201d inventory checks presented. It was not clearly established below that the procedure here undertaken was in fact \u201cstandard practice\u201d in the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial judge erred in upholding the search herein under an \u201cinventory\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\n<em>Probable cause and exigent circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">A warrantless search of an automobile may be upheld if it is shown that the search was predicated upon probable cause. <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 <em>U. S. </em>132, 45 <em>S. Ct. </em>280, 69 <em>L. Ed. </em>543 (1925). The automobile exception to the usual warrant requirement is permitted by the courts because it is recognized that \u201cthe circumstances that furnish probable cause to search a particular auto for particular articles are most often unforeseeable; moreover, the opportunity to search is fleeting since a car is readily movable * * <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 <em>U. S. </em>42, 50-51, 90 <em>S. Ct. </em>1975, 1981, 26 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 419 (1970). Additionally, the relaxed Fourth Amendment standard is based on the notion that there is a lesser expectation of privacy in a motor vehicle than in a dwelling. <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, supra </em>428 <em>U. S. </em>at 368, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>3092; <em>Cardwell v. Lewis, </em>417 <em>U. S. </em>583, 590, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>2464, 41 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 325 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The heart of this \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, </em>413 <em>U. S. </em>266, 269, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>2535, 37 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 596 (1973), is the concept of probable cause. The Supreme Court in <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 <em>U. S. </em>160, 69 <em>S. Ct. </em>1302, 93 <em>L. Ed. </em>1879 (1949), offered this definition of probable cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">\u00ab\u2022 5- * Probable cause exists where \u201cthe facts and circumstances within their [the officers\u2019] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the. belief that\u201d an offense has been or is being committed. <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 <em>U. S. </em>132, 162, 45 <em>S. Ct. </em>280, 69 <em>L. Ed. </em>543, 555, 39 A. <em>L. R. </em>790 * * *. [at 175-176, 69 S. <em>Ct. </em>at 1310]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">In assessing the facts surrounding a search, the courts must consider the specialized experience and \u201cwork-a-day\u201d knowledge of policemen continually exposed to the criminal enterprise. <em>State v. Kasabucki, </em>52 <em>N. J. </em>110, 117 (1968). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Further, \u201c[c] ourts should always remember that arresting officers have to act on the spur of the moment and that they are not constitutional lawyers. <em>State v. </em>Romeo, supra, 43 <em>N. J. </em>[188] at p. 206. Judicial review must be \u2018in a eommonsense and realistic fashion.\u2019 <em>United States v. </em>Ventresca, 380 <em>U. S. </em>102, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>741, 746, 13 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 684, 689 (1965).\u201d <em>State v. Contursi, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>422, 431 (1965). In short, probable cause is a flexible, nontechnical concept which must be applied with a practical appreciation of the facts of every-day life. <em>State v. Waltz, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>83, 87 (1972); <em>State v. </em>Williams, 117 <em>N. J. Super. </em>372, 375 (App. Div. 1971), aff\u2019d 59 <em>N. J. </em>535 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">However, \u201c[t]he problem in searches of motor vehicles is the area between suspicion and probable cause. The citizen who has given no cause for belief that he has committed or is engaging in the commission of crime is entitled to proceed on his way without interference.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Valentin, 74 <em>N. J. Super. </em>502, 506 (Law Div. 1962); <em>Brinegar v. United </em>States, <em>supra </em>338 <em>U. S. </em>at 176, 69 <em>S. Ct. </em>1302. A mere exploratory search based upon an officer\u2019s own suspicions violates the Fourth Amendment. <em>State v. </em>Parsons, 83 <em>N. J. Super. </em>430, 444 (App. Div. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In <em>State v. Parsons, </em>supra, the Appellate Division invalidated a search of defendant\u2019s car. The search was instigated after defendant and another drove up to a bank window and attempted to redeem 19 silver dollars. The teller thought the request was unusual and, after defendant informed her that he was from another town, she alerted the police. The police then searched the car and attempted to justify their action by noting that defendant had a large amount of rare coins, was from another town and tried to hide his face from the cashier. The court found the search to be merely exploratory and thus violative of the Fourth Amendment. 83 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The facts in the case at bar which are relied upon to establish probable cause are as follows: (a) the \u201cerratic stop\u201d at the intersection; (b) driving the vehicle for a short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>time on the wrong side of the street, and (c) the nine empty gl assine envelopes found in defendant\u2019s possession. It is significant to note, however, that the last fact was not uncovered until the officers decided to bring the vehicle to the precinct station and patted defendant down. We cannot conclude that these facts, if presented to a neutral magistrate, would provide sufficient grounds for finding probable cause and issuing a warrant. Nothing visible in the interior of the car, as in <em>State v. Gray, </em>59 <em>N. J. </em>563 (1971), or <em>State v. Waltz, supra, </em>gave the slightest indication to the officers that it contained contraband. Further, if the officers were going to charge Super with reckless driving or driving while intoxicated, nothing suggests that further evidence of these \"crimes\u201d could be discovered within the vehicle. See <em>State v. Scanlon, </em>84 <em>N. J. Super. </em>427, 435 (App. Div. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Indeed, after the officers pulled the vehicle over, defendant and Super took no evasive action or made any \u201cfurtive movements\u201d which could have heightened suspicion. The evidence adduced by the State at the suppression hearing affirmatively shows that defendant and Super were coherent, cooperative and possessed of their faculties. Also, this impression is strengthened by the officers\u2019 testimony that \u201cin all probability\u201d the vehicle would have been turned over to defendant after it was \u201cinventoried\u201d at the station. In short, while the officers may have had their own \u201csuspicions\u201d about defendant and Super, <em>State v. Parsons, supra </em>83 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 444, the facts which supported such suspicions did not rise to the level of probable cause. Any doubts engendered by the earlier action of defendant Super in driving the car, should have been dispelled when the car was stopped. At that point, nothing defendant or Super did could confirm in the mind of a reasonable man that an offense had been committed and that evidence thereof would be found in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial judge erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Further, because it is apparent that the decision of the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>to impound the vehicle directly precipitated defendant\u2019s alleged \u201cconsent\u201d to a search of his person, whereby the empty glassine envelopes were discovered, we conclude that that evidence should have been suppressed, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed. It follows that defendant\u2019s conviction must be, and is, reversed also. A new trial is ordered if the State deems it appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-12\">Defendant had also been convicted of possession of said substance. However, defendant\u2019s post-trial motion to vacate said conviction on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the ground that it merged with the indictment for possession with intent to distribute was granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\"> At the outset it should be noted that, despite the fact that defendant was merely a passenger in the seized automobile, the State does not attack defendant\u2019s standing to pursue the suppression motion. See <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 <em>U. S. </em>257, 267, 80 <em>S. Ct. </em>725, 4 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 697 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Note that in both <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Opperman, </em>and <em>Cady v. Dombrouski, supra, </em>the Supreme Court, in upholding the impoundment and subsequent inventory search, recognized that the operators of the seized vehicles were not available to make \u201cother arrangements\u2019\u2019 for safeguarding them. 428 <em>U. S. </em>at 375, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>3092; 413 <em>U. S. </em>at 443, 93 S. <em>Ct. </em>2523. The apparent implication is that if reasonable alternatives exist, impoundment is not warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
