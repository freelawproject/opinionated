Hyland, </em>Attorney General of blew Jersey, attorney for respondent Board of Review <em>{Mr. Michael 8. </em>Bolear, Deputy Attorney General, of counsel; <em>Mr. Marie I. Siman, </em>Deputy Attorney General, on the brief),</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A8e\">This is an appeal from a determination of the Board of Eeview confirming a decision of the Appeal Tribunal finding appellant disqualified for unemployment benefits on the basis she left work for a personal reason and therefore not for good cause attributable to the work. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Claimant\u2019s absence from her work was precipitated by the conceived necessity for her finding a different place to live<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> since the lady with whom she was living was \u201cdriving me crazy\u201d playing religious music. Accordingly, the finding that the claimant\u2019s reason for leaving her work was a personal one might easily have been reached on sufficient credible evidence in the whole record. Indeed, such a finding is inescapable and we will not disturb it. <em>Mayflower Securities v. Bureau of Securities, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>85 (1973). We have consistently held that causes personal to the claimant and not attributable to the work come within the disqualification of the statute. <em>White v. Board of Review, </em>146 <em>N. J. Super. </em>268 (App. Div. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Lor is appellant\u2019s claim saved because she and the employer chose to call her departure a leave of absence. Despite her statement at the hearing that she intended to return (after an \u201cindefinite leave\u201d), clearly continuity of the employment status was not truly contemplated: appellant was looking for a ffiive in\u201d job as a substitute, as she now concedes in her brief. In fact, she subsequently accepted such employment. A leave of absence connotes a continuity of the employment status not conditioned upon such things as contingent availability of employment or change of heart. <em>Lewis v. California Unemployment Ins. App. Bd., </em>56 <em>Cal. App. </em>3d 729, 128 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>795 (D. Ct. App. 1976); <em>cf. Bowers v. American Bridge Co., </em>43 <em>N. J. Super. </em>48 (App. Div. 1956), aff\u2019d o. b. 24 <em>N. J. </em>390 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\">In her <em>pro se </em>brief before us appellant details this search as her decision \u201cto find a job with a permanent live in arrangement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
