We find them to be clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">The question of the scientific admissibility of results of the Mameless Atomic Absorption Analysis test apparently has not been decided in any reported decision in this State. The test is performed on swabbings taken of the back hand and palm of an individual suspected of firing a gun. The wipings are taken with cotton swabs saturated with a nitric acid solution. The results are analyzed by using either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Neutron Activation or Flameless Atomic Absorption. While the State\u2019s expert testified that the latter method was used here, apparently both methods achieve the same results.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">In the Flameless Atomic Absorption Analysis method the nitric acid solution is extracted from the swab and placed on a metal strip in an instrument called the Flameless Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The metal strip is heated, causing the elements present in the liquid to vaporize and form an atomic cloud. A light beam is passed through the cloud at specific wavelengths designed to detect the presence of barium and antimony. If these two elements are found in sufficient quantity, it signals the presence of gunshot residue. Neither barium nor antimony are elements commonly found in the environment. Scientific studies have compared these levels with those from the hands of individuals who have not handled or fired a gun. From the \u201chand blank\u201d studies the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (which conducted the test involved in the present case) determined that levels higher than .2 mierograms of antimony and .3 micrograms of barium indicate the presence of gunshot residue. However, both elements must be found together in the same sample at a quantity higher than that criteria to permit a positive conclusion to be reached. The State\u2019s expert, who personally conducted the analysis of the swabs taken of defendant\u2019s hands, determined that only the sample taken of defendant\u2019s left palm indicated the presence of gunshot residue. The reading of .66 micrograms of barium and .79 micrograms of antimony found on defendant\u2019s left palm indicated, according to the State\u2019s expert, that defendant handled a weapon with the palm of his left hand within four hours prior to the swabbings.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The general rule in this State regarding the admissibility of scientific test results is that if the equipment or the methodology used is proven to have a high degree of scientific reliability, and if the test is performed or administered by qualified persons, the results will be admissible at trial. <em>State v. Walker, </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>208, 215 (1962), <em>cert. </em>den. 371 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>U. S. </em>850, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>89, 9 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 86 (1962); <em>State v. Hibbs, </em>123 <em>N. J. Super. </em>108, 110 (App. Div.), on remand 123 <em>N. J. Super. </em>152 (Cty. Ct. 1972), aff\u2019d 123 <em>N. J. Super. </em>124 (App. Div. 1973). On <em>voir dire </em>both the State\u2019s expert witness and the defense witness offered as an expert agreed that the Elameless Atomic Absorption Analysis method provided \u201cunimpeachable\u201d results in determining the levels of barium and antimony found in the samples tested. The only other jurisdiction which has apparently considered the same question has admitted such results as scientifically reliable. <em>State v. Crowder, </em>285 <em>N. C. </em>42, 203 <em>S. E. </em>2d 38, 47 (Sup. Ct. 1974), mod. on other grounds 428 U. <em>S. </em>903, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>3205, 49 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1207 (1976) (death penalty vacated).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Moreover, the few jurisdictions which have had an opportunity to pass upon the admissibility of the results of gunshop residue tests performed by the alternate method of Neutron Activation have uniformly agreed that that method has sufficient scientific reliability to warrant its admission into evidence. <em>Cf. United States v. </em>Stifel, 433 <em>F. </em>2d 431, 435-441 (6 Cir. 1970), <em>cert. </em>den. 401 <em>U. S. </em>994, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>1232, 28 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 531 (1971). See <em>State v. Johnson, </em>539 <em>S. W. </em>2d 493, 501 (Mo. Ct. App. 1976), <em>cert. </em>den. 430 <em>U. S. </em>934, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>1558, 51 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 779 (1977); <em>State v. Ross, </em>523 <em>S. W. </em>2d 841 (Mo. Ct. App. 1975); <em>State v. Spencer, </em>298 <em>Minn. </em>456, 216 <em>N. W. </em>2d 131 (Sup. Ct. 1974); <em>People v. Pieropan, </em>72 <em>Misc. </em>2d 770, 340 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 31, 32-33 (Cty. Ct. 1973). See also, Annotation, \u201cAdmissibility of Evidence of Neutron Activation Analysis,\u201d 50 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 117 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Defendant here attacks the Elameless Atomic Absorption Analysis, not because of the unreliability of its objective results, but rather for the interpretation and the ultimate conclusion drawn from the test results. Defendant claims that the State\u2019s expert used faulty criteria in determining that the levels of barium and antimony found on his left palm indicated the presence of gunshot residue. Such an argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>however, refers not to the admissibility of the test but rather to the weight of the testimony to be given by the jury. <em>People v. Collins, </em>43 <em>Mich. App. </em>259, 204 <em>N. W. </em>2d 290 (Ct. App. 1972), <em>cert. </em>den. 419 <em>U. S. </em>866, 95 <em>S. Ct. </em>121, 42 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 103 (1974). Under the circumstances we are satisfied that the trial judge was justified in concluding that the Elameless Atomic Absorption Analysis had sufficient scientific reliability for determining the presence of barium and antimony. Thus, the test results were properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The trial judge, however, refused to qualify the witness defendant offered as an expert on this method of gunshot residue analysis. Defendant\u2019s expert admitted that he had never performed this specific test. However, he stated that he had done extensive reading on the subject and was quite\u2019familiar with the problems surrounding its utilization through this reading and study. The trial judge pointed to the witness\u2019 admission that he had never performed the test himself and thus found him unqualified to testify. Defendant claims that this ruling constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">A trial judge is vested with wide discretion in determining the competency of expert witnesses. An appellate court will not disturb the trial judge\u2019s determination \u201cunless a clear abuse of discretion appears.\u201d <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>358, 411 (1960). See also, <em>Rempfer v. Deerfield Packing Corp., </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>135, 141 (1950); <em>Savoia v. F. W. Woolworth Co., </em>88 <em>N. J. Super. </em>153, 161-162 (App. Div. 1965); <em>Rockland Elec. Co. v. Bolo Corp., </em>66 <em>N. J. Super. </em>171, 176 (App. Div. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\"><em>Evid. R. </em>56(2) (b) requires that if a witness is testifying as an expert, testimony in the form of opinions or inferences shall be limited to such opinions as the trial judge finds are \u201cwithin the scope of the special knowledge, skill, experience or training possessed by the witness.\u201d The test of the admissibility of expert testimony has been stated to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">* <em>I * </em>whether the witnesses offered as experts have peculiar knowledge or experience not common to the world which renders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>their opinions founded on such knowledge or experience any aid to the court or jury in determining the questions at issue. <em>[Rempfer v. Deerfield Packing Corp., 4 N. J. </em>at 142]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The manner in which an individual\u2019s expertise is acquired is generally unimportant. A witness may he qualified to testify as an expert either <em>\u201cby </em>study without practice or by practice without study.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>21 <em>N. J. </em>326, 334 (1956); <em>Rockland Elec. Co. v. Bolo Corp., </em>66 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 176; <em>Keuper v. Wilson, </em>111 <em>N. J. Super. </em>489, 496 (Ch. Div. 1970). The modern tendency is to permit expert testimony wherever it would help the jury decide the ultimate issue of the case. See <em>Biro v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>110 <em>N. J. Super. </em>391, 400 (App. Div.) rev\u2019d on other grounds, 57 <em>N. J. </em>204 (1970). Of course, once the opinion testimony o\u00a3 an expert witness has been ruled admissible, his credibility and the weight accorded his opinion are matters resting within the province of the jury. <em>Savoia v. F. W. Woolworth Co., </em>88 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Although defendant\u2019s witness never personally performed a test for gunshot residue, ho was not asked to testify about the mechanical procedures of the test itself. His testimony was sought to attack the ultimate conclusion testified to by the State\u2019s expert that sufficient amounts of antimony and barium were found on defendant\u2019s left palm to indicate that defendant handled a weapon around the time of the shooting. This type of testimony does not call for practical experience in performing the test. Bather it would merely require knowledge of the method and the results of the analysis. Defendant\u2019s witness testified that he had extensive knowledge of the Blameless Atomic Absorption Analysis. Thus, we hold to the view that defendant\u2019s witness was qualified to give the expert testimony sought to be elicited from him, and the trial judge erred in ruling to the contrary. Defendant had the academic qualifications, the \u201cstudy without practice,\u201d to permit his testimony on interpreting test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">However, this error does not require a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. Defense counsel conducted a skillful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>and lengthy cross-examination of the State\u2019s expert. He elicited from the expert virtually all of the evidence he sought to obtain from him. Under the circumstances there was no prejudice to defendant by the trial judge\u2019s ruling in this regard. Beyond this, in view of the overwhelming evidence of guilt, the error did not reach dimensions \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N. J. 325, </em>336 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
