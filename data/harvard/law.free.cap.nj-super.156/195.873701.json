J. S. A. </em>19 :44A-16 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">The questioned contribution was a newsletter, drafted and signed by appellant and ostensibly sent by Western Monmouth Utilities Authority, of which appellant was chairman, to customers and residents of the area serviced by that au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>thority who were also his constituents. He contends that the letter did not constitute a contribution to his campaign and, also, that ELEC should have disqualified itself from considering his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We find that ELEC\u2019s conclusion that the letter was a campaign contribution is supported by sufficient credible evidence present in the record. <em>State v. Johnson, 42 N. J. </em>146, 162 (1964). The letter basically described eight different construction projects undertaken by the authority, made numerous references to the approval and funding of projects by state and federal agencies, and implied that appellant exerted influence in those areas. In addition, there were statements that the authority had received considerable funds \u201cas a result of my legislation,\u201d and \u201c[t]hrough my office in Trenton.\u201d The hearing examiner\u2019s description of the letter as \u201ca subtle masterpiece of political propaganda\u201d containing useful information \u201cbut cloaked in such self-laudatory rainment [sic] as to make anyone but a politician blush\u201d is accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Regardless of whether this letter falls within the definition of \u201cpolitical information\u201d pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>19:44A-3(h), its publication and distribution constituted an \u201cother thing of value\u201d contributed to appellant\u2019s campaign, which appellant was required to report under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>19:44A-16(a). \u201cOther thing of value\u201d is defined as \u201cany item of real or personal property, tangible or intangible.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>19:44A-3(\u00a3), The letter obviously furthered appellant\u2019s campaign effort by its expansive praise of him as both authority chairman and assemblyman. It thus must be considered a campaign contribution consonant with the legislative policy \u201cto require the reporting of all contributions received * * * to aid or promote\u201d the election of any candidate for public office. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>19:44A-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We also conclude that ELEC properly refused to disqualify itself. Although the release of ELEC\u2019s preliminary finding to the press may have been harmful to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>pellant, that in itself did not constitute grounds for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
