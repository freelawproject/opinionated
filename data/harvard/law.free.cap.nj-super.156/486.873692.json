He was charged in five municipal court complaints with embezzling moneys from said library, in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. 2A: </em>102-1, and also with drawing several checks to himself as payee and forging thereon the signature of another library official, in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :109\u20141. He applied on July 22, 1976 for entry into the Morris County Pretrial Intervention Program (PTI). Thereafter, on motion of the program coordinator, an order was entered in Superior Court by the designated judge for such matters adjourning all further proceedings and setting the matter down for hearing on October 29, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The program coordinator submitted to the court a pretrial intervention report in which he expressed the view that \u201cthere seems to be very little prospect that the defendant will commit another criminal act,\u201d and \u201cit is felt that Mr. Markt is rehabilitated.\u201d Defendant was declared to be \u201can excellent candidate for the Pre-Trial Intervention Program,\u201d and his acceptance was recommended. At the hearing the prosecutor objected to the application, essentially on the ground that the crimes charged involved a breach of public trust by defendant over an extended period of time. He argued that to admit defendant into the program would deprecate the position of a public official and lessen \u201cin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>public eye the seriousness of what happens when an individual violates that trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The designated judge agreed that defendant had previously led an exemplary life and was \u201ca significant candidate for rehabilitation.\u201d Nevertheless, he determined that the application should be denied. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">* * * Now, taking the nature of the offense, while it is for a short period of time, less than a year, it has a continuing characteristic. This is not the taking of just one amount of money. It is the taking of six amounts of money over a period from September 29, 1975 to March 10, 1976. It does certainly involve a breach of public trust. *' * * If permission is granted and it would have a tendency to deprecate the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s crime, then it is not appropriate * *\u2022 * Taking into consideration that there is a continuing nature, a pattern, short as it may be, but still, nevertheless, a pattern, that it does involve a breach of public trust and an employee who is a treasurer of a municipality misappropriating funds of the public which in my opinion would deprecate the seriousness of the crime and taking into consideration that the PTI program does not provide an alternative which can be expected to serve as a sufficient sanction to deter criminal conduct in this area the application will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Defendant later pleaded guilty to an accusation charging him in one inclusive count with having embezzled $4,384.88. He was sentenced to the Morris County Jail for a term of one year less one day, six months of which were suspended, and he was fined $500. This appeal followed. It is limited to the denial of defendant\u2019s PTI application. Although the notice of appeal included the sentence imposed, any issue with respect to its claimed excessiveness has been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The contentions are that (1) the lower court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s application for pretrial intervention was the result of an erroneous interpretation and application of the PTI guidelines as promulgated by the New Jersey Supreme Court; (2) defendant\u2019s denial of entry into the Morris County Pretrial Intervention Program was the result of the mandatory application of exclusionary criteria under PTI Guideline 3,(i) (4) which contradicted both the spirit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>content of the PTI guidelines as promulgated by the New Jersey Supreme Court; (3) the record below reflects that defendant did present evidence demonstrating his amenability to the reliabilitative process and showing compelling reasons justifying his admission into PTI and establishing that a decision against enrollment would be arbitrary and unreasonable, and (4) due to the vagueness and uncertainty of the PTI guidelines as promulgated by the Supreme Court, the denial of defendant\u2019s application was arbitrary and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><em>We </em>have carefully considered the record and the arguments advanced by defendant and conclude that the designated judge\u2019s determination to deny defendant entry into the PTI program should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We recently emphasized in <em>State v. Litton, </em>155 <em>N. J. Super. </em>207 (App. Div. 1977), that <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>71 <em>N. J. </em>85 (1976) (Leonardis I), and <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>73 <em>N. J. </em>360 (1977) .(Leonardis II, decided after the hearing in this case), narrowly limits court review of a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to consent to a defendant\u2019s enrollment into a PTI program. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">Its purpose is to allow the defendant to demonstrate an abuse of discretion by the prosecutor. <em>Leonardis II, supra </em>73 <em>N. J. </em>at 383. The proceeding is likened to an action in lieu of prerogative writ, <em>Leonardis II, supra </em>at 377, n. 7, based on the record below, <em>State v. White, </em>145 <em>N. J. Super. </em>257, 260 (Law Div. 1976). To prevail, the defendant has the \u201cheavy burden\u201d, <em>Leonardis II, supra </em>73 <em>N. J. </em>at 381, to show \u201cclearly and convincingly\u201d \u201ccompelling reasons justifying his admission\u201d and that the prosecutor \u201cacted in a grossly arbitrary or capricious manner,\u201d <em>Leonardis II, supra </em>at 382, 383, amounting to a \u201cpatent and gross abuse of his discretion.\u201d <em>Leonardis II, supra </em>at 382; Guidelines, 2, 3(i), 8. In reviewing the record \u201cgreat deference\u201d should be given the prosecutor\u2019s judgment. <em>Leonardis II, supra </em>at 381. His refusal to consent may, \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d be based solely on the nature of the offense charged and it is expected that his decision \u201crarely will be overturned.\u201d <em>Leonardis II, supra </em>at 380 n. 10, 382. Review is available \u201cto cheek only the most egregious examples of injustice and unfairness.\u201d <em>Leonardi</em>s <em>II, supra </em>at 384. [155 Ar. <em>J. Super. </em>207]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s reasons for his adverse- decision in this ease were within the ambit of Supreme Court Guideline 3(i), which recommends that a defendant\u2019s application should generally be rejected where the crime, among others, was \"(2) part of a continuing criminal business or enterprise,\u201d or, more to the point here, \"(4) a breach of the public trust where admission to a PTI program would deprecate the seriousness of defendant\u2019s crime.\u201d Supreme Court Guidelines, promulgated September 8, 1976, 99 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>Index Page 865. In such eases the aforementioned guideline accords the applicant the opportunity to present to the program director, and through him to the prosecutor, \"any facts or materials demonstrating his amenability to the rehabilitative process, showing compelling reasons justifying his admission and establishing that a decision against enrollment would be arbitrary and unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMH\">As we noted earlier, there is no question here of defendant\u2019s amenability to the rehabilitative process. Nonetheless, the judge below endorsed the prosecutor\u2019s reliance upon Guideline 3(i) (4). Defendant argues that he was \"denied the right to distinguish himself from the said class or category on the basis that his admission to PTI was justified, and a decision to the contrary would be unreasonable and arbitrary.\u201d But the record below discloses no request by defendant to present any facts or materials over and beyond those which had been previously submitted to the program coordinator. In fact, his argument on appeal is that he did present below evidence demonstrating amenability to rehabilitation and \"compelling reasons justifying his admission into PTI.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">It is to be noted that the designated judge did not specifically address himself to the latter issue, although his denial of the application implicitly suggested his conclusion that overriding reasons had not been demonstrated justifying defendant\u2019s admission into the program. We think that, where, as here, the prosecutor appropriately bases his rejection on the nature of the offense, in this case a breach of pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>lie trust, the judge hearing the matter should explain at least briefly why, in his judgment, the offered \u201cfacts and materials\u201d are not of such compelling nature as clearly and convincingly to establish that the prosecutor\u2019s decision was arbitrary and unreasonable. See <em>State v. Litton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">nevertheless, we have independently examined carefully the enumeration in defendant\u2019s brief of that which he conceives to be \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for his entry into the program. While they constitute an eloquent plea for leniency, they deal largely with his potential for rehabilitation, which is not disputed. But they gloss over the plain fact that defendant was guilty of a breach of public trust by the commission not merely of a single criminal act, but of a series of embezzlements and forgeries extending over a period of months.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"> Defendant seems to believe that he is being penalized \u201csolely because he was a public employee\u201d held to a different standard than had he \u201cbeen employed as a treasurer for a department store.\u201d He maintains that the decision \u201ccannot be based on the singular fact that defendant was a public employee when the subject embezzlement took place.\u201d He misses the point completely. In its comment following Guideline 3 (99 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>Index Page 874), the Supreme Court recognized that, consistent with <em>Leonardis I, supra, </em>\u201cthere must be a balance struck between a defendant\u2019s amenability to correction, responsiveness to rehabilitation and the nature of the offense,\u201d and that those charged with an offense within the enumerated categories \u201cmust bear the burden of presenting compelling facts and materials justifying admission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Public officers hold positions of public trust, and stand in a fiduciary relationship to the people whom they have been appointed to serve. <em>Driscoll v. Burlington-Bristol Bridge Co., </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>433, 474 (1952). They must serve the public with the highest fidelity. <em>Id. </em>It is, therefore, altogether fitting that criminal conduct amounting to a breach of that public trust should be cause for rejection of a PTT applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>tion, casting upon the applicant the very heavy burden of showing a patent and gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion. We are satisfied that defendant has failed to meet that burden here.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Since we conclude that the order under review should be affirmed, we do not reach the State\u2019s argument that defendant, by his plea of guilty, waived his right to raise, on appeal the denial of his PTI application. But our abstention is not to be construed as any indication on our part of agreement with the State\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
