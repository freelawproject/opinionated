He applied for admittance into the Bergen County Pre-Trial Intervention Program. His application was denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>by the program director \"due to opposition by [the county] Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\u201d He sought to have that decision overruled and applied for an order admitting him into the PTI program. The assignment judge for the county denied the motion. <em>B. </em>3:28(a). Thereafter, the county grand jury returned an indictment charging him with the armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Following the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>71 <em>N. J. 85 </em>(1976) <em>(Leonardis </em>I), defendant sought and obtained an extension of time within which to reapply for admittance into the PTI Program. His new application was rejected because the offense charged had been \"deliberately committed with violence or threat of violence against another person.\u201d Contesting the second rejection, defendant again moved for enrollment into the PTI program. On May 17, 1977, following a hearing on the motion, the assignment judge, referring to PTI Guideline 2, wrote to counsel for defendant informing him that he found that \"it was unreasonable to have denied Mr. Kirchdoerfer admission into the Pretrial Intervention Program,\u201d and, pursuant to Guideline 1, subparts (a), ,(b), (d) and (e), concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">* * * the rehabilitative services offered by the Program can reasonably be expected to deter future criminal behavior by Mr. Kirehdoerfer and that he should' therefore be admitted into the program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The preamble to the May 25, 1977 order granting defendant\u2019s motion for enrollment in the program sets forth a finding by the court that the rejection of defendant \"was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d See PTI guidelines 2 and 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">On May 31, 1977 the Supreme Court filed its opinion in <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>73 <em>N. J. </em>360 (1977) <em>(Leonardis </em>II), holding (at 381) that the scope of judicial review in pretrial intervention matters \"should be limited\u201d; that \"the decision should lie, in the first instance, with the program director and prosecutor\u201d; that \"great deference should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>given to the prosecutor\u2019s determination not to consent to diversion,\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">Except where there is such a showing of patent and gross abuse of discretion by the prosecutor, the designated judge is authorized under <em>It. </em>3 :28 to postpone proceedings against a defendant only where the defendant has been recommended for the program by the program director and with the consent of the prosecutor. <em>R. </em>3:28(b). By emphasizing prosecutorial discretion we ensure that PTI will fulfill one the motivating forces behind the program: the \u201cneed for prosecutorial options to augment those traditionally exercised by law enforcement authorities.\u201d [71 <em>R. J. </em>at 93]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The court made it clear that Pretrial Intervention Guideline 8<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should be read <em>in pari materia </em>with Guideline 3<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Guideline 3(i)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">* <em>* </em>* these guidelines should be interpreted to require that the defendant clearly and convincingly establish that the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to sanction admission into the program <em>was based on a patent and gross abuse of Ms discretion.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">* * * that Guideline 3(i) provides that any defendant charged with a crime is eligible for enrollment in a PTI program. In other words, every defendant is entitled to consideration. However, <em>the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to consent or the court\u2019s denial of a diversion order may, where appropriate, be based solely on the nature of the offense charged. </em>[73 <em>N. J. </em>at 382, emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>We </em>granted the State\u2019s motion for leave to appeal from the May <em>25 </em>order and asked for supplemental briefs to be filed addressed to the standards set forth in <em>Leonardis </em>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u201cUnder the general rule that the status of the law in effect at the time of the disposition of a cause by an appellate court governs,\u201d <em>S &amp; L </em>Associates, <em>Inc. v. Washington Tp., </em>35 <em>N. J. </em>224, 227 (1961), the clarified standards governing judicial review of PTI matters, as announced in <em>Leonardis </em>II, <em>supra, </em>should be applied in determining defendant\u2019s motion for enrollment into the Bergen County Pretrial Intervention Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">On the record before us we cannot discern what disposition would have been made by the assignment judge had he applied the <em>Leonardis </em>II standards rather than the <em>Leonardis </em>I criteria. Thus, in keeping with <em>Leonardis </em>II, the assignment judge should determine whether in the totality of the circumstances presented in this case: (1) the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to consent, based solely on the nature of the offense charged, was appropriate; and (2) the prosecutor\u2019s refusal was based on a patent and gross abuse of his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The May 25, 1977 order under review is reversed. The matter is remanded to the assignment judge for Bergen County for further consideration, findings and determination, consistent with this opinion, applying the <em>Leonardis </em>II standards quoted herein. The reasons supporting his decision are to be set forth in full on the record. <em>B. </em>3 :29.
