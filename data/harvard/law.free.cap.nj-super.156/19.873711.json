The complaint seeks to compel defendant (1) to take action to insure, against any further increase of vehicular traffic on the street; (2) and (3) to restrict Brook-lawn Drive to local traffic only and to strictly enforce all traffic safety regulations, and (4) require the municipality to find a viable solution to said traffic problems before the approval of any further subdivisions which might contribute to any increase in traffic problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\"> There is no dispute that Brooklawn Drive is a municipal street. As such, the sole authority to control and regulate its use by motor vehicles rests with the municipality by delegation from the Legislature, subject only to limited oversight by the State in the approval or disapproval of certain enumerated traffic regulations, if adopted by the municipality. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:48-2; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-197; <em>Samuel Braen, Inc. v. Waldwick, </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>476 (1958). The exercise of that authority within the ambit of the delegation is a matter of legislative discretion to be exercised by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>municipal governing body, by the adoption of general regulations \u201cin the interests of the welfare of the inhabitants [of the municipality] and the persons who use the highway,\u201d which bear a direct relationship to the public safety and are reasonable and not arbitrary. <em>Braen, supra </em>at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">In the present case it is plain that the complaints and concerns of the residents of Brooldawn Road have been brought to the attention of the municipal authorities and that they, in turn, have investigated the problem and have had a number of traffic and engineering studies made by both their own personnel and independent consultants. As a result of their conclusions following consideration of the reports and recommendations of those studies, the governing body determined that the changes requested by the residents were not feasible or practicable, and declined to adopt or enact them.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\"> Where, as here, the governing body of a municipality is vested with and enjoys a considerable degree of discretion in the exercise of its functions, so long as it operates within its delegated authority, \u201cit is well established that the courts will not interfere with the manner in which it exercises its power in the absence of bad faith, fraud, corruption, manifest oppression or palpable abuse of discretion. * * *\u201d <em>Newark v. N. J. Turnpike </em>Authority, 7 <em>N. J. </em>377, 381-382 (1951). There is no assertion in the present case of any such impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Consequently, the action of the trial judge in dismissing the complaint \u2014 whether treated as a motion for summary judgment or as a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action \u2014 was quite appropriate. Eor, quite plainly, on the pleadings, affidavits and exhibits no issue of fact was presented as to whether the municipality was guilty of bad faith, fraud, corruption, manifest oppression or palpable abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Law Division is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
