The damages came to $40,000, $35,000 of. which was styled \u201cpunitive,\u201d the balance \u201ccompensatory.\u201d Four months later (5 March 1965) the trial judge granted GAC\u2019s motion for a judgment N.O.V. Fennell appealed. While there are a number of subsidiary mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ters to be considered we shall be concerned principally with Judge Byrnes\u2019 reason for granting GAC\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He said that \u201calthough * * * [the libelous matter] could well be morally and ethically reprehensible it is not, in this court\u2019s opinion, actionable <em>per se.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Fennell was discharged (honorably) from the Air Force in 1952. He was 22 years old at the time. He drifted from one job to another until December of 1960 when he was employed as a salesman by The Jerome Apple Company and The Apple and Bond Company of Baltimore. The former is the general agent of the life insurance department of The Travelers Insurance Companies; the latter are general agents for Travelers\u2019 Casualty, Indemnity, Fire and Marine departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Although his education was limited and he seems to have had no special skills, he was not without some experience in the insurance business. He was given a drawing account of $125 per week. Although the first few months were disappointing, the sales manager felt (in April) he \u201cwould make a good career agent.\u201d Having a wife and five children to support, Fennell considered this to be the \u201cbest job of his career.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Early in April 1961 the sales manager told Fennell that he had been \u201ctaken off of the draw\u201d which meant that he would no longer receive an advance of $125 per week, tie explained to Fennell that he had not sold enough insurance to justify continuing the advance. Fennell testified he \u201cwasn\u2019t fully aware that * * * [he had been] hired strictly to sell life insurance and casualty on the side * * He expressed doubt that he could get along \u201cwithout some money coming in\u201d so it was agreed that he would receive in cash commissions on any new business he produced. Otherwise his commissions would be retained and applied against the \u201cdraw\u201d he had already received. In the next two weeks he \u201cwent out and sold close to $200,000 worth of life insurance.\u201d He said he \u201creally concentrated on the life, instead of the casualty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">In June 1960 Fennell had borrowed from GAC $1,160 which he agreed to repay at the rate of $58.00 per month. He had borrowed money (which seems to have been repaid) from GAC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>on a number of previous occasions. He was behind in his payments when he went to work for Travelers, a. circumstance he had disclosed to his new employer. Fennell said \u201cthey knew my complete history, when I went to- work there.\u201d Early in 1961 GAC allowed him to pay interest to date together: with \u00a1some sort of a penalty, and as a result his note- became \u201ccurrent\u201d instead of \u201coverdue.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u25a0 He was again unable to make the full monthly payments. :Late in .March the manager (James C. Chambers) telephoned Eennell and asked him if he \u201cwas going-to come in and make a payment that day.\u201d (He had paid $10.00 oh 10 March and $15.00 on 23 March.) Fennell replied he \u201ccouldn\u2019t possibly come in and make a payment that day, because * * * [he] only had a few dollars.\u201d Chambers said \u201che\" was going to get that payment one way or the other\u201d and that he was going to send a man around \u201cto speak to * * * [his] boss.\u201d Fennell said, \u201cIf you do that, it\u2019s going to cost me my' job.\u201d According to Fennell, Chambers replied that \u201che never cared if I worked again\u201d and that \u201cas far as he could see, <em>I would never get a job aumywhere.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) About fifteen minutes later a man from GAC (not Chambers) did come to the office. He asked for Mr. Brown, the president, but Fennell fobbed him off on the sales manager (Mr. Hooper) because Hooper 'was aware of his problems and he was afraid that if the GAC '\u2019man got in to Mr. Brown \u201cthe job would be gone.\u201d Whatever Hooper said or did was effective. There is no evidence that Brown ever learned of the visit;</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Despite the fact that he was now without' regular income Fennell continued his struggle to sell enough insurance to support his wife and family. He was not spectacularly successful but it appears he was making some progress. He sold a number of policies which the company, for one reason or another, had t\u00f3 decline but, as Mr. Brown put it,' \u201cL would say it\u2019s \u2022 [Fennell\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] an average record for a man who' is\u2019 new in the insurance business; you\u2019re going to have policies taken with the zeal of trying to write business that a' mor\u00e9 experienced man would not take; and I would say it\u2019s an \u00e1verage.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"AqA\">On 18 May Chambers dictated and caused to- be mailed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Travelers, with copies to Mr. Brown and Fennell, the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">\u201cTraveler\u2019s Insurance Company</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVR\">Harford [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">Connecticut</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">RE: FENNELL, Robert C.

Mr. Fennell signed a Promisory [sic] Note with our company on June 1, 1960 in the amount of $1160.00. This loan was contracted to be repaid over a period of twenty months at $58.00 a month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">\u201cThere remains as of this date an unpaid balance of $1082.10 with no payments having been received since March 2$, 1961.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">\u201cAll our attempts to have Mr. Fennell pay this moral and legal obligation have been in vain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">\u201cWe realize that the Traveler\u2019s Insurance Company cannot act as a collection agency, however, we feel quite sure they do not condone this type of behavior; in as much as this man is directly or indirectly handling your funds and is acting as a representative of your company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">\u201cIt is our contention that when a man is having financial difficulties, the greater the pressure is exerted the more likely the tendency is to infringe and tip the till.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">\u201cWe feel quite certain that if your office would discuss this matter with Mr. Fennell and his immediate supervisor, Mr. Herbert C.

Chambers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYG\">Manager\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The letter was seen by one or more officers of Travelers .in Hartford, Mr. Brown, Mr. Apple, Mr. Hooper and probably Mr. Dawson, an executive of the Apple companies. It also became a part of the company\u2019s file. Fennell telephoned Chambers immediately after receiving his copy of the letter and asked him why he had done it. Chambers replied, according to Fennell (and it is not denied), \u201che was going to take care of me; they were going to make sure I got well taken care of, right along * *</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Chambers was \u201cseverely reprimanded\u201d by the regional supervisor of GAC and he was told \u201cif it occurred in the future he would no longer be in * * * [GAC\u2019s] employ.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time of trial he was employed elsewhere (in Connecticut). He did not testify nor does it appear that he was deposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Fennell described his relationship with Mr. Brown as \u201cvery good\u201d before the receipt of the letter. Afterwards, he said, Brown \u201cbecame very cold toward * * * [him]. In other words he really wasn\u2019t\u2014didn\u2019t show an interest at all.\u201d Hooper also told him that \u201cBrown\u2019s attitude had changed.\u201d The following excerpt from Brown\u2019s testimony seems to reflect a change in attitude.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A58Z\">\u201cBy Mr. Hill:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t contend, do you, Mr. Brown, that this letter wouldn\u2019t have any effect on being in your file on hiring this man? A. Of course, it would have an effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">\u201c(Mr. Hill) Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-13\">\u201cBy Mr. Psoras:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-14\">\u201cQ. What effect? A. If we were going to rehire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>him, we would want to be sure, first, that he has repaid or made arrangements to repay his account, on the condition that I rehire him, which would be that he would repay the balance, which goes to Travelers Insurance Company, and also that he would be on a commission basis only, rather than on a drawing account.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">It is conceded that Fennell was not actually discharged. He claims, however, that commissions on new business, which he was entitled to receive under the arrangement made with him after he was taken \u201coff of the draw,\u201d were not paid to him but were applied to his indebtedness to Travelers. As a result, he \u201cwas more or less forced out * * *. Without the commissions, * * * [he] had no money to operate with.\u201d As Mr. Brown phrased it, \u201cas is usual in these cases, people have to eat, men take care of their families. He just left, about May of 1961.\u201d He also testified that Travelers had advanced to Fennell a total of $2,000; that Fennell\u2019s commissions (at the time of trial) amounted to $829.96; that he still owed $1,170.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Even after the receipt of the letter Fennell said he continued to spend some time at the office servicing accounts. For a while he had a job as a bartender but he was let go to make a place for a relative of the owner. He received unemployment compensation during the latter part of the summer and in September he enlisted in the U. S. Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and again at the conclusion of the whole case, GAC did not move for a directed verdict and state its reasons therefor, as provided by Maryland Rule 552 a, but instead, on each occasion, prayed the court to instruct the jury that there was \u201cno legally sufficient evidence to entitle the plaintiff to recover.\u201d The trial judge refused the first prayer and reserved his decision in respect of the second. Whether the proffer and rejection of such a prayer (often called a \u201cdemurrer prayer\u201d) can sustain a motion for a judgment N.O.V. as provided by Maryland Rule 563 a 1 is a question which has not been raised in the case at bar and it does not, therefore, require our decision. We observe in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>passing, -however,'that the. Rules, as they no.w, .exist-, prescribe the use of the motion for:a directed verdict and make. \u00bf10 mention of a \u201cdemurrer prayer.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ' \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Judge Byrnes, in,his charge to'the- jury, -declared that the letter was-libelous per se, that-the plaintiff was-\u201centitled to a verdict\u201d arid that- their verdict should be' for the-,plaintiff. As stated earlier, he later changed his mind and directed-the. entry of. the judgment N.O.V. We think he was right the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We shall not have to venture very far into the thickets of the law of libel to find support for our decision.\u2019 Anyone interested in learning just how tangled and how. nearly impassable the \u00fanderb.rush really is. need only observ\u00e9 the controversy <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> now raging between Dean .Prosser <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Mr. Eldredge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Kilgour </em>v. <em>Evening Star Co., 96 </em>Md. 16, 23-24, 53 Atl. 716 (1902), which in our judgment is controlling here, Judge Page, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201cThe declaration charges that at the time of the publication the appellant was and still is a'practicing attorney and the State\u2019s -Attorney of Montgomery County, and that the publication was \u2018of and concerning him in respect of his said profession as a prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ticing attorney and of his duties as State\u2019s Attorney.\u2019 It is not contended that the words of the publication are libelous as against the appellant, otherwise than as they touch upon or have reference to his profession and his official position of State\u2019s Attorney. The rule of law applicable to a case of that kind, seems to be clear. \u2018Words spoken of a person in his office, <em>trade, profession, business or means of getting' a livelihood, </em>which tend to expose him to the hazard of losing his office, or which charge him with fraud, indirect dealings or incapacity and thereby tend to injure him in his <em>trade, profession or business, </em>are actionable without proof of special damage, even though such words if spoken or written of an ordinary person,, might not be actionable <em>per se.\u2019 </em>18 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, </em>p. 942 (2nd ed.); <em>Wilson v. Cottman, </em>65 Md. 197.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201c \u2018The words must go so far as to <em>impute to - him some incapacity or lack of due qualification to fill the position, </em>or some positive past misconduct which will injuriously affect him in it.\u2019 <em>Sillars v. Collier, </em>151 Mass. 50; <em>Newell on Defamation, Slander and Libel, </em>ch. 8, p. 178; <em>Townsend, Libel and Slander, </em>secs. 188, 189.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">\u201cSo this Court said in <em>Newbold &amp; Sons v. The J. M. Bradstreet &amp; Son, </em>57 Md. 53: \u2018To say or publish of a merchant anything that imputes insolvency, - inability to pay his debts, the want of integrity in his business, or personal incapacity or pecuniary inability to conduct it with success, is slanderous or' libelous <em>per se if without justification.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis.supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">In <em>Pollitt v. Brush-Moore, Etc., Inc., </em>214 Md. 570, 136 A. 2d 573 (1957), Judge-Collins, in an opinion adopted by the Court after his retirement, cited <em>Kilgour </em>with approval and quoted some of the language set forth above. He cited also <em>Foley v. Hoffman, </em>188 Md. 273, 52 A. 2d 476 (1947) and his comment in respect of that case is especially interesting and relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">\u201c[T]he defendant, Foley, the county treasurer, published remarks about the plaintiff, Hoffman, who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>been defendant\u2019s chief clerk, which this Court held imputed to the plaintiff, not a particular act of carelessness or carelessness in some particular minor respect, but general incapacity or lack of due qualification to fill the position of chief clerk, and that he was justified in removing him from his staff on the grounds of inefficiency and neglect. It was there held that the demurrer was properly overruled because the words were libelous <em>per se.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">\u201cPlaintiff also claims that the printed newspaper article tended to degrade and expose him to contempt and ridicule. With this contention we agree. In <em>Goldsborough v. Orem &amp; Johnson, </em>103 Md. 671, 64 A. 36, the declaration alleged that the defendant falsely published of the plaintiff and of the majority of the members of the vestry of the church that they did \u2018 \u201crelentlessly turn their back upon legal and moral obligation to the detriment of a rector (meaning the said Reverend Thomas Carter Page) who suffered himself to become debilitated while plodding along the path of duty to his congregation (meaning the congregation of the said Christ Protestant Episcopal Church of Cambridge),\u201d and the defendants meant thereby that the said four members of said vestry, including the plaintiff, voting for the said resolution as aforesaid, and in particular the plaintiff, had relentlessly violated legal and moral obligations.\u2019 On demurrer <em>it was held that this publication zvas libelous per se and such words charged the plaintiff with conduct calculated to make him the object of scorn and contempt of all honorable men. </em>For the same reasons that the article here before us charged the plaintiff with conduct incompatible with the proper conduct of his office, it also charged him with conduct tending to degrade and expose him to contempt and ridicule.\u201d 214 Md. at 579-80.

However, libel includes any unprivileged (i.e. a publication not having an absolute privilege), false and malicious publication which by printing, writing, signs or pictures tends to expose a person to public scorn, hatred, contempt or ridicule, <em>Foley v. Hoffman, </em>188 Md. 273, 284, 52 A. 2d 476; and also embraced therein is any such publication that relates to a person\u2019s office, <em>trade, business </em>or <em>employment, </em>if the publication imputes to him <em>some incapacity or lack of due qualifications </em>to fill the position, or some positive past misconduct which will injuriously affect him in it. <em>Foley v. Hoffman, supra; Pollitt v. Brush-Moore, Etc., Inc., supra, </em>at p. 577.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In the recent case of <em>Heath v. Hughes, </em>233 Md. 458, 197 A. 2d 104 (1964), <em>Kilgour, Pollitt, Foley </em>and <em>Thompson </em>were cited with approval by Judge Marbury, who spoke for the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">GAC argued, perhaps not confidently, that the letter is not actionable per se since the plaintiff was not accused of <em>hcmng committed </em>a crime. In <em>Lewis v. Daily News Co., </em>81 Md. 466, 32 Atl. 246 (1895) it was said of the plaintiff that \u201che <em>would be </em>an anarchist if he thought it would pay.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Judge McSherry (later Chief Judge) in a caustic opinion said, for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">\u201c[T]o publish of another that he \u2018would be an anarchist if he thought it would pay/ is to impute to him the possession of that degree of moral obliquity and turpitude which would mark him as a fit per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>son,-if-he. .-were personally benefited thereby, to-do.the violent, and felonious acts of which anarchists are known or believed to be guilty.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 474.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In <em>Lewis </em>the defendant sought to,mitigate the sting of the publication .by suggesting, that the plaintiff \u2022 was charged merely with being, a. political propagandist .who advocated-visionary schemes;! Judge McSherry said it was \u2018[grossly libelous\u201d and he-paraphrased his characterization, in incandescent language. See also <em>Keating </em>v. Conviser, 246 N. Y. 632, 159 N.

Whatever doubt remains as to. Chambers\u2019 frame of mind, at least in our judgment, is whisked.away by his statement to Fennell in the telephone conversation following the receipt of the letter. In effect he said, I. told you I was going to take care of you and we (GAC) are going-to make sure you get well taken care of. Chambers strove for effective distribution of the publication by mailing the letter to Travelers- (to' the attention' of no' one in particular)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and by'.\u00abending<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> copies to Brownand Fennell.; - ' \u2022 . . n m --</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u2022 In support of \"its argument that-the words'published! were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>not libelous per se GAC cites decisions of this Court and of many other courts. Since we have taken the position that the case befor\u00e9 us is controlled by our own decisions, we shall not undertake a discussion of those of other courts. The three decisions of this Court in which GAC places reliance are not, in our opinion, sufficiently germane to the one at bar to be persuasive. In <em>Stannard v. Wilcox &amp; Gibbs, </em>118 Md. 151, 84 Atl. 335 (1912), the letter written to the employer recited the debt incurred by employee\u2019s wife in connection with the purchase of a sewing machine, and stated that unless the employee satisfied the \u201cjust obligation\u201d (there was some indication that the machine was faulty) suit would be filed. Our predecessors upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff\u2019s declaration was demurrable. The letter (in <em>Stannard), </em>which appellant insisted was libelous per se, was, compared to the letter in the instant case, thoroughly innocuous and only mildly deprecatory. Judge Stockbridge, for the Court, after a review of the authorities, stated the reason for the Court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cIn this case Mr. Stannard was not in business on his own account, he was the local manager for a nonresident corporation. It is not alleged or suggested that he had any occasion for the use of credit, or that his credit had been in any way impaired or affected. The statements in regard to him in no way related to the manner of his performance of his duties as manager of the Holmes Electric Protective Company, or charged him with being unfit for the proper performance of them, nor did he lose his position because of the letter in question, in which case he would have sustained special damage. Under these conditions, and applying the rule of law already stated, the letter can not be regarded as actionable <em>per se, </em>and the trial Court committed no error in sustaining the demurrer.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 158,159.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The defendant in <em>Simon v. Robinson, </em>221 Md. 200, 154 A. 2d 911 (1959) said of the plaintiff that he \u201cfraudulently diverted and converted to his own use\u201d funds deposited with the plaintiff by the defendant. We held that the demurrer was prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>erly overruled by the court below. The words were clearly libelous per se (among other things they charge the commission of a crime) and were not, as claimed, privileged. Our rule in <em>Simon </em>has no application here. Nor, indeed, does <em>Flaks v. Clark, </em>143 Md. 377, 122 Atl. 383 (1923) in which we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201cNow when the words in the headline in the article complained of are read in connection with the rest of the publication they can only mean that the plaintiff refused to pay one of his employees, or actors, all that the actor claimed was due him, and that the actor thereupon cut the curtains of the plaintiff\u2019s theatre, for which the plaintiff had him arrested. This construction clearly does not impute to the plaintiff a refusal or failure to pay his <em>honest debts, </em>or dishonesty or insolvency, or any mismanagement of his theatre calculated to injure or prejudice him or his business. We must therefore hold that the alleged libellous matter does not warrant any of the meanings ascribed to it in the <em>innuendoes, </em>and that the demurrer to the declaration was properly sustained by the court below.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 382-83.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The second count in Fennell\u2019s declaration charged GAC with an invasion of Fennell\u2019s right to privacy in his employment and in his private affairs. Judge Byrnes, in his charge, told the jury damages might be awarded to Fennell if they found that his privacy had been invaded. Although mentioned in both briefs the question was not argued. However, since neither side excepted (in the court below) to the instruction, there is no occasion for us to give the matter any further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The contentions of GAC as cross appellant are many. While most of them are without merit, they, nevertheless, require our consideration. Numbers 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 relate to the matter of damages. GAC argues (6) that Judge Byrnes should not have instructed the jury to find such compensatory damages as they find proper and (7) that he should have instructed the jury that Fennell had failed to prove any special damages. GAC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>failed to note an exception in either instance. In any event, since the publication is libelous per se proof of special damages is not required, <em>Heath v. Hughes, supra; Thompson v. Upton, supra; Pollitt v. Brush-Moore, Etc., Inc., supra; Kilgour v. Evening Star Co., supra, </em>and there is ample authority to support the award of compensatory damages. <em>Evening News Co. v. Bowie, </em>154 Md. 604, 141 Atl. 416 (1928); <em>Gambrill v. Schooley, </em>93 Md. 48, 48 Atl. 730 (1901); <em>Nolan v. Traber, </em>49 Md. 460 (1878) ; Prosser, <em>Torts, </em>\u00a7 107 (3rd ed. 1964). GAC argues further that the trial judge should have instructed the jury to find no punitive damages (8), that he should not have instructed the jury to find such punitive damages as they found proper (9) or such punitive damages as the plaintiff proved (10). Again GAC did not except to the court\u2019s charge, or failure to charge, on the subject of punitive damages. Nevertheless, it is well established that the jury may award punitive damages when the publication is libelous per se. <em>American Stores Co. v. Byrd, </em>229 Md. 5, 181 A. 2d 333 (1962) ; <em>Simon v. Robinson, </em>221 Md. 200, 154 A. 2d 911 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In its 15th contention GAC argues that Chambers had no authority to mail the letter and that the scope of his authority in this regard was for the jury to decide. Although it appears that an instruction to this effect was requested there was no exception to the court\u2019s failure to so charge the jury. The closing argument of counsel for GAC was made a part of the record. That GAC is something less than serious in advancing this contention seems to be supported by the following quotation therefrom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">\u201cListen, I love him; Mr. Fennell is a great guy, has a wonderful personality. He\u2019s married, has children. I\u2019m married. He\u2019s married and has children. I love him, too. We\u2019re all friends; but, because we\u2019re friends, and because we\u2019re human doesn\u2019t mean that G.A.C. isn\u2019t, because it\u2019s a corporation. Corporations have hearts.- They\u2019re composed of people. People make up corporations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">\u201cAnd, unfortunately, James Chambers was one .of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>those people. I won\u2019t comment on his intelligence, or lack of it, rather, but I would say that the letter should never have been written.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">During the trial, counsel for Fennell sought to show that GAC, in an answer to a request for an admission of fact, had made a statement at variance with the trial testimony of one of its witnesses. An objection was made by counsel for GAC but the court did not rule on the objection. GAC contends (14) that the court erred in not sustaining the objection and in failing to instruct the jury to disregard the evidence. There was no subsequent motion to strike nor was there any request for an appropriate instruction to the jury. Even if the question were properly before us, and even if the trial judge did err, it would be an almost perfect example of harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">In contentions 11, 12 and 13 GAC claims the trial judge should not have allowed evidence of the wealth of GAC\u2019s parent corporation, that he should not have allowed evidence of the wealth of GAC and that he should not have instructed the jury that they could consider the means and wealth of GAC because \u201can amount that might be extremely punitive and severe to a defendant of small or moderate means could be light and trivial to a defendant of much larger means.\u201d There is no merit in contention number 11. Whatever harm there may have been in the brief reference to the means of General Acceptance Corporation, of which GAC is a wholly owned subsidiary, was erased by what Judge Byrnes told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">\u201c(The Court) You are only to consider the assets of the G.A.C. No. 3. That\u2019s the Baltimore branch; is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">\u201c(Mr. Psoras) Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">\u201c(The Court) The other G.A.C. Companies or the parent company would have no responsibility in this case. That\u2019s a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">GAC\u2019s balance sheet, as of 25 of July 1963, showed assets in excess of $400,000 and there is no apparent basis for a conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>tion that the jury, in arriving at the amount of the damages, considered anything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Contentions 12 and 13 can be disposed of quickly. Whenever punitive damages are allowable, evidence of the defendant\u2019s means is admissible. <em>Schloss v. Silverman, </em>172 Md. 632, 192 Atl. 343 (1937); <em>Cairnes v. Pelton, </em>103 Md. 40, 63 Atl. 105 (1906). Whether Judge Byrnes\u2019 comment on the punitive effect of the amount of damages in the case of an impecunious defendant vis-a-vis a wealthy defendant is, in the circumstances, prejudicial, is a question we need not decide because no exception to it was noted. Maryland Rule 554 e.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">After the period of limitations had expired Fennell filed an amended declaration. The amendment consisted of three additional counts, one charging invasion of privacy, another charging interference with the contract of employment and a third charging the illegal divulgement of personal affairs. The last two were later abandoned. GAC, in its 16th contention, argues that since the original declaration did not state a cause of action, it could not be revived by amendment after the running of the statute. Since the libel count, which did state a cause of action, was restated <em>in totidem verbis </em>and the additional count charging invasion of privacy was merely a change in legal theory based on the same general aggregate of operative facts, the contention must be rejected. <em>Cline v. Fountain, Etc., Company, </em>214 Md. 251, 134 A. 2d 304 (1957). Fennell asserts that the period of limitations in respect of the invasion of privacy count is three years. GAC argues that such an action is barred ..after one year. Since it is unnecessary for us to do so, we shall not undertake the resolution of these conflicting views.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">In its 4th contention GAC argues that its demurrer to the amended declaration should have been sustained. The only reasons- put forward are that the letter is not libelous per se, that special damages were not alleged and that the suit is barred by-limitations. Since these matters have already been disposed -of no further comment is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Incident to the discovery skirmishes prior to trial GAC filed a motion to dismiss and a motion ne recipiatur. In its 17th contention it argues that the denial of these motions is reversible error. We do not agree. Maryland Rule 417 d leaves this within the discretion of the trial court. Judge Prendergast, who presided at the hearing on the motions, stated fully his reasons for denying the motions and we are satisfied he did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In its 3rd contention GAC argues that Fennell\u2019s motion to dismiss its cross appeal should be denied. Fennell contends GAC cannot appeal from a judgment in its favor. This contention is without merit because a cross appeal must be taken by the party prevailing in the trial court if he wishes to preserve the right to have <em>adverse </em>rulings reviewed. See <em>Reece, Adm\u2019r v. Reece, </em>239 Md. 649, 212 A. 2d 468 (1965) and cases collected in 2 M.L.E., <em>Appeals, </em>\u00a7 353 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">As allowed by Maryland Rule 563 a 3, GAC, having moved for a judgment N.O.V., prayed in the alternative for a new trial. Judge Byrnes, as has been said, granted the motion for a judgment N.O.V. but he did not deny (overrule) the prayer (motion) for a new trial. GAC now contends, assuming we reverse, which we do, that the case should be remanded to enable the trial court to rule on the motion for a new trial. Maryland Rule 563 c 1 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\u201cc. <em>Appeal\u2014Effect of Reversal.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">\u201c1. Of Judgment N. O. V.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">\u201cWhere a judgment so entered by the trial court is reversed on appeal, the Court of Appeals (1) shall remand the case for a new trial if the lower court conditionally so ordered or (2) otherwise may order a new trial or enter such judgment upon the original verdict as justice may require.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">Since we have dealt with all of the matters which might be argued in support of the motion we see no reason for ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>a new trial nor do we see any reason why it should be sent back for a ruling by Judge Byrnes, because he would be required, in light of the views expressed in this opinion, to deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">GAC, acting pursuant to Maryland Rule 835 b 5, moved to dismiss the appeal and cited as cause therefor a violation by Fennell of Maryland Rule 828 b relating to the printing of extracts from the record. We shall not undertake a narration of what came to pass in this regard. While we feel bound to express our disapproval of the attitude and course of action adopted by counsel for Fennell, we are unable to discern any lasting prejudice to GAC, although it is clear that its attorney was inconvenienced and some otherwise avoidable expense was incurred. We shall deny the motion but, exercising the discretion referred to in Maryland Rule 882, we shall require Fennell to pay the cost of printing GAC\u2019s brief and appendix.

Davidson, </em>241 Md. 550, 217 A. 2d 375 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\n<em>Motion to dismiss appeal denied.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\n<em>Motion to dismiss cross appeal denied.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\n<em>Judgment N.O.V. reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\n<em>Judgment entered on the verdict of the jury m favor of appellant against appellee in the amount of $40,000 with interest from the date of the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">\n<em>Appellant to pay the cost of printing appellee\u2019s brief and appendix.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">\n<em>Remainder of costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-15\">.
