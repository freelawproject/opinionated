J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYC\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">This appeal involves unfortunate injuries received by a 5-year old child, while playing on, or near, a \u201cstreet\u201d in Cambridge, Maryland, on May 12, 1962, when the child and an automobile driven by the appellant, collided.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The question which we must decide is whether the evidence, considered in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, and the proper and legitimate inferences to be drawn therefrom are sufficient to establish a prima facie case of primary negligence on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">It is difficult to obtain an accurate picture of the scene of the accident from the record: no photographs thereof were made, and the descriptions given by the witnesses are not easily deciphered. Also, it is impossible for an appellate Court to ascertain with accuracy what a witness means when he is testifying from a drawing on a blackboard and he uses such expressions as \u201cfrom here to here,\u201d \u201cit [the blacktop on the road] goes almost completely over on both sides except for the yards that start somewhere about here [indicating]\u201d or \u201cthis pole to here,\u201d without further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The collision occurred on Cross Street, at about 5 :30 p.m. on a clear, dry day in May. Cross Street, lined with small dwellings, is a macadam-surfaced, 2-way street running east and west; its width was not given, but an estimate or inference of about 21 feet was made for the entire right of way for the road. Toward the east from the scene of the accident at a distance of some 425 feet, it is intersected by Pine Street, which runs north and south. Shortly to the west of the scene Schoolhouse Lane comes into Cross Street from the south and dead-ends there. (One place in the testimony, seems to indicate to the contrary: that Schoolhouse Lane comes into Cross from the north. Whichever happens to be correct has little significance here.) The houses on Cross are constructed very close to the edge of the \u201cstreet\u201d; there are no concrete sidewalks or curbs to define the line between the \u201cstreet\u201d and the properties upon which the dwellings are built; however fences, in front of at least some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>of the houses do run between the houses and the \u201cstreet.\u201d What we are saying is that the best picture which we are able to obtain from the record is that Cross Street has something less than 20 feet of macadam running east and west. To the north this merges with some 4 to 6 feet of gravel and rocks (in the nature of a shoulder), which, in turn, merges with the property lines along which fences, at least in some spots, have been constructed. In the main, it is impossible to tell when the witnesses refer to the \u201cstreet,\u201d whether they are referring to only the macadamized portion thereof or that portion plus the shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">On the northern side of Cross (apparently slightly to the east of its intersection with Schoolhouse Lane) a utility pole is located \u201cin the blacktop,\u201d or macadam (the distance from the edge of the macadam not being established). This pole was being used by the infant appellee and other children as the home-base for a game of hide-and-go-seek, which they were playing on the northern side of Cross. Just prior to the accident, the appellee, according to his own witnesses, was seen to run out from an alley to the pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Only two eye-witnesses to the collision were offered to establish primary negligence: one, Victor Dorsey, a child of 7 years as of the time of the collision; the other, Ruby Jackson, 12, and both were testifying at the trial 3 years thereafter. Dorsey said he was playing \u201ccatches,\u201d (\u201cif he [another youth'] catch\u2019d me\u2014tagged me\u2014well, I would be the catcher\u201d), with another youth about \u201cone-house\u201d away, and gave the following account of how the accident happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">Q.

Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-29\">This witness said he saw the appellant when he came out of Pine Street some 425 feet to the east; he later, in answer to a question as to how far the appellant\u2019s car was away when he first saw it, said that it was \u201cnear about at it [the place of collision]\u201d; still later he again stated he saw appellant\u2019s car come out of Pine Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-30\">Ruby Jackson, the appellee\u2019s \u201csister\u201d (probably half sister), gave, inter alia, the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Q.

Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">Appellee\u2019s mother was in the house at the time of the accident. She came out and found the child lying on the gravel at the side of appellant\u2019s car, which was in the \u201cmiddle of the street.\u201d She put him in appellant\u2019s car, and they took the child to the hospital. Some two hours later after the child had been given sedatives, she asked him if he had run \u201cinto the street,\u201d and the child answered \u201cno.\u201d This last testimony was admitted over objection; for the purposes of this case, we shall assume, without deciding, that it was admissible, because, under the circumstances, it adds little, if anything, to appellee\u2019s attempt to prove primary negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">The appellant testified he had lived within 4 or 5 blocks of the scene of the accident for some 30 years and had been driving a truck for a living for about the same period of time; he had turned right on Cross from Pine Street, driving his automobile on his way home; he was staying on the right of the road, for \u201cdriving for the law you can\u2019t run in the middle of the street\u201d; when about 125 feet from the point of collision, he noticed some 5, or more, children playing in the \u201cyards\u201d; he didn\u2019t pay \u201ctoo much attention\u201d to them, but concentrated on the road ahead of him; suddenly, the appellee \u201crun away\u201d from the other children and ran in front of his car at a time when the front of his vehicle had passed the pole; he applied his brakes quickly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>and heavily, but the child ran into his right front bumper and fender; had he been traveling fast, he would have killed the child; he was going about 15 to 20 miles an hour and stopped within a few feet after the collision; after the collision the child was in the gravel alongside the car; the mother came out of the house and said, \u2018I told you all [the children] to stay out of the street\u201d; and the mother and he took the child to the hospital. This testimony of appellant has not been set forth with the view that it detracts from appellee\u2019s proof of primary negligence, but to show that appellant did not, by admission, add thereto, for the motion for a directed verdict was made by appellant at the close of all of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">An examination 'and an analysis of the evidence convince us that there is nothing therein upon which to base primary negligence except conjecture, pure and simple. The principle that the evidence and proper inferences therefrom must be considered in a light most favorable to the plaintiff when determining \u25a0whether to take a case from the jury on the ground of no proof of primary negligence does not require the taking of iso- ' lated sentences, or parts of sentences, in the testimony, and construing them out of context, without any regard to the rest of a witness\u2019s testimony. The testimony to establish primary negligence must be credible; and that which is incredible should be disregarded. <em>Cocco v. Lissau, 202 </em>Md. 196; <em>York Motor Express Co. v. State, </em>195 Md. 525; <em>Olney v. Carmichael, 202 </em>Md. 226. Cf. <em>So. Md. Electric v. Blanchard, </em>239 Md. 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Appellee\u2019s theory seems to be that he has produced evidence from which the jury could find that he ran out to the pole, \u2022looked to his left, and saw appellant\u2019s car coming. He then stopped running, but took a short step to the south of the pole (no explanation is given as to why there was any occasion for his going south of the pole\u2014the home base)* and stood still; whereupon, appellant, with ample opportunity to have stopped his vehicle or to have swerved it to the left, ran straight into \u25a0 appellee at this point, the contention resembles a claim of last clear chance, a contention not here made).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The proof proffered in an attempt to establish the above was the testimony of a 7-year old playmate, and a 12-year old sister, taken 3 years after the accident. One said the appellee was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>playing in the \u201cfront yard,\u201d without stating whether or not the \u201cyard\u201d was separated from the \u201croad\u201d by a fence; the other stated he was playing in an alley \u201cbetween the houses.\u201d Appellee was being chased by 2 boys. We repeat the first version given by the 7-year old witness, Dorsey. Q. \u201c* * * tell * * * the jury what you saw.\u201d A. \u201cI saw Rodney was by the telephone pole. Then he made a step and [sic] see if any car was coming.\u201d Q. \u201cWere any cars coming?\u201d A. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Q. \u201cWhat did Rodney do?\u201d A. \u201cHe <em>stepped </em>into <em>it </em>[the vehicle or the road?] and then he stopped.\u201d Q. \u201cAnd what happened then?\u201d A. \u201cThe car <em>had </em>hit him.\u201d Q. \u201cWas he moving or standing still when he was hit?\u201d A. \u201cStand [sic] still.\u201d Q. \u201cDid he at any time <em>rum </em>in the street?\u201d A. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We fear that the jury would have had to have discovered a fourth inscription on the Rossetta Stone in order to have deciphered the above intelligently, or with any reasonable assurance of the accuracy of its interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">We shall say little about the testimony of the sister. Apart from its vague and indefinite nature and the fact that it resulted, in good part, from leading questions, its value was greatly diminished, if not destroyed, when she testified <em>at the </em>trial, that she \u201cdidn\u2019t notice the [appellant\u2019s] car coming,\u201d and \u201cafter [she] saw her brother was hit then [she] saw the accident,\u201d and, although she had stated in her deposition that she \u201cdidn\u2019t notice the car coming,\u201d after she had been \u201creviewed\u201d on the morning of the trial she had \u201cchanged her mind.\u201d To permit primary negligence to be based upon such evidence would, in our opinion, be allowing it to be based upon very risky, gambling speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">There was no testimony to establish excessive speed, reckless driving or the drinking of alcoholic beverages on the part of the appellant. And the physical facts were consistent with a conclusion that appellant was proceeding at a moderate rate of speed on his right side of the road and keeping a proper look out (his car stopped within a few feet after the impact according to witnesses from both sides). Both of appellee\u2019s eye-witnesses agreed that he \u201cran\u201d out to the pole. He was being chased by two boys, but no one offered an explanation as to why he was proceeding (whether running, walking, or standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>still) south of the pole, which was past the home-base. The case, we think, falls squarely within the purview of such cases as <em>Olney v. Carmichael, supra, </em>wherein it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">\u201cWe find that the testimony of Leverette [a witness] is too inconclusive, uncertain, vague, and contradictory to furnish a rational basis for a finding of negligence. <em>***,*** </em>if any witness\u2019s testimony is itself so contradictory that it has no probative force, a jury cannot be invited to speculate about it or to select one or another contradictory statement as the basis of a verdict.\u201d See also <em>Eisenhower v. Balto. Transit Co., </em>190 Md. 528, and <em>Moulden v. Greenbelt Consumer Services, Inc., </em>239 Md. 229.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The appellee relies very heavily upon the rather early case of <em>Ottenheimer v. Molohan, </em>146 Md. 175 (1924), but that case is readily distinguishable. There, the facts permitted an inference of excessive speed of a vehicle driven very close to the right edge of a highway by an operator who had seen (or could have seen), for a distance of some 30 feet or more, small children \u201cskylarking\u201d on a cinder apron very close to the edge of the highway. No such situation is shown here. In the instant case, the children were playing in the \u201cyard\u201d (whether behind a fence or not is not shown), or in an \u201calley between the houses.\u201d As stated above, no evidence was offered of excessive speed, reckless driving, or other violation of the motor vehicle laws, which contributed to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">We hold that <em>the </em>trial judge should have granted the appellant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, without a new trial; appellee to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
