They demurred to the declaration. Appellee requested an immediate hearing on the demurrer, and it was twice assigned for such a hearing, but on both occasions it was postponed at the request of appellants\u2019 counsel. Before hearing on the demurrer, the appellants filed notices to take the depositions of 17 persons and 13 orders to issue writs of sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>poena duces tecum. At the request of one of the prospective deponents, Judge Evans signed an order directing that \u201cno depositions be taken for use in the * * * case until after the defendants\u2019 demurrer shall have been ruled upon by this court [the trial court].\u201d Appellants appealed, and no brief was filed by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Apart from the fact that the order seems to be no more than a proper exercise of the authority granted the trial judge by Maryland Rule 405 a 3, it is an interlocutory order from which no immediate appeal will lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed; appellants to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
