Detective Captain James F. Van (appellant), while driving his own automobile north on Frederick Street<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Cumberland, struck Loretta G. McPartland, widow (appellee), aged 68, as she was crossing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Frederick Street. From the $5,000 judgment, entered on the verdict of an Allegany County jury in her favor, Capt. Van has taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">Van contends primarily and principally that appellee was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. He lists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>other contentions but it will not be necessary for us to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">It was clear and cold on 30 January 1964. After a busy day at headquarters Capt. Van decided to leave a little early. No doubt this was one of the perquisites accorded him by reason of his 37 years\u2019 service. Homeward bound he approached the intersection of Frederick and Centre Streets a little before five o\u2019clock. The traffic light controls at the northeast corner were manned by Officer Stanken. Although the light' was green Officer Stanken was expediting the flow of traffic through the intersection with arm signals. Van, \u201cthree or four car lengths\u201d behind the car in front of him, entered the intersection and went on through it. Frederick Street immediately beyond the intersection bears left about 45 degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Meanwhile, appellee, on' her way to Twigg\u2019s store (somewhere west of Frederick Street) was walking along the north side of Centre Street intending to cross Frederick Street. She stopped at the intersection and \u201clooked.\u201d She said she saw Van\u2019s \u201ccar standing over there\u201d waiting for the light to change. She testified she \u201cstarted across the street\u201d and had her \u201cleft foot on [the opposite curb] and * * * [her right] foot in the air when * * * [she] was hit.\u2019.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Van, as he came through the intersection, \u201csaw no one except people standing on the curb, [and] the traffic officer * * He \u201cdidn\u2019t see Mrs. McPartland until she was about a foot from * * * [his] car * * He applied his brakes \u201cjust a fraction too late to avoid the impact.\u201d \u201c* * * [A]t the impact [he said], * * * the upper portion of her body sort of came back on the hood toward the windshield and then * * * when the car stopped [within a foot or two, he testified] she * * * slipped to the ground.\u201d At the time he estimated the distance from the front of his car to the building line on Centre Street to be 26 to 27 feet. Immediately he jumped out of his car and found her \u201csitting in a slumped position * * * right in front of the car.\u201d' Officer Stanken and several bystanders helped him \u201cput her. in the rear seat.\u201d He left immediately for the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Officer Stanken testified \u201cthere was a.good bit of traffic that day\u201d and he had been \u201ctrying- to get the traffic out of Frederick Street.\u201d He recalled that after Van\u2019s car passed him he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201cheard the squeal of tires.\u201d He turned \u201caround and * * * saw the car striking the lady.\u201d He said \u201cshe rolled up onto the hood * * * and fell back down onto the road * * * in front of the car.\u201d She was lying \u201capproximately in the middle of the street * * * about 33 feet from where [he] was standing.\u201d He testified also that (according to his measurements) she was 24 feet from the crosswalk and 10 feet from the west curb of Frederick Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Perry W. Fields, a retired bus driver, helped Officer Stanken and Van put the appellee into the rear seat. He said she was 2 feet in front of the car and about 10 feet from the west curb of Frederick Street. The distance from the crosswalk to where she was sitting in the street, in his judgment, \u201cwas around about 20 or 22 feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">It was suggested at argument that the jury could have found from the evidence that appellee was actually in the crosswalk when she was struck. There were no \u201clines or other marking[s]\u201d (Code, Art. 66\u00a7 2 (a) (9) (1957)) indicating a pedestrian crossing. Counsel argued, however, that since she crossed where \u201ceveryone crossed\u201d a finding that she was in the crosswalk was justified. We rejected a similar argument in <em>State v. Miller, </em>199 Md. 521, 526, 87 A. 2d 401 (1952). Custom or habit, we said, \u201cdoes not entitle * * * [pedestrians] * * * to establish a crosswalk which then gives them the right of way.\u201d Counsel also attach some importance to the fact that Centre Street changes direction slightly at this intersection and that if the lines of the sidewalk are \u201cprolonged\u201d they would enclose an area which would support a finding that appellee was in the crosswalk. But counsel have misread the statute. The statute defines the cross-walk as \u201cthat portion of a roadway ordinarily included within the prolongation <em>or connection </em>of the lateral lines of sidewalks at intersections.\u201d Code, Art. <em>66}4, </em>\u00a7 2 (a) (9) (1957). (Emphasis supplied.) Prolongation of the lateral lines of the sidewalk obviously applies in cases where there is no change in the direction of the street at the intersection. Where there is a change of direction or where some other asymmetrical condition prevails the lines of the sidewalk at one curb should be connected with the lines of the sidewalk at the opposite curb to delineate the crosswalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Appellee does not, in so many words, say that she was in the crosswalk (as we have defined it), nor indeed do any of the witnesses who testified on her behalf. She was shown a photograph upon which she made a mark to indicate the spot where she contends she was struck. Her mark, alongside a utility pole, is about 5 feet west of and clearly outside of the crosswalk. Moreover it seems to us quite likely she has confused the pole standing where she made the mark with a similar pole about 20 feet further up the street and approximately where she was picked up by Van, Fields and Officer Stanken.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Since appellee was crossing between crosswalks she was bound to accommodate herself to whatever vehicles were using the street. In <em>Love v. State, Use of Nelson, </em>217 Md. 290, 297, 142 A. 2d 590 (1958), Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, for the Court, restated the familiar principles of law which are controlling here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201cIt is true that crossing a street between crosswalks has repeatedly been held or said not to constitute negligence <em>per se (Nelson v. Seiler, </em>154 Md. 63, 76, 139 A. 564; <em>Slaysman v. Gerst, </em>159 Md. 292, 150 A. 728; <em>Legum v. State, Use of Moran, </em>167 Md. 339, 173 A. 565), but as was pointed out in <em>Henderson v. Brown, </em>214 Md. 463, 468, 135 A. 2d 881, a pedestrian crossing between intersections \u2018must use the greatest care for his own protection. While both the pedestrian and the driver have an equal right to use the street, the amount of diligence and care needed on the part of each is shifted from one to the other according to where the accident happens. When a pedestrian crosses between intersections, the law requires him to know that he must accommodate himself to vehicles on the road, that he cannot dispute their right-of-way but must cross only as the traffic affords safe opportunity.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">\u201cCases in this State are numerous and uniform in holding that a pedestrian crossing a street between intersections is guilty of contributory negligence if he fails to look for approaching motor vehicles, or, if having looked, he fails to see such a vehicle, and so fails to guard against being struck by it. <em>Webb-Pep</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>ploe v. Cooper, </em>159 Md. 426, 151 A. 235; <em>Thompson v. Sun Cab Co., supra; Jackson v. Forwood, </em>186 Md. 379, 47 A. 2d 81; <em>Billmeyer v. State, Use of Whiteman, </em>192 Md. 419, 64 A. 2d 755; <em>Dean v. Scott, </em>196 Md. 70, 75 A. 2d 83; <em>Males v. Davidson, </em>200 Md. 296, 89 A. 2d 597; and <em>Henderson v. Brown, </em>214 Md. 463, 135 A. 2d 881, above cited. For an extensive review of cases dealing with the rights of motorists and pedestrians under the Maryland right of way law down to 1950, see <em>Due and Bishop, Motorists and Pedestrians, </em>11 Md. L. Rev. 1.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">There remains for consideration appellee\u2019s assertion that she \u201clooked\u201d and that when she looked Van\u2019s car was stopped on the other side of Centre Street. In disposing of this aspect of the case we think it might be helpful to set forth precisely what was said by appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u201c* * * and I stood there for a while and I looked over and I saw this [Van\u2019s] car;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">\u201cQ. Was the car moving or was it stopped? A. It was stopped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201cQ. And did you look? A. I looked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">Q. And what did you see? A. I saw the car standing over there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">\u201cQ. Before you stepped off the curb did you look to your left to see if any traffic was coming? A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">Q. Was there any traffic coming? A. I didn\u2019t see any cars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">Q. If there was traffic coming you didn\u2019t see them; is that right? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">Q. And did you observe a police officer standing in the street directing traffic? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-15\">Q. You did not. A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>^ ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201cQ. Did you look again to the left to look for cars? A. I looked and still the car was stopped there and I crossed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">Q. I want to get the details of this so the Court and jury will understand. You stepped off of the curb and you looked again to your left to see the car; is that right? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">Q. And was the car still stopped? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">Q. Then you started on across. A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">Q. Did you look again? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-11\">Q. You did not look again at any time? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaC9\"><em>Q. </em>So you looked when you were on the sidewalk, you looked once to the left, saw the car standing there, you stepped off of the curb and looked again and saw the car standing there; is that right ? A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-14\">Q. Then you walked on across the entire intersection without again looking to your left; is that correct? A. That is right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-16\">Appellee contends that what we said in <em>Henderson v. Brown, </em>214. Md. 463, 468-69, 135 A. 2d 881 (1957) (quoted below) absolves her of contributory negligence as a matter of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-17\">\u201cMaryland cases have adopted the language of Judge Cardozo in <em>Knapp v. Barrett, </em>216 N. Y. 226, 230, as to one who crosses the street: \u2018The law does not say how often he must look, or precisely how far, or when or from where. If, for example, he looks as he starts to cross, and the way seems clear, he is not bound as a matter of law to look again.\u2019 In Maryland the language, generally if not always, has been applied where the pedestrian was crossing at a crosswalk, it being said that having looked and seen no vehicle, or having seen a vehicle at a distance justifiably thought to be safe, the wayfarer was entitled to assume that an oncoming vehicle would respect his right-of-way. See, for example, <em>Merrifield v. Hoffberger, </em>147 Md. 134; <em>Taxicab Co. v. Ottenritter, </em>151 Md. 525; <em>Shaivitz v. Etmanski, </em>164 Md. 125; <em>Legum v. Moran, </em>167 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>339; <em>Sheriff Motor Co. v. Parker, </em>169 Md. <em>79. The same rule might well apply, under some circumstances, zvhen the pedestrian was crossing where he did not have the right-of-way. If, as he started to cross, he looked, and the view gave him credible assurance of adequate opportunity and ability to cross safely, he might not, as a matter of law, be said to be negligent in failing to look again, although common prudence zvould seem to say that it zvould be better to do so.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">It will be observed that Judge Hammond chose his words with care. He said the rule <em>\u201cmight </em>* * * apply under <em>some </em>circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) He said further that if \u201cthe view gave * * * [appellee] <em>credible assurance </em>of <em>adequate </em>opportunity and ability to cross safely\u201d she <em>might not </em>be contributorily negligent as a matter of law, in failing to look again. We do not see how this language can be applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Van said at least one car preceded him through the intersection. Seifert corroborated this. Mrs. LaMarca said \u201ctraffic was stopped on Centre Street.\u201d Mrs. Dixon (testifying for appellee, as did Seifert and Mrs. LaMarca) said traffic was stopped on Centre Street and that \u201cat that time of the evening there is quite a lot of traffic there.\u201d Perry Fields testified that traffic on Centre Street had stopped and that \u201ctraffic was moving through Frederick Street.\u201d Officer Stanken said the light was green for traffic on Frederick Street and that \u201cthere was a good bit of traffic that.day.\u201d In the circumstances the appellee\u2019s view could not have given her \u201ccredible assurance\u201d that she had \u201cadequate opportunity and ability to cross safely\u201d and her statement that when she looked she saw nothing (on either Frederick or Centre Streets), except Van\u2019s motionless car, must be disregarded as impossible. It will be recalled that she did not say no traffic was there but that she did not see it. Had she looked she was bound to have seen the northbound traffic on Frederick Street. Even if it were possible to accept her statement at its face value it seems to us she could have crossed safely the remainder of the one lane of Frederick Street before Van could have proceeded from a dead stop on the other side of Centre Street to the point where she was picked up by Officer Stanken.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Having examined the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellee and having given her the benefit of all <em>plausible </em>inferences, <em>Dorsey v. General Elevator, </em>241 Md. 99, 101, 215 A. 2d 757 (1966), we must conclude she was contributorily negligent as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.
