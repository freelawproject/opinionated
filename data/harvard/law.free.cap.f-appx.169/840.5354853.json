The district court determined that Simmonds lack standing and dismissed the complaint without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. Simmonds has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-25\">The judicial power of the United States courts under Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution extends only to cases and contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>versies \u201cof the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.\u201d <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, </em>523 U.S. 83, 102, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). \u201cStanding to sue is part of the common understanding of what it takes to make a justiciable case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To have standing, a plaintiff must suffer an injury in fact, that is, \u201ca harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103. \u201cAllegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Art. III. A threatened injury must be \u2018certainly impending\u2019 to constitute injury in fact.\u201d <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 159, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Under the statute at issue, an inmate shall forfeit good conduct time if more than one lawsuit or habeas application is dismissed as frivolous or malicious. Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 498.0045 (Vernon 2004). In his complaint, Simmonds contended only that the statute is an unlawful bill of attainder and that the defendant attorney general should be enjoined from enforcing the statute. In his motion to amend his complaint, Simmonds contended that he already has one prior lawsuit that was dismissed as frivolous. Simmonds contends that he did not file a lawsuit and decided not to appeal the dismissal of another lawsuit because he was concerned that the lawsuit and the appeal would be regarded as frivolous and that he would forfeit good conduct time as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The acts necessary to make the complained of injury happen to Simmonds are at least partly within his own control. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 564 n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). In that circumstance, Simmonds must show that the threatened injury has a \u201chigh degree of immediacy.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Simmonds has not made such a showing. Because amendment of the complaint would have been futile, Simmonds has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to amend. <em>See Lowrey v. Texas A &amp; M Univ. Sys., </em>117 F.3d 242, 245 (5th Cir.1997). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b866-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
