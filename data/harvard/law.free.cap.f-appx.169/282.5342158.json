He argues that the district court erred by determining that his prior Texas felony conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>lence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). This argument is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Dec. 15, 2005)(No. 05-8542).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Reyna-Veloz\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Reyna-Veloz contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Reyna-Veloz properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Reyna-Veloz has shown no error in the judgment of the district court. Consequently, that judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
