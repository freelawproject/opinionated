Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, the parties have commented on the impact of <em>Booker. </em>For the following reasons, we conclude that <em>Booker </em>does not affect Defendant Appellant Ramon Ramirez-Viruete\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">Ramirez-Viruete pleaded guilty to reentering the United States illegally following removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, an offense that is punishable by up to two years imprisonment. At his sentencing\u2014 which occurred prior to <em>Booker </em>\u2014 the district court increased Ramirez-Viruete\u2019s offense level under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines by eight levels, because he had a prior aggravated felony conviction. The court then sentenced RamirezViruete to 30 months imprisonment. Ramirez-Viruete appealed his sentence, arguing that it violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. After we affirmed in an unpublished opinion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ramirez-Viruete petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, asserting his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time. The Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We again affirm Ramirez-Viruete\u2019s sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AAG\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b898-17\">Ramirez-Viruete raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his petition for a writ of certiorari. We will therefore review his <em>Booker </em>claim only in the presence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although we have yet to flesh out the contours of precisely what constitutes \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d we know that the extraordinary circumstances standard is more onerous than the plain error standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If, therefore, Ramirez-Viruete can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>not meet the requirements of plain error review, he certainly cannot satisfy the requirements of extraordinary circumstances review. So, despite the fact that RamirezViruete argues that the extraordinary circumstances standard is inapplicable in this case for a variety of reasons, because \u2014 as Ramirez-Viruete concedes \u2014 he cannot meet the lower plain error standard, we need not address his arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the circumstances in a case meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under <em>Booker, </em>a district court\u2019s sentencing of a defendant under mandatory Sentencing Guidelines (1) constitutes error that (2) is plain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry for which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He will carry this burden only if he can \u201cshow[ ] that the error \u2018must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That may be shown, in turn, by the defendant\u2019s \u201cdemonstrating] a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To demonstrate such a probability, the defendant must identify in the record an indication that the \u201csentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory [Guidelines] scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">In his supplemental letter brief, Ramirezr-Viruete concedes that <em>\u201cMares </em>appears to foreclose [his] plain-error claim in this circuit.\u201d Specifically, Ramirez-Viruete is unable to point to any indication in the record that there is a probability that the sentencing judge would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Instead, he preserves a challenge to the standard of review we adopted in <em>Mares, </em>arguing that in <em>Mares </em>we got it wrong and the plain error standard employed by other courts (the Sixth Circuit, for example<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>) gets it right. <em>Mares </em>is the settled law of this circuit, however, and we may revisit it only <em>en banc </em>or following a Supreme Court decision that actually or effectively overturns it. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Ramirez-Viruete\u2019s sentence is affirmed. We therefore need not address the government\u2019s pending Motion to Reinstate Prior Affirmance of Appellant\u2019s Conviction and Sentence in Lieu of Filing Supplemental <em>Booker </em>Brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">AFFIRMED; motion DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
