At sentencing, the district court enhanced Magdaleno\u2019s base offense level by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) because it determined that he had been con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>victed in a Washington state court of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d namely assault in the second degree with a special finding of sexual motivation. The district court also included two points to Magdaleno\u2019s criminal history score because it concluded that Magdaleno committed the instant offense less than two years following release from custody for the state assault offense. Magdaleno challenges his sentence on three grounds, claiming that: 1) section 1326(b) is unconstitutional; (2) the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>United States v. Booker;</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and 3) his prior conviction for assault in the second degree does not constitute a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(a). We vacate Magdaleno\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">As an initial matter, Magdaleno argues that because the indictment did not allege a prior conviction, it charged only a violation of \u00a7 1326(a) and under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>his sentence violated due process because it exceeded the two-year maximum punishment for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although Magdaleno contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Magdaleno concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, raising it here solely to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-17\">Magdaleno next argues that the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines system held unconstitutional in <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The government concedes that Magdaleno preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>claim of error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The sentencing transcript is devoid of evidence that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory regime, and, therefore, the government has not borne its burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error was harmless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate Magdaleno\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing. In the interest of judicial efficiency and to provide guidance on remand, we address whether Magdaleno\u2019s prior assault-in-the-second-degree conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-18\">Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a sixteen-level enhancement of a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d An offense constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d if (1) it has the use of force against another as an element of the offense, or (2) it fits within an enumerated list, which includes an \u201caggravated assault\u201d and \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The government contends that Magdaleno\u2019s prior conviction for assault in the second degree is a crime of violence under both definitions. Because we conclude that Magdaleno\u2019s prior conviction \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force[,]\u201d we need not address whether it is an \u201caggravated assault\u201d or \u201cforcible sex offense.\u201d We review the district court\u2019s characterization of Magdaleno\u2019s prior conviction <em>de novo</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">In determining whether a prior conviction of a non-enumerated offense is a conviction for a crime of violence, this court \u201clooks to the elements of the crime, not the defendant\u2019s actual conduct in committing it.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, \u201cthe statute of conviction, not the defendant\u2019s underlying conduct, is the proper focus.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, if the statute contains multiple, disjunctive subsections, we may look \u201cbeyond the statute to certain \u2018conclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt\u2019 in order to determine which particular statutory alternative applies to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nevertheless, these records, which \u201care generally limited to the \u2018charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant ] assented[,]\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> may not be used to conclude that force is an element of the statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201c[ajlthough the actual conduct described in the indictment[ ] could be construed to involve the use of physical force against the person of another, that is \u2018irrelevant\u2019 in determining whether physical force is in fact an element of the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Instead, the relevant question is whether the government must prove the intentional use of force to sustain a conviction under the particular statutory alternative at issue.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cIf any set of facts would support a conviction without proof of that component, then the component most decidedly is not an element \u2014 implicit or explicit \u2014 of the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">Magdaleno was convicted of assault in the second degree with a special finding of sexual motivation, in violation of Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.36.021(l)(e). Subsection 9A.36.021(l)(e) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the second degree if he or she, under circumstances not amounting to assault in the first degree ... [w]ith intent to commit a felony, assaults another....\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The statute further provides that a special finding of \u201csexual motiv\u00e1<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>tion\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> renders the offense a class A felony rather than a class B felony.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Because the term \u201cassault\u201d is not defined by statute, Washington courts apply its common-law definition,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which recognizes three types of assault: \u201c(1) an attempt, with unlawful force, to inflict bodily injury upon another; (2) an unlawful touching with criminal intent; and (3) putting another in apprehension of harm whether or not the actor intends to inflict or is incapable of inflicting harm.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Magdaleno argues that under the second common-law definition of assault (unlawful touching with criminal intent), a defendant can be convicted of violating subsection 9A.36.021(l)(e) by merely touching someone with intent to commit a felony, and therefore, the intentional use of force is not an element of the offense<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As Magdaleno recognizes, subsection 9A.36.021(l)(e) does not criminalize mere touching. Rather, the statutory provision outlaws unlawful touching with intent to commit a felony. Therefore, the issue is whether the government must prove the intentional use of force to sustain a conviction of assault in the second degree for unlawful touching with intent to commit a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Under Washington law, an \u201cunlawful touching\u201d is a non-privileged touching that is harmful or offensive.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In a recent unpublished opinion, <em>United States v. Sanchez-Torres,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we addressed whether a defendant\u2019s convictions in Washington state court for assault in the fourth degree<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> were crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(E). We concluded that they were not because a \u2018Washington state prosecutor may secure a conviction for fourth degree assault by proving that there was an intentional touching that [was] either \u2018harmful\u2019 or \u2018offensive\u2019.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>We noted that \u201cwhile a \u2018harmful\u2019 touching likely involves as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of destructive or violent force ..., an offensive touching may not involve such an element.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201cthe mere fact that Sanchez-Torres was convicted for fourth degree assault d[id] not demonstrate that the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force is an essential element necessary to support that conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Because \u201cthe record [was] devoid of any additional evidence, such as the judgment of conviction, or the plea colloquy, from which we [could] ascertain the essential elements of Sanchez-Torres\u2019s Washington fourth degree assault convictions, we [could] not categorically determine those convictions to be crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(E).\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">In this case, however, the record contains the charging document that led to Magdaleno\u2019s second-degree-assault conviction. Therefore, we can ascertain the essential elements of Magdaleno\u2019s conviction for assault in the second degree and can determine whether Magdaleno\u2019s alleged intentional touching was harmful or offensive. The charging document states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-5\">RAUL MAGDALENO-SANCHEZ [is accused] of the crime of Assault in the Second Degree, committed as follows: that the defendant RAUL MAGDALENO-SANCHEZ in King County, Washington on or about August 19, 2002, with intent to commit the felony of Rape in the Second Degree, did intentionally assault [the victim]; [c]ontrary to RCW 9A.36.021(l)(e) ... with sexual motivation, that is: that one of the purposes for which the defendant committed this crime was for the purpose of his sexual gratification....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">Under Wash. Rev.Code. Ann. \u00a7 9A.44.050(1), \u201ca person is guilty of rape in the second degree, when, under circumstances not constituting rape in the first degree, the person engages in sexual intercourse with another person: (a) [b]y forcible compulsion; or (b) when the victim is incapable of consent by reason of being physically helpless or mentally incapacitated.... \u201d Additionally, Magdaleno\u2019s plea agreement stipulated that the trial \u201ccourt, in sentencing, may consider as real and material facts information ... in [a] certification[ ] of probable cause.\u201d An attached police certification indicates that Magdaleno grabbed the victim by the hair, forced her to perform oral sex on him, punched her repeatedly in the head, tore off her blouse and bra, pushed her face into a chain link fence, and began strangling her before she could get away. We may not use these \u201cexplicit factual findings ... to which [Magdaleno] assented\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> to conclude that force is an element of the statute, but may use them \u201cfor the limited purpose of determining which of a series of disjunctive elements [Magdaleno]\u2019s conviction satisfies.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The \u201cconclusive records made or used in adjudicating [Magdaleno\u2019s] guilt\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> allow us to \u201cpare down\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the assault-in-the-second-degree statute under which Magdaleno was convicted, leaving us with the offense of unlawful touching that is harmful (as opposed to offensive) with the intent to commit a felony. Because the government can not sustain a conviction for this \u201cpared-down\u201d offense without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>proving the use of force, we conclude that Magdaleno\u2019s prior conviction was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\"># * \u2756</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing in accord with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b856-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
