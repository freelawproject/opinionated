Unlike Pintor\u2019s relatively minor role in the offense, Ramos acted as the supplier of methamphetamine and participated in planning the transaction that resulted in his arrest. Pintor\u2019s dismissal does not make it any more or less probable that Ramos was innocent, and the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Pintor was therefore not relevant to Ramos\u2019s case. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401. Even if the evidence is considered relevant, it was properly excluded because the evidence was cumulative of trial testimony that showed the questionable character of the co-defendants who testified against Ramos. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion when it excluded the Pintor motion. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>210 F.3d 311, 314 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Second, Pintor argues that the district court erred when it applied a sentencing enhancement for possession of a firearm pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Ramos argues that there was no direct evidence that he reasonably foresaw that weapons would be involved in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">One of Ramos\u2019s co-defendants dropped a firearm when law enforcement officials attempted to arrest him after he had delivered drugs to the undercover officer. Another firearm was found in the trunk of a vehicle that was used in the drug transaction and that belonged to one of Ramos\u2019s co-defendants. Evidence thus establishes that a codefendant knowingly possessed a gun while he and Ramos jointly engaging in concerted criminal activity involving a quantity of narcotics sufficient to support an inference of intent to distribute. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 574 (5th Cir.1997). The sentencing court therefore did not commit error, clear or otherwise, when it inferred that Ramos should have foreseen his codefendants\u2019s possession of a dangerous weapon and applied the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) weapons enhancement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b892-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
