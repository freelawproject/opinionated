Reyes now challenges two conditions of supervised release imposed by the district court. Reyes first argues that the district court erred in ordering him to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample as a condition of supervised release and that this condition should be vacated. We dismiss this claim for lack of jurisdiction because it is not ripe for review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Reyes also contends that the district court erred in imposing a condition of supervised release that forbids him from accessing the Internet, save for employment purposes that are approved by his probation officer. This argument is reviewed for plain error only due to Reyes\u2019s failure to raise an appropriate objection in the district court. <em>See United States v. Phipps, </em>319 F.3d 177, 192 (5th Cir.2003). Reyes relies primarily on law from other circuits, and his attempt to distinguish a substantially similar Fifth Circuit case is unpersuasive. <em>See United States v. Paul, </em>274 F.3d 155, 169-70 (5th Cir.2001) (upholding a total prohibition on computer or Internet usage as a condition of the defendant\u2019s supervised release). Consequently, he has failed to demonstrate any clear or obvious error on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AYr\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
