He also argues that the case should be remanded because the IJ did not address his claim for relief under the CAT. Finally, he asks this court to extend his grant of voluntary departure during the pendency of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-22\">Because Allmeta has failed to show that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against the IJ\u2019s determination that he is not entitled to asylum, we must affirm that finding. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, 78 </em>F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Because he does not specifically challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for withholding of removal, that issue is deemed abandoned. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-23\">The IJ\u2019s consideration of Allmeta\u2019s CAT claim was sufficient. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 140 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, there is no need to remand the case for further consideration. Allmeta\u2019s request for an extension of voluntary departure, assuming we have the authority to consider it, is denied. <em>See Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 169, 171-72 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-24\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
