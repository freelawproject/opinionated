Estrada argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in imposing a sentence under a mandatory guideline scheme, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the written plea agreement does not foreclose review of this argument, we review it for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267,163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Estrada concedes that he cannot demonstrate that the district court would likely have sentenced him differently under an advisory sentencing scheme. His argument that this error is structural, or at least presumptively prejudicial, is foreclosed, <em>see United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600-01 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005), and his argument that we require proof by a preponderance of the evidence that this error affected his substantial rights lacks merit. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521; <em>Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Estrada\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Estrada contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Estrada properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"ABl\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
