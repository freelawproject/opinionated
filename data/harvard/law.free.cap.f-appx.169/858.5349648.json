Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, the parties have commented on the impact of <em>Booker. </em>For the following reasons, we conclude that <em>Booker </em>does not affect Defendant-Appellant Alfredo Gonzalez-Trejo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">Gonzalez-Trejo, a citizen of Mexico, pleaded guilty to and was convicted of reentering the United States illegally following removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Standing alone, a \u00a7 1326(a) offense carries a maximum penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment and one year of supervised release. Gonzalez-Trejo\u2019s \u00a7 1326(a) offense, however, did not stand alone: Prior to his removal from the United States, Gonzalez-Trejo was convicted of an aggravated felony, which, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), increased the maximum penalty for his \u00a7 1326(a) offense to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. At his sentencing\u2014 which occurred prior to <em>Booker </em>\u2014 Gonzalez-Trejo\u2019s prior conviction also led to a 16-level increase in his offense level under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Following the Guidelines, the court sentenced Gonzalez-Trejo to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. Gonzalez-Trejo objected to the sentence on the ground that it exceeded the maximum authorized by \u00a7 1326(a), but the district court overruled his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">Gonzalez-Trejo then appealed his sentence to this court, arguing that it exceeded the statutory maximum in violation of his rights under the Fifth Amendment because the indictment charging him with a \u00a7 1326(a) offense did not separately state a \u00a7 1326(b) offense. After we affirmed his sentence in an unpublished opinion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gonzalez-Trejo petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, asserting his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time. The Supreme Court granted Gonzalez-Trejo\u2019s petition, vacated our judgment affirming his sentence, and remanded to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We again affirm Gonzalez-Trejo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AGM1\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b885-18\">Gonzalez-Trejo raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his petition for a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>of certiorari. We will therefore review his <em>Booker </em>claim only in the presence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although we have yet to flesh out the contours of precisely what constitutes \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d we know that the extraordinary circumstances standard is more onerous than the plain error standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If, therefore, Gonzalez-Trejo cannot meet the requirements of plain error review, he certainly cannot satisfy the requirements of extraordinary circumstances review. And Gonzalez-Trejo cannot; as he concedes, his claim does not survive plain error review. We therefore need not address his argument that, for a variety of reasons, the extraordinary circumstances standard is inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the circumstances in a case meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under <em>Booker, </em>a district court\u2019s sentencing of a defendant under the formerly-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines (1) constitutes error that (2) is plain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry for which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He will carry this burden only if he can \u201cshow[] that the error \u2018must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That may be shown, in turn, by the defendant\u2019s \u201cdemonstration of] a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To demonstrate such a probability, the defendant must identify in the record an indication that the \u201csentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory [Guidelines] scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By all accounts, this burden is \u201cdifficult\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014but not impossible<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014 to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">In his supplemental letter brief, Gonzalez-Trejo concedes that <em>\u201cMares </em>appears to foreclose [his] plain-error claim in this circuit.\u201d Specifically, Gonzalez-Trejo is unable to point to any indication in the record that there is a probability that the sentencing judge would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Instead, he preserves a challenge to the standard of review we adopted in <em>Mares, </em>arguing that in <em>Mares </em>we got it wrong and the plain error standard employed by other courts (the Sixth Circuit, for example<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>) gets it right. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number><em>Mares </em>is the settled law of this circuit, however, and we may revisit it only <em>en banc </em>or following a Supreme Court decision that actually or effectively overturns it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Gonzalezr-Trejo\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
