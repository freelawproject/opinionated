Although the Government seeks to dismiss GareiaHerrera\u2019s appeal as barred by the appellate waiver provision in his plea agreement, we need not decide whether the waiver precludes consideration of the instant appeal as Garcia-Herrera\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Garcia-Herrera contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Garcia-Herrera properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. His sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
