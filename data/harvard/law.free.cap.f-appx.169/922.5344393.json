Delafosse\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Delafosse challenges the district court\u2019s application of the physical-injury requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e) to bar his First Amendment claim for compensatory damages due to denial of a religious diet. This court has rejected Delafosse\u2019s argument. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 374-75 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-20\">The district court dismissed as moot Delafosse\u2019s claim for injunctive relief based on the denial of a religious diet, because Delafosse had been moved to another prison facility. In his IFP motion and brief, Delafosse notes in his recitation of the procedural history of his case that he had filed a post-judgment motion contending that the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were moot was based on a mistake of fact.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> He does not mention the mootness determination at any other point in his IFP motion or brief. Therefore, he has failed to brief this issue and thereby abandoned it. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-21\">Because Delafosse has not identified a non-frivolous issue for appeal, his motion for IFP status on appeal is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b949-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A5R\"> In his post-judgment motion, Delafosse asserted that prior to the magistrate judge's issuance of his report and recommendation, he had been returned to Angola, the prison at which he had been denied a religious diet.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
