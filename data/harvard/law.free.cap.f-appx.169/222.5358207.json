Roberts moves to supplement the record; his motion to supplement is DENIED. Roberts also moves for leave to appear for oral argument; that motion too is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The record does not indicate that Roberts complied with the requirements of FedR.CivP. 4 for the service of summons and proof of service, despite having been put on notice that his attempts to comply were deficient and having been given two opportunities to comply. The dismissal of Roberts\u2019s complaint without prejudice was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Lindsey v. United States R.R.
