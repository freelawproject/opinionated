Betancourt-Cruz was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 57 months, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. We need not decide the applicability of the waivers in this case because the issues raised by Betancourt-Cruz are without arguable merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Betancourt \u2014 Cruz argues that his sentence under the mandatory guidelines system was plain error that affected his substantial rights because the district court would have imposed a different sentence under an advisory guidelines system. He relies on the fact that the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the sentencing guidelines range. He also contends that the sentence affected the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">In the remedial portion of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220,125 S.Ct. 738, 764-65, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court excised 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) of the Sentencing Reform Act, rendering the Federal Sentencing Guidelines effectively advisory. After <em>Booker, </em>it is clear that application of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in their mandatory form constitutes error that is plain. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). Betancourt-Cruz must show that the error affected his substantial rights, and he has not done so. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733-34. His sentence at the bottom of the sentencing guidelines range is not sufficient to make the required showing. <em>See United States v. Bringier, 405 </em>F.3d 310, 318 n. 4 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 264,163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-19\">Betancourt-Cruz argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(2) are unconstitutional, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s suggestion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-20\">Betancourt \u2014 Cruz\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States. </em>Although BetancourtCruz contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Betancourt-Cruz properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
