Mora-Granados\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Mora-Granados properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>Mora-Granados contends that his sentence must be vacated because he was sentenced pursuant to mandatory guidelines that were held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Although he asserts that the error in his case is structural and not susceptible of harmless error analysis, we have rejected this specific argument. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">In the alternative, Mora-Granados contends that the government cannot show that the sentencing error was harmless. We review this preserved challenge to the sentence for harmless error under Fed. R.CkimJP. 52(a). <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The government concedes that the record does not indicate that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory guidelines regime. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170-71 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1444, 164 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006) (No. 05-8843). Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b934-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
