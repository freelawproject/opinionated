Renee Baker, formerly employed as a police officer by Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland (\u201cthe County\u201d), appeals a district court order granting summary judgment to the County on her claims for gender discrimination, retaliation, and constructive discharge, all pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l), 2000e-3(a) (West 2003). The district court held that Baker\u2019s gender discrimination claim failed because she had not shown that the nondiscriminatory reasons given by the County for not promoting her were pretextual. Regarding Baker\u2019s retaliation claim, the district court determined that Baker had not established a causal connection between her filing of discrimination complaints and any adverse employment action. As to Baker\u2019s constructive discharge claim, the district court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>show that the County had deliberately subjected Baker to intolerable working conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law, we conclude that the district court correctly decided the issues before it. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Baker v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>No. RWT-02-3085, Hr\u2019g Tr. (D.Md. Sept. 27, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
