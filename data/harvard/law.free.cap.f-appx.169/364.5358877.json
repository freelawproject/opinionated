He argues that the district court committed reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the guidelines. As the Government concedes, Arellano preserved this issue for review by raising an objection based upon <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), in the district court. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 462-63 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the question before us \u201cis whether the government has met its burden to show harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The district court erred by sentencing Arellano under the mistaken belief that the guidelines were mandatory. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). While the district court denied Arellano\u2019s request for a downward departure, it sentenced him at the low end of the guidelines range and did not state what sentence it would impose if the guidelines were held unconstitutional. In these circumstances, the Government has not met its \u201carduous burden\u201d of showing that the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we vacate Arellano\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Arellano\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Arellano contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Arellano properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
