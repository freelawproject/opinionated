She argues that the district court erroneously calculated her criminal history category for purposes of applying the United States Sentencing Guidelines by considering a prior, uncounseled misdemeanor conviction of possessing marijuana when assessing her criminal history points. She contends that her waiver of the right to counsel in that case was invalid because the district court failed to inform her that she was entitled to be represented during her guilty plea by court appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The records pertaining to Mehis\u2019s conviction of possessing marijuana indicate that Mehis knowingly and voluntarily waived her right to be represented by counsel when she entered her guilty plea. <em>See Iowa v. Tovar, </em>541 U.S. 77, 88-94, 124 S.Ct. 1379, 158 L.Ed.2d 209 (2004). Accordingly, the district court did not misapply the Sentencing Guidelines by using Mehis\u2019s prior conviction for purposes of determining her criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The judgment of the district courts is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b883-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
