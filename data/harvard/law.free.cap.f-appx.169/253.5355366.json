For the first time on appeal, Garza argues that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-23\">Garza\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the Guidelines is \u201cstructural\u201d and \u201cnot susceptible to harmless error analysis\u201d has been rejected as inconsistent with this court\u2019s analysis in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). <em>See e.g., United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005). In order to obtain relief, Garza must demonstrate plain error. <em>See Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 600; <em>see also United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-28\">The district court\u2019s mandatory application of the Guidelines constitutes error that is plain. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733; <em>Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 600. However, Garza has failed to show that the error affected his substantial rights. Athough the district court was sympathetic to Garza and sentenced him at the low end of the guidelines range, nothing in the record indicates that it would have sentenced Garza to a lesser sentence if it knew that the Guidelines were merely advisory. <em>See United States v. Creech, </em>408 F.3d 264, 272 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 777, 163 L.Ed.2d 602 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>(2005); <em>United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 <em>&amp; </em>n. 14 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005). \u201cNeither is a sentencing judge\u2019s mere summary of sentencing law as it existed at the time sufficient, where, as here, the summary contains no indication that the district court wished to impose a different sentence.\u201d <em>See Creech, </em>408 F.3d at 272. Accordingly, Garza has not satisfied the plain error test.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Also for the first time on appeal, Garza argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466,120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Garza\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Garza contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Garza properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Garza\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
