They entered the United States on June 25, 1992, on a six-month tourist visa that expired on December 24,1992. Because they overstayed their visit, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) commenced removal proceedings against them by filing Notices to Appear (\u201cNTAs\u201d) on March 2, 1998.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At a hearing before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) on May 1, 1998, Petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ers admitted the allegations of the NTA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 6, 1998, the IJ convened a hearing to entertain Petitioners\u2019 applications for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1537. Petitioners presented the testimony of themselves and their two daughters, Christina and Andrea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Tiberius Mots is of \u201chalf\u2019 German ancestry. German is his language. He testified that he and his family emigrated from Romania to Germany in 1979. They lived first in Essen and then in Dusseldorf. After attending computer school, he worked part-time for three years; in 1987, he obtained a full-time job as a subway train driver. He held that job until leaving Germany for the United States in 1992. He explained that life was difficult for him and his family in Germany because they were considered foreigners and discriminated against for that reason. He was treated as such in part because his German accent is different from the accent prevalent where he lived and worked. Mots described two unpleasant experiences. In February 1989, two passengers on his train, whom he believed to be Neo-Nazis or \u201cSkinheads,\u201d cursed him, calling him an \u201causlander,\u201d meaning a foreigner. They told him to leave Germany, but they did him no physical harm. He complained of the incident to his supervisor, who summoned the police. He complained because he was concerned about the increasing membership of the Neo-Nazi party and the prevalence of Skinheads \u2014 both are prejudiced against foreigners. In 1991, he had a dispute with a police officer about whether he had parked overtime at a parking place in front of his house. The officer asked him if he was German and gave him a ticket, saying that \u201causlanders have to pay for the money what they take from the welfare.\u201d This angered Mots, so he complained to the police department, which brushed him off by saying that the officer was overworked and that \u201ceverybody makes mistakes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Mots attributed the above incidents to race and nationality. He said that he feared that if he returned to Germany, he would face more problems \u2014 including the ability to get work \u2014 because his accent is stronger now that he has been living in the United States \u2014 in other words, he would appear more than ever to be a foreigner.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Constanza Mots described the jobs she held in Germany, from 1981 to 1992, when the family left for the United States. She also told of the increase of Neo-Nazism and the discrimination against foreigners. As for her and her family, the incidents of discrimination against them were few and of little consequence (for asylum purposes); in fact, for the thirteen years they lived in Germany, they suffered no harm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ denied Petitioners\u2019 applications for asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ denied Petitioners asylum because they \u201cfailed to establish that they would be persecuted or that their fears for life or freedom if returned to Germany are because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\u201d And because Petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ers failed to satisfy the standard of proof for asylum, the IJ concluded that they \u201cfailed to satisfy the clear probability standard of eligibility required for withholding of removal.\u201d The IJ also concluded that Petitioners failed to show that they could not safely relocate within Germany. Finally, the IJ denied Petitioners\u2019 request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">On November 7, 2002, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed <em>per curiam, </em>the IJ\u2019s decision as to asylum and withholding of removal, but remanded the case to an IJ for further consideration of Petitioners\u2019 request for voluntary departure. On August 21, 2003, the IJ denied their request because they admitted that, if granted the privilege, \u201cthey would not depart within the period of time granted by the Court or any extension of that date,\u201d and Petitioners appealed. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on January 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Petitioners now seek review of the BIA\u2019s decisions of November 7, 2002 and January 31, 2005. Reduced to their essentials, the issues their petitions present are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">1. Whether the IJ\u2019s denial of their applications for asylum and withholding of removal are supported by substantial evidence;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">2. Whether Petitioners were denied due process of law because the transcript of them removal hearing is incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Petitioners contend that the IJ\u2019s decision denying their applications for asylum is not supported by substantial evidence, as they testified to acts of persecution in Germany based upon their race and nationality. They say that the IJ\u2019s finding that they lacked a well-founded fear of persecution is inconsistent with the granting of the application for political asylum of their daughter Andrea on the same facts. In addition, having presented credible evidence of past persecution, they were entitled to the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Insofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, as it did here, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>See id. </em>The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84 (internal quotations and citation omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir. 2001) (internal quotations and citation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (considering withholding of removal claim). With these principles in mind, we turn to the denial-of-asylum and withholding-of-removal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">The Attorney General and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) have discretion to grant asylum if an alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APc\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carnes the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. 208.13(a), (b); <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">If the alien demonstrates past persecution, he is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution unless the government can rebut the presumption. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). If an alien does not establish past persecution, he bears the burden of showing a well-founded fear of future persecution by showing that (1) he fears persecution based on his membership in a particular social class, (2) there is a reasonable possibility that he will suffer persecution if removed to his native country, and (3) he could not avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his or her country, if, under all of the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect relocation. 8 C.F.R. 208.13(b)(2), (3)(i). Additionally, \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. According to persuasive authority, if an alien remains unharmed in his native country after allegedly suffering persecution, his or her fear of future persecution is diminished. <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Although neither the INA nor the regulations define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have discussed other circuits\u2019 holdings that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations omitted). To be an act of persecution, the behavior must threaten death, punishment, or the infliction of substantial harm or suffering. <em>Sharif v. INS, </em>87 F.3d 932, 935 (7th Cir.1996). \u201cThreats alone generally do not constitute actual persecution; only rarely, when they are so immediate and menacing as to cause significant suffering or harm in themselves, do threats per se qualify as persecution.\u201d <em>Vatulev v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 1207, 1210 (10th Cir.2003). \u201cTo qualify as persecution, a person\u2019s experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\u201d <em>Nelson v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">An alien shall not be removed to a country if his life or freedom would be threatened in such country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The burden of proof is upon the alien to show his eligibility for withholding of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). An alien is entitled to withholding of removal if he can establish, with specific and credible evidence: (1) a past threat to life or freedom through proof of past persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group (or other statutorily listed factor), or (2) a future threat to life or freedom if it \u201cis more likely than not\u201d that his membership in a particular social group (or other statutorily listed factor) will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1),(2). Because this standard is more stringent than the standard for asylum, if an applicant is unable to meet the standard for asylum, he generally is precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of removal. <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Petitioners failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, as the incidents they described did not rise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the level of persecution. Accordingly, the BIA correctly denied their applications for asylum and withholding of removal. We turn then to the incomplete-transcript issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Petitioners contend that \u201cimportant testimony has been excluded\u201d from the transcript of their removal hearing, as the notation \u201cindiscernible\u201d appears \u201cat least 233 times throughout the record of [their] testimony.\u201d They argue that the omitted testimony would \u201clikely ... be helpful to this Court,\u201d as the gaps in their testimony \u201cmight apply to [their claims of] past persecution and fear of future persecution.\u201d The petitioners urge that the matter be \u201cremanded\u201d for <em>\u201cde novo </em>review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to this due process claim. We therefore lack jurisdiction to entertain it, the result being that we dismiss their petition as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">PETITIONS DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-19\">. The INS has been superceded by the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\u201d).
