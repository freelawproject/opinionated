Gonzalez contends that the district court reversibly erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. There was no <em>\u201cBooker\u201d </em>error or Sixth Amendment violation because the only enhancement to Gonzalez\u2019s sentence was for his prior conviction. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, 769. Nevertheless, the district court committed <em>\u201cFanfan </em>\u201d error by sentencing Gonzalez pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). We have previously rejected Gonzalez\u2019s claim that such error is \u201cstructural\u201d in nature. <em>See id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The Government concedes that Gonzalez preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>argument. Accordingly, this court reviews the claim for harmless error. <em>See id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">The Government argues that the district court\u2019s error in sentencing under a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines was harmless because the district court determined Gonzalez\u2019s sentence by considering the Sentencing Guidelines and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because the Government has failed to carry its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect Gonzalez\u2019s sentence, we will vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">Gonzalez contends that the district court erred in determining that his California marijuana conviction was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). He argues that this court would violate Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B) if it resolved this claim by relying on a transcript of his California guilty plea hearing, which was supplemented into the record over his objection. Because we vacate Gonzalez\u2019s sentence due to the mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines, it is not necessary to address these arguments. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">Gonzalez argues that the provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Gonzalez\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Gonzalez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Gonzalez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>but he raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">SENTENCE VACATED; CONVICTION AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
