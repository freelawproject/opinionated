He argues for the first time on appeal that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the instant case because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce. He also argues for the first time on appeal that his conviction should be reversed because the indictment does not allege that the offense had a substantial impact on interstate commerce. He acknowledges that these arguments are foreclosed by precedent, but raises them to preserve them for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">We have repeatedly held that \u201cthe constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question.\u201d <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001)(quoting <em>United States v. DeLeon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 499 (5th Cir.1999)). Evidence that a weapon was manufactured in one state and possessed in another is sufficient to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 922(g). <em>Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d at 518; <em>United States v. Kuban, </em>94 F.3d 971, 973 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242-43 (5th Cir.1996). Additionally, in <em>United States v. Gresham, </em>118 F.3d 258, 264-65 (5th Cir.1997), we rejected a challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment under \u00a7 922(g)(1) that was identical to the one raised by Rodriguez in this case. Accordingly, Rodriguez\u2019s challenges to the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) and to the indictment are foreclosed by circuit precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"AWr\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
