Aston and the City of Granite Shoals (the City). In his complaint, he alleged that Aston used excessive force in effecting his arrest and that he was deprived of his personal property (a wallet and poeketknife) in violation of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">We review the district court\u2019s order de novo. <em>Cousin v. Small, </em>325 F.3d 627, 637 (5th Cir.2003). A review of the record indicates that the district court did not err in determining that Aston\u2019s actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances. The videotape of Galvan\u2019s detention and subsequent arrest shows Galvan being argumentative, belligerent, and uncooperative during the sobriety tests and Aston\u2019s efforts to handcuff Galvan. The tape also shows that as Galvan was being led to the police car in handcuffs, he twisted away from Aston, resulting in Aston taking him to the ground with a controlled leg sweep. Contrary to Galvan\u2019s assertion, the videotape is consistent with the facts as sworn to by Aston in his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Galvan does not, in his opening brief, address the dismissal of this loss-of-property claim or his claims against the City. Thus, the claims are deemed abandoned on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b920-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
