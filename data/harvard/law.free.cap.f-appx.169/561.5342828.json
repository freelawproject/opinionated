Douglas conceded that she violated the Department\u2019s rules against carrying bags around patients after receiving numerous reprimands from the Department, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>record evidence shows that she also was reprimanded for laughing at a patient, both of which led to her unsatisfactory performance appraisals. Moreover, she has made no showing that the Department did not believe that she had committed such infractions. While the Department conceded that it failed to implement the correct personnel procedures, Douglas has not shown that the failure benefitted another employee outside her protected class. In fact, the Department admitted that it made the same mistakes in the evaluation procedure with regard to an African-American female who worked at CBNF during the same time period as Douglas. Thus, we find no reversible error in the grant of Summary Judgment to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-19\">. In her complaint, Douglas also asserted claims against Lydia Williams and Melcina Russell individually, a pattern or practice claim against the Department, and a retaliation claim against all the defendants. Because Douglas admitted to the district court that the claims against Williams and Russell individually, as well as her retaliation claim were due to be dismissed, and because she does not raise any of these claims before this Court, they have been abandoned and will not be discussed further. <em>Access Now, Inc. v.
