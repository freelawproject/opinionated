While Davis directed his motion to this court, the district court improperly docketed the motion as one in that court under \u00a7 2255. The district court then entered an order construing the motion as one seeking authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion and denied it. Davis timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-25\">Under \u00a7 2244, a motion seeking authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cshall be determined by a three-judge panel of the court of appeals.\u201d \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(B). Because Davis clearly sought authorization from this court under \u00a7 2244, the district court lacked jurisdiction to act on it. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order. By separate order entered this day, we direct that Davis\u2019 \u00a7 2244 motion be filed and docketed in this court. We will then review and act on the motion in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-26\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order. We deny Davis\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">\n<em>VACATED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
