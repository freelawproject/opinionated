He argues that the district court erroneously dismissed his claims against Dr. Jerry Thomas and Warden Kathleen McGinnis in their official capacities without prejudice pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and, additionally, that the district court erroneously dismissed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>monetary damages and injunctive claims against them in their individual capacities as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Given that Dr. Thomas and Warden McGinnis are agents of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Williams\u2019s monetary damages claim against them in their official capacities was properly dismissed under the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Hafer v. Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 26, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991); <em>Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Williams\u2019s complaint and his <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing testimony both evidence that his Eighth Amendment claim was based solely on a disagreement over the type and quality of medical treatment he has received. However, unsuccessful medical treatment, acts of negligence or medical malpractice, or a prisoner\u2019s disagreement with prison officials regarding medical treatment are insufficient to establish an unconstitutional denial of medical care. <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991); <em>see Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Williams\u2019s individual-capacity claims as frivolous. <em>See Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The district court\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) dismissal counts as a strike. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Williams is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). ,</p>\n<p id=\"AnZ\">AFFIRMED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
