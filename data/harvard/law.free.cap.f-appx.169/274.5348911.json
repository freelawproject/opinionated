The district court denied Lee leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Lee is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-17\">Lee argues that he has newly discovered evidence showing that the defendants failed to provide him with a copy of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and thereby denied his right of access to the courts. Lee has not shown that this evidence could not have been discovered through due diligence pri- or to the district court\u2019s initial judgment denying his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. Lee has not shown that the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Carimi v. Royal Carabean Cruise Line, Inc., </em>959 F.2d 1344, 1345 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-18\">Lee has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201c \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>omitted). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cm. R. 42.2. Lee is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Lee is warned that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 38; <em>Clark v. Green, </em>814 F.2d 221, 223 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
