Morin-Garcia argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. Specifically, he argues that the viability of <em>Almendarez-Tor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>res v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is in doubt in light of later Supreme Court cases such as <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). We need not decide the applicability of the waiver provisions in the plea agreement because the issue that Morin-Garcia raises is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Morin-Garcia\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States. </em>Although Morin-Garcia contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298,163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Morin-Garcia properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
