New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Prado concedes, his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). He raises the issue only to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Prado also contends that the district court erred by finding that his prior Texas state conviction for burglary of a habitation constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the career offender enhancement provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The district court correctly found that Prado\u2019s prior conviction for burglary of a habitation was a conviction for a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>See United States v. Hornsby, </em>88 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir. 1996); <em>see also United States v. </em>Garcia-<em>Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir. 2005) (applying <em>Hornsby </em>to enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Finally, although the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence of 188 months of imprisonment was within the applicable guidelines range, Prado contends that the sentence was unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This court recently held that a discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551 (5th Cir.2006). Prado has not rebutted the presumption that his sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b944-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
