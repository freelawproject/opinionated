California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Lopez has filed a response challenging his sentence and asserting ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Our independent review of the brief, Lopez\u2019s response, and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. We conclude that the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration on direct appeal of Lopez\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Brewster, </em>137 F.3d 853, 859 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, without prejudice to Lopez\u2019s right to file a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
