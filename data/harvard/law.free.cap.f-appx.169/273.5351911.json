Romero-Montiel argues that the district court erred in ordering, as a condition of supervised release, that he cooperate with the probation officer in the collection of DNA. His claim is not ripe for judicial review in light of our holding in <em>United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Romero-Montiel also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. His challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Romero-Montiel contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Romero-Montiel properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"AtG\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
