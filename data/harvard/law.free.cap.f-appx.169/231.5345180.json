Paredes was sentenced to 41 months in prison and two years of supervised release. We need not decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>whether Paredes\u2019s appeal is barred by his plea agreement because his issues are either foreclosed or lack arguable merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">For the first time on appeal, Paredes contends that his sentence should be vacated because it was imposed pursuant to an unconstitutional mandatory sentencing guidelines regime, contrary to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This is an alleged \u201cFanfan\u201d error. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005). This court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See id.; United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43,163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Although the application of a mandatory guidelines regime was error that was \u201cplain,\u201d Paredes concedes that he cannot carry his burden of showing that the \u201cFan-fan\u201d error affected his sentence. <em>See Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 600. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court felt constrained by the mandatory Guidelines in imposing the sentence. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522; <em>see also United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 n. 4 (5th Cir.) (minimum guideline sentence, without more, insufficient to carry third prong of plain-error test), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005). Insofar as Paredes argues that the error was a \u201cstructural\u201d one that affected the entire \u201cframework\u201d of the proceeding against him, and that plain-error prejudice should be presumed, we have rejected such contentions. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005). Paredes raises the \u201cFanfan\u201d claim only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">Paredes\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Paredes contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Paredes properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-18\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
