Mitchell appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon, arguing that it violates the Sixth Amendment rule announced in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). After briefing, the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), extending to the Sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>fencing Guidelines the Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment holding in <em>Blakely </em>and rendering the Guidelines advisory only. Mitchell\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court preserved the issue for appeal, and we review for harmless error, which requires a showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence if it had been operating under an advisory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.Sd 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Our review of the record convinces us that the error in this case cannot be considered harmless. Although the district court sentenced Mitchell to the maximum sentence authorized by the then-mandatory guidelines range, that fact is insufficient, standing alone, to satisfy the Government\u2019s burden. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>No. 04-11058, 2006 WL 168475 (5th Cir. Jan.24, 2005). The district court\u2019s comments about the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the impact of his offense shed no additional light on what the court would have done if the Guidelines had been advisory; they may simply reflect why the court believed the sentence was appropriate within the mandatory guidelines framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
