Estrada argues that his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the federal Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">The erroneous application of the Guidelines as mandatory is technically a \u201cFanfan error.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005); <em>see Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69. The Government concedes that Estrada preserved his Fanfan claim for appeal. The Government fails to meet its burden of proving that the district court\u2019s sentence under Guidelines it deemed mandatory was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the Government fails to cite to any record evidence showing that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 171 (5th Cir.2005) <em>(Booker </em>error). We therefore vacate the sentence and remand the case for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">Estrada also challenges the term of supervised release that was imposed on the basis that the enhancement provisions set forth in \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. Given that Estrada\u2019s entire sentence is vacated, this court need not reach this argument. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b880-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
