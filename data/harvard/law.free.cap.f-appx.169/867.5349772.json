He argues that the district court misinterpreted the Sentencing Guidelines when it erroneously denied his request for a minor-role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although admitting that he is not necessarily entitled to an adjustment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lares contends that he was a mere courier and that the district court failed to consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d when applying the Guidelines;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he seeks remand for a proper inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and review factual findings for clear error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if the defendant was a minor participant. An adjustment for a minor role applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant bears the burden of proving that he was a minor participant in the offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">Though lack of knowledge of the criminal endeavor does not preclude application of a minor-role adjustment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we conclude that Lares has not shown the district court misapprehended the Sentencing Guidelines or that he should have received a minor-role adjustment. The district court expressly adopted the presentence report, which determined that no mitigating evidence existed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Lares has not demonstrated that reliance on the fact determinations found therein results in clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-19\">Moreover, for purposes of \u00a7 3B1.2, a defendant\u2019s involvement in an offense is not evaluated with reference to the entire criminal enterprise in which he participated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, the proper scope of a \u00a7 3B1.2 inquiry asks whether a defendant\u2019s involvement was minor in relation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>the conduct for which he was held accountable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Lares was convicted and sentenced based on his possession of 46.8 kilograms of marijuana<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that were found in the truck he drove across the border<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and is, therefore, not entitled to a minor-role adjustment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b893-16\"> Pursuant to the 5TH CIR.
