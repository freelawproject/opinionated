Velasquez argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional both on their face and as applied. Velasquez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Velasquez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th. Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Velasquez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-26\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
