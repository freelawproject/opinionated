He argues that the district court committed reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the guidelines. As the Government concedes, Navarette preserved this issue for review by raising an objection based upon <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), in the district court. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 462-63 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the question before us \u201cis whether the government has met its burden to show harmless error beyond, a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The district court erred by sentencing Navarette under the mistaken belief that the guidelines were mandatory. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). The district court sentenced Navarette at the low end of the guidelines range, and nothing in the record indicates what sentence it would have imposed had it known that the guidelines were advisory. In these circumstances, the Government has not met its \u201carduous burden\u201d of showing that the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we vacate Navarette\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Navarette\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Navarette contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Navarette properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
