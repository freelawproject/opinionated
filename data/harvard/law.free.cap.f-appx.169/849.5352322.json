We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-23\">Our careful review of the record on appeal demonstrates that this case has a particularly long, convoluted, and \u2014 for the most part \u2014 meritless and frivolous history, including, without limitation, the addition and deletion of parties, both public and private, and several instances of removal and remand between state and federal courts. Also obvious from the record is the longstanding displeasure of the pro se plaintiff, apparently originating with a state law real estate foreclosure action, and growing exponentially from there.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-24\">At least as to those issues of this lengthy and tortured litigation that are implicated in today\u2019s appeal, it is long since time to stop the twisting and turning and lay it to rest, once and for all. Now, therefore, for the reasons expressed in the several rulings of the district judge or the magistrate judge at issue here, each order, judgment, and ruling before us on appeal is, in every respect, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-25\">In addition, Robinson is <em>cautioned </em>that, despite proceeding pro se and thus enjoying a bit more latitude from us than would retained or appointed counsel, no further pursuit of these matters will be tolerated. Any prolongation or continuation of any of the matters covered by our ruling on appeal today shall expose him to the full panoply of sanctions and penalties at our disposal for meritless, frivolous, or contumacious continuation of this litigation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>any aspect thereof, in this or any other federal court of this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b875-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
