The district court dismissed Smith\u2019s complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction after determining that the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP) staff members involved in the actions Smith challenged in his administrative grievances were sufficiently related to their official duties to entitle the United States to immunity under the FTCA,</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Smith complains that the district court (1) failed to conduct a de novo review of the magistrate judge\u2019s second report and recommendation; (2) erroneously changed its factfindings by adopting that second report after having accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s first report and recommendation; and (3) erred in concluding that the complained-of acts of the BOP staff members were sufficiently related to their official duties to afford the United States immunity under to the FTCA\u2019s waiver exception contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2860(c). We disagree that the district court failed to conduct a de novo review or to change any factfindings that were relevant to the dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Smith\u2019s first two contentions are therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">We further conclude that the acts of the BOP staff members in connection with the shipping of prisoners\u2019 personal property and the receipt and forwarding of prisoners\u2019 packages were at least remotely related to their official duties: That is sufficient for purposes of immunity. <em>See Capozzoli v. Tracey, </em>663 F.2d 654, 658 (5th Cir.1981). The district court did not err by dismissing Smith\u2019s complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Jeanmarie v. United States, </em>242 F.3d 600, 602 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"Ats\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
