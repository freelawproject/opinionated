Zuniga\u2019s waiver-of-appeal provision does not bar this appeal because the record reflects that the magistrate judge who administered Zuniga\u2019s plea erroneously described the waiver-of-appeal provision. <em>See </em>Fed. R.CrimP. ll(b)(l)(N).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-24\">Zuniga argues that the district court erred in assigning a 16-level increase to his offense level based upon a prior conviction for second degree assault that occurred in Kentucky. This issue is reviewed de novo as Zuniga raised it in the district court. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-25\">The Government concedes that the district court erred in assigning the 16-level increase because the record does not conclusively establish that the prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (Nov.2004). Accordingly, Zuniga\u2019s sentence is vacated and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-26\">Zuniga also argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in sentencing him using and unconstitutional mandatory Sentencing Guideline regime in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Zuniga\u2019s argument will not be ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>dressed in light of this court\u2019s remand for resentencing. <em>See United States v. South</em>erland, 405 F.3d 263, 270 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">CHARLES H. SPURGEON SAID, CARVE YOUR NAME ON HEARTS AND NOT ON MARBLE.
