Specifically, \u00a7 4246(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-19\">The court shall, after a hearing, determine whether the person should be remanded to a suitable facility on the ground that, in light of his failure to comply with the prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment, his continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-20\">Thus, the statute unambiguously requires that the court make two findings before revoking a conditional discharge: (1) that the person failed to comply with his prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological treatment; and (2) in light of that failure, the person\u2019s continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>age to property of another. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246(f); <em>United States v. Woods, </em>995 F.2d 894, 896 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">2. Relying on the district court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Woods, </em>970 F.Supp. 711 (D.Minn.1997), and the language in \u00a7 4246(f), the district court held that it did not need to make a finding on the issue on whether Appellant\u2019s continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another. Based on that holding, the district court denied Appellant\u2019s request to continue the hearing for the purpose of obtaining an independent mental health examination. It specifically stated that \u201c[h]ad dangerousness been an issue to be decided ..., the court would at this time continue the hearing to the end of allowing [Appellant] time to obtain an independent opinion on that issue. Having concluded that the issue was not relevant, the court does not consider that there is anything to gain by prolonging the hearing.\u201d We read <em>Woods </em>and the statutory language of \u00a7 4246(f) differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">3. Although the district court held that whether Appellant\u2019s continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another was irrelevant, earlier in the same order, the court stated, \u201cunder the record now before the court, the court could, and would if relevant, find that, in light of respondent\u2019s failure to comply with the prescribed regimen, her continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another.\u201d This seems to indicate an alternative holding. However, this alternative holding would be inconsistent with the district court\u2019s statement in the same order that had \u201cdangerousness\u201d been an issue, it would \u201ccontinue the hearing to the end of allowing respondent time to obtain an independent opinion on that issue.\u201d We therefore remand this case to the district court to make an express finding on whether Appellant\u2019s continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another. In making such a finding, the district court should, consistent with its order, permit the Appellant to have her own examination by a mental health expert and to present evidence on the issue of whether her continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
