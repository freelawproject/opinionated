(\u201cHudson\u201d) and Dillingham Construction Co., Inc. (\u201cDillingham\u201d). Hudson brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that it did not owe Dillingham damages. The district court dismissed Dillingham\u2019s counterclaims and granted summary judgment to Hudson. On appeal, Dillingham argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and that the district court erred in dismissing Dillingham\u2019s counterclaims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">In 1999, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. contracted with Hudson to expand and improve a Wal-Mart store in Murphy, North Carolina. Hudson subsequently entered into a subcontract with Dillingham for grading, storm drainage and erosion control services for the project. Dillingham maintains that Hudson owes it damages for causing delays in construction, for withholding partial payment when Dillingham refused to use crushed stone to backfill a retaining wall, and for making deceptive statements about Dillingham\u2019s ability to recover damages for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-16\">Hudson filed this declaratory judgment action after Dillingham voluntarily dismissed a state court claim against Hudson for breach of contract and unfair and deceptive trade practices. Dillingham\u2019s answer to Hudson\u2019s claims in this case included as counterclaims all of the claims that Dillingham had included in its state court action. The district court dismissed all of Dillingham\u2019s counterclaims. The court found that the North Carolina statute of limitations barred Dillingham\u2019s contract counterclaims and dismissed Dillingham\u2019s unfair trade practices claim because \u201cthe dispute between these parties does not impact commerce or the public interest at large.\u201d The district court ultimately granted summary judgment to Hudson, finding that Hudson did not owe Dillingham money under the contract or the state deceptive trade practices act.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-17\">Dillingham first contends that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case, arguing that Hudson\u2019s declaratory judgment action did not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction. Federal district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions in which the parties are of diverse citizenship and \u201cthe matter in controversy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (2000). The parties here are diverse, so the only issue is the amount in controversy. \u201c[T]he test for determining the amount in controversy in a diversity proceeding is the pecuniary result to either party which [a] judgment would produce.\u201d <em>Dixon v. Edwards, </em>290 F.3d 699, 710 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although Hudson is seeking a declaration that it does not owe Dillingham any money, the record makes clear that the amount involved in the underlying controversy exceeds $75,000. For example, Dillingham\u2019s counterclaims in this action allege that Hudson\u2019s breaches of the subcontract caused Dillingham damages exceeding $250,000. Accordingly, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Dillingham additionally maintains that the district court erred when it dismissed Dillingham\u2019s contract counterclaims as time barred. We need not reach this issue, however, because Dillingham fails to claim that the district court improperly granted summary judgment to Hudson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court found that the clear and unambiguous language of the contract permitted Hudson\u2019s actions, and that Hudson therefore did not breach the agreement. Dillingham\u2019s brief does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding on this point; as a result, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dillingham\u2019s counterclaims did not affect the final outcome in this case. Even if we were to find that the district court erred in its determination that Dillingham\u2019s counterclaims were time barred, Dillingham would still be unable to recover from Hudson given the grant of summary judgment to Hudson.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Finally, Dillingham argues that the district court erred in dismissing the unfair trade practices counterclaim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court found that Dillingham\u2019s claim did not satisfy the statute\u2019s \u201caffecting commerce\u201d requirement because the dispute \u201cdoes not impact commerce or the public interest at large.\u201d North Carolina precedent supports this finding: \u201cAlthough commerce is defined broadly under G.S. \u00a7 75-l.l(b) as \u2018all business activities, however denominated,\u2019 the fundamental purpose of G.S. \u00a7 75-1.1 is to protect the consuming public.... The proper inquiry is not whether a contractual relationship existed between the parties, but rather whether the defendants\u2019 allegedly deceptive acts <em>affected </em>commerce.\u201d <em>Durling v. King, </em>146 N.C.App. 483, 554 S.E.2d 1, 4-5 (2001) (emphasis in original). We agree with the district court that \u201cthere is no evidence of any impact beyond the parties\u2019 contractual relationship.\u201d Thus, the district court correctly dismissed Dillingham\u2019s unfair trade practices claim and granted summary judgment to Hudson.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>the court, and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\">. Because Dillingham does not claim anywhere in its brief that the district court\u2019s final judgment \u2014 a declaratory judgment that Hudson did not breach the contract and therefore did not owe Dillingham damages \u2014 was erroneous, we deem these issues abandoned. <em>See 11126 Baltimore Blvd., Inc. v. Prince George's County, Md., </em>58 F.3d 988, 993 n. 7 (4th Cir. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-12\">. When the district court granted summary judgment to Hudson on Dillingham\u2019s unfair trade practices claim, the court expressly relied on its earlier reasoning in dismissing Dillingham\u2019s counterclaim. In addition, Dillingham challenges the district court's final decision on the unfair trade practices claim. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellant at 17 n. 4. Thus, Dillingham has not abandoned its claim of unfair trade practices.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
