The IJ ordered the petitioners removed to South Africa.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-18\">As the BIA summarily and without a written opinion affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, it is the final agency determination for judicial review. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2005); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003). We shall uphold the factual finding that an alien is not eligible for asylum if that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Gomez-Mejia v. INS, </em>56 F.3d 700, 702 (5th Cir.1995). The petitioners have the burden to \u201cshow that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>The petitioners\u2019 evidence of verbal harassment does not rise to the level of persecution; neither does their evidence of persecution of white farmers establish that the petitioners, who are not farmers, have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Abdeh-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 584 (5th Cir. 1996). As the petitioners have not shown persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution, as required for obtaining asylum, they have also failed to show a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution as required by the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). Similarly, they have failed to clear \u201cthe higher bar of torture\u201d as required for relief under the CAT. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The petitioners also assert that the IJ erred in finding that they were ineligible for asylum because they were \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d in South Africa. We need not decide this question: Even if the petitioners prevailed on the resettlement issue, they have failed to establish entitlement to discretionary asylum on account of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The petitioners next contend that the BIA violated its own rules by referring their appeal to a single member of the BIA. They argue that a three-member panel should have considered \u201cthe detailed, sensitive, and nuanced\u201d resettlement issue. As the resettlement issue was not determinative of their request for relief, however, any IJ error concerning firm resettlement was harmless or nonmaterial; and, in light of the other grounds for denying relief, the legal question of firm resettlement was so insubstantial that three-member review was not warranted. <em>See Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 662 (5th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The petitioners go on to contend that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229e(b) is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. They argue that there is no rational basis for barring voluntary departure for aliens who have been in the United States for less than a year, while allowing voluntary departure for aliens who have been in the United States for more than a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Under well-established Equal Protection principles, the petitioners have failed to carry their burden of negating \u201cevery conceivable basis\u201d which might support the statutory classification they challenge. <em>See FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., </em>508 U.S. 307, 315, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993). Further, the \u201clegislative choice is not subject to courtroom fact-finding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree with the Ninth Circuit that \u201cCongress presumably determined that those aliens with at least a year\u2019s presence had accumulated sufficient interests to warrant time to settle their affairs in this country,\u201d thereby meriting the privilege of voluntary departure. <em>See Tovar-Landin v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
