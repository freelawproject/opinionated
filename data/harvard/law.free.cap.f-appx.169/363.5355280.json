He argues on appeal that the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict on all four counts because it did not establish that he knowingly possessed the firearm or the crack cocaine. As Thompson concedes, he did not move for a judgment of acquittal at the end of the Government\u2019s case or at the close of all evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-27\">When viewed in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, the evidence shows that Thompson knowingly possessed the firearm and the crack cocaine found in the vehicle he was driving shortly before his arrest. Accordingly, Thompson\u2019s conviction on all four counts does not constitute a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Griffin, </em>324 F.3d 330, 356 (5th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
