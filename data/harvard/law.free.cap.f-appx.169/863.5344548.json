For the following reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-24\">For the first time on appeal, De Leon-Garcia asserts that the district court\u2019s belief during sentencing that the United States Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory, rather than advisory, is reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He asserts that we should review the Fanfan error de novo. He also suggests that the error is structural, or at least presumptively prejudicial. However, we have firmly established that the plain error standard of review applies to a forfeited Fanfan error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 513-14 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005) (No. 04-9517)), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005) (No. 05-5556). The error is not structural, and prejudice is not presumed. <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600-01 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005) (No. 05-6242). Accordingly, these arguments are foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-31\">In the alternative, De Leon-Garcia asserts that he is entitled to a reversal under the plain error standard. However, the Fanfan error did not affect his substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>rights. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied,, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005) (No. 05-5535); <em>United States v. Garcia-Rodriguez, </em>415 F.3d 452, 456 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, he has failed to demonstrate plain error. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 732-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Finally, De Leon-Garcia asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), controls this issue. We must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, this issue is also foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b889-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
