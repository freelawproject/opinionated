Oviedo contends that the district court erred when it considered the wrong recommended sentencing range when sentencing Oviedo.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The plain error standard of review applies. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf all three conditions are met an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). When reviewing for plain error in a sentencing context, the key inquiry is whether the district court could have imposed the same sentence absent the error. <em>United States v. Leonard, </em>157 F.3d 343, 346 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">Even if a clear and obvious error occurred, Oviedo cannot show that his substantial rights were affected. Oviedo\u2019s sentence of 21 months of imprisonment is within the appropriate recommended sentencing range of 18-24 months of imprisonment and could be reinstated on remand. Therefore, Oviedo fails to satisfy the plain error standard of review. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-17\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
