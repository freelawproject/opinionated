He concedes that his argument is foreclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>by current Fifth Circuit law, citing <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2001) and <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). Thus, the district court did not err in applying the eight-level adjustment to his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) based on his prior state felony drug conviction. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943) does not affect the binding precedential value of <em>Rivera </em>and <em>Hinojosa-Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Villa-Gutierrez argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. Specifically, he argues that the viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is in doubt in light of later Supreme Court cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Villa-Gutierrez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Although Villa-Gutierrez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Villa-Gutierrez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
