Franklin argues that the district court committed reversible error when it sentenced her based on facts not admitted by her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the Government argues that there was no Sixth Amendment violation, it concedes that the district court erred by sentencing Franklin under the mandatory guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government also concedes that Franklin preserved this issue through her objection in the district court based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and that it cannot show that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we VACATE Franklin\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for resentencing in accordance with <em>Book</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>er. See United, States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

To the extent that she raises a Fifth Amendment challenge, that argument is waived as inadequately briefed. See Fed. R.App. P. 28(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
