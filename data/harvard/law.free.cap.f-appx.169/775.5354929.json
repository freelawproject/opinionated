On appeal, Murphy\u2019s counsel filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there were no meritorious issues, but raising the issue of whether the district court erred in using a prior conviction to increase the mandatory statutory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Murphy filed a pro se supplemental brief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-23\">The prior predicate conviction for distribution of crack cocaine, although occurring during the course of an 18-year long conspiracy, was properly used to enhance the mandatory statutory minimum sentence. <em>United States v. Martino, </em>294 F.3d 346, 350-51 (2d Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>924 F.2d 1354, 1361-62 (6th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-24\">Murphy contends counsel was ineffective on a number of counts. The proper proceeding in which to pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not a direct appeal but a collateral proceeding under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120 (4th Cir.1991). We will entertain such a claim on direct appeal only if it \u201cconclusively appears\u201d from the record that the defendant\u2019s counsel was ineffective. <em>United States v. Russell, </em>221 F.3d 615, 619 n. 5 (4th Cir.2000). Because the record is incomplete in this regard, the claim will not be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-25\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Murphy\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
