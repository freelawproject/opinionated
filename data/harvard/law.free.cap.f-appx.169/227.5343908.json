Montes argues that the district court erred by requiring him to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample from him as a condition of his supervised release. In <em>United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662), this court considered an indistinguishable challenge and held that it was not ripe for review because the possibility that the defendant\u2019s DNA sample would be collected by the Bureau of Prisons rendered the possibility that his DNA sample would be collected while on supervised release conjecture. Accordingly, this portion of Montes\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">Montes\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Montes contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Montes properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
