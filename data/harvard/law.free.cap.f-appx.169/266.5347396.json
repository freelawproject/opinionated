This claim is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because it is not ripe for review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2005) (No. 05-8662).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Vargas next argues, for the first time on appeal, that his previous state offens\u00e9 of burglary of a habitation did not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). He correctly concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006), but he raises the argument to preserve it for further review. He also argues that <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>was incorrectly decided. We do not disturb our holding in <em>Garcia-Mendez. See United States v. Taylor, </em>933 F.2d 307, 313 (5th Cir.1991) (one panel of this court may not overrule another panel).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Vargas finally challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Vargas contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Vargas properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
