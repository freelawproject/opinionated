Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court erred when it sentenced him pursuant to the pre<em>Booker </em>mandatory sentencing guidelines regime. He is correct. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). By stating that a harmless-error standard of review applies to this \u201cFanfan\u201d challenge, the Government concedes that Galvan preserved the challenge for appellate review. We review a preserved challenge to the mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines for harmless error, and the Government bears the burden of showing harmlessness. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). Before an error can be held harmless, the Government must \u201cpoint to ... record evidence that would prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced [the defendant] different had it acted under an advisory Guidelines regime.\u201d <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 (5th Cir.2005). Because the Government has not met this burden, we vacate Galvan\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-25\">Galvan\u2019s constitutional challenge to the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Galvan contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>decided, we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.8d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Galvan concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. We affirm Galvan\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED; CONVICTION AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b911-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
