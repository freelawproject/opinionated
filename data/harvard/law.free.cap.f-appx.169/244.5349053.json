He raises a constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) and also argues that the district court plainly erred in requiring him to submit to DNA testing as a condition of his supervised release. Felix\u2019s appeal waiver is unenforceable because the magistrate judge advised him at his rearraignment hearing that he could appeal an illegal sentence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517-18 (5th Cir.1999). We need not decide the applicability of the sentencing waiver in the plea agreement because the appellate issues are foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-18\">Felix\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Felix contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Felix properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-21\">Felix\u2019s supervised release claim is not ripe for review and is therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-22\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
