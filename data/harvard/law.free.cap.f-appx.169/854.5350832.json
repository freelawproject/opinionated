Since Agado\u2019s possession-of-cocaine conviction is appropriately classified as an aggravated felony, this court lacks jurisdiction over the instant petition for review. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Avalos, 251 </em>F.3d 505, 510 (5th Cir .2001); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Based on the foregoing, Agado\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
