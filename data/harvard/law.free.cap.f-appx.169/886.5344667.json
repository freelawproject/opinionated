Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, the parties have commented on the impact of <em>Booker. </em>For the following reasons, we conclude that <em>Booker </em>does not affect Defendant-Appellant Saul Navarro-Molina\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Navarro-Molina, a citizen of Mexico, pleaded guilty to and was convicted of being in the United States illegally after removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Standing alone, a \u00a7 1326(a) offense carries a maximum penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment and one year of supervised release. Navarro-Molina\u2019s \u00a7 1326(a) offense, however, did not stand alone: Prior to his removal from the United States, Navarro-Molina was convicted of an aggravated felony, which, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), increased the maximum penalty for his \u00a7 1326(a) offense to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. Navarro-Molina\u2019s presentencing report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended that he receive a total offense level under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines of 21, which included a 16-level upward adjustment for his prior aggravated felony conviction, and a 3-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for his \u00a7 1326(a) offense. Combined with Navarro-Molina\u2019s Criminal History Category of III, his offense level of 21 resulted in a Guidelines sentencing range of 46-57 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court accepted the PSR\u2019s recommendation and sentenced Navarro-Molina at the bottom-end of the Guidelines sentencing range, imposing a sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. Navarro-Molina objected to the sentence on the ground that it exceeded the maximum authorized by \u00a7 1326(a), but the district court overruled his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">Navarro-Molina then appealed his sentence to this court, arguing that it exceeded the statutory maximum in violation of his rights under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause because the indictment charging him with a \u00a7 1326(a) violation did not separately state a \u00a7 1326(b) offense. In his brief on appeal, Navarro-Molina acknowledged that precedent foreclosed his argument, but he raised it anyway to preserve possible Supreme Court review. We affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Navarro-Molina then petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. After the Court handed down <em>Booker, </em>Navarro-Molina filed a supplemental petition for certiorari with the Court in which, for the first time, he raised a <em>Booker </em>challenge to his mandatory Guidelines sentence. In response, the Supreme Court granted Navarro-Molina\u2019s petition, vacated our judgment affirming his sentence, and remanded to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We again affirm Navarro-Molina\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Apye\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Navarro-Molina raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his supplemental petition for certiorari. We will therefore review his <em>Booker </em>claim only in the presence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although we have yet to flesh out the contours of precisely what constitutes \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d we know that the extraordinary circumstances standard is more onerous than the plain error standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If, therefore, Navarro-Molina cannot meet the requirements of plain error review, he certainly cannot satisfy the requirements of extraordinary circumstances review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And Navarro-Molina cannot: He has failed to show, as is required by plain error review, that the error in his case affected his substantial rights. We therefore need not address whether extraordinary circumstances exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the circumstances in a case meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under <em>Booker, </em>a district court\u2019s sentencing of a defendant under the formerly-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines (1) constitutes error (2) that is plain.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry in which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He will carry this burden only if he can \u201cshow[] that the error \u2018must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That may be shown, in turn, by the defendant\u2019s \u201cdemonstration of] a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To demonstrate such a probability, the defendant must identify in the record an indication that the \u201csentencing judge-sentencing under an advisory [Guidelines] scheme rather than a mandatory one-would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By all accounts, this burden is \u201cdifficult\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>-but not impossible<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>-to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-20\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b914-21\">In measuring a defendant\u2019s attempt to show that a plain error affected his substantial rights, our decisions have considered \u201ctwo issues: first, whether the judge made any statements during sentencing indicating that he would have imposed a lesser sentence had he not considered the Guidelines mandatory; [and] second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>relationship between the actual sentence imposed and the range of sentences provided by the Guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Navarro-Molina does not contend that the district court made any statements expressing a preference for a lower sentence: In his brief on appeal he concedes that \u201cthe district court made no particular remarks disagreeing with the requirements of the mandatory guidelines,\u201d or otherwise indicating that it would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Instead, Navarro-Molina calls to our attention \u201cmitigating circumstances\u201d-namely, the facts that he returned to the United States to seek work, and that he requested that the district court order him to undergo alcohol and drug treatment-\u201cthat support a finding of a reasonable likelihood of a lower sentence.\u201d In addition, Navarro-Molina argues that the district court\u2019s decision to impose the lowest term of imprisonment permitted by his Guidelines sentencing range-which Navarro-Molina contends was \u201c[apparently\u201d based on \u201cthe[] mitigating circumstances\u201d surrounding his case-indicates that the district court would likely have imposed a different sentence under an advisory set of Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">We hold that Navarro-Molina has not carried his burden of showing that <em>Booker </em>error \u201c \u2018affected the outcome of [his] district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> First, under our decision in <em>United States v. Bringier, </em>Navarro-Molina\u2019s invocation of the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range is not enough to carry his burden.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And, contrary to Navarro-Molina\u2019s argument, <em>Bringier </em>is not distinguishable from this case. Navarro-Molina contends that unlike the <em>Bringier </em>defendant, he presents sufficient mitigating circumstances to raise a reasonable likelihood that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory Guidelines scheme. But the differences between this case and Bringier-for example, that Bringier was a \u201clarge-scale drug trafficker\u201d while Navarro-Molina is \u201can illegal alien who merely crossed the border to find work\u201d-have no bearing whatsoever on the question whether we may infer from a Guideline-minimum sentence that Navarro-Molina would have been sentenced differently under an advisory scheme. The significance of any factual differences is, of course, borne out in the sentences imposed: Bringier was sentenced to a Guideline-minimum 30 years\u2019 imprisonment, compared to Navarro-Molina\u2019s 46 months. Yet, in neither case may we conclude that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory scheme. Navarro-Molina\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Bringier </em>is simply unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-23\">Second, Navarro-Molina contends that his mitigating circumstances themselves raise a reasonable likelihood that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory Guidelines scheme. \u201cDespite the [district] court\u2019s demonstrated willingness to impose the lowest available sentence,\u201d contends Navarro-Molina, \u201cit could not reduce [his sentence] below 46 months based on the most sympathetic circumstances of his case [because, under the then-mandatory Guidelines,] Navarro\u2019s drug and alcohol problems were not grounds for departure.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>This argument misses the mark. All Navarro-Molina has done is raise the mere possibility that, <em>post-Booker, </em>the district court would have considered Navarro-Molina\u2019s drug and alcohol problems as a reason to impose a lower sentence. But he has not pointed us to any indication in the record that the district court <em>actually would have done so </em>had it been so empowered. Under <em>Mares, </em>a defendant must do more than raise a mere possibility to carry his burden; he must \u201c \u2018show that the error actually did make a difference: if it is equally plausible that the error worked in favor of the defense, the defendant loses; if the effect of the error is uncertain so that we do not know which, if either, side it helped the defendant loses.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Navarro-Molina therefore fails to carry his burden, and thus fails to satisfy plain error review. We need not reach his argument that the error in his sentencing seriously affected the fairness, integrity and public reputation of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Finally, in a last-ditch effort, Navarro-Molina expresses disagreement with the mechanics of <em>Mares \u2019s </em>plain error standard. He recognizes that <em>Mares </em>forecloses this argument, but he nonetheless raises the point to preserve a challenge to <em>Mares\u2019s </em>articulation of the plain error standard of review, arguing that in <em>Mares </em>we got it wrong, while the plain error standard employed by other courts (the Sixth Circuit, for example<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>) gets it right. <em>Mares </em>is the settled law of this circuit, however, and we may revisit it only <em>en banc </em>or following a Supreme Court decision that actually or effectively overturns it.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Because Navarro-Molina cannot satisfy plain error review, he does not present extraordinary circumstances entitling him to resentencing. We affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Navarro-Molina\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s pending motions to reinstate our prior affirmance and, in the alternative, to extend time to file its supplemental brief are DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
