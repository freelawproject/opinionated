Aexander was sent a copy of counsel\u2019s motion and brief, but has not filed a response. Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
