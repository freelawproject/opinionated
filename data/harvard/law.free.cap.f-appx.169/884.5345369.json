He argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Martin\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Martin contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Martin properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-25\">Martin also argues that the district court reversibly erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Sentencing Guidelines. The Government concedes that Martin has preserved this issue for appeal. The Government, however, has not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Martin\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b910-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
