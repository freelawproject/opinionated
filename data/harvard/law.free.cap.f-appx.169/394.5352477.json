He contends that the district court committed reversible error when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>United States Sentencing Guidelines system held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The district court erred when it sentenced Rocha pursuant to a mandatory Guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). This error was more like that experienced by the other respondent in <em>Booker, </em>Ducan Fanfan. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005). Because Rocha preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>challenge in the district court by raising an objection based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), we review for harmless error. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir. 2005). The Government bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced Rocha differently under an advisory Guidelines system. <em>See id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The mere fact that the district court sentenced Rocha to the middle of the applicable Guidelines range, standing alone, fails to satisfy the Government\u2019s burden of proving harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170-71 (5th Cir.2005) <em>(Booker </em>error). Further, the sentencing transcript is silent with regard to whether the district court would have applied the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory rather than mandatory. Therefore, the Government has failed to carry its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect Rocha\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>We therefore vacate Rocha\u2019s sentence and remand the case <em>for re </em>sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Rocha also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Rocha\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rocha contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rocha properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
