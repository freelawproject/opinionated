For the first time on appeal, Elizalde asserts that the district court\u2019s belief during sentencing that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory, rather than advisory, is reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In his plea agreement, Elizalde waived his right to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>his sentence, and this waiver encompasses his <em>Booker </em>claim. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 446-50 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746-47 (5th Cir.2005). This portion of the appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Elizalde asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. Elizalde\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Elizalde contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Elizalde properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
