Gutierrez argues that the district court reversibly erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-26\">There was no <em>\u201cBooker </em>\u201d error or Sixth Amendment violation because the only enhancement to Gutierrez\u2019s sentence was for his prior conviction. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, 769. Nevertheless, the district court committed \u201cFanfan\u201d error by sentencing Gutierrez pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-27\">The Government concedes that Gutierrez preserved his Fanfan claim. As such, this court reviews the claim for harmless error. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464. This court has rejected the argument that a Fanfan error is structural. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-28\">There is no indication in the record that the district court would have imposed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>same sentence had the guidelines been advisory rather than mandatory. The Government has not satisfied its burden of showing that the district court\u2019s Fanfan error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463-64. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Gutierrez argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in his case in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Gutierrez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Gutierrez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Gutierrez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Gutierrez\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">This court need not address at this time Gutierrez\u2019s remaining argument challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b890-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
