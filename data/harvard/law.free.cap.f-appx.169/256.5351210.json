Rubio-Cruz argues that the district court plainly erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on a Texas conviction for aggravated assault. Rubio-Cruz contends that the enhancement is improper because the Texas aggravated assault statute may be violated by conduct such as recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">As the United States Sentencing Commission has identified aggravated assault as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, by imposing the sentence enhancement. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(b)(iii)); <em>see United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 317 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">Rubio-Cruz argues next that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in his case in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Rubio-Cruz\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rubio-Cruz contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres in </em>light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rubio-Cruz properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
