Vallejo asserts that the district court erred in concluding that his prior state felony conviction for simple possession of cocaine and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>marijuana was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b). Vallejo\u2019s argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Vallejo also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. This challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Vallejo contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Vallejo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Vallejo argues that the district court erred in ordering him to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample as a condition of supervised release and that this condition should therefore be vacated. He contends that the collection of his DNA violates the Fourth Amendment. Vallejo concedes that the issue is not ripe for review but raises the issue to preserve it for further review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (05-8662). As Vallejo concedes, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the issue. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
