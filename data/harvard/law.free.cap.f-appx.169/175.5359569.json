Flip-pen\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the district court erred in imposing Flippen\u2019s sentence. Although he was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Flippen has not filed a brief. Finding no meritorious issues and no error by the district court, we affirm the revocation order and the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-25\">In light of Flippen\u2019s admission that he violated the terms of his supervision, we find no error by the district court in revoking his supervised release. <em>See </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). Flippen challenges the length of the sentence and supervised release term. The eight-month term of incarceration imposed by the district court was within the five-to-eleven-month advisory guideline range and was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.2006) (No. 05-4270); 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a). The forty-two month term of supervised release imposed following the eight-month revocation sentence was within the statutory maximum and was not \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(b), (h); 3742(a)(4) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have independently reviewed the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Flippen\u2019s supervised release and imposing an eight-month sentence and a forty-two-month supervised release term. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
