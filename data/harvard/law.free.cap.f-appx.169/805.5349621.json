Caldwell\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Caldwell has been notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">We review the district court\u2019s judgment revoking supervised release and imposing a term of imprisonment for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). The conduct upon which the revocation was based included illegal drug use, a Grade B violation. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines </em>\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2) (2004). Caldwell\u2019s criminal history level was V. Combining these two factors, the district court correctly determined Caldwell\u2019s sentencing range was eighteen to twenty-four months. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">The sentence imposed by the district court was within both the statutory and guideline range. Caldwell admitted to testing positive for cocaine on eight occasions as well as other supervised release violations. The district court gave Caldwell a choice of sentences and he selected the twenty-four month sentence because it included a drug treatment program. The sentence was reasonable and the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Caldwell\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
