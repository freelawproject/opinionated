Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, Defendant-Appellant Guillermo Hernandez-De la Torre has submitted a supplemental letter brief addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>The government has submitted a motion to reinstate our prior affirmance of Hernandez-De la Torre\u2019s conviction and sentence, which Hernandez-De la Torre opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b917-19\">Hernandez-De la Torre pleaded guilty to reentering the United States unlawfully following deportation. Hernandez-De la Torre contends that he reentered the United States to help support his disabled wife and minor child. In his brief, HernandezDe la Torre provides us with some background personal information about himself, including, <em>inter alia, </em>that he suffered a physical injury in May 2000, and his physical injury prompted serious psychological problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>The district court enhanced HernandezDe la Torre\u2019s sentence on the basis that he committed his reentry offense while under a prior criminal justice sentence. Hernandez-De la Torre appealed his conviction and sentence, and we affirmed in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hernandez-De la Torre then obtained Supreme Court review on the issues he raised on appeal and on the constitutionality of his sentence under <em>Booker. </em>As noted above, the Supreme Court remanded to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A5i_\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Hernandez-De la Torre raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his petition for certiorari. Therefore, we will not review his <em>Booker </em>claim absent \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The extraordinary circumstances standard is more demanding than the plain error review that we employ when a defendant has raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, if a defendant cannot satisfy plain error review, he certainly cannot satisfy extraordinary circumstances review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hernandez-De la Torre argues that the extraordinary circumstances review is inapplicable in this case for a variety of reasons. As his claim does not survive plain error review, we need not address his objections to the extraordinary circumstances standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the circumstances meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since <em>Booker, </em>sentencing under mandatory Guidelines constitutes error, and that error is plain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry in which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He carries his burden only if he can \u201cdemonstrate a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant demonstrates such a probability when he identifies from the record an indication that the sentencing judge would have reached a significantly different result under an advisory Guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">In his supplemental letter brief, Hernandez-De la Torre points to his family circumstances and his physical and psychological condition as grounds for a downward departure. Hernandez-De la Torre argues that because the Guidelines discourage considerations such as family ties and physical and psychological condition, there is a probability that the district court would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>For openers, as Hernandez-De la Torre concedes, there is no indication in the record that the district court would have sentenced him differently. Moreover, Hernandez-De la Torre\u2019s argument is unpersuasive on its merits. Although the Guidelines state that \u201cfamily ties and responsibilities are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure may be warranted,\u201d the commentary to that section specifically provides that the sentencing court may take a family\u2019s loss of financial support into account in deciding to depart downward.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Similarly, although the physical condition is not \u201cordinarily\u201d relevant to the sentencing determination under the Guidelines, that section explicitly provides that \u201cextraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to depart downward.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As with physical condition, the defendant\u2019s mental condition is typically not relevant in fashioning a sentence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Guidelines do provide, however, that the court may consider a mental condition that is present to \u201can exceptional degree.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Furthermore, although the Guidelines are now advisory, sentencing courts still must consider them.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, Hernandez-De la Torre\u2019s argument that a sentencing court would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme is unpersuasive. Accordingly, Hernandez-De la Torre fails to carry his burden under the third prong of the plain error test. Concomitantly, Hernandez-De la Torre fails to demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances entitle him to resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">In the alternative, Hernandezr-De la Torre urges us to abandon the standard of review we adopted in <em>Mares </em>and instead apply the plain error standard employed by, <em>inter alia, </em>the Fourth Circuit. <em>Mares, </em>however, is the settled law of this circuit, and we may revisit it only en banc or following a Supreme Court decision that effectively overturns it. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Hernandez-De la Torre\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED. The government\u2019s motion to reinstate our prior affirmance is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b917-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
