Williams\u2019s motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted). If the appeal is frivolous, this court may dismiss it sua sponte under 5th Cm. R. 42.2. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202, n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Williams has failed to identify any error relevant to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint or the denial of his IFP motion. Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Because Williams has waived the only issue relevant to his appeal, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. Williams\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of Williams\u2019s civil rights complaint that we affirm this day in <em>Williams v. Sheriffs Department, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx-, No. 05-30598, 2006 WL 470607 (5th Cir. Feb. 23, 2006), also counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). Williams is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
