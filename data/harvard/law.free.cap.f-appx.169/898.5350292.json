Wanzer also asks this court to appoint counsel to represent him on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>After dismissing Wanzer\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, the district court denied Wanzer\u2019s petition to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith, and his motion seeking appointment of counsel on appeal, finding that Wanzer failed to present exceptional circumstances that would justify the appointment. By moving this court for leave to proceed IFP, Wanzer is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5). In this court, Wanzer alleges that the district court \u201cwrongfully\u201d determined facts against the weight of the evidence and that there were genuine issues of material fact which precluded summary judgment. Wanzer has not demonstrated any nonfrivolous ground for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">In order to establish an Eighth Amendment violation, Wanzer had to establish that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1993). To establish deliberate indifference, Wanzer had to offer \u201cfacts clearly evincing \u2018wanton\u2019 actions on the part of the defendants.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985). Thus, Wanzer had to show the defendants knew he faced a substantial risk of serious harm and disregarded \u201cthat risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). The district court correctly determined that Wanzer failed to establish that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. It also correctly determined that Wanzer failed to establish that he suffered from a serious medical condition. Wanzer has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his civil rights complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Based on the foregoing, Wanzer has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). His motion for IFP is therefore DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24. Wanzer\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is also DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">The dismissal of Wanzer\u2019s appeal as frivolous by this court counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Wanzer is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b924-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
