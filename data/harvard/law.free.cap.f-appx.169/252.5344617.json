State of Ala., </em>847 F.2d 282, 283 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Hagerty v. Succession of Clement, </em>749 F.2d 217, 220 (5th Cir.1984). Because Butcher\u2019s claims are inextricably intertwined with his probate action, the federal district court had no jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Phinizy, </em>847 F.2d at 283; <em>Hagerty, </em>749 F.2d at 220. Because the appeal lacks arguable merit, it is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-23\">Butcher is warned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal each count as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and that, if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). He is also warned that any future filing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>prosecution of paid frivolous appeals will invite the imposition of monetary sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
