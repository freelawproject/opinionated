In March 2003, Plaintiff initiated her first lawsuit against Defendants asserting claims for racial discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. Defendants moved to compel arbitration and dismiss the lawsuit in April 2003, and in June 2003, the district court entered an order granting Defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration. The parties proceeded to arbitration under the supervision of the American Arbitration Association. In January 2005, the arbitrator issued his award denying all of Plaintiffs requested relief. In March 2005, the arbitrator denied Plaintiffs request for modification of the arbitrator\u2019s award. In April 2005, Plaintiff initiated her second lawsuit against Defendants, once again claiming discrimination and retaliation under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. On motion of Defendants, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs second complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Rule 12(b)(6). Plaintiff appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the record excerpts, the reply brief and relevant portions of the record itself. For the reasons stated by the district court in its memorandum opinion and order filed July 15, 2005, we affirm the final judgment entered by the district court on July 25, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
