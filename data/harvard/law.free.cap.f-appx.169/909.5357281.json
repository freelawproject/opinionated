Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Castillo was charged with and the jury-found that she transported the illegal aliens \u201cfor purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain,\u201d she does not qualify for such a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Castillo also argues that the district court erred by increasing her sentence for creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person based on facts not alleged in the indictment or found by the jury, in contravention of <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and in violation of her Sixth Amendment rights. This argument lacks merit. By rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only, <em>Booker </em>eliminated the Sixth Amendment concerns that prohibited a sentencing judge from finding all facts relevant to sentencing. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 552 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\"><em>Fost-Booker </em>sentences are reviewed only for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 518. If, in the exercise of discretion, the sentencing judge imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range, we will infer that consideration was afforded all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 519. Moreover, given the deference due the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion, we will rarely say that a sentence within the properly calculated Guideline range was unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">Here, the district court fulfilled its duty to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors and sentenced Castillo within a properly calculated guidelines range. Castillo has failed to demonstrate that her properly calculated guidelines sentence was unreasonable. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519; <em>Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b935-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
