Garcia\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Garcia contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Garcia properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-28\">Garcia contends that his sentence must be vacated because he was sentenced pursuant to the mandatory sentencing guidelines regime that was held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We review Garcia\u2019s preserved challenge to his sentence for harmless error under Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(a). <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>district court, in denying Garcia\u2019s Fed. R.CrimP. 85(a) motion, stated that \u201cthe Court has no reason to believe in retrospect that it would have found the advisory guideline range unreasonable or that it would have imposed a more lenient sentence upon Garcia\u201d had the court considered the Guidelines to be advisory only. Based on the district court\u2019s statements, we conclude that the error in the imposition of Garcia\u2019s sentence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Garcia further argues that the sentencing error is structural and presumptively prejudicial. As Garcia concedes, we have previously rejected this argument. <em>Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463; <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, 411 F.3d </em>597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 464,163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b922-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
