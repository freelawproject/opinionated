Altato argues that under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court was not authorized to increase his sentence based on its factual finding that he recklessly endangered the lives of his alien passengers. Both the Government and Altato contest whether Altato admitted the facts supporting the reckless endangerment adjustment. However, neither party provided this court with a transcript of the rearraignment proceeding. Absent the transcript, this court cannot review this claim. <em>See e.g., United States v. Holmes, </em>406 F.3d 337, 366 &amp; n. 49 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 375,163 L.Ed.2d 163 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-24\">The district court, however, committed \u201cFanfan\u201d error by sentencing Altato pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). The Government concedes that Altato preserved his Fanfan claim. As such, this court reviews the claim for harmless error. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464. This court has rejected the argument that a Fanfan error is structural. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-25\">There is no indication in the record that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the guidelines been advisory rather than mandatory. The Government has not satisfied its burden of showing that the district court\u2019s Fanfan error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463-64. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">This court need not address at this time Altato\u2019s remaining argument challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
