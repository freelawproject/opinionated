The district court sentenced Gonzalez to 15 months of imprisonment, based in part on a prior illegal reentry conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">Gonzalez contends that his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Gonzalez thus alleges a \u201cFanfan\u201d error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). In the district court, Gonzalez objected to his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and the Government concedes that the issue is preserved and that it is subject to review for harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-22\">The Government has not carried its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error did not affect Gonzalez\u2019s sentence. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464; <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285-86 (5th Cir.2005). We therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464; <em>Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 285-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-23\">Gonzalez also contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. Gonzalez\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Gonzalez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Gonzalez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
