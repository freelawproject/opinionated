Walkup, Jr., filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition challenging his West Virginia state court convictions. He seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denying Walkup\u2019s motion to excuse exhaustion of state court remedies, granting Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to Walkup\u2019s motion to excuse exhaustion, and giving Walkup twenty days to file an amended \u00a7 2254 petition containing only exhausted claims or to withdraw his \u00a7 2254 petition in its entirety.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order Walkup seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b802-16\"> The district court entered its order on September 30, 2005. Walkup has neither filed an amended \u00a7 2254 petition nor withdrawn his \u00a7 2254 petition, and no final order has been issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
