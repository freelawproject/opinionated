He was sentenced to forty-eight months of imprisonment. On appeal, his attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising the issue of whether Williams\u2019 sentence is reasonable. Although advised of his right to do so, Williams has not filed a supplemental pro se brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Williams argues that his forty-eight-month sentence was unreasonable. After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). In determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>however, sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>Id. </em>As stated in <em>Hughes, </em>this court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. Further, this court has stated that \u201cwhile we believe that the appropriate circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the guideline range will depend on the facts of individual cases, we have no reason to doubt that most sentences will continue to fall within the applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 219 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). Indeed, \u201ca sentence imposed \u201cwithin the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Newsom, </em>428 F.3d 685, 687 (7th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Jan. 27, 2006 (No. 05-8986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">We find that the district court properly calculated the guideline range and appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory. The court sentenced Williams only after considering and examining the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). The court also clearly stated that it deemed the sentence \u201creasonable\u201d under the circumstances. Based on these factors, and because the court sentenced Williams within the applicable guideline range and the statutory maximum, we find that Williams\u2019 sentence of forty-eight months of imprisonment is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Williams\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
