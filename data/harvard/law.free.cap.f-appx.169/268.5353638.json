The district court sentenced Lino-Mejia to 63 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. We need not decide the applicability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>waiver in this case because the only issue that Lino-Mejia raises is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Lino-Mejia challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Lino-Mejia\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Lino-Mejia contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Lino-Mejia properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.%</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
