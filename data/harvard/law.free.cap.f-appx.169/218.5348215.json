At issue is the defendants\u2019 representation of Taylor in connection with a solicitation-of-capital-murder charge that was dismissed in exchange for Taylor\u2019s agreement to a civil forfeiture of property seized during a prior drug offense. Taylor argues that he introduced \u201ca substantial amount of evidence\u201d which created genuine issues with regard to the issues of causation and injury. He also argues that a jury should have been allowed to resolve various factual issues, including his motive in agreeing to the civil forfeiture and the appellees\u2019 motives in securing the dismissal of the solicitation charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Cates v. Creamer, </em>431 F.3d 456, 460 (5th Cir.2005). A motion for summary judgment will be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">An attorney malpractice action in Texas is based on negligence. <em>Cosgrove v. Grimes, </em>774 S.W.2d 662, 664 (Tex.1989). A plaintiff asserting attorney malpractice must establish that \u201c(1) the attorney owed the plaintiff a duty, (2) the attorney breached that duty, (3) the breach proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries, and (4) damages occurred.\u201d <em>Peeler v. Hughes &amp; Luce, </em>909 S.W.2d 494, 496 (Tex.1995). In order to show causation, the plaintiff must, in essence, \u201cprove \u2018a suit within a suit\u2019 by demonstrating that he would have prevailed in the underlying action but for his attorney\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Schlager v. Clements, </em>939 S.W.2d 183, 186-87 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ denied).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Taylor cannot show that the defendants proximately caused him harm in connection with the solicitation proceeding because the charge was dismissed with prejudice. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Taylor\u2019s averments regarding the motives and intent of the parties do not undermine the magistrate judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment. The magistrate judge\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is affirmed. <em>See Cates, </em>431 F.3d at 460; Rule 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
