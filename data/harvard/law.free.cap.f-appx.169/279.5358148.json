Jones contends that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was based on facts that were neither determined by a jury nor admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Because Jones challenges errors that occurred at sentencing, the claim may not be asserted in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Insofar as he has suggested that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 based on the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, because relief under the latter section is \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d such suggestion is unavailing. <em>Id. </em>at 427. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
