Vasquez filed the motion to challenge his 156-month sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. This court granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on whether Vasquez\u2019s defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance in connection with the following enhancements to Vasquez\u2019s offense level: (1) the three-level enhancement for aggravating role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) and (2) the two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Vasquez asserts that his counsel was deficient in failing to argue that there was insufficient evidence to support the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) for manager/supervisor. Vasquez asserts that the record demonstrates that the only person he instructed was a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d), who under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), does not qualify as a \u201cparticipant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">A defendant\u2019s base offense level may be increased three levels \u201c[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). To qualify for an adjustment under this section, \u201cthe defendant must have been the ... manager[ ] or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2). Application note two to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, however, recognizes an exception to the control requirement if a defendant \u201cexercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.2); <em>see also United States v. Ronning, </em>47 F.3d 710, 712 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Lopez-Urbina, </em>434 F.3d 750, 755 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">The record reflects that Vasquez was a partner in the drug-trafficking organization. Vasquez was responsible for transporting loads of narcotics smuggled from Mexico to the organization\u2019s stash houses in Laredo, Texas. He was also responsible for negotiating and arranging the delivery of the narcotics to certain destinations in the country. Vasquez admitted during rearraignment that he acted as an intermediary in arranging and escorting the transportation of the marijuana. Vasquez often used a Cl as his means of storing and transporting the narcotics. The record further reflects that Vasquez was transporting his own personal loads of narcotics. These actions are all indicia of Vasquez\u2019s elevated role in the criminal organization. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) enhancement. <em>See Lopez-Urbina, </em>434 F.3d 750, 7554. As such, it cannot be said that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance at sentencing. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688-89, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Vasquez also argues that his defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance in connection with the enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Vasquez asserts that there was insufficient evidence to show that he possessed any firearms or that it was foreseeable to him that his co-conspirators would possess firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Section \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) provides for a two-level increase to a defendant\u2019s base offense level \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\u201d during the commission of a drug trafficking offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); <em>United States v. Garza, </em>118 F.3d 278, 285 (5th Cir.1997). One co-conspirator may ordinarily be assessed a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) increase in view of another co-conspirator\u2019s possession of a firearm during the drug conspiracy so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>long as the use of the weapon was reasonably foreseeable. <em>United States v. Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d 337, 350 (5th Cir.1993) (citing <em>United States v. Aguilera-Zapata, </em>901 F.2d 1209,1215-16 (5th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">According to the record, 1,052 pounds of marijuana and 13 firearms, including an AK-47 assault rifle, were found in co-conspirator\u2019s, Jorge Hernandez\u2019s, residence which was located at 111 Allende Street. The residence was a stash house for the drug-trafficking organization. The record reflects that Vasquez had a load of marijuana delivered to the residence for safe storage. \u201cIt was readily foreseeable that firearms would be employed as tools of the drug-trafficking trade.\u201d <em>See Garza, </em>118 F.3d at 286. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement. <em>Id. </em>As such, Vasquez\u2019s counsel was not ineffective at sentencing. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688-89,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Vasquez has filed a motion to supplement his brief on appeal. He seeks to challenge his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This court cannot consider a habeas claim unless a COA has been issued on that claim. <em>See Lackey v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 149, 151 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Williamson, </em>183 F.3d 458, 464 n. 11 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, Vasquez\u2019s motion is DENIED. The judgment of the district court denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b901-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
