Zambrano asserts that the district court erred in ordering him to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample as a condition of supervised release and that this condition should therefore be vacated. He contends that the collection of his DNA violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">In <em>United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.2005) <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662), which was decided after Zambrano filed his brief, this court declined to address such an argument on the ground that the claim was not ripe for review. In accordance with <em>Riascos-Cuenu, </em>this court lacks jurisdiction over this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Zambrano also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. This challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Athough Zambrano contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Zambrano properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-18\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
