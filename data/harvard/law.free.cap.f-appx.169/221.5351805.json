Nieto\u2019s arguments that the defendants subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment because they failed to protect him from another inmate and used excessive force lack legal bases. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, 188 </em>F.3d 322, 326 (5th Cir.1999); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e); <em>Glenn v. City of Tyler, </em>242 F.3d 307, 314 (5th Cir. 2001). Nieto\u2019s claim that the defendants denied him access to the courts is likewise without a legal basis. <em>See Walker v. Navarro County Jail, 4 </em>F.3d 410, 413 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">Nieto\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">The dismissal of Nieto\u2019s complaint as frivolous and of this appeal as frivolous each count as \u201cstrikes\u201d for purposes of the three-strikes provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Nieto is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-18\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b248-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
