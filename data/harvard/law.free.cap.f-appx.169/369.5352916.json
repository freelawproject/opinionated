Citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), he argues that the district court erred in increasing his criminal history, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e), based on the conclusion that at the time of his illegal reentry, he had been released from custody for less than two years. Reyes also argues that the district court committed <em>\u201cFanfan </em>error\u201d when it sentenced him pursuant to a mandatory guideline system. Because we conclude that the district court committed <em>\u201cFanfan </em>error\u201d when it sentenced Reyes pursuant to a mandatory guideline system, <em>see United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005), we decline to address Reyes\u2019s argument that the application of \u00a7 4Al.l(e) amounted to <em>Booker </em>error. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">This court reviews a preserved <em>Fanfan </em>challenge for harmless error. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). The Government has not met its burden of demonstrating that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent its mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we remand the case for the district court to decide whether resentencing will be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Reyes\u2019s constitutional challenge to the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Reyes contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Reyes properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">AFFIRMED BUT REMANDED FOR THE DISTRICT COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER TO RESENTENCE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
