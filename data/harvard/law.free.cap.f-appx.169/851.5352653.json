The Government\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal is GRANTED. Argueta-Ramirez\u2019s motion to strike the Government\u2019s brief, in whole or in part, is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-19\">Argueta-Ramirez argues first that the district court plainly erred when it classified his prior state conviction as a drug trafficking offense that warranted a 12-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). Argueta-Ramirez is correct. California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a), the state statute under which Argueta-Ramirez was convicted, is worded so that some, but not all, violations of the statute constitute a drug trafficking offense consistent with the guidelines definition, and the documents introduced by the Government to support the enhancement indicate only that Argueta-Ramirez had been convicted of violating that state statute. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273-74 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005); <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352, 352-60, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 217, 163 L.Ed.2d 198 (2005). Moreover, the statements made by the district court after Argueta-Ramirez\u2019s plea was entered do not enlighten this court as to the basis for the district court\u2019s adjudication of guilt. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>see also Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-27\">Argueta-Ramirez argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in ordering him to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample as a condition of supervised release. This claim is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because it is not ripe for review. <em>See States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir. 2005). Argueta-Ramirez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Riascos-Cuenu, </em>but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-28\">Finally, Argueta-Ramirez challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Argueta-Ramirez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 276. ArguetaRamirez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION; CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED; MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT RECORD GRANTED; MOTION TO STRIKE BRIEF DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b877-20\"> Pursuant <em>to 5th Cir.
