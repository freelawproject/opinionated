Boche was sentenced to a 55-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-24\">For the first time on appeal, Boche challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Boche contends that her conviction should be reduced to one under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(2) and the judgment reformed to reflect conviction only under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-25\">Boche\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Boche contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Boche properly concedes that her argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but she raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"A2Y\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
