To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Takoulo fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Takoulo\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Takoulo fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Accordingly, although we grant the pending motion to file a supplemental appendix, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\">. Takoulo does not challenge the immigration judge's denial of his request for protection under the Convention Against Torture in his petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\">. To the extent that Takoulo challenges the immigration judge\u2019s refusal to allow his witness to testify, we find that he has waived this claim by failing to raise it before the Board. <em>See Astka v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Farrokhi v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 700 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
