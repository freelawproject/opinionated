In his appellate brief, Avila-Trujillo states that he is raising the issue whether the district court erred in imposing a sentence that violated the plea agreement without providing him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. However, he has not addressed or adequately briefed this issue in the body of his appellate brief. Therefore, he has abandoned this issue on appeal. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>408 F.3d 214, 216 n. 2 (5th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Avila-Trujillo argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by imposing his sentence based on his prior convictions which were not charged in the indictment, admitted by him, or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Avila-Trujillo\u2019s sentence was enhanced based solely on his prior state convictions for aggravated assault. Under <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), there is no requirement that Avila-Trujillo\u2019s prior criminal history be alleged in the indictment and either admitted by him or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Consistent with <em>Almendarez-Torres, \u201cBooker </em>explicitly excepts from Sixth Amendment analysis\u201d the fact of a prior conviction. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, 769; <em>United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1080, 163 L.Ed.2d 898 (2006). Therefore, the increase in Avila-Trujillo\u2019s sentence based on his prior convictions did not violate his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Booker. See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, 769; <em>Guevara, </em>408 F.3d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
