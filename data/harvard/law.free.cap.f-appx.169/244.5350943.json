Dill argues that the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate to raise his jurisdictional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-17\">Dill\u2019s jurisdictional argument, however, challenges his conviction and is therefore the type of claim reserved for \u00a7 2255 proceedings. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Dill has not shown that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir. 2001). He therefore cannot proceed under \u00a7 2241, and the district court, which was not Dill\u2019s sentencing court, did not err in dismissing his petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"AYL\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
