Chapa first argues that his sentence should be vacated because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">The Government concedes the error, and it further concedes that Chapa\u2019s objection under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), preserved the issue for appellate review. However, the Government contends that the error is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">The Government bears the burden of showing that a <em>Booker </em>error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir. 2005). The Government has failed to show \u201cthat the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286. Accordingly, we will vacate Chapa\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-18\">For the first time on appeal, Chapa challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Chapa contends that his conviction should be reduced to one under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(2) and the judgment reformed to reflect conviction only under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Chapa\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Chapa contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Chapa properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Chapa\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
