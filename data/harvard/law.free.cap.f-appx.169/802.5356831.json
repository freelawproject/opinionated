He contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Fergus contends that the evidence did not support his conspiracy conviction. We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 29 motion. <em>United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 693 (4th Cir.2005). Where, as here, the motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We have reviewed the trial testimony in the joint appendix and are convinced that the evidence was sufficient to convict Fergus. <em>See United States v. Strickland, </em>245 F.3d 368, 384-85 (4th Cir.2001) (discussing elements of offense); <em>United States v. Cardwell, </em>433 F.3d 378, 390 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201cIt is no defense to a conspiracy charge that one\u2019s role in the conspiracy is minor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Fergus\u2019 conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
