On appeal, he asserts that his sentence should not have been enhanced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) because (1) such an enhancement violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and (2) his prior North Carolina breaking and entering convictions did not qualify as predicate felonies. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">As Sales admits, his claim that the application of the ACCA violated the principles of <em>Booker </em>is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 286 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that fact of prior conviction is not subject to <em>Booker </em>requirements; that convictions cannot be severed from their essential components, including the integral facts such as the statutory violation and date of offense; and that these facts are inherent to convictions, not extraneous to them), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Oct. 25, 2005 (No. 05-7266); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 350 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by a jury was not violated by district court\u2019s reliance on his prior convictions for purposes of sentencing under the ACCA, even though convictions were neither charged in indictment nor admitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Sales also contends that his North Carolina convictions for breaking and entering did not constitute \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005) because they were not \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d Although breaking and entering, a Class H felony, carries a maximum term of 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, Sales was only subject to a term of 10-12 months, due to his criminal history and lack of admitted aggravating factors. (J.A. at 96, 104-05); <em>see North Carolina v. Allen, </em>359 N.C. 425, 615 S.E.2d 256, 265-70 (2005) (holding that, after <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), statutory maximum is the maximum that this particular defendant can face in light of his criminal history and the facts found by a jury or admitted by the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">However, as Sales admits, his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201ca prior North Carolina conviction was for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year if <em>any </em>defendant charged with that crime could receive a sentence of more than one year\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005). In addition, <em>Harp </em>considered and rejected the argument that <em>Allen </em>required a different result.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 246-47. Thus, because a sentence of over twelve months could be imposed on a defendant convicted of breaking and entering, Sales\u2019 prior convictions were properly considered felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">Accordingly, we affirm Sales\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\"> At the time <em>Harp </em>was decided, <em>Allen </em>was still pending on appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court affirmed the holding of the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which was the holding reviewed by this court. The North Carolina Court of Appeals held that the portion of the state sentencing guidelines that permitted judges to impose aggravated sentences based on facts not found by a jury violated <em>Blakely. North Carolina v. Allen, </em>166 N.C.App. 139, 601 S.E.2d 299, 306 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
