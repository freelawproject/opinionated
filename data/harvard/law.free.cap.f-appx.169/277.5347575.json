Williams\u2019s motion for reconsideration is construed as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion. <em>See Harcon Barge Co. v. D &amp; G Boat Rentals, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 665, 667 (5th Cir. 1986) (en banc). Because Williams\u2019s notice of appeal was filed fewer than 30 days from the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion but more than 30 days from the entry of judgment dismissing the underlying action, the notice of appeal is effective only as to the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Edwards v. City of Houston, </em>78 F.3d 983, 995 (5th Cir.1996); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4). Under Rule 60(b)(6), the district court may relieve a party of a final judgment for any \u201creason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). We review for abuse of discretion. <em>See McCorvey v. Hill, </em>385 F.3d 846, 848 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-16\">Even if Williams did not timely receive a copy of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, Williams gave the district court no reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. <em>See </em>Rule 60(b). The district court thus did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion. <em>See McCorvey, </em>385 F.3d at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">The district court\u2019s order denying Williams\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion is affirmed. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Williams\u2019s civil rights complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). The dismissal as frivolous of Williams\u2019s appeal in <em>Williams v. Pfizer Inc., </em>No. 05-30532, decided this day, also counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). We caution Williams that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-18\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
