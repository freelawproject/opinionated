The district court held in pertinent part that Avarez\u2019s claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Avarez has failed to brief this issue and therefore has waived its review. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-25\">Avarez\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. His motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). The dismissal of his appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>tute two strikes for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Alvarez is cautioned that if he obtains three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
