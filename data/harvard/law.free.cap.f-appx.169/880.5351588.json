Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, the parties have commented on the impact of <em>Booker. </em>For the following reasons, we conclude that <em>Booker </em>does not affect Defendants Appellant Hector Avila-Fernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Avila-Fernandez pleaded guilty to reentering the United States illegally following removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, an offense that is punishable by up to two years imprisonment. At his sentencing\u2014 which occurred prior to <em>Booker </em>\u2014 the district court increased Avila-Fernandez\u2019s offense level under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines by 16 levels, because he had a prior aggravated felony conviction. Following the Guidelines, the court sentenced Avila-Fernandez to 46 months imprisonment. Avila-Fernandez then appealed his sentence, arguing that it violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. After we affirmed in an unpublished opinion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Avila-Fernandez petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, asserting his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time. The Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded to us for reconsideration in light of Booker.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We again affirm Avila-Fernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">Avila-Fernandez raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his petition for a writ of certiorari. We will therefore review his <em>Booker </em>claim only in the presence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although we have yet to flesh out the contours of precisely what constitutes \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d we know that the extraordinary circumstances standard is more onerous than the plain error standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If, therefore, Avila-Fernandez cannot meet the requirements of plain error review, he certainly cannot satisfy the requirements of extraordinary circumstances review. So, despite the fact that Avila-Fernandez argues that the extraordinary circumstances standard is inapplicable in this case for a variety of reasons, because \u2014 as Avila-Fernandez concedes \u2014 he cannot meet even the lower plain error standard, we need not address his arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the circumstances in a case meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under <em>Booker, </em>a district court\u2019s sentencing of a defendant under mandatory Sentencing Guidelines (1) constitutes error that (2) is plain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry for which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He will carry this burden only if he can \u201cshow[ ] that the error \u2018must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That may be shown, in turn, by the defendant\u2019s \u201cdemonstrating] a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To demonstrate such a probability, the defendant must identify in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>the record an indication that the \u201csentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory [Guidelines] scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">In his supplemental letter brief, Avila-Fernandez concedes that <em>\u201cMares </em>appears to foreclose [his] plain-error claim in this circuit.\u201d Specifically, Avila-Fernandez is unable to point to any indication in the record that there is a probability that the sentencing judge would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Instead, he preserves a challenge to the standard of review we adopted in <em>Mares, </em>arguing that in <em>Mares </em>we got it wrong and the plain error standard employed by other courts (the Sixth Circuit, for example<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>) gets it right. <em>Mares </em>is the settled law of this circuit, however, and we may revisit it only <em>en banc </em>or following a Supreme Court decision that actually or effectively overturns it. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Avila-Fernandez\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion to reinstate our prior affirmance is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
