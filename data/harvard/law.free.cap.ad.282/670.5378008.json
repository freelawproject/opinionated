There has been no showing of prejudice. We find nothing else in the conduct of the arbitrators which could be considered misconduct. All of the complaints of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>substance relate to alleged errors of fact or law made by the arbitrators, which we may not review. Order unanimously reversed, with $20 costs and disbursements to the appellant, and the motion to confirm the award granted. Settle order on notice. Present \u2014 Peck, P. J., Glennon, Dore, Callahan and Bergan, JJ. [See <em>ante, </em>p. 669.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
