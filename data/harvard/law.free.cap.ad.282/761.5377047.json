This is not a matter of pleading but a matter of substantive law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Plaintiff has an election between an action on the contract and an action on an executory accord (Personal Property Law, \u00a7 33-a, subd. 3). Plainly he \u2022 may not pursue both or present both to the court. The alternatives are not to be presented in a pleading but represent a choice which must be made by the plaintiff in advance of pleading. Orders unanimously modified to require the plaintiff to make an election between the two causes of action and to serve an amended complaint accordingly. Settle orders on notice.
