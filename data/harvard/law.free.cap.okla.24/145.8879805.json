On July 25, 1899, defendants demurred, and the same was overruled, and on July 21, 1900, A. J. Seay appeared in open court and by leave and agreement of parties intervened and set up title to said warrants, claiming to have lost them, disclaiming any knowledge as to how they came to be in the possession of the plaintiff, and praying judgment thereon with interest. On September 26, 1903, by agreement, the People\u2019s National Bank was substituted for the People\u2019s Bank, and, by leave, filed answer to the petition .of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tervention denying generally the allegations in said petition, and stating, in substance: That on June 14, 1899, and prior thereto, the People\u2019s Bank was duly organized under the laws, of the territory of Oklahoma, and doing a general banking business at Kingfisher, Okla., with a capital stock of $10,000, with intervener as a stockholder, director, and vice president therein, at which time it was in the possession of said warrants claiming title; the same being listed and registered on its books and kept by it among the warrants and bills receivable, which said facts were well known to its directors, including intervener. That on said day John F. Stone, F. L. Winkler, F. L. Boynton, and H. K. Bickford became the owners by sale and transfer of all the stock and property of said bank, and on March 16, 1901, increased its capital stock and took in other stockholders, and on April 24, 1901, reorganized and became a national bank with a capital stock of $25,000. That by reason of the facts set forth intervener was estopped from setting up title to said warrants and prayed judgment thereon as stated in the petition of the People\u2019s Bank. On the same day intervener demurred to this answer, which was overruled, whereupon he filed a general denial in reply thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-4\">There was trial and judgment for the People\u2019s National Bank, against the county of Kingfisher for $367.75, and that intervener take nothing by his suit, which was dismissed. There was an appeal by intervener to the district court, where, on October 10, 1904, the then stockholders of the People\u2019s National Bank, by leave of court, intervened, reciting the history of the litigation and sought to enjoin the intervener, A. J. Seay, from further prosecution of his suit, which was demurred to by Seay and later, on his' motion, stricken from the files.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">On December 9, 1905, the cause was tried to the court, and, after the warrants were introduced in evidence, was submitted on an agreed statement of facts, in substance: That on January 3, 1898, the People\u2019s Bank was incorporated under the laws of the territory of Oklahoma with a capital stock of $10,000. That after several changes in the personnel of the stockholders, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>June 10, 1899, its stock was owned as follows: George Newer, 20 shares, H. K. Bickford, 50 Shares, A. J. Seay, 30 shares\u2014 they being president, cashier, and vice president, respectively, and constituting the board\u2019 of directors. That on said day Seay assigned his 30 shares aforesaid to John F. Stone, the transfer being duly made on the back of his stock certificate, and delivered the same to him on June 14, 1899. On June 13, 1899, George Newer, assigned his 20 shares of its stock, by transfer duly made on the back of his stock certificate, to F. L. Boynton, and on the same day H. K. Bickford, by transfer duly made on the back of his stock certificate, assigned his 50 shares to \u2022-. That on June 14, 1899, at a meeting of the stockholders of said bank, to wit, said Stone, Bickford, Boynton, and \"Winkler, the latter being elected president and said Bickford secretary, the resignations of Seay, Newer, and Bickford were accepted, with the exception of the latter, who retained three shares of the stock and agreed to remain as cashier for a short time. Said Stone, Winkler, and Boynton were elected as a new board of directors, and it was ordered that the stock of the bank be entered on the books of said corporation transfer record and new stock issued to the incoming parties. On that day the stock of said bank was owned by Boynton, 30 shares; Winkler, 20 shares; Stone, 47 shares; and Bickford 3 shares.\" That after several changes in the personnel of its stockholders, on February 2,. 1901, the capital stock of said bank was increased to $25,000, and on March 25, 1901, was converted into a national bank, under the name of the People\u2019s National Bank. That on a day between June 10, 1899, and June 14, 1899, said Newer and Seay resigned their offices as president and vice-president and as members of the board of directors, and have not since been connected in any official way with or as stockholders in said bank. That on the latter day, said Boynton, Stone, and Winkler were elected president, vice-president, and cashier, respectively, of said bank-. That on June 10, 1899, and for some time prior thereto, the intervener, A. J. Seay, was the owner of the warrants in controversy and never, at any time, sold or transferred them to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>People\u2019s Bank, or any person or persons.' That on said date and up to about June 25, 1899, said bank carried a warrant account on its individual deposit ledger, which amounted to $1,218.45.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">\u201cThat no list or schedule ox description of the warrants so carried in said individual deposit ledger was made out by said bank; but that the warrants representing said amount were kept in an envelope or jacket in the last pocket of the leather note case in which all the bills receivable and municipal bonds and warrants of the bank were all kept, and among the other warrants of the bank in the vault of said bank. That at the time the said A. J. Seay transferred his stock in said bank and resigned his office as vice president and member of the board of directors of said bank, the warrants were in said envelope, or said jacket, in said vault among the other warrants belonging to said bank.\u201d . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">That at said time \u201che had no actual, personal knowledge of the fact that said warrants were in said jacket, nor that he ever had any personal, actual knowledge that said warrants were in said jacket among the other warrants owned by said bank, nor had he ever had any personal, actual knowledge that such was the case, until after the commencement of this action.\u201d At the time said Seay sold his stock to Stone, and \u201cat the time of said sale and transfer of said bank, said warrants were among the bills receivable, and other assets of said bank, and it required said warrants to make up the full amount of bills receivable, warrants, and assets of said bank; and at said time said Seay received his full consideration for his stock, and other interests in said bank, and has at all times kept, and still retains, the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">The undisputed testimony shows: That these warrants were found by the new management among the assets of the People\u2019s Bank, a few days after June 14, 1899, and were sued on a short time thereafter; that intervener first saw them after their loss, with the papers in that suit; that he had been hunting them before and had, he thought, located them in the People\u2019s Bank before he sold his stock. No further resistance was made by the board of county commissioners, which agreed that judgment might go for either People\u2019s National Bank, or the intervener, Seay, whereupon the court rendered judgment in favor of said intervener and against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>said board on said warrants in the sum of $401 and costs, and on the same day said bank filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled, and exceptions saved, and has brought the case before us by petition in error and case-made for review.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-4\"><em>Robberts &amp; Garran </em>and <em>F.

The title to the corporate assets is in the corporation. Neither the legal nor equitable title thereto is in its stockholders. The ownership of shares of stock is but the ownership of the right to participate from time to time in the management and net profit of the business. 26 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law, 899. In <em>Gibbons v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Mahon, </em>136 U. S. 557, 10 Sup. Ct. 1058, 34 L. Ed. 525, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201cThe distinction between the title of a corporation and the interest of its members or stockholders in the property of the corporation is familiar and well settled. The ownership of that property is in the corporation, and not in the holders of shares of its stock. The interests of each stockholder consist in the right to a proportionate part of the profits whenever dividends are declared by the corporation, during its existence under its charter, and to a like proportion of the property remaining, upon the termination or dissolution of the corporation, after payment of its debts. <em>Van Allen v. Nolan, </em>70 U. S. (3 Wall.) 573, 584, 18 L. Ed. 229, 234; <em>Delaware Railroad Tax, </em>85 U. S. (18 Wall.) 206, 230, 21 L. Ed. 888, 896; <em>Tennessee v. Whitworth, </em>117 U. S. 129, 136, 6 Sup. Ct. 649, 29 L. Ed. 830, 832; <em>New Orleans v. Houston, </em>119 U. S. 265, 277, 7 Sup. Ct. 198, 30 L. Ed. 411, 415.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Therefore the transaction above referred to had no such effect, as claimed, upon the assets of the People\u2019s Bank as to pass the title thereto to the new set of stockholders, but the same remained the property of the bank as though nothing had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"A7K\">2. It being thus determined that the title to the assets of the bank remained in the bank and did not pas= by the sale of its stock to the new set of stockholders, it becomes immaterial to discuss to what extent Seay as a director was chargeable with knowledge of what the books of the bank contained. We think it sufficient to say, as was said,by Brewer, J., in <em>First National Bank v. Drake, </em>29 Kan. 329, 44 Am. Rep. 646, that public policy \u201csustains the doctrine of imputed knowledge on the part of the directors only so far as will protect the dealings of third parties with the bank, or will prevent the bank from suffering through inattention or wrong from the directors themselves,\u201d and has no application in this case. <em>Bryant v. Hawley, </em>7 Cal. App. xiii, 94 Pac. 850\u2018. While the assets so remained the property of the People\u2019s Bank, intermingled with which were the warrants in question, to wit, on July 20, 1899, one of the new management of said bank, finding them among its assets, sued the board of county commissioners of Kingfisher county thereon. Pending suit a year elapsed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>after which intervener Seay set up title thereto, claiming them as his long-lost warrants, and which is not denied. On March 25, 1901, the People\u2019s Bank having increased its capital stock, and having been converted into a national bank, intervened and claimed said warrants by virtue of its succession and said alleged estoppel. The eifect of the plea is to assert as a proposition of law that a stockholder and director in a bank, having lost a portion of his personal property, which has, without his actual knowledge, become inadvertently intermingled with the assets of the baftk, and as such appear upon its books, is estopped to assert title thereto as against the bank, after he has parted wdth his stock therein, where his assignee makes no complaint. To this we cannot assent. We can see how Stone, to whom Seay sold his stock, might complain and sue Seay, and perhaps recover in a proper action the difference between the value of his stock in the financial condition the bank was with the warrants added to its assets and what it was with them subtracted therefrom, or how he might sue to rescind the sale of the stock on the ground of mistake, but we can see no privity between Seay and the bank upon which the latter can predicate an estoppel and claim title to the warrants in itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Finding no error, the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b165-5\">All the Justices concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
