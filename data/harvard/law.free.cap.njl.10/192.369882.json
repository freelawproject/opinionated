L. Eakin, In behalf of the defendants produced an affidavit showing that all the lessors of the plaintiff, except Josiah Sparks and wife, are residents of the states of Pennsylvania and Delaware, and that Sparks was insolvent, and had been discharged under the insolvent laws in 1820 ; and thereupon moved that the proceedings in the cause be stayed, until security <em>be </em>given for the payment of costs. It was contended that although the case did not come within the words of the statute, yet that it was within the equitable principles by which the action of ejectment is regulated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-13\"><em>F. L. Macculloch, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amt\">Allhough Sparks, one of the plaintiffs, may have been insolvent in the year 1820, yet he may be perfectly solvent at this time. The affidavit does not bring ihe case within the statute, and at this sta^e of the cause an ejeptmenl is not within the especial control of the court, but is to be governed by the same rules as other actions.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-14\"><em>G. D. Wall, </em>replied.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b200-15\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AaK\">The fact of insolvency, if wo are authorised <em>to </em>extend the provision of the statute, on principles of equitable construction, is not sufficiently made out. Though insolvent in 1820, the time to which the affidavit relates, Sparks may be quite otherwise in 1827, when this suit was commenced. In a case reported in <em>Penn. Hep. </em>866, this court overruled an application for security for costs, one of the several lessors of the plaintiff, being a resident in the state. Motion overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
