The state of demand filed with the justice was as follows: \u201c The plaintiff comes into court on the return day of the summons and demands of the defendant the suni of fifty cents for wintering pasturing and washing a sheep, - - <em>$0 50</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">.f okh Stull.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">May 25h 1827.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\">A judgment was rendered by the Court of Common Pleas, In favour of Siuli the plaintiff below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\"><em>jEakin, </em>in behalf of Vangiltier the defendant below, moved to reverse this judgment, and among other reasons contended that the state of demand was insufficient and uncertain j thatts in all states of demand in justices courts, or declarations in other courts, <em>time </em>was necessary to be stated with certainty and precision.\u201d And that this had been repeatedly decided by this court, to wit;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-10\">Sn <em>Pen. </em>267, <em>Longstreet </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>the court said, that \u201c iru snaking out the cause of action, <em>dates </em>are proper and requisite.\u201d In <em>Pen, </em>320, <em>Lane v. </em>Pissant, <em>ib. </em>321, <em>Brant </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>the same error appears, though not alleged, and only noticed by the court under the general head, that the demand was insufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-11\">In <em>Pen. </em>370, <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Vandyke, </em>after reciting the demand the court say \u2014 \u201c Nov/ this, besides that it gives neither <em>time </em>nor place to these transactions,\u201d &amp;c. &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-12\">In <em>Pen. </em>407, <em>Seely </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>the court reversed the judgment, because the state of demand was altogether insufficient After stating three of the charges therein, the court say, i! and all these three without any date.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-13\">In <em>Pen. </em>640, <em>Ramsay </em>v. <em>Emans, </em>demand was for money had <em>fyc, </em>\u201c without any <em>date,\u201d </em>fee. and held insufficient</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZ2\">And in <em>South, </em>92, <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>the late <em>Chief Justice, </em>its giving the opinion of the court said : \u201c The importance of <em>dates </em>m these states of demand, is exceedingly manifest in this very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>case,\u201d 8ic. and the judgment was reversed for the insufficiency of the demand.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-7\"><em>McCulloch </em>for the defendant, in certiorari, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-8\">The question for the consideration of the court is not, whether the slate of demand filed in this cause would be deemed sufficient in the Superior Courts <em>\\ </em>it is at once conceded, that in them it would be held insufficient. But the court is to decide, whether upon the principles which have been recognised in regulating the proceedings in justice\u2019s courts, and from the spirit of the enactments of the legislature, this be a sufficient statement of demand, and drawn with such accuracy and technicality as our law requires in a justice\u2019s court. The courts for the trial of small causes were established with a view of bringing justice home to every man\u2019s door, and enabling individuals of common understanding to draw their pleadings, and conduct their own business, without resorting to counsel, and thereby incur an expense which the subject matter in dispute might not justify. The sum demanded in this case is but fifty cents j already have two adjudications been had before the.constitutional tribunals of our state upon this petty dispute j and should this court hold as strict a hand as is now contended for, in these small cases, and require a technical conformity with the rules of pleading, it would destroy the salutary intentions of the legislature in the enactment of the small cause act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-9\">To the sufficiency of this state of demand, it is objected, that the time when these services were rendered is not stated with Certainty and precision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-10\">To this error the case, of <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Snowhill, </em>1 Pen. 361, affords a full and sufficient answer. The charge in that case was: \u201c To services of my son, in attending your store one year, $ 50.\u201d Divers exceptions were taken in this case, and much was said upon it at the bar. Yet the court there held, that if the party be fully apprised of the demand which is to be set up against him, it is enough, and unanimously affirmed the judgment. In this case there was no averment of the time when the services were rendered, nor any allegation that they were performed at the request of the defendant, and both these were regarded as matter of evidence before the justice. The principle of this case is again recognised in <em>Pen. </em>461, 466, 560, 654, 712.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-11\">In <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Roff, Pen. 609, </em>the action was for money paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>and expended for the use of the defendant, without any allegation that it was at his instance and request, and the demand was held sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-3\">Defects in mere matter of form in the declaration, will be cured by the defendant\u2019s pleading over, and in some instances, even matters of substance. As in an action of trespass for taking goods, not stating them to <em>be the </em>property of the plaintiflj the defect will be aided if the defendant by his plea admit the plain-! tiff\u2019s property. 1 <em>Chitty </em>402. 1 <em>Sid. </em>184. <em>Com. Dig. Pleader, C </em>85, 87. <em>Plowd, </em>182. 8 <em>Coke </em>239. To the same point are <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>8 <em>Johns, </em>84. <em>Drake v. Corderoy, Sir W. Jones </em>307. <em>Cro. Car. </em>288. 6 <em>Binney </em>24. <em>Tuke and Condies case cited in Osborne </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>Alleyn. 7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-4\">In support of this error, several cases are cited, but they do not go the length contended for by the counsel. In <em>Longstreet </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>Pen. 267, the principle to be deduced is, that in filing a copy of an account instead of a state of demand before a justice, dates must be affixed to the several items of the account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">In <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Pissant, Pen. </em>320, a copy of an account was filed without any date to the account and without dates to the several items; yet these omissions were not assigned for error not noticed by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\">In <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Randalph, Pen. </em>370, the court say, the state of demand is wholly unintelligible and therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\">In <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Seeley, Pen. </em>408, the court again reverse because the demand was unintelligible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-8\">In <em>Ramsey v. Evans, Pen. </em>640, the demand was for money bad and received to the use of the plaintiff. It has long been decided that the common count for money had and received is Insufficient in a justice\u2019s court, and this was sufficient cause for reversal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-9\">In Sims v. <em>Smith, South. </em>92, there was no allegation as to the time when the special contract upon which the action was founded, was entered into 5 and it appears that the date was purposely omitted, with a view of avoiding the effect of a former judgment which was expected to be pleaded in abatement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-10\">But if the demand standing by itself should be deemed defective in <em>this </em>particular, I refer to the Item of set off, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>which it appears that the defendant was <em>fully </em>aware of the claim intended to be proved against him, and of the time when the services mentioned in the demand were, performed for him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b244-6\">Ewing, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXN\">The state of demand in this case makes no mention of the time when the services were rendered, for which the plaintiff claims to recover compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In the case, of <em>Sims v. </em>Smith, 1 <em>South. </em>92, the state of demand, because it contained no date, was deemed, insufficient, and the judgment was reversed. The same principle is recognized in the cases of <em>Longstreet </em>v. <em>Taylor, Penn. 267; Leary </em>v. <em>Vandyke, Ibid </em>370; <em>Seeley v. Foster, Ibid </em>407; and <em>Ramsay </em>v. <em>Evans, Ibid </em>640. In <em>Lippincott </em>v <em>Smith, </em>1 <em>South. </em>95, the time of the irespass for which the action was brought was set forth in the state of demand to have been e&lt; about in the month of September, 1314;\u201d a majority of the .court thought this charge sufficiently specific in trespass. <em>Justice Southard </em>was of opinion the allegation was too uncertain, even in trespass, and afforded sufficient ground for reversal. In <em>Timmerman v. Morrison, </em>14 <em>John. </em>389, on certiorari, a declaration in assumpsit in a justice\u2019s court was held bad, for not stating any time. <em>Comyns, tit. pleader, c. </em>19, says, the time of a matter charged in the declaration ought to be certainly alleged, and therefore if in assumpsit, the plaintiff omits the day when the promise was made, it is bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The cases cited by the counsel of the defendant, in certiorari, avail nothing. In <em>Montgomery v. Snowhill, Penn. </em>361, the want of time, was not urged, nor indeed from what appears on the state of demand, could such an objection have been well made, in point of fact. In the cases reported in <em>Penn. </em>461, 466, 654, 712, this point was not raised nor decided. In some <em>of them </em>there were dates ; in none was any notice taken of the defect; and in general these cases only prove the rule that mere technical formality is not required in a state of demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Let the judgment be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
