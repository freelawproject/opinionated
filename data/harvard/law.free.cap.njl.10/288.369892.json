The only one necessary to be noticed is: that there was an interlineation, in the- bond of the words <em>\u201c and ten </em>dollars,\u201d which interlinea\u00bb lion was not, in any manner, stated to have been made previous to its execution, or noted on the bond. He contended that the court of Common Pleas erred in dismissing the appeal on that ground; that the interlineation did not vitiate the bond; and that in the absence of all testimony, the presumption, was, that the interlineation was made before the execution of the bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ael\">J. <em>S.

The alteration in this bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>is <em>in </em>a material part of it. Because, if that part of the bond is struck out, the Court of Common Pleas have no jurisdiction. The presumption of law is, that the interlineation is made after the execution unless the <em>contrary </em>appears,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b297-3\">Ch. Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"A47j\">The Court of Common Pleas did right in dismissing the appeal. The party appellee is entitled to have a bond perfect upon the face of it. If the presumption is, that the alteration was made before the execution, yet it is only a pregumption, and may be overcome by proof to the contrary. Whether the alteration was made before or after the execution, must be put to a jury to determine, and the bond may be found to be invalid. The appellee is not compelled to take a bond which may turn out to ba bad. He is entitled to a good bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Motion refused,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
