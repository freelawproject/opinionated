EDSALL, AND OTHERS, SURETIES.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"0\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b198-2\">Sept. 1828.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-10\">1. A notice to assess damages, upon a judgment <em>entered </em>upon a sheriff\u2019s bond, is properly served upon the sheriff and his sureties, and need not be served upon the attorney who appeared for the defendants in the suit on the bond.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-11\">2. Such notice may ho given by any attorney selected by the parties interested in obtaining the assessment, though such attorney was not the one employed in the original suits on which the assessment is to be made.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-12\">3. It is not necessary to assign breaches on the record, after a judgment by default on a sheriff\u2019s bond.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-13\">A judgment by default having been obtained in this court, in May term last, on a sheriff\u2019s bond, against the late sheriff of Sussex, and his sureties\u2014</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-14\">W\u25a0 Ilalsted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9t\">now moved for leave to assess, as damages under that judgment, the amount of several amercements obtained against the late sheriff in the Court of Common Pleas of the county of Sussex, and in the Supreme Court; and offered to read a copy of a notice of this motion, which had been duly served upon the late sheriff and his sureties.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-15\"><em>Scudder, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An\">objected I. To the notice. 1. Because the attorney by whom it was signed, was not the attorney in the original suits on which the amercements against the sheriff had been obtained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-16\"><em>2. </em>Because the notice was not served upon the attorney of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>t\u00edis defendant who had entered his appearance to the suit, in this court, previous to the entry of the judgment by default, and who ought to have been served with notice of this motion, instead of the late sheriff and his sureties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-4\">II. He objected that no damages could <em>be </em>assessed under this judgment, upon the sheriff\u2019s bond, until breaches had been assigned upon the record, and cited 1 <em>Saund. </em>58 <em>note </em>1; <em>Rev. Laws </em>238, <em>sec. </em>9, 10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-5\"><em>llalsted, </em>replied, 1. As to the notice. I. That it was not necessary that it should be made by the attorney in the original suits in which the amercements against the sheriff were obtained\u00bb Because those suits were at an end, and this was a new proceeding in which the parties interested were at liberty to employ another attorney. It was analogous to the suing out a writ of <em>scire facias, </em>to revive a judgment which might be done by a different attorney from the one who obtained the <em>judgment; </em>and that even an execution might be issued by a different attorney from the one who obtained the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-6\">2d. That the notice was properly served upon the sheriff and his sureties instead of the attorney of the defendants in the suit on the bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-7\">II. As to the assignment of breaches, the practice had been Jong and well settled, that an assignment of breaches upon these bonds was unnecessary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b199-8\">Ch. Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ApI\">As to the notice, it was properly given by the attorney <em>J. S. llalsted. </em>It was not necessary to be given by the attorney in the original suit. The parlies interested may employ the same, or a different attorney to move for an assessment upon the sheriff\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The notice was also properly given to the sheriff and his sureties, and it would not have been proper to have given it to the <em>attorney; </em>ibis is a new and substantial proceeding after the determination of the suit. This point was decided iti a case recently before us from Somerset. In <em>Flommerfelt </em>v. <em>Zellers, 2 Halst. </em>31, an application was made for an attachment against a person, who disobeyed a rule to stay waste. The notice was given to the party, against which an objection was raised, but the court said it had been properly given.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">As <em>to </em>the assignment of breaches upon the record, it is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>uniform practice to assess the damages in this way. No instance can be found of an assignment of breaches upon sheriff\u2019s bond.</p>\n<author id=\"b200-8\">Ford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqQj\">As to the assignment of breaches, it appears to me that the breaches have been sufficiently assigned by the notice given to the defendant and his sureties.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Assessment ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
