Halsted, on behalf of <em>W. Pennington, </em>attorney for Van Houten, moved for leave to withdraw the <em>relicta </em>which had been signed at the last Circuit in Essex, for the purpose of pleading the discharge of Van Houten, under the insolvent act, previous to the commencement of the suit; and read an affidavit of the defendant, stating, that subsequent to the contracting of the debt, for which the action was brought, and previous to the commencement of the suit, he took the benefit of the insolvent law of this state, and that he did not inform his attorney of that fact, (until after he had filed a plea of the general issue, and the cause had been noticed for trial and called at the circuit,) under a belief that it would be sufficient for him to produce his discharge before the Circuit Court in order to obtain the benefit of it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-14\">\n<em>E.

Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"A_B\">We think this application too late. The discharge was allowed before the commencement of the suit, and' might have been pleaded, and probably would have been if not, concealed, it would almost seem studiously from the attorney by the defendant who availed hirnself of another plea, which had no support and was relinquished <em>at the Circuit. </em>Allowing to tho affidavit its <em>utmost </em>force, <em>the </em>only reason given for the delay, is an ignorance of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Application Overruled-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
