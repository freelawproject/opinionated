This general credit, he contended, was insufficient to bring the cause within the'jurisdiction of the justice. In support of the second reason, he referred to the two following items in the state of demand, <em>viz. </em>\u201c To loading vessel at his wharf, at Cedar-Bush Landing,\u201d and to \u201c sundries per day-book.\u201d <em>The first </em>items he contended was for a trespass, and the <em>second </em>for a book debt, and that they could not be joined in the same action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-3\">Wall, contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b65-4\">Ch. Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AOmp\">If the charge of sundries, per day book, stood alone, it would be objectionable for its generality. But it appears, that there is a credit given the defendant for the same amount, in the same language, on the same date ; and in as much as those two items taken together, clearly shew that there is no demand on this score, and that the one is extinguished by the other, we think we ought not to reverse the judgment on this ground. As to the objection that debt and trespass, are joined together, we think that the charge for \u201cloading vessel at Cedar-Bush Landing,\u201d is not a trespass, but merely for the use of the wharf or wharfage- \u2014 Therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Let the judgment be affirmed,.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
