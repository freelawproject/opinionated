That the justice, was not in his office, <em>but </em>that William Letson, a partner in trade of said justice, was <em>there; </em>and upon Probasco\u2019s enquiring for said justice, and informing the said Letson of his business, was told that Hartough, had sent a letter that morning, and solicited a further adjournment for a fortnight; and as the parties both requested it, such further adjournment would of course be granted. And that said Letson, further told Probasco, that it was unnecessary for him to remain until the said justice came in, as he would notify the justice of the application.\u201d That in consequence of this information, Probasco went home, and at the expiration of said fortnight, came prepared with his witnesses to try the cause, when he was informed, for the first time, that judgment had been rendered against him. That he was totally uninformed of the day of the trial, of said cause. And that he had a just and legal defence to make on the merits- of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">It further appeared, by the affidavit of Letson, that Joachim Hartough, the plaintiff below, sent a letter to the justice, in which he requested an adjournment of his suit against Probasco, for two-weeks. But the cause was actually adjourned only for one week, and that Hartough appeared on the day of the trial, and Insisted upon having the cause tried, and that if was tried in the absence of Probasco the defendant below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-7\"><em>Vroom, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Avt\">in certiorari, moved to reverse the judgment of the justice, because Probasco, was surprised and deceived as to the time of the trial, and had not an opportunity of being heard ; and cited <em>2 Pen. Rep. </em>630. 1 <em>South. Rep. </em>288.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b63-8\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Act\">The- act of the legislature, re-Vive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>trial of small causes, says, <em>\u201c </em>that to prevent fraud and surprises the justice may grant adjournment,\u201d and in this case we are inclined to think, he ought to have granted the adjournment for two weeks. This is not so strong a case as that of <em>Trueax </em>v. <em>Roberts. 1 South. </em>288: and we think the judgment ought to be reversed. Judgment reversed\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
