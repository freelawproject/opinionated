D. 1898; that on the said first day of April he employed one Henry Barrett as janitor for the court house, for the term of one year, at a salary of $50 per month; that such court house consists of a basement and first and second stories above the basement; that in the basement are located a steam heating plant, coal bins, working room for the janitor, water closets for men and women; on the first floor are the offices of the county and circuit clerks, superintendent of schools, sheriff, county treasurer and county judge; on the second floor are located the court room, grand and petit jury rooms, county surveyor\u2019s office and one room rented as an office; that such court house is located in the center of a lot of ground about 300 feet square, belonging to said county, on which grounds are walks running around said court house from each side of the court house to the public square, shade trees and a blue-grass lawn; that it is the duty of the janitor so employed by the sheriff to keep said court house properly cleaned, attend to the heating plant, keep the lawn mowed, ice and snow cleaned from the walks, and perform the usual duties of a janitor; that on the eighth day of March, 1898, the board of supervisors of said county made a contract in writing with one George G. Yenard, in and by which it undertook to employ him as janitor for said court house and grounds; that complainant, as such sheriff, put said Henry Barrett in the possession of such court house and grounds as janitor, and that said Barrett is now performing the duties of janitor thereof; that on the first day of April, 1898, said Yenard demanded the possession and janitorship of said court house of said Barrett, but that said Barrett refused to deliver the same or any part thereof, but still holds the same under his appointment; that said Yenard has never performed any of the duties of such janitorship; that the board of supervisors of said county has authorized J. E. Lane, county clerk of said county, to issue orders monthly to said Yenard for the sum of $45 each, pursuant to his said pretended employment; that said board of supervisors, through said Lane, is about to, and will, pay said Yenard the sum of $45, one month\u2019s salary, and thereby divert the public money from its proper channels, and will also pay said Yenard monthly, without his performing any services under such contract, although he has been ready and willing, and now is ready and willing, to perform such services. Brays for injunction restraining board of supervisors and county clerk from paying, and George G. Yenard from receiving, any money by virtue of such contract; that the contract may be set aside; general relief and process, making the county of McDonough, George G. Venard and J. E. Lane, defendants.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\" pgmap=\"418\">The bill was demurred to for want of equity. The demurrer was overruled, and the defendants electing to stand by it, a decree was entered in accordance with the pravTer of the bill, setting aside the contract between the county and Yenard, enjoining the county clerk from issuing orders to Yenard, as directed by the board of supervisors, and enjoining Yenard from exercising the functions of janitor of the court house and grounds.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-6\" pgmap=\"418\">Tom H.

App. 115.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-11\" pgmap=\"418\">The control of the coiirt house by the county board flows from the ownership of the court house by the county\u2014the control of the sheriff from his inherent duties as the executive officer of the court\u2014and is, in fact, only the custody of the courts themselves. Therefore there is not necessarily a conflict between sections of the statute which in the same words give the custody of the court house to both the sheriff and the county board. Dahnke v. The People, 57 Ill.

He constantly attended the courts within his jurisdiction, and had custody of the property and premises whereon courts were held, and was made responsible for the proper care thereof as well as the other discharge of his duties. 1 Bl.

Justice Harker</author> <p id=\"AZF\" pgmap=\"419\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b419-9\" pgmap=\"419\">The only question submitted for our decision in this controversy is whether the right to employ a janitor for the county court house and jail rests with the sheriff of the county or with the county board.</p> <p id=\"b419-10\" pgmap=\"419\">The sheriff contends for the right, under the common law powers incident to his office and Section 14, Chapter 125, Rev. Stat., entitled \u201cSheriff,\u201d which reads as follows:</p> <p id=\"b419-11\" pgmap=\"419\">\u201c He shall have the custody and care of the court house and jail of his county, except as otherwise provided.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b419-12\" pgmap=\"419(110) 420(13)\">The county board contends for the right under Sections 23, 24 and 25, Chapter 34, Bev. Stat., which provide that the \u201c powers of a county as a body corporate or politic shall be exercised by a county board; \u201d that \u201c each county shall have power * * * to make all contracts and do all other acts in relation to the property 'and concerns of the county necessary to the exercise of its corporate powers,\u201d and that \u201c the county boards of the several counties shall have power, first, to take and have the care and custody of all the real and personal estate owned by the county; second, to manage the county funds and county business, except as otherwise provided.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b420-5\" pgmap=\"420\">We are clearly of the opinion that the care and custody of the county court house and jail fall within the common-law powers and duties of the sheriff, and that the employment of a -necessary janitor to assist him was a right incident to his office. That right continues with him to-day in this State unless it has been taken from him by some constitutional or statutory provision. It is not contended that there is any constitutional provision which has that effect; and the nearest approach to it by any statutory provision is found in the first paragraph of Section 25, Chapter 34, Rev. Stat., which states that the county board shall have power \u201c to take and have the care and custody of all the real and personal estate owned by the county.\u201d That power is contained in the general enumeration of powers given to county boards in the chapter entitled \u201c Counties,\u201d and there is nothing in the section, nor in any other section of the chapter, showing a legislative intent to curtail the common law powers of the sheriff as custodian of the court house and jail.</p> <p id=\"b420-6\" pgmap=\"420\">In determining the question before us the paragraph quoted must be'construed in connection with section 14, chapter 125, which provides that the sheriff \u201c shall have the custody and care of the court house and jail of the county,\u201d which section, as we think, is but declaratory of the common law.</p> <p id=\"b420-7\" pgmap=\"420\">Invoking the familiar rule of construction that when there are two statutory provisions in apparent conflict, one general and applying to general subjects, and the other particular and applying to only one subject, the particular provision must prevail, it does not seem difficult to discover the legislative intention in the matter. The power of the county board as contained in the first provision relates to all the real and personal estate of the county generally, while the other provision relates to the jail and court house specifically.</p> <p id=\"b420-8\" pgmap=\"420(10) 421(56)\">The intention of the legislature not to interfere with the common law right of the sheriff as custodian of the court house and jail, is further manifested by a provision contained in section 24 of the chapter entitled \u201c Sheriffs,\u201d which requires him on going out of office to deliver to his successor \u201c the possession of the court house and jail of his county.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b421-7\" pgmap=\"421\">The above views are in harmony with those of the Supreme Court as expressed in the opinion of Mr. Justice Magruder in Dahnke v. The People, 168 Ill. 102. Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
