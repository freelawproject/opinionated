J udgment for \u00a745\u2014from which this appeal.</p><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\" pgmap=\"281\">The evidence shows that appellee, through his driver, delivered the beer at the depot of appellant at Mt. Vernon to be shipped to Pete Farthing, at Salem. That the agent of appellant at the depot said he was busy, and after being told to whom the beer was to be shipped, said, \u201c Well, I will just put that down, and do not need a bill of lading,\u201d and showed where to put the beer on the platform. Subsequently the agent telephoned appellee to know where the beer was to be sent, and was told to Pete Farthing, at Salem. The beer was not billed to Farthing, but was billed to the depot agent of appellant, at Salem. While there is a conflict in the evidence, there is sufficient evidence to sustain a finding by the jury that the delay in delivery at Salem was through the failure of appellant to bill the beer to Farthing, and that on account of this delay, the keg beer was injured in quality, and for this reason was not received by Farthing. Appellant refused to deliver the case beer unless Farthing would also receive the keg beer. All was then reshipped to Mt. Vernon by appellant. Appellee offered to take back the case beer, but declined to receive the keg beer on the ground that it was spoiled. Appellant refused to deliver the case beer to appellee unless freight charges were paid.</p><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-6\" pgmap=\"281\">W. H. Lyford and E. H.

For this neglect appellant is liable. Appellee was not chargeable for freight to and from Salem, when, by appellant\u2019s fault, the beer was not delivered; and was not therefore entitled to insist upon freight charges before delivering the case beer when appellee offered to take it back.</p> <p id=\"b282-4\" pgmap=\"282\">We find no error in the instructions given for appellee.</p> <p id=\"b282-5\" pgmap=\"282\">The instructions given for appellant embraced all that was proper to be given that is contained in the refused instructions.
