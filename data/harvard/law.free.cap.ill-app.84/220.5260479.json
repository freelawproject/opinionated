Other claims for total disability shall be referred to the grand master, first vice-grand master, and grand secretary and treasurer, who shall decide as to whether or not the disability is of such a nature as to totally and permanently incapacitate the claimant from the performance of duty in any department of the train or yard service, and if the claim is approved by them, the claimant shall receive the full amount of the beneficiary certificate or certificates held by him.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-4\" pgmap=\"230\">The section of the constitution in regard to disputed claims is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\" pgmap=\"230\">\u201c Section 48.

And' the defendant avers that in and by section 48 of the constitution, it is expressly provided as follows:</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-4\" pgmap=\"232\">\u201cEvery death and permanent disability claim having been disallowed by the grand secretary and treasurer shall be referred to the beneficiary board provided for in Sec. 44, and if rejected by said board, the claimant shall have \" the right to appeal' to the grand lodge; and no suit or action at law or in equity shall ever be commenced upon any beneficiary certificate until after such appeal has been taken and decided; that the claim and certificate upon which plaintiff sues herein are one and the same as provided for in said section, and not other and different claims and certificates; that after said rejection and disallowance of said claim by the said board as aforesaid, the plaintiff did not take and has not at any time before or after the commencement of said suit, taken and perfected any appeal whatever from the decision and action of said board to said grand lodge, as he had a right to do and as required 1 by said Sec. 48; and that said grand lodge, defendant, was, during all the times aforesaid and still is, the supreme and appellate body of said brotherhood, which body alone has power and authority under said constitution and general rules to finally allow or disallow the said claim of the plaintiff.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\" pgmap=\"232\">All which matters and things aforesaid the defendant is ready to verify; wherefore,-it says, the plaintiff\u2019s said suit is premature, and the defendant prays judgment of said writ and declaration and that the same may be quashed.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\" pgmap=\"232(20) 233(47)\">On the fourth day of the term defendant\u2019s attorneys asked, and the court .granted them, time, to plead until, the seventh day of the term. On the sixth day of the term they filed another plea in abatement, which was an exact copy of the plea before given, except it was duly verified by affidavit. On motion of the plaintiff both pleas were stricken from the files.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-4\" pgmap=\"233\">The defendant then filed a plea of general issue, and also a special plea in bar, setting up the same matters contained in the plea in abatement. To the latter plea a demurrer was sustained on the special grounds that the matters therein alleged were matters in abatement only, and not in bar of the action; but if in bar, they were admissible under the general issue; the case went to trial on the plea of general issue only, but no evidence was offered under it of the matters set up in the special plea in bar, and plaintiff recovered a verdict and judgment for $1,250, and the defendant has brought the case here by appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-5\" pgmap=\"233\">Foster &amp; Carlock and Marshall W.

Tucker, 157 Ill. 194.</p> <opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b233-9\" pgmap=\"233\">Mr. Justice Bigelow</author> <p id=\"ARL\" pgmap=\"233\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"AfT\" pgmap=\"233\">Appellant has assigned a number of errors on the record, which we will notice in their order.</p> <p id=\"b234-4\" pgmap=\"234\">The first error assigned challenges the ruling of the court in sustaining appellee\u2019s motion to strike the plea in abatement from the files. The record is in no condition to raise the question as to whether the ruling of the court was correct or otherwise. It is true, several lengthy affidavits relating to the pleas have been copied by the clerk in transcribing the record, but they are no part of the record, since they are not preserved by any bill of exceptions, and they could have become a part of the record only by having been so preserved. The same rule obtains as to the motion itself.</p> <p id=\"b234-5\" pgmap=\"234\">In the absence of a bill of exceptions preserving the evidence and the rulings of the court, the presumption is it ruled correctly. Besides, after appellant had filed its first plea in abatement, it asked and obtained leave to plead again. This was a waiver of the plea in abatement. Leave to plead meant that the defendant should answer in some way to the merits of the case, and this could only be done by demurrer to the declaration, or by pleading in bar of the action. The error is not wTell assigned.</p> <p id=\"b234-6\" pgmap=\"234\">The second errror challenges the ruling of the court in sustaining plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to defendant\u2019s special plea in bar. Tne demurrer was general and special. Appellant\u2019s counsel say in regard to this error : \u201c After having stricken the plea in abatement from the files it was error to sustain demurrer to plea in bar settingup the same matter.\u201d Ao reason is attempted to be given why the matter set up in the plea, if proper to have been considered by the jury, could not have been given in evidence, under the plea of general issue, and as we are unable to discover any, the judgment of the court sustaining the demurrer must be held to have been correct.</p> <p id=\"b234-7\" pgmap=\"234\">The third assignment of error challenges plaintiff\u2019s three instructions. The first instruction\" told the jury that section 48 of the constitution of the order, providing for an appeal from the decision of the officers of the order rejecting the claim, was permissive only, and that plaintiff was not bound to appeal to the grand lodge before bringing suit.</p> <p id=\"b235-3\" pgmap=\"235\">Section 48 of the constitution provides that when a claim is rejected by the officers of the order the claimant \u201c may appeal to the grand lodge.\u201d ISTo obligation is imposed on the claimant to appeal, and he forfeits nothing if he omits to do so. Besides, the claim is against the lodge, and the appeal is given to the lodge, thus giving it the right to sit in judgment on its own case. Under such circumstances it would have to clearly appear that the claimant had agreed to submit his rights twice to interested umpires before a court would require him to do it as a condition to his right to sue in a court of law.</p> <p id=\"b235-5\" pgmap=\"235\">It may not be out of place to inquire why, if a claimant was bound to appeal from the decision of the officers of the lodge before he could maintain a suit for his claim, was it necessary to enact further laws, such as were set up in the plea in abatement ?</p> <p id=\"b235-6\" pgmap=\"235\">In the case of People ex rel. v. Order of Foresters, 162 Ill. 78, the court said:</p> <blockquote id=\"b235-7\" pgmap=\"235\">\u2018\u2018Where the controversy is concerning the discipline or policy or doctrine of the order or fraternity, the member must resort to the method of procedure prescribed by the association, including the remedy by appeal, before invoking the power of the courts. But it is otherwise where a member claims money due from the society on its contract, or where the beneficiary of a deceased member claims money due on its contract of insurance; in such case the right to resort to the courts to coerce payment will not be .abridged by the right of appeal from a lower to a higher tribunal of the society as conferred by its laws and rules.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b235-8\" pgmap=\"235\">There was no error in giving the instruction. A. O. U.W. v. Grogan, 44 Ill. App. Ill.</p> <p id=\"b235-9\" pgmap=\"235\">The objection to the second instruction is substantially the same as to the first, and it was properly given.</p> <p id=\"b235-10\" pgmap=\"235(79) 236(46)\">The third instruction told the jury in effect that if they found for the plaintiff they would allow him the amount of the certificate and interest at five per cent from the date of the rejection of the claim, and the total amount was fixed in the instruction. The certificate was an instrument in writing, and there was no dispute as to the date of the rejection of the claim, and it is not claimed that the interest computed by the court was too much, and while it would have been the better practice to have left the computation of the interest to the jury, the error, if it was such, did no harm and is not sufficient ground for reversing the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b236-5\" pgmap=\"236\">\u2022 The refusal of the court to give defendant\u2019s instruction No. 14 is also claimed to be error. The substance of it was that the plaintiff could not maintain a suit on his claim until it was submitted to and approved by the officers of the lodge named in section 48 of the constitution.</p> <p id=\"b236-6\" pgmap=\"236\">From what has already been said in regard to plaintiff\u2019s first and second instructions, it follows that the instruction was properly refused.</p> <p id=\"b236-7\" pgmap=\"236\">Error is also assigned on the rulings of the court in overruling defendant\u2019s objections to certain evidence introduced by plaintiff. We have examined the evidence and are of the opinion that no material error was committed by its admission.</p> <p id=\"b236-8\" pgmap=\"236\">The final error insisted upon is that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence and therefore the court should have sustained defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The verdict can not be said to have been the effect of passion or prejudice. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence was quite sufficient to sustain the verdict, and we can not say the jury were not justified by the evidence in finding as they did, and the judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
