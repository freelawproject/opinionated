McDonald. [Seal.]</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-10\" pgmap=\"341\">J. W. Pattekson &amp; Co. [Seal.] \u201d</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-11\" pgmap=\"341\">And setting up further that extra work was done and material furnished by them, in and about the building during its construction, at the special request of McDonald.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-12\" pgmap=\"341(30) 342(73)\">The petition further averred that Patterson &amp; Co. commenced work on the building immediately after the date of the written contract, and completed it on the May 5, 1896, after which McDonald accepted it; that Patterson &amp; Co. filed with the Circuit Court of Vermilion County, their claim for a lien upon said lot, duly verified as required by statute; and that McDonald paid them only $12,324.28 on account of said labor and material, which leaves a balance due them therefor of $15,011.47, with interest and attorney fees, for all of which they claim a lien in pursuance of the statute, etc.</p><p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-4\" pgmap=\"342\">The appellees, other than Patterson &amp; Co., by leave of court, intervened in the proceedings thus instituted, and became parties thereto, and set up that they, as sub-contractors under Patterson &amp; Co., had respectively furnished labor and material which went into said building, and each claimed a lien for the amount due him or them respectively therefor.</p><p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-5\" pgmap=\"342\">The appellant answered the petition and intervening petitions, in which he admitted he owned the lot described therein; that he had made the written contract with Patterson &amp; Go. as claimed, but denied that Patterson &amp; Co, or the interveners had erected on said lot the building agreed to be erected thereon by the terms of the written contract, but had constructed thereon a building greatly inferior to the one contracted for; that he had paid them more money for the building so constructed than the same was reasonably worth; and that he was not indebted to Patterson &amp; Co., or the intervenors, or any of them, for anything whatever.</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-6\" pgmap=\"342\">Eeplications were filed to the answer, and the court referred the' case to the master in chancery to take evidence, state an account between the parties, and report to the court his conclusions upon the law and the facts in the case.</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-7\" pgmap=\"342\">The master took the evidence and made up his report, showing his conclusions upon the law and facts in the case; which report is substantially as follows:</p><p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-8\" pgmap=\"342(30) 343(150)\">That on June 17, 1895, Patterson &amp; Co. contracted with the Henry Taylor Lumber Co., for $2,955, to furnish the lumber and mill work; that June 14, 1895, they contracted with Wiseman &amp; Son, for $997, to furnish all work included in the painters\u2019 and glaziers\u2019 specifications; that J une 14, 1895, they contracted with E. J. Ryan, for the sum of $921, to do all the gasfitting, plumbing and sewerage; that June 11, 1895, they contracted with Doyle &amp; Co., for $1,850, to do all the plastering and furnish and set all the partitions; that June 14, 1895, they contracted with Pullis Bros. Iron Co., for $4,750, to furnish all the material and do all the work included in the iron plans and specifications; that on June 14, 1895, they contracted with Carson &amp; Co., for $1,252, to perform and finish all the work included in the heating specifications; and that some time in June they made a verbal contract with John A. Lewis, for $4,733, to do all the work in the miscellaneous plans and specifications.</p><p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-5\" pgmap=\"343\">That Chesley Bros., Bireline &amp; Orr, M. Gaynor and Abdill &amp; Son furnished material and did work.</p><p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\" pgmap=\"343\">That all these persons filed their liens in' this case and ask to have them determined.</p><p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\" pgmap=\"343\">Finds that McDonald, without certificates, paid as follows:</p><p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-8\" pgmap=\"343\">September, 1895.......... .$4,000 00</p><p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-9\" pgmap=\"343\">November, 1895....... 3,600 00</p><p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-10\" pgmap=\"343\">December,.............. 3,500 00</p><p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-11\" pgmap=\"343\">February, 1896....... 328 00</p><p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-12\" pgmap=\"343\">March, 1896............................... 541 35</p><p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-13\" pgmap=\"343\">Electric Co., claim..........\u25a0................... 646 00</p><p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-14\" pgmap=\"343\">Also for divers extras, without certificates, or evidence that the property was free from liens.</p><p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-15\" pgmap=\"343\">Finds that about a week before the completion of the building, Treat, of Treat &amp; Folz, as a representative of McDonald and at his request, came to Danville and examined the building, and after examination made no objection to the contractors as to the kind and quality of the work or material. That he issued and delivered to McDonald two certificates, each for the sum of $4,000; and that certificates were issued to Doyle &amp; Co. for $1,200 balance in full, and $154 for extras; also to the Terra Cotta Co. for amount due it.</p><p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-4\" pgmap=\"344\">That McDonald has refused to recognize or accept these certificates.</p><p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-5\" pgmap=\"344\">That without certificates from the architects, numerous changes and alterations were made from the plan and specifications, by agreement between the owner and contractor, requiring more material and more work-\u2014among others, a larger and heavier wall was put under the building on the east and north sides, etc.</p><p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-6\" pgmap=\"344\">That Patterson &amp; Co. applied to McDonald for a settlement of the balance due; that McDonald requested Patterson &amp; Co. to present him with a' certificate of the architects that the work had been completed to their satisfaction; that thereupon Patterson &amp; Co. did apply for the certificate and requested Treat &amp; Foltz to come and examine the building; that Treat &amp; Folz replied that they were in the employ of McDonald, and would not come to Danville unless they were requested by McDonald, .etc.</p><p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-7\" pgmap=\"344\">That therefore the master concludes that the provisions in the contract relative to the architects\u2019 certificates and the good and sufficient evidence were waived by McDonald; and that Patterson &amp; Co. had done everything in their power to obtain the certificates, and were only prevented by the refusal of Treat &amp; Foltz to come and examine the building.</p><p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\" pgmap=\"344\">The master further finds that prior to the completion of the building, when about all but the painting was done, Mater, of Patterson &amp; Co., went to Walton, superintendent for McDonald, and asked if there were defects, or anything remaining undone; that Walton read a list of things he wished done, and\" that Mater went over the. building and did the work requested. That Mater again asked Walton if there was any other changes to be made, signifying his willingness to do the same.</p><p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-9\" pgmap=\"344\">The master finds that Patterson &amp; Co. were delayed in the construction of the building a period of one hundred and sixty-nine days; that the delay was caused- partly by the unusual action of the elements, partly by changes, and partly by the default of Pullis Bros. Iron Co., one of the contractors, in furnishing material.</p><p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-3\" pgmap=\"345\">That at the time of the delay Patterson &amp; Co. repeatedly presented claims to the architects for additional time, but that the architects refused to grant additional time.</p><p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-4\" pgmap=\"345\">That sixteen days delay was caused by McDonald being compelled to tear down and rebuild the north and east foundation walls, and eighteen days in extending and changing the lavatory, and thirty-five days by the unusual action of the elements, and one hundred days by the default of Pullis Bros. Iron Co.</p><p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\" pgmap=\"345\">\u25a0 That there is some defective work in the building, caused by being done in midwinter, owing to the default of Pullis Bros.

The court sustained the exceptions of the appellant as to two items as follows:</p><p data-order=\"472\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-12\" pgmap=\"364\">The court allowed appellant as against E. J. Ryan $7.50 on water-closets, and as against Patterson &amp; Go. $54 on sidewalk over lavatory, and ordered the master\u2019s report and \u25a0 statement of account to be corrected by deducting $7.50 from the amount due E. J. Ryan and $54 from the amount fexmtov.duR-Patterson &amp; Go., and the report and findings \u25a0 Avei^\u00c9^imingly so corrected. The court then overruled all oth^ exceptions, and entered a final decree in accordance with' the corrected report and findings of the master; and on evidence heard in, open court the master was allowed $300 for time spent in stating the account, etc., to be taxed in his favor as costs; four-fifths of the costs were ordered taxed to appellant, except the costs made by Gaynor and Bireline &amp; Orr. The other one-fifth of the costs were ordered taxed to the other parties, in proportion to the amounts of, liens allowed each of them.</p><p data-order=\"473\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-15\" pgmap=\"364\">From which decree McDonald brings the case to this court by appeal, and assigns upon the record the following errors, to wit: . .......</p><p data-order=\"474\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-16\" pgmap=\"364(20) 365(12)\">. \u201c First. The Circuit Court erred in overruling the defendant McDonald\u2019s exceptions to the findings, and to the report of conclusions of law and fact of the master in chancery.</p><p data-order=\"475\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\" pgmap=\"365\">\u201c Second. The Circuit Court erred in finding for the complainants and in entering a decree against the defendant, McDonald, in favor of the contractors, J. W. Patterson &amp; Co., for the sum of $13,294.38, and ordering him to pay the same within twenty days from the 30th day of July, 1898.</p><p data-order=\"476\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\" pgmap=\"365\">\u201c The Circuit Court erred in ordering that out of the proceeds of sale the following parties be paid the amounts set opposite their respective names, that is to say:</p><p data-order=\"477\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\" pgmap=\"365\">Henry Taylor Lumber Company.......$2,769 29</p><p data-order=\"478\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\" pgmap=\"365\">Carson &amp; Company.................. 1,022 68</p><p data-order=\"479\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-9\" pgmap=\"365\">John Doyle &amp; Company.............. 2,158 65</p><p data-order=\"480\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-10\" pgmap=\"365\">J.

The Circuit Court erred in adjudging and decreeing - that defendant, McDonald, pay interest from the 16th day of May, 1896, to the date of final decree on accounts found due by the master to the contractors and sub-contractors.</p><p data-order=\"487\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-17\" pgmap=\"365\">\u201c Fifth. The Circuit Court erred in considering incompetent testimony offered by the contractors and subcontractors and in not sustaining objections thereto, and motions to exclude the same interposed by the defendant, McDonald.</p><p data-order=\"488\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-19\" pgmap=\"365\">\u201cSixth. The Circuit Court erred in not allowing the master in chancery, A. A. Partlow, three hundred dollars for stating an account in this cause, and in ordering that the same be taxed as costs.</p><p data-order=\"489\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-20\" pgmap=\"365\">\u201c Seventh. The Circuit Court erred in not allowing the defendant, Robert McDonald, fifteen dollars per day as liquidated damages under the terms of the contract, from the 20tli day of November, 1895, to, that is to say, the 6th day of May, 1896.</p><p data-order=\"490\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-21\" pgmap=\"365\">\u25a0 \u201c Eighth. The Circuit Court erred in approving the final decree in this cause as the same appears of record and herein authenticated.</p><p data-order=\"491\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-22\" pgmap=\"365\">\u201c Ninth. The Circuit Court erred in adjudging and ordering the defendant, Robert D. McDonald, to pay four-fifths of the costs in this case.</p><p data-order=\"492\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-3\" pgmap=\"366\">\u201c Tenth. The Circuit Court erred in not adjudging and ordering the complainants to pay the costs in this case.</p><p data-order=\"493\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\" pgmap=\"366\">\u201c Eleventh. The Circuit Court erred in not dismissing the bill of complaint in this cause at the costs of the complainants.</p><p data-order=\"494\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\" pgmap=\"366\">\u201c Twelfth. The Circuit -Court erred in finding and adjudging in favor of the principal complainants, being the contractors, when they, the contractors, failed to obtain from the architects the certificates required by the fourteenth paragraph of the contract, and failed to show a sufficient cause for not obtaining them.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"495\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\" pgmap=\"366\">And J. W. Patterson &amp; Co., J. Wiseman &amp; Son, and the Henry Taylor Lumber Co., appellees, have also by leave of this court assigned upon the record the following errors, to wit:</p><p data-order=\"496\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\" pgmap=\"366\">\u201c(1) Said master and the court erred in not allowing to complainants, and each of them, the attorney\u2019s fees provided for in the statute, claimed in the bill, and shown and proven under evidence.</p><p data-order=\"497\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-8\" pgmap=\"366\">(2) The report, findings and statement of account of master and decree of court is erroneous, in that it allows to appellant thirty-five dollars damage as against J. Wiseman &amp; Son for defects in the puttying.</p><p data-order=\"498\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-9\" pgmap=\"366\">(3) The master and court erred in allowing to appellant damages as against each of these complainants and each item thereof, as shown by the master\u2019s report.</p><p data-order=\"499\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-10\" pgmap=\"366\">(4) Said master and the court erred in refusing to allow these complainants, and each of them, the items in their respective claims for extra work and labor done and materials furnished in and about the erection of said building.</p><p data-order=\"500\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-11\" pgmap=\"366\">(5) Said report, findings, conclusions and statement of account of the master and the decree of court are erroneous in not allowing to J. W. Patterson &amp; Co. the sum of $943, and allowing appellant credit with $4,000, when, as a matter of fact, only $3,057 was actually received.</p><p data-order=\"501\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-12\" pgmap=\"366\">(6) Said master erred in overruling complainant\u2019s objections and each of them to his report and conclusions, and statement of account.</p><p data-order=\"502\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-13\" pgmap=\"366\">(7) The court erred in overruling complainant\u2019s exceptions, and each of them.</p><p data-order=\"503\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-14\" pgmap=\"366\">(8) The court erred in not sustaining complainant\u2019s exceptions, and each of them.\u201d</p> <opinion data-order=\"504\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b366-15\" pgmap=\"366\">Mb. Justice Bubboughs</author> <p id=\"Aver\" pgmap=\"366\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b366-16\" pgmap=\"366(11) 367(158)\">The report of the master in chancery to whom this cause was referred by the Circuit Court, to take testimony and report conclusions of law and fact, and which is substantially set out in the statement preceding this opinion, gives some idea of the claims of the parties, and the facts in this case, as appears by the evidence in this voluminous record; and after a careful examination of the report and all the evidence, and the objections urged by appellant\u2019s counsel, and also those urged by .counsel representing some of the appellees, we are satisfied, that while there are some inaccuracies in the decree, yet on the whole it does not contain prejudicial error as against the appellant, or the complaining appellees, except as to the allowance of $300 to the master as costs for his labor and time spent in stating the account between the parties, which is in excess of what the statute permits therefor; and to which we will refer hereafter.</p> <p id=\"b367-5\" pgmap=\"367\">We think that the changes made in the building. during its construction, by agreement of the owner and contractors, justified all the extra allowances above the contract price that were made to the appellees by the decree; and that their failure to use the exact material specified in the contract in most, if not all the instances in which such was used, was justified from the many agreements made between the architects and the contractors; the contractors and the superintendent of appellant employed by him outside the terms of the contract; by appellant himself, or waived by him when he saw it used without objection; or were properly \u25a0 excused by reason of the extreme difficulty, if not impossibility, of the contractors getting just such material as the contract called for.</p> <p id=\"b367-6\" pgmap=\"367\">The evidence tends strongly to show that whenever material different from that called for by the contract was used is was good material and made good work. For much of this the decree rendered shows that the court made reasonable reductions, and to such an extent that, when ever\u2019ffhing is considered, no hardship appears to have been imposed upon the appellant.</p> <p id=\"b367-7\" pgmap=\"367(10) 368(34)\">There was some delay in the completion of the building beyond the time named in the contract, for which the decree allows the appellant $1,500 as liquidated damages, under the provisions of the contract that $15 per day should be allowed as liquidated damages.</p> <p id=\"b368-4\" pgmap=\"368\">The appellant insists that the amount allowed is inadequate, but from all the facts and circumstances shown by the evidence, it does seem to us that it is reasonable and fair, because, whether we treat the $15 per-day as a penalty or as liquidated damages under the contract, the $1,500 \u2022allowed seems to us, in equity and good conscience, to be a just and fair amount for the contractors to pay.</p> <p id=\"b368-5\" pgmap=\"368\">The allowance of interest to the principal contractors for the time given in the decree was proper under our statute, which allows interest on money due upon a contract in 'writing; and as the contract (in writing) between the appellant and the principal contractors inures to the benefit of \"the sub-contractors, it was proper to allow them interest also.</p> <p id=\"b368-6\" pgmap=\"368\">Masters in chancery in this State, by Section 9, Chapte 90, entitled \u201c Master in Chancery,\u201d are entitled to \u201c receive for their services such compensation as shall be allowed by \"law, to be taxed as costs.\u201d (Starr &amp; Curtis\u2019 Ill. Statutes (1896), Vol. 2, p. 2694.)</p> <p id=\"b368-7\" pgmap=\"368\">And by Section 20 of Chapter 53, entitled \u201c Fees and Salaries,\u201d they are allowed \u201c for taking and reporting testimony, under order of court, the same fee as for taking \u25a0depositions \u201d (fixed at 15 cents per 100 words); \u201c for examining questions of law and fact in issue by the pleadings, and reporting conclusions, whenever specially ordered by the court, a sum not exceeding ten dollars ($10); and no other fee or allowance whatever (except those in this act specified) shall be made for services by masters in chancery.\u201d</p> <blockquote id=\"b368-8\" pgmap=\"368\">\u201c In counties of the third class, masters in chancery may receive for examining questions in issue referred to them, and reporting conclusions thereon, such compensation as the court may deem just, and for services not enumerated above in this section, and which have been and may be imposed by statute or special order, they may receive such fee as the court may allow.\u201d (Starr &amp; Curtis\u2019 Ill. Statutes (1896), p. 1915.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b369-3\" pgmap=\"369\">- From which it appears that it is only in counties of the third class that masters in chancery are entitled to more than ten dollars for reporting their conclusions Whenever specially ordered by the court, and no more.</p> <p id=\"b369-4\" pgmap=\"369\">Vermilion county not being a county of the third class, but only of the second class (Section 13, Chapter 53, Starr &amp; Curtis\u2019 Ill. Statutes (1896), p. 1903), the Circuit Court committed reversible error when it allowed the master in this case $300 as costs for stating the account, when the statute only permits him to be allowed $10 therefor. (See Lee, Adm\u2019r, etc., v. Rowley et al., 4 Ill. App. 218, and Harvey et al. v. Harvey, etc., 87 Ill. 54.)</p> <p id=\"b369-5\" pgmap=\"369\">For the error above indicated, we reverse that part of the decree allowing $300 to the master in chancery for stating the account, and reduce his allowance therefor to $10. In all other respects the decree is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"AArX\" pgmap=\"369\">Reversed in part and affirmed in part.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
