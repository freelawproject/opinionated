Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(a) &amp; (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). See <em>Community Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 553-557 (1976). The motions were allowed and judgments entered ordering the municipalities to pay the county all unpaid taxes, with interest at the statutory rate of eight percent. The judgments further ordered the municipalities to account for and pay over all profits over eight percent which they had earned after the due date on the funds owed but not paid to the county. Newton and Ayer claimed appeals from the latter order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The sole issue on appeal is whether the county can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>recover the interest earned by Newton and Ayer in excess of the statutory eight percent. A review of the principles governing county taxation and statutory interpretation reveals that it cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The counties of the Commonwealth are creatures of statute, \u201corganized by the General Court for the convenient administration of some parts of government.\u201d <em>County Commrs. of Bristol </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Dartmouth, </em>380 Mass. 706, 711 (1980), quoting from <em>County of Middlesex </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>278 Mass. 514, 516 (1932). Cf. <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>County Commrs. of Norfolk, </em>367 Mass. 345, 348-349 (1975). As such, the scope of their authority is a \u201cpurely legislative\u201d determination, <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>212 Mass. 127,129 (1912), and counties possess only the rights and powers which the Legislature has conferred upon them \u201caccording to [its] judgment of the requirement of the interests of the public.\u201d <em>County Commrs. of Bristol </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Dartmouth, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Chelsea, supra. </em>See <em>Agawam </em>v. <em>County of Hampden, </em>130 Mass. 528, 530 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The Legislature has expressly provided that a county may levy taxes on its several municipalities, G. L. c. 35, \u00a7\u00a7 30 &amp; 31, and that it may recover unpaid taxes by means of an action in contract. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 28. The statute authorizing such an action provides only that a county may recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u201cthe amount of the [unpaid] tax,\u201d id., and makes no provision for the recovery of interest. For the necessary legislative authority for recovery of interest on upaid taxes the county must look to G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 24. As noted above, however, that statute specifically fixes the rate of such interest at \u201ceight percent per annum.\u201d The simple and straightforward provisions of these statutes appear to leave the order under review without support.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Since the language of G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 24, is unambiguous on its face, there is no need to resort to the special rules established for the construction of tax statutes, see <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>361 Mass. 125, 130 (1972),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> except to observe that it is \u201c [conspicuously important\u201d to construe the language of a tax law according to its \u201ccommon and ordinary meaning.\u201d 3 Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 66.03, at 188 (4th ed. 1974). See <em>Sayles </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>286 Mass. 102, 104 (1934). Rather, the case calls for application of the basic rule that \u201c [a] general term of a statute may not be construed differently from its plain meaning, especially in the absence of any evidence of legislative . . . intent so to construe it.\u201d <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 782 (1980). See <em>Mile Road Corp. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>345 Mass. 379, 382-383 (1963). In addition, we think it appropriate here to follow the maxim that \u201ca statutory expression of one thing is an implied exclusion of other things omitted from the statute.\u201d <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 480, 484 (1980), quoting from <em>Harborview Residents\u2019 Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Quincy Housing Authy., </em>368 Mass. 425, 432 (1975). See 2A Sands, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47.24, at 127 (noting that maxim is based on premise that \u201cgenerally when people say one thing they do not mean something else\u201d). For an example of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>application of this rule in a similar situation, see <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>329 Mass. 661, 663-664 (1953) (statutory language which expressly provides only for payment of \u201clegal costs\u201d with judgment \u201cindicates an intention to . . . exclude[ ] by implication\u201d the payment of interest), quoting from <em>McArthur Bros. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>197 Mass. 137, 139 (1908). See also <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>373 Mass. 720, 726 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We are, of course, aware that the eight percent interest provided for unpaid county taxes is low as compared with the present market rates and that this fact might tempt a municipality to treat the county as a convenient banker who makes loans at lower than prevailing rates. It may even be, as the county suggests, that if the Legislature had anticipated the present market rates in 1975, it would not have reduced the interest recoverable by the county from the prior rate of twelve percent. Nevertheless, it is our duty to \u201cconstrue the statute as it is written,\u201d <em>Harry Alan Gregg, Jr. Family Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>330 Mass. 538, 544 (1953), and not to \u201cconjecture what the Legislature would have enacted if they had for-seen ... a case like this.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting from <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914). See <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 547 (1976). Rather, the case presents sensitive questions concerning the economic relationship between coordinate branches of government which are more properly considered \u201clegislative work beyond the power and function of the court.\u201d <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>272 Mass. 422, 431 (1930), quoting from <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>259 U.S. 44, 70 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In light of the principles discussed, many of which have special application to the analysis of tax statutes, we are satisfied that G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 24, authorizes the recovery of interest on unpaid county taxes only at the rate which it states, i.e., eight percent, and that the Legislature\u2019s specification of that rate precludes recovery at any greater rate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u201c[W]here the statute which creates the right and imposes the liability also prescribes the form of remedy, that form of remedy alone must be pursued.\u201d <em>Cosmopolitan Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>244 Mass. 128, 134 (1923). See <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Boston R.R. Holding Co., </em>315 Mass. 591, 612 (1944). As a result of our holding, we need not consider in detail the complex argument presented by the county that the municipalities were its agents for the collection of the tax, and that they violated a fiduciary duty imposed by the agency by the manner in which they handled the funds, thereby warranting the imposition of a constructive trust.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The orders in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the Superior Court permitting the arm of the county tax collector to reach the disputed funds were erroneous. Those portions of the judgments entered on February 25, 1981, and May 28, 1981, which require Newton or Ayer to pay the county the interest earned in excess of the statutory eight percent (i.e., the first paragraph of \u00a7 4 of the judgment in civil action No. 80-4182, and \u00a7\u00a7 1(b) and 3(b) of the judgment in civil action No. 81-565) are to be struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b561-5\"> General Laws c. 35, \u00a7 30, as amended through St. 1978, c. 211, provided in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he amount which the county commissioners .. . shall levy as the county tax shall be as authorized annually by the general court\u201d according to a formula set out therein.

The action in No. 81-712 was brought against all five municipalities for failing to make the payment due for the first half of fiscal 1981, and against Framingham and Newton for failing to pay a special additional assessment levied for fiscal 1980. The total unpaid taxes amounted to $2,765,629.97 for Newton, and $39,949.57 for Ayer. Following an amended judgment, Newton paid its outstanding taxes in full, with interest at the statutory rate of eight percent, and with interest on the judgment at the rate of ten percent under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, as appearing in St. 1980, c. 322, \u00a7 2. Newton has estimated that of the interest which it earned from investing the taxes not paid when due, the amount exceeding the statutory rate totaled $118,000. It does not appear from the record whether Ayer has paid the portion of the judgment not in dispute, or whether it has made an accounting of the interest which is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\"> Newton and Ayer are the only defendants remaining in the case. The actions against Chelmsford and Framingham were dismissed, and Acton has chosen not to pursue an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Additional factual details of these cases may be summarized as follows. The action in No. 81-481 was brought against Newton alone for failing to</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\"> In the <em>John Hancock </em>case, at 130, the court, quoting from <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Fopiano, </em>324 Mass. 304, 307 (1949), summarized the basic rules of construction as including the propositions \u201c (a) that tax statutes must be strictly construed, (b) that all doubts are to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer, and (c) that the right to tax must be plainly conferred, it cannot rest on implications.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\"> Our conclusion is supported by two additional factors. First, the Legislature has recently amended G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 24, to reduce the rate of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>terest recoverable by a county from twelve percent, as provided since St. 1876, c. 143, \u00a7 2, to the present eight percent. See St. 1975, c. 253. Particularly since the former rate had been maintained for nearly a hundred years, we think that the 1975 amendment manifests an affirmative legislative judgment that the rate should now be lower, which presents a substantial barrier to the county\u2019s argument, in effect, that the rate should be higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Second, the Legislature has created a similar procedure for the assessment and collection of taxes owed by municipalities to the Commonwealth. General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 20, as amended by St. 1977, c. 888, provides that if State taxes are not paid within the time specified the municipality shall be liable for \u201csuch further sum as would equal one percent per month during the delinquency from and after the time specified.\u201d The rate of the penalty authorized for unpaid State taxes is thus twelve percent per year. Since the Legislature could, of course, have authorized the same penalty rate for both State and county taxes, the fact that it did not requires the conclusion that its choice was deliberate. In addition, the various separate provisions for the collection of State, county, and municipal taxes, see G. L. c. 60, \u00a7\u00a7 23-61A, suggest that the Legislature\u2019s plan for providing revenue to each level of government is complete and exclusive, and therefore may not be supplemented by a common law remedy such as that urged by the county here..</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> We believe, however, that some brief comment on the argument is appropriate. Our law does not consider a municipality to be a mere conduit for the transmission of revenue from its taxpayers to the county. See <em>Brookline v. County Commrs. of Norfolk, </em>367 Mass. at 349 (\u201cThe county tax is assessed on the town itself\u201d and \u201c[i]f the tax is not paid promptly, it is the town which becomes liable to the county treasurer for the amount assessed plus interest [under] G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 24, [and] G. L. c. 59, <em>\u00a7 </em>28\u201d). Contrast <em>Millis </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>367 Mass. 831, 834 (1975). This fact undercuts at the threshold the agency premise on which the county relies for its fiduciary duty argument. There is also no basis here for finding the other requisites to the imposition of a constructive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>trust. See <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Covich, </em>332 Mass. 338, 342 (1955); <em>Meskell </em>v. <em>Meskell, </em>355 Mass. 148, 151 (1969); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>358 Mass. 154, 156 (1970); <em>Superior Glass Co. </em>v. <em>First Bristol County Natl. Bank, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 356, 360-361 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>380 Mass. 829 (1980); <em>John Alden Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 920 (1981). See also Restatement of Restitution \u00a7 160 (1936); 5 Scott, Law of Trusts \u00a7 462 (3d ed. 1967). It does not appear that the municipal taxes included a discrete assessment for county taxes which could constitute the necessary res of a constructive trust. See Restatement of Restitution, <em>supra, </em>Comment i. There is also no showing that the municipalities sought to defraud the county of its tax funds or that they were subject to a trust specially imposed by statute. See, e.g., G. L. c. 62B, \u00a7 5. Moreover, if the county\u2019s theory of liability were accepted, it would constitute precedent for the recovery of interest exceeding the rate specified by statute in other areas. Such a holding might well precipitate actions by municipalities to mulct their taxpayers of investment profits in excess of the fourteen percent interest provided for unpaid local property taxes, G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 57, and actions by the Commonwealth for interest in excess of the twelve percent provided for unpaid State income taxes, G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 32. There might also be actions brought by prevailing plaintiffs for interest exceeding the ten percent provided for unpaid judgments. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B. It is obvious that such recoveries would be \u201cdisruptive of the Legislature\u2019s efforts in thefse] area[s].\u201d <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Charlestown Sav. Bank, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 178, 185 (1979). See <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Suffolk Franklin Sav. Bank, </em>370 Mass. 314, 326-327 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
