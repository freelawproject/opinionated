L. c. 119, \u00a7 27,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permits a de nova appeal to a juvenile appeals session of a District Court in two situations: (1) where a minor is adjudicated to be in need of care and protection or (2) where there is an adjudication under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, and an order of commitment, either temporary or permanent. A second type of review is also provided by G. L.c. 119, \u00a7 26, which allows, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>where there has been an adjudication or commitment, a parent or other interested party to petition the adjudicating court once every six months for a review and redetermination of the current needs of the child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This action raises the question whether there is a right to a de nova appeal to a juvenile appeals session from an adverse decision rendered on a petition for review and redetermination of the current needs of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We recount the background. In July, 1979, the minor was adjudged to be in need of care and protection and was committed to what is now the Department of Social Services (department). After the statutory waiting period the parents petitioned the adjudicating court for a review and redetermination of the minor\u2019s current needs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a hearing, a judge made findings and ordered that the original adjudication and commitment order remain in effect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parents appealed the decision to a juvenile appeals session, and the department filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. The motion was allowed on the ground that G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a726 and 27, do not provide a right of de nova appeal from an adverse finding on a petition for review and redetermination. The parents have appealed that decision, asserting that a redetermination under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, is an adjudication and that, therefore, under the provisions of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 27, a de nova appeal is permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Both parties agree that there is a right of appeal from a decision on a petition for review and redetermination. The department asserts that the appeal is directly to the Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Court and is limited to matters of law and whether the judge\u2019s findings were warranted by the evidence. However, the department\u2019s position is weakened by its inability to point to any statute that gives the Appeals Court jurisdiction to hear such appeals. By G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10, jurisdiction is given to the Appeals Court to review determinations made in the Superior Court, the Land Court, the Probate Court and the District Court jury sessions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no language in the statute that gives the Appeals Court jurisdiction to hear appeals from first instance District Court or juvenile sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The parents contend that a de nova appeal is authorized to the juvenile appeals session under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 27, because a \u201credetermination\u201d under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, is an \u201cadjudication\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 27. Under the principles of statutory interpretation \u201ca statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). \u201cAdjudication\u201d and \u201cdetermination\u201d are similar words.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Supreme Judicial Court has used the words interchangeably. See <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. 876, 877, 883, 884, 886 (1979), and <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 2), </em>378 Mass. 712, 713 (1979), where the court, in discussing G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a724 and 26, used the word \u201cdetermination\u201d where the statute used the word \u201cadjudge.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The prefix \u201cre-\u201d used in the word \u201credetermination\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, means \u201cagain: anew.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 1888 (1971). Since the only prior determination under the statute is the adjudication itself, the Legislature was using the word \u201credetermination\u201d in place of \u201creadjudication.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, a decision on a petition for review and redetermination is an adjudication and a de nova appeal lies under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 27. Our holding is in line with the policies and purposes of G. L. c. 119, as set out in \u00a7 1, and with judicial opinions which state that decisions in care and protection cases, because they involve the separation of parent and child, place \u201ca sufficient burden on family integrity to make the determination deserving of added judicial attention.\u201d <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. at 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The order allowing the motion to dismiss is reversed and the case is remanded to the juvenile appeals session for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-13\"> General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 27, as appearing in St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 51, provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe child, parent, guardian or person appearing in behalf of such child, or the department, may appeal from the adjudication . . . and also may appeal at the time of the order of commitment, in which events the entire case shall be before the court as if originally commenced therein . . . .\u201d The amendment to \u00a7 27 effected by St. 1981, c. 715, \u00a7 1, is not material to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\"> General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 26, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1076, \u00a7 3, provides in pertinent part: \u201cOn any petition filed in any court pursuant to this section, the department, parents, person having legal custody of, or counsel for a child may petition the court not more than once every six months for a review and redetermination of the current needs of such child whose case has come before the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\"> The parents filed for a de nova appeal from the original adjudication and commitment (G.

L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 391 and 56, provide that a District Court jury session shall be designated as the juvenile appeals session.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b90-7\"> We note that one of the definitions for \u201cadjudication\u201d set forth in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 39 (5th ed. 1979) is \u201c[t]he equivalent of a \u2018determination\u2019.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b90-8\"> The department suggests that the use of the article \u201cthe\u201d prior to the word \u201cadjudication\u201d in the first sentence of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 27, refers only to the original adjudication and, therefore, a de nova appeal does not lie from a decision on a petition for review and redetermination. The word \u201cadjudication,\u201d however, is used again in the last sentence of \u00a7 27 without the use of the article \u201cthe\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> On a de nova appeal, however, the appeal is only as to the petition for review and redetermination and not as to the original adjudication and therefore is limited to new or changed circumstances arising after the original adjudication.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
