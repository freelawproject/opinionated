(Junior Sales), sought damages from, and injunctive relief against, the defendants for alleged wrongful appropriation of a corporate opportunity of Junior Sales. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff. The defendants have appealed. The evidence is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">A family partnership manufactured and sold greeting cards, most recently in Springfield. In 1953, it was incorporated under the name of Sunshine Art Studios, Inc. (Sunshine). Of the shares, Willard S. Robbins held fifty percent, his wife, Grace B. Robbins, ten percent, and their son, Ry-land E. Robbins, forty percent. The real estate used by the corporation was held by a related corporation, Sunshine Realty Corp. Various other corporations, not directly involved in this case, were formed from time to time to conduct particular aspects of the Robbins family greeting card enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">The plaintiff (O\u2019Hara) was a friend and college classmate of Ryland Robbins and had been office manager of Sunshine and its partnership predecessor. He was in charge of promotional work for Sunshine and of developing and testing ideas for the sale of greeting cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">In 1954, he suggested and carried out a novel method of promoting greeting card sales through prize and money incentives to young people to sell boxed assortments of Sunshine cards. This was initiated under the name of Junior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Sales Club of America, an \u201coral partnership\u201d in which O\u2019Hara was declared to be a twenty percent partner. This business (Junior Sales) was incorporated in 1955, after a satisfactory experimental period. O\u2019Hara, \u201cseveral months after the incorporation,\u201d received a certificate for twenty shares. The other shares were owned, forty by Willard Robbins and forty by Ryland Robbins. O\u2019Hara never invested directly any money in any of the Robbins greeting card enterprises and, until the incorporation of Junior Sales, was a full-time paid employee of Sunshine which financed the testing of his idea. Ryland Robbins testified that, prior to the incorporation of Junior Sales, O\u2019Hara was told that he would be given twenty percent of the shares of the new corporation. This was something for which O\u2019Hara never asked or negotiated and, according to Ryland Robbins, was given because of \u201clong friendship\u201d and O\u2019Hara\u2019s \u201cwork on the program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">After the incorporation of Junior Sales, O\u2019Hara became its president and worked for and was paid by both Sunshine and Junior Sales until 1957. Then his duties became concerned almost entirely with Junior Sales. His salary was paid thereafter by Junior Sales in an amount originally intended, at least in a general way, to reflect about twenty percent of the profits of Junior Sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In 1956, O\u2019Hara suggested, and developed in large measure, a program conducted under the name \u201cSales Leadership Club\u201d to promote the sale of imprinted Christmas cards and other greeting cards. This involved some variation of the same marketing plan used by Junior Sales and had greater advantages both for the young distributors and for the sponsors of the program. It used in part the same customers lists and also some rented lists. An initial test period by a partnership was undertaken before this operation also was incorporated in 1958 as Sales Leadership Club, Inc. (Sales Leadership). The partnership filed a partnership tax return for the test period showing as equal partners only Willard and Ryland Robbins. O\u2019Hara received no income from that partnership. Ryland Robbins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>could not recall whether O\u2019Hara was told in advance that Sales Leadership Club was to be incorporated. In any event, O\u2019Hara became an incorporator of Sales Leadership and was shown on certificates of condition as having subscribed to one share of its stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">O\u2019Hara became president of Sales Leadership when it was formed with the same officers, directors, incorporators, and corporate purposes as Junior Sales. It used many of the same methods of marketing and the two corporations were competing in the same market. O\u2019Hara never paid even for the one share of Sales Leadership for which he subscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">O\u2019Hara testified that he regarded Sales Leadership as an \u201coutgrowth\u201d of Junior Sales. He, however, never claimed in writing prior to 1966 that he was entitled to any shares or a share of Sales Leadership. In 1966, he requested one-third of its stock on the basis of the articles of organization. The request was refused. O\u2019Hara conceded that neither Willard nor Ryland Robbins ever had told him that he would receive such shares. Ryland Robbins\u2019s testimony was that O\u2019Hara was first told in 1959 he had no stock interest in Sales Leadership. O\u2019Hara alleged in his bill and testified that he was told in January, 1962, that \u201che had no stock ownership in Sales Leadership.\u201d He claimed, however, that he \u201cwas not told that . . . [he] wouldn\u2019t receive any stock\u201d and at that time \u201cbelieved . . . [he] should be issued some stock.\u201d Between 1962 and 1966, O\u2019Hara did nothing to assert his ownership claim, except possibly to ask about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">From 1958 to 1964, O\u2019Hara was paid what the management had agreed to pay him for those years. During part of those years there was discussion about O\u2019Hara\u2019s salary, and testimony indicated that, at least in 1961 and 1962, he was given a percentage (over a base volume) of the profits of Sales Leadership. There was testimony also that at one time O\u2019Hara had overdrawn his share of Junior Sales profits. In 1962, O\u2019Hara and Ryland Robbins had a discussion in which O\u2019Hara was told that the payments to him based upon a percentage of sales were to be discontinued. O\u2019Hara testified that he then resigned from the corporations but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>that, upon reconsideration, a compromise was effected. His prior salary was reestablished and his paid vacation time was increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">There was substantial evidence that payments were made from Junior Sales accounts which more appropriately might have been paid by Sales Leadership. For example, Willard and Hyland Robbins received a salary from Junior Sales every year but in only two years received salaries from Sales Leadership. Junior Sales funds were used, at least to some extent, to pay expenses and salaries for Sales Leadership.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">O\u2019Hara, as time went on, assumed other responsibilities in the Robbins family enterprises. By 1965, Ryland Robbins had moved to Arizona, and O\u2019Hara was appointed by Willard Robbins to be general manager of Sunshine. He thus became, in effect, for a time \u201cboss of the whole Sunshine . . . operation.\u201d Because Willard Robbins failed to support him in a dispute with the manager of Sunshine\u2019s East Longmeadow manufacturing plant, O\u2019Hara left (or was discharged from) his positions with the Robbins companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The evidence would have permitted finding the facts stated above. Further facts are stated below in discussing the several issues which the parties have argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">1. On the evidence, the trial judge concluded in effect that the Sales Leadership operation was a corporate opportunity which could and should have been exploited by Junior Sales. He stated that it was the duty of the individual defendants as officers and directors of Junior Sales \u201cto promote the business of Junior Sales and not to divert that business to another corporation.\u201d With the pattern (already mentioned) of a separate corporation for carrying out each aspect of the Robbins family greeting card business, the corporate opportunity perhaps reasonably might have been viewed by the judge as that of Sunshine. On the somewhat conflicting and largely oral evidence, however, we cannot say that the judge\u2019s conclusion was clearly erroneous. The Massachusetts cases on the diversion of a corporate opportunity have been collected very recently in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>BBF, Inc. </em>v. <em>Germanium Power Devices Corp., ante </em>166, 172 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">2. The judge concluded that O\u2019Hara\u2019s claim was not barred by the then prevailing torts two-year statute of limitations. See G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A, as in effect prior to St. 1973, c. 777, \u00a7 1. He found that O\u2019Hara was not told until early 1966 (when O\u2019Hara and Willard Robbins corresponded about a possible purchase of O\u2019Hara\u2019s shares in Junior Sales) that \u201che would receive no stock ownership in Sales Leadership or any interest in Sales Leadership by virtue of his stock ownership in Junior Sales.\u201d The judge had found earlier that, in discussions in 1962, O\u2019Hara had been \u201ctold that he had no stock in Sales Leadership.\u201d The judge decided, however, that because of the \u201cclose personal relationship between O\u2019Hara\u201d and the Robbinses, father and son, O\u2019Hara had every reason to believe that he would be treated fairly as an \u201cemployee and as a minority stockholder in Junior Sales.\u201d O\u2019Hara, of course, \u201cknew that Sales Leadership had been incorporated to carry on . . . business in . . . competition with Junior Sales, [but] he had no reason to complain\u201d which would \u201crequire him to . . . take legal action.\u201d He had received until 1962 compensation based in part upon Sales Leadership\u2019s sales and no shares in Sales Leadership were issued to any shareholder until 1966. Thus the correspondence in 1966, after he had left the Robbins companies, constituted the earliest repudiation of his claim which required \u201chim as an officer and director of Junior Sales to complain about the diversion of its profits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Upon the somewhat confused and conflicting testimony, the trial judge was justified in determining that the statements to O\u2019Hara in 1959 and 1962 that he had no stock in Sales Leadership did not amount to a clear repudiation by either Robbins of their fiduciary duty at least to insure that profits were allocated fairly between Junior Sales and Sales Leadership. This could be determined to be the situation even if the Robbinses were unwilling in 1959 and 1962 to recognize O\u2019Hara\u2019s claim to twenty percent of Sales Leadership\u2019s shares. This litigation was commenced within two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>years after the date on which (as the judge thus reasonably found) one of the quasi trustees for the first time had repudiated at least some aspects of their fiduciary duty in the 1966 correspondence. Thus the bill is not barred by the statute of limitations or loches. See <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>318 Mass. 669, 676 (1945), and cases cited; <em>Kearney </em>v. <em>Mechanics Natl. Bank, </em>343 Mass. 699, 702-703 (1962); <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>365 Mass. 83, 88-91 (1974); <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>381 Mass. 611, 613-620 (1980), and cases cited. See also <em>Samia </em>v. <em>Central Oil Co., </em>339 Mass. 101, 112-113 (1959). Compare <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, </em>394 F.2d 416, 419-420 (1st Cir. 1968); Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 219 (1959); 3 Scott, Trusts \u00a7 219.2, at 1761 (3d ed. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">3. We are urged by the defendants to afford to the trial judge\u2019s findings less weight and credence because they, to a considerable extent, were precisely in the form of findings proposed by O\u2019Hara\u2019s counsel. See <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>381 Mass. 234, 235-238 (1980). The docket and transcript indicate that trial began on July 5, 1978, and ended on July 11, 1978. At the conclusion of arguments, the trial judge requested counsel to confer in chambers with him about \u201cthe possible submission of some memoranda.\u201d There is in the record no transcript of this conference. The defendants\u2019 counsel by affidavit (reproduced in the record) asserts that he received from O\u2019Hara\u2019s attorney a copy of proposed findings, rulings, and an order for judgment on August 5, 1978, with a copy of a letter to the clerk\u2019s office from the attorney referring to \u201cthe brief . . . which [the trial judge] ... instructed\u201d him \u201cto mail to you.\u201d We thus assume that counsel decided to submit as his trial brief the findings which he proposed that the judge make. Whether the defendants similarly submitted proposed findings as their brief is not shown in the record. It is not argued that the defendants were not given the opportunity to do so and their attorney\u2019s affidavit shows that they certainly knew by early August, 1978, what O\u2019Hara\u2019s counsel had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The judge did not issue his findings, rulings, and order for judgment until August 18, 1980, more than two years after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the close of the trial. It thus was unlike either <em>United States </em>v. <em>El Paso Gas Co., </em>376 U.S. 651, 656-657 (1964), or the <em>Cormier </em>case, 381 Mass. at 235 nn.1 and 2, and 237 n.5, where it appears that the probate judge, whose action was reviewed in that case, had not requested from prevailing counsel (with a copy of the request sent to adversary counsel) suggestions for findings until after she had reached her decision. The trial judge in 1980 in the present case made only minor changes, largely in the omission of case citations, in the findings proposed in 1978 by O\u2019Hara\u2019s counsel. In the light of the <em>Cormier </em>decision (because there is not any clear indication in the record of the extent to which the findings are the product of the trial judge\u2019s independent judgment), careful scrutiny of the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions has been given, although this may have been unnecessary in view of n.5 in the <em>Cormier </em>case, <em>supra </em>at 237. We are satisfied that, upon the evidence, and on not unduly complicated issues, his findings were permissible. They certainly do not leave us \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that a[ny] mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Marlow </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>369 Mass. 501, 508 (1976), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948). See also <em>Markell </em>v. <em>Sidney B. Pfeifer Foundation, Inc., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 412, 414-418, 431-432 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">4. The defendants contend that the trial judge improperly permitted copies of Sales Leadership\u2019s tax returns to be admitted as exhibits \u201cfor the purposes of showing any transactions between . . . [Sales Leadership] and . . . Junior Sales . . . and . . . Sunshine . . . [and] any other relevant association or interest.\u201d In <em>Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>377 Mass. 576, 586-588 (1979), it was decided (with full examination of the pertinent authorities) that corporate Federal tax returns have only \u201ca qualified right to confidentiality.\u201d We cannot say the trial judge erred in his appraisal of the conflicting policies<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of tax returns by admitting the returns in evidence, in view of O\u2019Hara\u2019s need to show in simple form the general business and fiscal relationships among the corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">5. The trial judge accepted the proposal of O\u2019Hara\u2019s counsel that the defendants be allowed to select one of three alternative forms of relief viz., (1) that Sales Leadership transfer all its assets to Junior Sales, or (2) that all the shares of Sales Leadership be transferred to Junior Sales, or (3) that twenty shares of Sales Leadership be transferred to O\u2019Hara. The parties, after the trial judge made his order for judgment, stipulated that the defendants (without waiving their rights of appeal) would accept the third alternative but would reduce to ten the number of shares of Sales Leadership to be transferred to O\u2019Hara. This was done because, prior to the judge\u2019s order, half the shares of Sales Leadership had been redeemed. Judgment was entered in accordance with the stipulation for the transfer to O\u2019Hara of ten shares of Sales Leadership. This had the result of transferring to O\u2019Hara a twenty percent minority interest in assets having a 1976 book value of about $2,115,000, or an interest worth somewhat over $420,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">6. Before the trial judge, O\u2019Hara\u2019s attorney stated by affidavit and testimony (based upon such time records as he had kept) that he had expended about 183 Vs: hours on the case. On the basis of the contingent fee arrangement which the attorney had made with O\u2019Hara, that would have entitled the attorney to a fee of about $62,215, which is what the trial judge allowed as the fee to be paid by Junior Sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Where attorneys\u2019 fees are to be paid out of a fund or on a basis other than the usual rule that each litigant must bear his own expenses (see <em>Creed </em>v. <em>Apog, </em>377 Mass. 522, 525 [1979]), the traditional Massachusetts principle was stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>in <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>326 Mass. 587, 595-596 (1950), \u201cWhere payments are to be made out of the property of litigants to or for the benefit of counsel who may not have been employed by those whose estates are thus diminished, the standard is not the same as that applied in an action by an attorney against a client with whom he has voluntary contractual relations .... Fees in . . . [cases of the former type] are awarded on \u2018strictly conservative principles.\u2019\u201d See <em>Holyoke Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>350 Mass. 223, 230 (1966). The <em>Hayden </em>case (at 596) refers to a possible test of \u201cthe compensation paid to public officers for services of a similar character,\u201d perhaps by itself too parsimonious a standard for application in an inflationary period. See discussion in <em>First Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Brink, </em>372 Mass. 257, 265-266 (1977). See also <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388-389 (1979). Compare, however, <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Madden, </em>363 Mass. 884 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The Federal courts have held that contingent fee agreements should not be considered in fixing attorneys\u2019 fees in cases much like that before us. See <em>Hew Corp. </em>v. <em>Tandy Corp., </em>480 F. Supp. 758, 761-763 (D. Mass. 1979), where the authorities were reviewed carefully and the appropriate criteria were stated in detail. There is further discussion of relevant considerations in <em>Farmington Dowel Prod. Co. </em>v. <em>Forster Mfg. Co., </em>421 F.2d 61, 86-92 (1st Cir.),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeal of decision on remand, 436 F.2d 699 (1st Cir. 1970). Compare <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Southworth, </em>564 F.2d 609, 612-614 (1st Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">We recognize that O\u2019Hara\u2019s counsel is a lawyer of skill, experience, and standing in his community who has achieved for his client a highly satisfactory result. Taking into account, however, all aspects of this case of which we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>aware, we are left with the conviction that the fee allowed as to be paid by Junior Sales is somewhat excessive, perhaps because the trial judge gave, despite the decisions already cited, essentially conclusive weight to the contingent fee arrangement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> between O\u2019Hara and his attorney and insufficient weight to other factors, such as time reasonably expended and absence of great complexity of the facts, which were deserving of consideration under the pertinent case. Accordingly, we remand the case to the Superior Court for reconsideration and a new exercise by the trial judge of his discretion to fix the amount to be paid to O\u2019Hara\u2019s attorney by Junior Sales,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> this to be done in accordance with the criteria referred to in this opinion and in the decisions herein cited. In other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\"> See discussion of the policies concerning the use in evidence of copies of Federal income tax returns in <em>Heathman </em>v. <em>United States Dist.
