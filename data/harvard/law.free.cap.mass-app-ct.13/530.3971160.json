The dismissals were not on constitutional speedy trial grounds, involved no violation of statute or rule of court, and were ordered on the express understanding of the judge and all counsel that the Commonwealth would not be prevented from seeking indictments against the defendant for the same offenses. We hold that the Superior Court judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>was not required to dismiss the subsequent indictments, and we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The defendant was charged with receiving stolen goods (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 60) in January and February of 1980. Two complaints were issued by the Clinton District Court on December 26, 1980, and one was issued on January 13, 1981. On the same day, January 13, 1981, the defendant pleaded not guilty. The cases were set for conference on February 27, 1981, and there were continuances to April 7, May 15, and May 26, 1981. The record is silent as to who sought the continuances, but the defendant makes no claim that the continuances were made over his objection or that there was any violation of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 35 (continuance over the objection of the defendant not to exceed ten days). A transcript of the tape of the May 26 hearing in the District Court discloses that when the defendant\u2019s cases were called, together with those of two codefendants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the assistant district attorney sought a continuance to keep the cases against the three codefendants together, as counsel for one of the codefendants was not present in court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Counsel for the codefendant Loureiro, when asked by the judge to respond to the Commonwealth\u2019s request for a continuance, moved to dismiss \u201cfor lack of a speedy trial\u201d as well as for failure of the Commonwealth to comply with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>discovery order. In turn, counsel for the defendant stated: \u201cYour Honor, this, these cases have been around since we had a pretrial conference on February 24, and we heard that it\u2019s going to go to the Grand Jury, it going to go to the Grand Jury it never has. I\u2019d move to dismiss for lack of speedy trial. <em>If they want to indict him and go to the Grand Jury, go ahead and do that\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">After a short dialogue with the assistant district attorney, the judge showed annoyance that she did not appear ready for trial because neither the defendant nor Loureiro was present in court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge asked about discovery matters and then ordered, \u201cThese are dismissed without prejudice to your rights to indictment.\u201d The codefendant\u2019s counsel said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s counsel made no objection to the dismissals without prejudice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">On June 9, 1981, within two weeks after the dismissal of the complaints, the defendant was indicted for the same offenses. He moved to dismiss in the Superior Court, urging that, despite the dismissal \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d subsequent prosecution was barred. The judge denied the motion, and the defendant was tried and convicted by a jury on August 4, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The issue before us is whether the District Court judge exceeded his authority in dismissing the complaints <em>without prejudice </em>where the dismissal purported to be on speedy trial grounds. Our discussion requires analysis of four recent cases: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>370 Mass. 31 (1976), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>371 Mass. 274 (1976), <em>Commonwealth v. Balliro, </em>385 Mass. 618 (1982), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 784 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Ludwig, </em>a continuance from November, 1973, to the following February was granted over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the defendant\u2019s objection in violation of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 35. In February, the defendant moved that the complaints be dismissed with prejudice on two grounds: double jeopardy and denial of a speedy trial. The motion was allowed by a District Court judge. After concluding that there was no double jeopardy, the Supreme Judicial Court held that \u201cgiven the violation of the statutory prohibition^] ... a decision to dismiss on speedy trial grounds could have been warranted in the circumstances of this case.\u201d 370 Mass. at 33-34. The court concluded that the judge\u2019s dismissal of the complaints <em>with prejudice </em>\u201cimplied the findings of fact necessary to support his action on speedy trial grounds and that such findings were permissible based on the evidence. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Ludwig, </em>the reference was to constitutional speedy trial grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 34 &amp; n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Constitutional speedy trial grounds were also involved in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 784, 788-789 (1980), another case where continuances had been permitted in violation of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 35. This court, \u201c[o]n the findings made in the Superior Court, accompanied by the record before that court,\u201d concluded \u201cthat the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, despite the lack of specification, implied the findings of fact necessary to support dismissal on constitutional speedy trial grounds.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>at 789. This was so even though the dismissal did not contain the words \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 790 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The dismissals in <em>Ludwig </em>and <em>Silva </em>were required to be with prejudice. Where the determination has been on constitutional speedy trial grounds, dismissal with prejudice is \u201cthe only possible remedy.\u201d <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 522 (1972). <em>Strunk </em>v. <em>United States, </em>412 U.S. 434, 440 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>371 Mass. 274 (1976), a statutory and not a constitutional violation was involved. A District Court judge had dismissed two complaints pursuant to G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 72A (repealed 1979), which required trial or other disposition of charges against a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment within six months of his application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>to court for trial. No action had been taken on the complaints during the more than eight months that had elapsed after Fields\u2019 application under the statute. The Supreme Judicial Court determined that the judge\u2019s \u201caction implied the findings of fact necessary to establish a violation of the statute.\u201d <em>Fields, </em>at 282. Citing <em>Ludwig </em>and ABA Standards, Speedy Trial \u00a7 4.1 (1974), the court concluded that precluding subsequent prosecution was \u201cappropriate\u201d where G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 72A, had been violated. <em>Fields, </em>at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balliro, </em>385 Mass. 618 (1982), the most recent case involving speedy trial questions, there was neither a constitutional nor a statutory violation; nor was a mandatory dismissal required under Rule 36(c) of the Mass.R.Crim. P., 378 Mass. 912 (1979), set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It was conceded, however, that the Commonwealth through negligent inattention had caused delay in trying the defendant. Although the Commonwealth had known for several weeks that no charge based on the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol could be proved, it waited until the day of trial to correct the error. It first sought to amend the complaints, and, when that attempt failed,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it entered a nolle prosequi of the charges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The arresting officer then filed an application for new complaints, and the defendant moved to dismiss the application, citing various grounds, including the right to a speedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>trial. A District Court judge, without opinion, allowed the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court pointed out that the Commonwealth was concededly \u201cunreasonably lacking in diligence in bringing the defendant to trial,\u201d see rule 36(c)(1), <em>supra, </em>and that the appellate court could infer \u201cthat the District Court judge relied on the assumed anxiety and concern of the defendant resulting from the delay.\u201d <em>Balliro, </em>at 623.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In these circumstances, rule 36(c), which is concerned with mandatory dismissal of charges, does not deny \u201ca judge the inherent right in his discretion to determine that an application for complaints should be dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court continued, \u201cWhile we do not say that we would have allowed the motion to dismiss ... we do say that it was not an abuse of the District Court judge\u2019s discretion to act as he did, <em>once he concluded that the defendant had been denied a speedy </em>trial\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>The application having been dismissed on that ground, the Superior Court judge was correct in dismissing the subsequent indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In summary, in each of the cases discussed, the Supreme Judicial Court or this court was able to conclude that the judge had impliedly found the facts necessary to establish a constitutional <em>(Ludwig </em>and <em>Silva) </em>or a statutory <em>(Fields) </em>speedy trial violation or facts which permitted a determination <em>(Balliro) </em>that the defendant has been denied a speedy trial within the double pronged guidelines of rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Here, neither the record nor the action of the District Court judge permits the inferring of any such findings. There was clearly no constitutional or statutory violation. Despite the judge\u2019s annoyance at the prosecutor, and despite defense counsel\u2019s use of the term \u201cspeedy trial\u201d in his motion, there is no evidence or indication in the record that the prosecution was lacking in diligence, let alone unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ably lacking in diligence, in bringing the defendant to trial. We do not know who sought, or the reasons for, the previous continuances. Although the defendant was not in court on May 26, 1981, the assistant district attorney said she had her witnesses in court, and there is nothing to suggest that there would have been any difficulty in bringing the defendant promptly into court from the house of correction. Had there been any hint that the complaints would be dismissed with prejudice, it can be inferred from the transcript that she would immediately have gone to trial. There is likewise no evidence or suggestion in the record that the judge found that the defendant was prejudiced by any lack of diligence on the part of the assistant district attorney. To the contrary, the judge\u2019s action in dismissing <em>without prejudice </em>indicates that he did not find that the delay had been unfair to the defendant by impairing his ability to mount a defense or otherwise. In view of the statement of the defendant\u2019s then counsel, \u201cIf they want to indict him and go to the Grand Jury, go ahead and do that,\u201d and in view of the lack of objection by the defendant to the form of dismissal, a finding of prejudice cannot be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Accordingly, where, as here, the necessary findings that the defendant was deprived of a speedy trial cannot be inferred, we conclude that the dismissal was not for true \u201cspeedy trial grounds\u201d as in the cases cited, and that the judge did not exceed his discretion in dismissing the complaints without prejudice. He had not determined, within the meaning of 2 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Standard 12-4.1 (2d ed. 1980), that the defendant had not been \u201cbrought to trial before the running of the time for trial,\u201d so as to bar a subsequent prosecution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Because of the confusion engendered by the use of the phrase \u201cspeedy trial grounds,\u201d we suggest that the term be limited to those cases where a judge determines that the defendant was denied a speedy trial under Rule 36(b) of Mass.R.Crim.P., 378 Mass. 909 (1979), or under the two pronged standard of rule 36(c), or where the judge finds some other constitutional or statutory ground which permits or requires him to dismiss with prejudice. Where a judge finds the prosecutor\u2019s delinquency less grievous, and not every dilatory action of a prosecutor requires imposition of the most severe sanction; the Commonwealth can avoid difficulty by requesting that the judge indicate that he is not making a determination that the defendant\u2019s rights to a speedy trial have been violated. When such rights have not been violated, the judge, acting under his inherent power to take corrective measures, may impose such sanction as he deems appropriate, including dismissal of a complaint without prejudice to the procuring of a subsequent indictment.
