Section 2-201 of the Code of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>City of New Bedford (code) prior to the 1979 ordinance<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provided that such appointment was to be made by the mayor subject to confirmation by the city council. The ordinance became effective January 1, 1980, and the defendant Maryanne Moses was appointed clerk of committees by the city council during the week of January 7, 1980. Prior to that time, the mayor, as alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, had appointed another person \u201con the premise that the ordinance in question is not valid and that the office had to be validly filled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In this action the plaintiffs seek to preclude the defendant Moses from acting as clerk of committees and also seek a declaration that the 1979 ordinance is invalid. Their primary claim is that the ordinance contravenes G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 60, which provides that in a Plan B city such as New Bed-ford (see G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 1-45, \u00a7\u00a7 56-63), the mayor is to appoint all heads of departments, subject to confirmation by the city council. After a jury-waived trial, the trial judge held that the clerk of committees is not a head of a department within the meaning of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 60, and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to relief. We agree with the judge\u2019s determination. A judgment entered dismissing the complaint with prejudice. Since this action sought declaratory relief, a judgment declaring the rights of the parties is to be entered. See point 5, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">1. <em>The clerk of committees is not a department head. </em>The principal duties of the office of the clerk of committees are set forth in \u00a7 2-202 of the code, a section unchanged by the 1979 ordinance. According to undisputed testimony, the duties set forth in \u00a7 2-202 constituted ninety percent of the activities of the office of the clerk of committees. The enumerated responsibilities contained in that section are: to \u201cserve notices of all regular and special meetings of the city council\u201d; to serve as \u201cclerk of all committees ... of the city council\u201d; to \u201cmake proper records ... of all proceedings and transactions of said committees\u201d; to have the \u201ccustody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>of all books and papers\u201d of said committees; and to \u201ccause notice of meetings to be served upon members of all committees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The remaining duties of the clerk of committees prior to the 1979 ordinance were to maintain a central mailing office for all outgoing mail from municipal departments which had offices in the municipal building (\u00a7 2-203); to be responsible for the printing of the mayor\u2019s inaugural address (\u00a7 2-204); to receive copies of department reports (\u00a7 2-205); and to prepare and distribute specified city documents (\u00a7 2-206).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The 1979 ordinance amended \u00a7\u00a7 2-203, 2-205 and 2-206 to provide that the mailing and other duties to be performed by the clerk of committees under those sections prior to the code\u2019s amendment were to be the responsibility of the mayor\u2019s office.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The duties of the clerk as set forth in \u00a7 2-202, and the elimination by the 1979 ordinance of all other duties which could be deemed to pertain to the executive or administrative functions of city government left the position of clerk of committees as one established exclusively to assist the conduct of the legislative branch of the city government. This case is, therefore, quite different from those which involve \u201cemployees or officers in ordinary city departments\u201d or those who perform \u201cthe usual municipal functions.\u201d <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Mayor of Medford, </em>241 Mass. 336, 338 (1922). The fact that officials of New Bedford treated the office of the clerk of committees as a department for fiscal or other purposes is not of significance. What is important is that we are concerned with a \u201cspecial officer\u201d of the city council, the \u201clegislative department of the government of the city. It is correlative to the executive department of which the mayor is the head.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Other cases have also contrasted administrative or executive departments with the two branches of city government. In <em>King </em>v. <em>Mayor of Quincy, </em>270 Mass. 185, 187 (1930), the Supreme Judicial Court construed the term \u201cheads of departments\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 52, the section applicable to Plan A cities comparable to G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 60. It held that the word \u201cdepartment\u201d as used in G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 52, \u201cis not restricted to the two basic departments of a municipality \u2014 the legislative and the executive. On the contrary it applies to the \u2018executive and administrative departments,\u2019 among which executive and administrative functions are distributed.\u201d See also <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Inspector of Buildings of Quincy, </em>323 Mass. 552, 558 (1949). More recently, the Supreme Judicial Court has held invalid an ordinance attempting to limit the powers of the mayor of Boston to appoint his staff and fix the compensation of his employees, saying: \u201cThe mayor\u2019s office is not a \u2018department or agency\u2019 subject to reorganization by the city council; it is a separate branch of city government.\u201d <em>City Council of Boston </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 716, 722-723 (1981). The city council is equally a separate branch of city government. Accordingly, we hold that its officers and employees are not a department for the purposes of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">2. <em>Power of city council to make </em>appointments. The legislative powers of the city of New Bedford are vested in the city council (G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 59). In some charters there is a specific grant to the legislative department of the city to \u201cappoint such assistant clerks and other officers as may be necessary for the proper conduct of its business.\u201d See, for example, the city charter of Medford, St. 1903, c. 345, \u00a7 11, construed in <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Mayor of Medford, </em>241 Mass. at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">General Laws c. 43 does not expressly grant to the city council the authority to appoint administrative assistants and other employees as may be necessary for the proper conduct of its business. The only specific appointment power given to the city council is contained in G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>authorizing the appointment of a city clerk. The absence of a specific grant of authority is, however, not indicative that the city council lacks appointment power. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tillinghast, </em>203 Mass. 539, 545-546 (1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In addition to vesting the legislative power of the city in the city council, the Legislature has, in G. L. c. 44, specifically charged the city council with significant budgetary responsibilities (see G. L. c. 44, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 33, 33A). \u201cThese grants of authority and responsibility to the [city council] necessarily imply . . . power to carry out the authority expressly conferred.\u201d <em>City Council of Boston </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>383 Mass. at 721 (discussing the powers of the mayor). There is nothing in G. L. c. 43 to the contrary. Indeed, \u00a7 3 of G. L. c. 43 provides that \u201c[n]one of the legislative powers of a city shall be abridged or impaired by this chapter.\u201d The Supreme Judicial Court has implied that appointment powers for legislative functions reside in the legislative branch of city government. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Mayor of Quincy, </em>270 Mass. at 187-188. See also <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tillinghast, </em>203 Mass. at 546; <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Mayor of Medford, </em>241 Mass. at 338-339.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 48, is also a legislative indication of this power. That statute is similar to the statute relied on in <em>City Council of Boston </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>383 Mass. at 718-719, to support the conclusion that the mayor of Boston has authority to make staff appointments and determine their salaries. Recognizing the needs of the two branches of city government for staffing flexibility, see <em>City Council of Boston </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, supra </em>at 721, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 48, exempts from civil service \u201cadministrative assistants, secretaries, stenographers, clerks, telephone operators and messengers connected with the offices of <em>city councils, </em>mayors, city managers, town managers and selectmen\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">We see no policy reason why the city council may not determine that the clerk of committees, a position in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>legislative, should be subject only to the appointing authority of the city council. As sometimes happens, and has happened in this case, a mayor and a city council may be at odds as to who should be appointed to a particular position. To require, as suggested by the plaintiffs, that staffing for the legislative branch of the city government be initiated by the mayor is not conducive to the efficient functioning of city government.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We conclude, therefore, that implicit in New Bedford\u2019s charter provisions, and recognized in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 48, is the authority of the city council to make such appointments as are necessary to carry out its legislative responsibilities, subject, however, to such appropriation and other powers as may be held by the mayor. See G. L. c. 44; see also <em>Sherriff </em>v. <em>Mayor of Revere, </em>355 Mass. 133, 137 (1969). Compare <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>231 Mass. 252, 257 (1918); <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Mayor of Medford, </em>241 Mass. at 338-339.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">3. <em>Civil service. </em>The plaintiffs also argue that the city council, when acting under G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 5, may not \u201cauthorize any action in conflict with c. 31.\u201d Although the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 2-201 of the 1979 ordinance is contrary to the civil service laws, their contentions are not specific.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Assuming, for purposes of this argument, that the ordinance is a reorganization under G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 5, and assuming also that the mayor has standing to raise the rights of the employees of the office of the clerk of committees,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>but see <em>Police Commr. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>279 Mass. 577, 583-584 (1932), we hold on this record that no conflict with G. L. c. 31 has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">4. <em>Cross appeal by the defendants. </em>There is one additional matter before us. The defendants by cross appeal seek an injunction ordering the mayor to remove his appointee from the position of clerk of committees and for other orders. We decline to order injunctive relief and instead follow the practice of declining to order public officials to act when their duties have been judicially defined. See <em>Boston Teachers Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>370 Mass. 455, 471 (1976) (\u201c[W]e assume that public officials will act in conformity with the court\u2019s determination of their obligations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">5. <em>Judgment. </em>Since the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, dismissal of the complaint was not appropriate. <em>MacKeen </em>v. <em>Canton, </em>379 Mass. 514, 516 n.3 (1980). Judgment shall be entered in accordance with this opinion declaring that the city council has the authority to appoint the clerk of committees pursuant to \u00a7 2-201 of the Code of the City of New Bedford as amended by the 1979 ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> New Bedford Rev. General Ordinances, tit. 2, c. 2 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\"> Although the plaintiffs in their brief state that it is \u201cquestionable\u201d whether the city council can impose on the mayor these duties (which were ten percent of the activities of the clerk\u2019s office), they do not separately challenge these sections of the 1979 ordinance. We do not pass upon their validity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"> As inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\"> Their purported explanation is as follows: \u201cIf the ordinance is viewed as having transferred civil service clerks into the mayor\u2019s office, it violated c. 31, \u00a7 48, which exempts persons employed in the mayor's office from civil service laws. No notice or hearing were accorded these clerks under \u00a7\u00a735 and 41 (Chapter 31). . . . If the clerks are not deemed to be transferred, then either their positions are abolished, or they remain in the clerk\u2019s office (and need a department head). Whatever view is taken of the clerk\u2019s status under the questioned ordinance, some general law has been violated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\"> The office of the clerk of committees has three administrative subordinates who, according to testimony of the director of labor relations and personnel for the city, were \u201cdesignated civil service appointees.\u201d The director testified that the designation was made by normal requisition and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>not as a result of special petition. Assuming that these employees have civil service status, but see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 48, there has been no showing on the record before us that any of the rights of these employees have been impaired.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
