Spiliotis and by Nicholas P. Spiliotis, the son of Concetta, against the estate of Philip N. Spiliotis (Concetta\u2019s former husband and Nicholas\u2019s father) for arrears in alimony, child support, school tuition and books pursuant to a decree of divorce dated January 26, 1967.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint alleges that Concetta died on April 5, 1970, and that Philip died August 27, 1979, \u201chaving paid nothing\u201d under the decree. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss under Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 12(b)(6) (1975). Although ruling that the complaint stated claims against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>husband\u2019s estate, a judge of a Probate Court dismissed the action on the ground of loches. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">1. <em>Laches. </em>To sustain a defense of loches, mere delay is not enough. The person claiming the defense must also make a factual showing of prejudice. <em>Three Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>357 Mass. 271, 278 (1970). <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Zeiders, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 634, 636 (1981). It was error to dismiss the complaint on this ground as the complaint did not on its face show prejudice to the defendant. See 5 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1277 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Moreover, in cases involving alimony and support where, as here, the Probate Court has discretion, on the facts that may be proved, to modify the original judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 37, the authorities do not treat the matter as one of loches but consider the question of delay \u201csubsumed in whether the circumstances of the parties [have] so changed as to require a modification of the earlier judgment.\u201d <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Zeiders, supra </em>at 637. Thus, in <em>McIlroy </em>v. <em>McIlroy, </em>208 Mass. 458, 465 (1911), where an action was brought in 1909 on a decree entered in 1892 ordering separate support payments, the court held that the rulings requested, including a request that the neglect of the wife to take action for more than fifteen years should be deemed loches, were rightly refused. This was so because the court in an action for unpaid alimony or support \u201ccould consider any change in the present position of the parties.\u201d The case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Greenlow, </em>330 Mass. 88, 89-90 (1953), is to the same effect. There, an action was brought by a wife in 1952 against her husband\u2019s estate to recover arrears in alimony and child support which had remained unpaid since 1929. See also <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>134 Mass. 353 (1883) (twenty-eight years).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">2. <em>Claim for accrued alimony hy wife\u2019s administratrix. </em>Since it would be futile to remand the matter for further proceedings if, as the defendant claims, Concetta\u2019s administratrix is barred from recovering as matter of law, and since the parties have briefed the issue, we consider whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>judgment of alimony abates with the death of the obligee so that an administratrix is precluded as matter of law from recovering alimony arrears accrued at the date of her decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although there are dicta in old cases which would bar such an action, see <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>16 Gray 109, 110 (1860); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>100 Mass. 373, 374 (1868); <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>134 Mass. at 355, quoting from <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Allen, supra; </em>see also <em>Gediman </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>306 Mass. 138, 141 (1940) (statute contemplates living parties), we have not been cited to any case in Massachusetts or elsewhere in the United States which holds that recovery is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Indeed, in <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Comstock, supra </em>at 109-110, an award against a husband for nonpayment of accrued periodic payments was upheld after his wife\u2019s death. Arbitrators had awarded fifteen dollars quarterly \u201cby way of alimony\u201d to the wife. After defining alimony and after explaining that the basis for the rule which precluded recovery by the wife\u2019s executor was that arrears in alimony belonged to the husband, the court pointed out that the money due in the case at bar was not technically \u201calimony\u201d. This was so because the wife was free to dispose of it as a \u201cfeme sole\u201d and, if she left a will, her beneficiaries had an interest in the arrears. <em>Id. </em>at 110-111.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Because of the different legal setting concerning the rights of succession, see <em>DuMont </em>v. <em>Godbey, </em>382 Mass. 234, 236 (1981), alimony does not now have the technical attributes it had at the time it was discussed in <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Comstock, supra. </em>See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>23 Ind. 370, 372-377 (1864) (statutory alimony is not the same as common law alimony). There is, therefore, no sound basis for following the dictum in <em>Holbrook. </em>See <em>Du Mont </em>v. <em>Godbey, supra </em>at 239. We choose rather to follow the <em>Holbrook </em>holding which permits recovery where the spouse is free to dispose of her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">There are obvious policy considerations against adopting a rule which would give a spouse a financial incentive to disobey a judgment, and which would increase his potential reward each time he fails to make a payment required by the judgment. Moreover, as pointed out by the New York Court of Appeals, \u201cTo hold otherwise would be to defeat the object of the law and seriously impair the value of the decree in the wife\u2019s favor by depriving her\u201d of a source of credit to obtain support. <em>Van Ness </em>v. <em>Ransom, </em>215 N.Y. 557, 559, 560 (1915). The following cases also allow recovery by a wife\u2019s personal representative. <em>Heaton </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>216 Ala. 197, 198-199 (1927). <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>23 Ind. at 376-377. <em>Dinet </em>v. <em>Eigenmann, </em>80 Ill. 274, 279 (1875), S.C. 86 Ill. 83 (1877), and 87 Ill. 260 (1877). <em>Gerreins Adm\u2019r. </em>v. <em>Michie, </em>122 Ky. 250, 253-254 (1906). <em>Beyerlein </em>v. <em>Ashburn, </em>334 Mich. 13, 15 (1952). See also <em>Greer </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>110 Colo. 92, 95 (1942); <em>Siver </em>v. <em>Shebetka, </em>245 Iowa 965, 969-970 (1954); <em>Leutzinger </em>v. <em>McNeely, </em>216 Mo. App. 699, 702-704 (1925); <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>White, </em>15 N.J. Misc. 542, 544 (Sup. Ct. 1937). Cf. <em>Bourman </em>v. <em>Bourman, </em>155 Kan. 602, 605-606 (1942); <em>Coffman </em>v. <em>Finney, </em>65 Ohio St. 61, 68-69 (1901). We agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the complaint does state a claim against the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>fendant and that the plaintiff administratrix is not barred from bringing an action for arrearages in alimony accrued prior to Concetta\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">At our request the parties filed supplementary briefs discussing Nicholas\u2019s right to seek recovery from his father\u2019s estate. See <em>Luster </em>v. <em>Luster, </em>299 Mass. 480, 484-485 (1938), and <em>Sorensen </em>v. <em>Sorensen, </em>369 Mass. 350, 353 (1975), commenting on possible actions between a parent and a minor child in matters of contract and property. See also <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 273, 277 (1976). Because of the difficulties pointed out by the parties, we conclude that these questions would best be resolved with \u201cthe benefit of a record of facts agreed upon or actually established by proof rather than from mere allegations in a complaint as in the present case.\u201d <em>Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kotseas, </em>378 Mass. 85, 100 (1979). See also <em>id. </em>at 99; <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 105 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Probate Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-15\"> Prior to the effective date of the Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P., July 1,1975, the word \u201cdecree\u201d was used, rather than \u201cjudgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\"> Contrary to the contention made in the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, no additional adjudication of arrearages is necessary to bring this action. See <em>McIlroy </em>v. <em>McIlroy, </em>208 Mass. at 464, 465.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\"> The court in <em>Holbrook, supra </em>at 110, discussed alimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">\u201cAlimony is not considered to be the separate property of the wife; but it is that portion of the husband\u2019s estate which is allowed her for her present subsistence and livelihood. It is unlike property held for her sole and separate use. She ought to apply it exclusively to her support; and upon her death the arrears belong to her husband, subject only to the payment of her debts .... It is for this reason that the executor of the wife cannot recover any arrears of . . . alimony . . . against the husband, except for the payment of debts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\"><em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>6 Watts &amp; Serg. 85, 89 (Pa. 1843), also explains the rule in terms of property rights. In a divorce a mensa et thora, the rights of the parties so far as regards succession to property, remain as during mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>riage, and the husband is entitled to all the wife\u2019s personal property. \u201cFrom this it would result, that the arrears of alimony belong to the husband; and it would seem to be against right to compel him to pay to another that which belongs to himself.\u201d Nevertheless, in that case, the action was allowed for the benefit of the wife\u2019s creditors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
