Each defendant has appealed. At trial, each defendant rested at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, and filed a motion for a required finding of not guilty. These motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">1. The evidence most favorable to the Commonwealth was that one or both defendants had been having discussions in June, 1979, with Flemming Budual. Beginning in early July, 1979, further conferences took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">(a) By arrangement, Budual met both defendants at a Howard Johnson restaurant in Kingston on July 3. After discussion of a separate enterprise, Nighelli asked Budual if he \u201cknew somebody that could make two persons disappear.\u201d When asked what he meant, Nighelli said \u201csomething about two people have to be killed,\u201d two elderly males from New Hampshire, because \u201csome big shot in the M.B.T.A. wanted ... it because\u201d his son had been killed, \u201csomeone had killed his son.\u201d Budual said he would \u201csee if . . . [he could] find somebody.\u201d Budual was told by Nighelli that a proposed victim was \u201cliving in New Hampshire . . . that . . . [Nighelli] knew what kind of car he was driving every day, [and] which way he was going back to his home,\u201d and that the victim was not \u201crelated to organized crime.\u201d When asked the cost, Budual said he \u201cdidn\u2019t know, but . . . [estimated] three to five thousand dollars.\u201d Melanson (known to Budual only as \u201cMel\u201d) assured Budual that \u201ceverything Nighelli told . . . [him] was true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">(b) On July 12, 1979, Budual went to Friendly\u2019s Restaurant in Plymouth to meet Nighelli but found Melanson there. Melanson told Budual that Nighelli was in Lowell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>and asked Budual \u201cif . . . [he] ever got a ... hit man to kill the persons from New Hampshire.\u201d Budual told Melanson that he would call and arrange for Melanson and Nighelli to meet the hit man at the Howard Johnson Restaurant in South Boston the next day. The appointment apparently was not kept by Melanson and Nighelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">(c) On July 20, 1979, Budual met Nighelli at Friendly\u2019s Restaurant at Plymouth. Nighelli told Budual \u201cthat Mel screwed up and . . . was out of it now,\u201d but that \u201cthe hit was still on, was still going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">(d) On July 24, Budual, \u201cin the midday hours\u201d met with Nighelli and one Don Cuccinelli (known to Nighelli only as \u201cPauly\u201d) at the Howard Johnson Restaurant in Kingston. Cuccinelli asked Nighelli for \u201cinformation about the person that has to be hit.\u201d Nighelli gave Cuccinelli a paper which contained the intended victim\u2019s motor vehicle license plate number, make of automobile, and road address. Cuccinelli, as the supposed \u201chit man,\u201d then \u201casked for some money up front for expenses.\u201d Nighelli said he would go to Boston, \u201cspeak with the person [who] wanted the job done and get the money for him.\u201d Nighelli said that the job could not be done as \u201can accident,\u201d but must be carried out in some manner that would make the victim \u201can example\u201d so that other people involved would know \u201cthat the guy died for a good reason.\u201d They met again at the same place later that day about 5:30 p.m. Nighelli had not obtained any money, but said, \u201c[Y]ou go ahead and do the hit, anyway, because he [Nighelli\u2019s friend] will be good for the money.\u201d Nighelli disclosed the name of the proposed victim as Vincent Ferrara.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">(e) On July 27, Nighelli called Budual by telephone to report that Ferrara \u201cwas in prison.\u201d He asked if it could be arranged to \u201cget him hit inside the prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Nighelli and Melanson were unfortunate in their confidants. Budual was an undercover informer for the Drug Enforcement Administration of the Department of Justice, who \u201cknew an awful lot about illegal trafficking in drugs\u201d and had become an informer because he did not like people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>who used and sold drugs. Cuccinelli was a State police officer, working under cover in the narcotics unit and posing as a \u201chit man\u201d in respect of the proposal to kill Ferrara. Budual and Officer Cuccinelli each testified. Their testimony, already described, was sufficient to warrant a rational jury in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants, as early as July 3, were guilty of the offense of conspiracy to murder one and possibly two unnamed New Hampshire residents. Ferrara\u2019s name was not mentioned to Budual until after Nighelli had told Budual on July 20 that Melanson \u201cscrewed up and was out of it now.\u201d Evidence that Ferrara was a resident of New Hampshire was produced in the form of Ferrara\u2019s motor vehicle registration and a Massachusetts house of correction record (each showing him to be a resident of Nashua, New Hampshire). Melanson had shown continuing participation in the venture by his inquiry of Budual on July 12 about the \u201chit man.\u201d Nighelli\u2019s pursuit of the objective was indicated by his later talks with Budual on July 20 and 24, at which he met Officer Cuccinelli.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The crime, at least in this simple two-participant type of conspiracy, under Massachusetts law is complete upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>formation of an agreement and a combination to commit, or caused to be committed, a crime or an unlawful act. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass. 188, 249-250 (1971), cert. denied, 407 U.S. 914 and sub nom. <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>407 U.S. 910 (1972). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corridori, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 469, 476 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 604, 618 &amp; n.27 (1975); Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7 443 (1976 &amp; supp. 1981). See for other situations which may constitute criminal conspiracy, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 337, 340 (1977), and cases cited. There is in Massachusetts no requirement that an overt act be committed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>232 Mass. 588, 591 (1919); Nolan, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Originally there were (a) indictments charging the defendants with conspiracy to solicit the commission of murder, as well as (b) indictments charging each of them with conspiracy to murder. The Commonwealth consented to the dismissal of the indictments charging conspiracy to solicit murder and proceeded only on the indictments charging conspiracy to murder Ferrara or (as of the conference of July 3) one or two unspecified residents of New Hampshire. The jury could infer from the conversation of July 3, at which both defendants were present, that each defendant then had in mind the same victim or victims, although no victim was then identified to Budual. The testimony about what each said and did when together on July 3, if believed, constituted proof of participation in a combination \u201cdirected toward the accomplishment of the same object,\u201d viz. the death of two New Hampshire residents not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>then named to Budual. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>163 Mass. 411, 417-418 (1895); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soule, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 973, 974 (1979). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 678, 682-684 (1980). Compare also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>370 Mass. 192, 200-203 (1976), where the evidence of the conspiracy\u2019s object was much more equivocal. Even if these defendants did not intend to participate directly and personally in killing the victim or victims they could be found to have conspired to bring about the result. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>French, </em>357 Mass. 356, 391-393 (1970), judgments vacated as to death penalty sub nom. <em>Limone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>408 U.S. 936 (1972). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferry, </em>357 Mass. 149, 152 (1970). The motions for required findings of not guilty were denied properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">2. There is no merit to the defendants\u2019 argument that the judge in some manner usurped the function of the jury in his charge. The judge instructed correctly that, in this case where there were only two alleged conspirators, the acquittal of one of them would require that both be acquitted because one cannot conspire alone. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>130 F.2d 56, 57 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 317 U.S. 666 (1942); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>503 F.2d 50, 54 (6th Cir. 1974); LaFave &amp; Scott, \u00a7 62, at 488 et seq.; <em>Nolan, supra, </em>\u00a7 452. Compare Model Penal Code, Comment to \u00a7 5.03, at 104 (Tentative Draft No. 10, 1960). The judge further charged that, if the jurors \u201cfound that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt all . . . [the] elements [of the crime of conspiracy,] then you <em>may </em>bring and return a verdict of guilty as to both defendants\u201d (emphasis supplied). We do not perceive how this charge in any respect constitutes an instruction directing a verdict of guilty against either defendant or improperly precluding the jury from returning \u201cinconsistent verdicts,\u201d as that term is used in some Federal cases. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martorano, </em>557 F.2d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 1977), S.C. 561 F.2d 406, cert. denied, 435 U.S. 922 (1978). Under the charge, neither defendant could be harmed by the acquittal of one of them, and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>was no <em>requirement </em>in the charge that, if one was found guilty, the other must also be found guilty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">3. There was no error in the action of the trial judge in charging that Melanson\u2019s possible withdrawal from the conspiracy (as reported by Nighelli to Budual at their conference of July 20, 1979; see part l[c] of this opinion, <em>supra) </em>was \u201cnot a defense ... as the crime of conspiracy is complete upon the making of the agreement\u201d and the \u201ccombination.\u201d The defendants rely on language in <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>438 U.S. 422, 462-465 (1978), concerning indictments for a continuing conspiracy of price-fixing under the Sherman Act, where proof of withdrawal from the conspiracy may be of significance. Whatever weight may be given to withdrawal from a continuing conspiracy in Federal and anti-trust proceedings, withdrawal from a conspiracy has not been shown to have any effect upon the commission of the common law offense of conspiracy to commit a crime under Massachusetts law. See Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7 452, at 289.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is a logical ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>tension of cases, already cited in part 1 of this opinion, applying the \u201ctraditional rule\u201d (referred to in the comments to Model Penal Code, \u00a7 5.03[6], at 143 [Tent. Draft No. 10 [1960]) that \u201cthe crime is complete with the agreement\u201d so that \u201cno subsequent action can exonerate the conspirator of that crime.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">4. The transcript of the trial judge\u2019s charge indicates that he told the jury that \u201ca person becomes a conspirator by <em>negligently </em>and intentionally entering into an agreement that creates a combination\u201d (emphasis supplied). The judge was purporting to read from (or follow) written requests by the Commonwealth for instructions, which had asked that the jury be told that \u201ca person becomes a conspirator by <em>knowingly </em>and intentionally entering into the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ment that creates the combination\u201d (emphasis supplied). On motion by the Commonwealth, the trial judge ordered the transcript corrected and a single justice of this court ordered the papers with respect to the correction reproduced and referred to the panel which has decided this appeal. We regard the trial judge\u2019s correction as essentially conclusive. Mass.R.A.P. 8(e), as appearing in 378 Mass. 934 (1979). Apart from the rule, we regard the use of the word \u201cnegligently\u201d as probably an error (based on phonetic similarity of the words \u201cnegligently\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d) of the court stenographer during a hot July week of trial in which there had been mention of outside traffic noise and the sound of electric fans. Also, in related sections of the charge, which must be viewed as a whole and in context, the judge (as shown by the uncorrected transcript) had charged that \u201cthe agreement that each member [of a conspiracy] makes must have a common purpose, that is to say the members of that conspiracy must knowingly and intentionally have agreed to accomplish the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">At the close of the judge\u2019s charge, no defense objection to the alleged use of the word \u201cnegligently\u201d was made (at a time when any error could easily have been corrected). This circumstance not only supports the probability that no error was in fact made, but provides strong reason for treating the statement, if made, as an immaterial \u201cslip of the tongue,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 455, 458 (1979), on a point adequately and accurately dealt with elsewhere in the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">5. The defendants\u2019 discussions with Budual on various dates in July, 1979, dealt not only with the proposed murder of Ferrara, as to which Budual gave testimony, but also dealt with other criminal activities, then discussed, including a bank robbery. Melanson\u2019s counsel had filed a \u201cmotion in limine\u201d to prevent reference to the other criminal activities and especially the bank robbery. After an extended bench conference, the prosecuting attorney stated that he would \u201cmake every effort to exclude questions . . . concerning the bank robbery.\u201d The prosecutor also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>agreed to caution witnesses called by him to avoid mention of offenses other than those then being prosecuted. The trial judge ruled that \u201cas of . . . [the bench conference], any questions relating to the . . . bank robbery allegedly abandoned . . . [were] to be excluded,\u201d subject to reconsideration as the trial proceeded. This effort to avoid possible prejudice to the defendants was successful, while Budual was being examined by the prosecutor, despite the fact that the subject of the proposed murder of Ferrara was discussed at some of the conferences of one or the other of the defendants with Budual, when there was also discussion of the proposed bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">During the cross-examination of Budual, Budual was asked by Melanson\u2019s counsel about the detail of the somewhat ambiguous conversation of July 20, when Nighelli reported to Budual that Melanson was \u201cout of the hit\u201d theretofore discussed. When seeking further detail, Melanson\u2019s counsel asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t Nighelli make it clear to you that as a result of screwing it up Mel[anson] was out of it now?\u201d To this Budual replied, \u201cHe was out of the hit job and the bank job.\u201d Melanson\u2019s counsel asked for a mistrial and immediate instructions to disregard the answer. The judge denied the motion for a mistrial and gave no immediate instructions based on the objection. After the judge\u2019s charge, defense counsel made no request for further instruction on this matter, perhaps some indication that he then thought it would unduly emphasize the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">There was no error. There is no fair suggestion that the answer was inaccurate in any respect, or was induced by the prosecutor. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banuchi, </em>335 Mass. 649, 654 (1957). The conversation, referred to by Budual, probably discussed somewhat inextricably both the proposed \u201chit\u201d on Ferrara and the proposed bank robbery. Budual\u2019s answer was given in reply to incautious and persistent defense efforts to press Budual as to details in an area in which defense counsel knew there were risks. The trial judge reasonably could have been of opinion that immediate cautionary instructions would have served only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>unduly to lay stress on the somewhat obscure reference in Budual\u2019s answer to \u201cthe bank job.\u201d The full answer, in any event, had sufficient relevance to the specific conspiracy being prosecuted to be admissible in the circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Deschamps, 1 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 2-3 (1972). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chalifoux, </em>362 Mass. 811, 815-816 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 732 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 269 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drayton, </em>386 Mass. 39, 48-49 (1982). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanley, </em>337 Mass. 384, 395, cert. denied, 358 U.S. 850 (1958). Compare also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>348 Mass. 68, 70-71 (1964); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spare, </em>353 Mass. 263, 267 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-6\"> The conversations with Budual, by Melanson on July 12 and by Nighelli on July 20 and 24, were not the subject of specific objection (by defense counsel) as to their admissibility. Earlier telephone conversations on June 3, June 25, and July 1 between Budual and Nighelli had been admitted in evidence only against Nighelli. After testimony about the conversations of July 3 and July 12, at which Melanson was present, and before Budual\u2019s testimony about the July 20 conference, the prosecutor asked the trial judge at a bench conference to rule that there had been sufficient proof that a conspiracy existed, so that conversations with either could be attributed to both defendants. The judge declined so to charge the jury at that stage of the trial but suggested to the prosecutor \u201cthat the next time\u201d that the problem arose \u201cand there is an objection,\u201d he could overrule it. Inasmuch as no objections were made to tbe admissibility of Budual\u2019s testimony about the later conferences between Budual and Nighelli, we regard that testimony as admissible against both defendants for all purposes, including the identification of Ferrara as the initial proposed victim. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>370 Mass. 703, 708 (1976), where objections were made. We do not understand the defendants to argue otherwise on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b616-6\"> For general text authorities concerning criminal conspiracy, see 1 Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 82-93 (1957 ed. &amp; 1979 supp.); 4 Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7\u00a7 722 et seq.

The Model Penal Code \u00a7 5.03 (Proposed Official Draft, 1962, and see comments to this section, Tent. Draft No. 10, 1960, at 102 et seq.) departs from the present Massachusetts law and common law rules in various respects, as is explained fully in the comments. See the discussion in LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law \u00a7 62, at 470 et seq. (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\"> We have been referred to no Massachusetts decisions which suggest that the Federal cases on \u201cinconsistent verdicts\u201d have any application to conspiracy charges (or, indeed, other charges) in the State courts. The only Massachusetts decisions relied upon by the defendants are <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>170 Mass. 228, 242 (1898), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>255 Mass. 317, 319-320 (1926), neither of which involved conspiracy indictments. A different situation may arise where, in prosecutions for substantive offenses, different evidence applies to (or may be believed or rejected with respect to) different defendants, and a trial judge charges that like verdicts must be returned as to each defendant. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 365, 369-370 (1977). Compare also <em>Standefer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>447 U.S. 10, 14-26 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\"> In LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 62, at 486-488, some respects are pointed out in which withdrawal from the conspiracy may be significant, e.g. (a) relief from liability for substantive crimes committed, pursuant to the conspiracy, after the date of withdrawal by a conspirator; (b) running of the statute of limitations (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Panebianco, </em>543 F.2d 447, 453-454 [2d Cir. 1976], cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1103 [1977]), after the withdrawal; (c) period when statements of one coconspirator may bind other conspirators, and similar matters. On the record before us, we need not consider to what extent in Massachusetts, these exceptions to the general rule may be of importance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\"> On this meager record, even if the Model Penal Code had been applicable, it would seem that Melanson\u2019s action as described by Nighelli on July 20 would not have provided him a defense, for it was not shown that Melanson \u201cthwarted\u201d the conspiracy by whatever he did. The 1962 Proposed Official Draft of the Model Penal Code, \u00a7 5.03(6) reads \u201c(6) <em>Renunciation of Criminal Purpose. </em>It is an affirmative defense that the actor, after conspiring to commit a crime, <em>thwarted the success of the conspiracy, </em>under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose\u201d (emphasis in text supplied). See comments on subsection (6), Model Penal Code (Tent. Draft No. 10) at 142-144. See also comments upon renunciation of other inchoate crimes, at 71-73. Subsection (7) of \u00a7 5.03 (Proposed Official Draft, at 85-86) reads in part \u201cFor purposes of Section 1.06(4) ...(c) if an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him only if and when he advises those with whom he conspired of his abandonment or he informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his participation therein.\u201d This language does not purport to deal with renunciation as a <em>defense </em>to a charge of conspiracy but only with \u201cabandonment\u201d of the conspiracy, as it affects the date when the crime occurs and when time starts to run. See for \u00a7 1.06(4), Proposed Official Draft at 9-10, and comments on subsection (7) in Tentative Draft No. 10, at 144-155. A proposed revision (somewhat based on the Model Penal Code) of our statutes on criminal conspiracy was set out in the Proposed Criminal Code of Massachusetts, c. 263, \u00a7\u00a7 48 &amp; 49(3), prepared in 1971 for the Governor\u2019s Committee on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Criminal Justice and the Criminal Law Revision Commission, 1972 Senate Doc.
