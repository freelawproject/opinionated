On August 25, 1976, the Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation, acting under the provisions of G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 25 (as amended through St. 1971, c. 555, \u00a7 58), valued the stock at $765,806.25 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>purposes of the inheritance tax.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 8,1976, the State Tax Commission, apparently acting under the provisions of G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 26 (as appearing in St. 1961, c. 469, \u00a7 3), arrived at the same valuation. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Tax Board (board), which, on December 17, 1979, rendered a decision for the \u201cappellee.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board made seasonable return of its decision to the Probate Court in which the estate was being settled. On November 12, 1980, the board promulgated findings of fact and a report in which it concluded that the plaintiffs had \u201cfail[ed] to sustain [their] burden of proof . . . as to overvaluation of the shares of corporate stock.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The plaintiffs promptly filed in a Probate Court a complaint against the Commissioner of Revenue (Commissioner) which was entitled \u201cPetition for Refusal of Return of Appellate Tax Board and for Determination of Value of Stock,\u201d which purported to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction under G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 26, and which sought a reduction in the valuation of the stock to $631,210. The Commissioner moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action (Mass.R.Civ.P. 12[b][1], 365 Mass. 755 [1974]) on the ground that the \u201c[plaintiffs\u2019] only remedy [was] a timely appeal to the . . . Supreme Judicial Court on matters of law.\u201d The Commissioner\u2019s motion was allowed, and the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">There no longer appears to be any real dispute between the parties that it was error to dismiss the action on the ground advanced by the Commissioner below. Ever since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the enactment of St. 1930, c. 416, either the old Board of Tax Appeals or (since 1937) the present Appellate Tax Board has been required to make return to a Probate Court of any appraisal which it has made for inheritance tax purposes pursuant to the provisions now found in G. L. c. 65, \u00a7\u00a725 and 26, and G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is equally clear that during that same period G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, has contained tandem provisions which have (a) recognized and preserved the right of the Probate Courts to review such appraisals and (b) specifically excepted the appraisals from the otherwise exclusive review of the board\u2019s decisions by the Supreme Judicial Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It necessarily follows that the order dismissing the action must be reversed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Our work is not over. The parties are in disagreement as to the function of a Probate Court now that the board has returned its appraisal to the court. The plaintiffs point to the \u201cwhen accepted by the court\u201d language of the present G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 26,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and to the \u201chear and determine all questions relative to the tax imposed by this chapter\u201d language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>of G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 30 (as amended by St. 1922, c. 520, \u00a7 19), in support of their contention that the Probate Court can now disregard the board\u2019s labors in favor of a completely independent appraisal of the stock which will bind the Commissioner for inheritance tax purposes. The Commissioner effectively ignores the \u201cwhen\u201d and asserts that the court must accept the board\u2019s appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We think both parties are wide of the mark. In <em>Greenfield </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., ante </em>486, 490 (1982), we concluded that neither \u00a7 27 nor \u00a7 30 of G. L. c. 65 affords any basis for the court\u2019s making an independent determination of value for purposes of the inheritance tax. In that same case we pointed out that ever since 1930 (with a hiatus not here material) G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, has provided that \u201c[t]he decision of the board shall be final as to findings of fact\u201d <em>(supra </em>at 490). That language has immediately preceded the first of the tandem references to G. L. c. 65, \u00a7\u00a725 and 26, which have already been mentioned. Taken in context, we think the effect of the \u201cfinality\u201d language is to preclude a Probate Court from engaging in the fact-finding process which would be necessary to any independent valuation of assets. See and compare <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>J.G. McCrory Co., </em>280 Mass. 273, 278 (1932); <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>308 Mass. 558, 572 (1941); <em>DeCordova </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>314 Mass. 371, 374 (1943); <em>Assessors of Worcester </em>v. <em>Knights of Columbus Religious Educ. Charitable &amp; Benevolent Assn., </em>329 Mass. 532, 534 (1952); <em>Coomey </em>v. <em>Assessors of Sandwich, </em>367 Mass. 836, 839 (1975), and cases cited. Taken in conjunction with the \u201cwhen accepted\u201d language of \u00a7 26, we think the effect of the \u201cfinality\u201d language is to require a Probate Court to accept the board\u2019s findings and appraisal unless they are vitiated by some error of law. See <em>Choate </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>304 Mass. 298, 300 (1939); <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>310 Mass. 674, 676 (1942); <em>Assessors of Lawrence </em>v. <em>Arlington Mills, </em>320 Mass. 272, 274-275 (1946); <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>323 Mass. 154, 157-158 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>(1948); <em>Fisher Sch. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>325 Mass. 529, 533-534 (1950); <em>Assessors of Everett </em>v. <em>Albert N. Parlin Home, Inc., </em>331 Mass. 359, 364 (1954); <em>Stilson </em>v. <em>Assessors of Gloucester, </em>385 Mass. 724, 729 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">It does not appear that the Probate Court has given any consideration to what its function might be or to how that function should be performed in the circumstances of this case in the event that it should be determined (as we have) that the court has jurisdiction to engage in a limited review of the board\u2019s findings and appraisal. The parties have not briefed the question whether those findings or that appraisal might be vitiated by some error of law. Accordingly, the order of dismissal is reversed, and the case is to stand for further proceedings in the Probate Court consistent with the principles enunciated in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> We are not concerned with the estate tax now found in G.
