The plaintiff then brought the second suit, and pending that action, on the 9th of October, the defendant assigned the judgment in the first suit to his attorney in that action in payment of the attorney\u2019s bill of costs in that action, and gave notice of the assignment to the plaintiff. The attorney swore that the costs belonged to him before the assignment; that he took the assignment in good faith to get the entire control of the judgment, and without any good reason to believe the plaintiff would recover in the second suit. In November following, the plaintiff recovered judgment in the second suit for $440, damages and costs. ,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-10\"><em>R. W.

Here there was only one judgment, and consequently no right to set off at the time of the assignment. <em>(Graves </em>v. Woodbury, 4 Hill, 559.) The assignment was made in payment of the costs due from the defendant to his attorney. I see no reason why that was not as good a consideration as though the attorney had paid so much money. The attorney\u2019s lien for his costs is not always protected against the equities existing between the parties. But he stands here as the assignee of the judgment, and is entitled to the same protection as any other assignee. Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
