After the evidence had been given and the cause summed upon both sides the referee intimated an opinion against the plaintiffs as to one of the notes, and as to the other note said he would take time to consider. The plaintiffs thereupon asked the referee to hear further evidence, and the referee said he would do so, if the witnesses on both sides were still in attendance. On inquiry it was found that one of the defendants\u2019 witnesses had left the city. The referee thereupon- declined to hear further evidence at any subsequent time, on the sole ground, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>as lie certified, that he did not consider he had authority to do so.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-5\"><em>J. Edwards </em>and <em>M. T. Reynolds, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq8K\">moved that the hearing be opened, and that the parties have leave to produce further evidence. They cited Cleveland <em>v. Hunter, </em>1 Wend., 104.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-6\"><em>J.

If the referee had put his refusal on any other ground than the want of power, we should not have interfered. The defendants will very likely think it prudent, if \u25a0 not necessary, to have all their witnesses,- as well as their counsel, in attendance on the further hearing. The plaintiffs must therefore pay the costs of the hearing thus far, as well as the costs of opposing this motion, as the condition on which relief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
