STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Our standard of review when considering a challenge to an order granting a demurrer is well settled. \u201c \u2018 \u201cWe treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.\u201d [Citation.] . . . [W]e give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sanchez v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1778, 1781 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 812].)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Plaintiffs allege they are current, former, and retired deputy probation officers employed by the County of Marin (the County), and members of Local 856. According to the complaint, Local 856, its agent Martinelli\u2014who had primary authority to represent plaintiffs at the County\u2014and the union leadership entered into a secret deal with the County: (a) not to negotiate overtime compensation for plaintiffs and the proposed class although defendants knew plaintiffs were working more than 40 hours a week and were not exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C \u00a7 201 et seq.) (ELSA); (b) to conceal plaintiffs\u2019 right to overtime compensation from them; (c) to misrepresent to plaintiffs and the proposed class that they were \u201cprofessionals\u201d and therefore exempt from overtime compensation, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>defendants knew they were not exempt; and (d) to encourage the union\u2019s officers to lie to its membership about the members\u2019 rights to overtime compensation under the FLSA. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants continued to conceal plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to overtime compensation from 1995 until March 2009, when the complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Plaintiffs further allege that, in a November 6, 2006, meeting of persons representing the County and Local 856 (including Martinelli), and a group of probation department employees (including plaintiffs), the County announced it might have been \u201cout of compliance\u201d with the FLSA with respect to paying the deputy probation officers overtime, and advised plaintiffs to discuss the matter with their union if they had questions. Plaintiffs discussed the matter with Martinelli, who said defendants did not know anything about the issue, but that defendants would investigate and take appropriate action to grieve the process. However, defendants did nothing to assist plaintiffs and the proposed class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In their first cause of action, for breach of the duty of fair representation, plaintiffs allege defendants owed plaintiffs a duty of fair representation, including a duty to disclose material facts that could affect the terms and conditions of employment; that between 1994 and 2007, they knew or should have known that plaintiffs were nonexempt employees who were statutorily entitled to overtime pay and that the use of \u201cprofessional hours\u201d was a scheme or artifice to defraud plaintiffs of their right to overtime; that defendants conspired with the County to deprive plaintiffs of overtime compensation; and that during that time period defendants engaged in a pattern and practice of breaching the duty of fair representation toward plaintiffs and other proposed class members by (1) wrongfully classifying plaintiffs during negotiations and interactions with the County and plaintiffs as exempt employees, (2) entering into an undisclosed secret agreement with the County to deprive plaintiffs of overtime benefits, (3) failing to disclose to plaintiffs their right to overtime, (4) misleading plaintiffs into believing they were not entitled to overtime compensation and that such compensation could not be negotiated, and (5) engaging in unreasonable conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In their second cause of action, for common law breach of fiduciary duty, plaintiffs allege that defendants, as union representatives, owed plaintiffs fiduciary duties and obligations in all dealings, and that they breached their duty in acting as described in the earlier allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In their third cause of action, for fraudulent concealment, plaintiffs allege that from 1994 to the present, defendants knew that plaintiffs were not exempt employees under the FLSA, that plaintiffs were working a significant amount of overtime under the guise of \u201cprofessional hours\u201d without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>compensation, that they were entitled to overtime compensation, and that the use of \u201cprofessional hours\u201d was a scheme or artifice to defraud plaintiffs of overtime compensation; that defendants intentionally, maliciously, and recklessly concealed these facts from plaintiffs and took active steps to cover up their right to overtime pay and benefits; and that plaintiffs were unaware of the facts and relied on defendants\u2019 representations to their detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Defendants demurred to the complaint. The trial court sustained the demurrer to each cause of action without leave to amend on the ground it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. In doing so, it ruled: \u201cThe 1st Cause of Action for breach of the duty of fair representation falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Public Employment Relations Board as an \u2018unfair labor practice.\u2019 [Citations.] Plaintiffs are not exempt from PERB jurisdiction pursuant to Government Code [section] 3511, because they are defined as \u2018peace officers\u2019 in Penal Code [section] 830.5[, subdivision] (a), not Penal Code [section] 830.1. Plaintiffs\u2019 further contention, that PERB does not have jurisdiction to hear class action claims, is not supported by their cited authorities available to the court. [][] The 2nd and 3rd Causes of Action are also within PERB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction, because \u2018the essence\u2019 of these claims is a breach of the duty of fair representation. [Citation.]\u201d The trial court dismissed the complaint and entered judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">HI. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">A. <em>Legal Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">\u201cIn California, labor relations between most local public entities and their employees are governed by the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (MMBA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3500 et seq.), which recognizes the right of public employees to bargain collectively with their employers over wages and other terms of employment. The administrative agency authorized to adjudicate unfair labor practices charges under the MMBA is California\u2019s Public Employment Relations Board (PERB). Subject to certain exceptions, local public agencies and their employees must exhaust their administrative remedies under the MMBA by applying to PERB for relief before they can ask a court to intervene in a labor dispute.\u201d <em>(City of San Jose v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3 </em>(2010) 49 Cal.4th 597, 601 [110 Cal.Rptr.3d 718, 232 P.3d 701] <em>(City of San Jose).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">In <em>City of San Jose, </em>our Supreme Court discussed the background of PERB\u2019s authority to adjudicate unfair labor practices under the MMBA (Meyers-Milias-Brown Act; Gov. Code, \u00a7 3500 et seq.). \u201cThe history of PERB begins in 1975, when the Legislature enacted the Educational Employment Relations Act (EERA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3540-3549.3). The law established the Educational Employment Relations Board (EERB), which in 1977 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>was renamed the Public Employment Relations Board. [Citation.] As an administrative agency, PERB was to adjudicate unfair labor practice charges under the EERA, and its jurisdiction was set forth in Government Code section 3541.5. That statute provided and still provides, in part: \u2018The initial determination as to whether the charges of unfair practices are justified, and, if so, what remedy is necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, shall be a matter within the <em>exclusive jurisdiction </em>of the board.\u2019 (Italics added.)\u201d <em>(City of San Jose, supra, </em>49 Cal.4th at pp. 603-604.) Adopting a rule developed by the federal courts under the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.) (NLRA), our high court later concluded that \u201cthe administrative agency \u2018is held to have exclusive jurisdiction over activities <em>arguably protected or prohibited </em>by\u2019 the governing labor law statutes.\u201d <em>(City of San Jose, supra, </em>49 Cal.4th at p. 604, italics added, quoting <em>El Rancho Unified School Dist. v. National Education Assn. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 946, 953 [192 Cal.Rptr. 123, 663 P.2d 893] <em>(El Rancho Unified School Dist.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\u201cIn 2000, the Legislature extended PERB\u2019s jurisdiction to cover matters arising under the MMBA\u2014this was done through enactment of Government Code section 3509, which became effective July 1, 2001. (Stats. 2000, ch. 901, \u00a7 8.) Subdivision (b) of that statute provides in relevant part: \u2018A complaint alleging any violation of [the MMBA] . . . shall be processed as an unfair practice charge by [PERB], <em>The initial determination as to whether the charge of unfair practice is justified </em>and, if so, the appropriate remedy necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, shall be a matter within the <em>exclusive jurisdiction </em>of [PERB].\u2019 (Italics added.) This enactment removed \u2018from the courts their initial jurisdiction over MMBA unfair practice charges\u2019 [citation] and vested such jurisdiction in PERB [citation].\u201d <em>(City of San Jose, supra, </em>49 Cal.4th at p. 605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">This requirement that a party exhaust available administrative remedies, however, is subject to certain exceptions, such as when the administrative remedy is inadequate or when it is clear it would be futile to seek administrative remedies. <em>(City of San Jose, supra, </em>49 Cal.4th at pp. 609-610; see also <em>Coachella Valley Mosquito &amp; Vector Control Dist. v. California Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1072, 1080 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 234, 112 P.3d 623].) The question of whether the exhaustion doctrine applies to a given case is subject to de novo review on appeal. <em>(Citizens for Open Government v. City of Lodi </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 865, 873 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 636].)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">B. <em>Deputy Probation Officers as Peace Officers</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>C. <em>Breach of Duty of Fair Representation as Unfair Practice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Plaintiffs contend their action is not subject to the exclusive initial jurisdiction of PERB because they do not allege an unfair practice under the MMBA. According to plaintiffs, breach of a union\u2019s duty of fair representation is not arguably an unfair labor practice for purposes of Government Code section 3509. (All undesignated statutory references are to the Government Code.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In a number of its decisions, PERB has addressed the question of whether a breach of the duty of fair representation is an unfair practice under the MMBA. PERB has authority to interpret the provision of several labor relations acts, including the MMBA. <em>(Burke v. Ipsen </em>(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 801, 809 [117 Cal.Rptr.3d 91] <em>(Burke).) </em>As our Supreme Court has stated: \u201cPERB has a specialized and focused task\u2014\u2018to protect both employees and the state employer from violations of the organizational and collective bargaining rights guaranteed by [the governing labor law statutes].\u2019 [Citation.] As such, PERB is \u2018one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge, whose findings within that field carry the authority of an expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[T]he relationship of a reviewing court to an agency such as PERB, whose primary responsibility is to- determine the scope of the statutory duty to bargain and resolve charges of unfair refusal to bargain, is generally one of deference\u2019 [citation], and PERB\u2019s interpretation will generally be followed unless it is clearly erroneous. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Banning Teachers Assn. v. Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 799, 804-805 [244 Cal.Rptr. 671, 750 P.2d 313]; see also <em>San Mateo City School Dist. v. Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 850, 856 [191 Cal.Rptr. 800, 663 P.2d 523] [PERB\u2019s construction of statutory provision within legislatively designated field of expertise regarded with deference by court construing statute].) Accordingly, we may look to PERB\u2019s decisions for guidance. <em>(Burke, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.4th at p. 809.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In <em>Buck v. Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1704 </em>(2007) PERB Dec. No. 1898-M [31 PERC f 88, p. 304] <em>(Buck), </em>PERB discussed the duty of fair representation as follows: \u201cAlthough the MMBA does not specifically impose a duty of fair representation on an exclusive representative, the courts have held that \u2018unions owe a duty of fair representation to their members, and this requires them to refrain from representing their members arbitrarily, discriminatorily, or in bad faith.\u2019 (Hussey v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1213 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 389] (Hussey).)\u201d In <em>Buck, </em>PERB concluded an unfair labor practice had been demonstrated for purposes of section 3509, subdivision (b), where a union failed in its duty of fair representation by failing to file a member\u2019s grievance. <em>(Buck, supra, </em>PERB Dec. No. 1898-M [31 PERC <em>f </em>88, pp. 304-305].) PERB similarly explained in <em>Attard v. Internat. Assn, of Machinists </em>(2002) PERB Dec. No. 1474-M [26 PERC <em>f </em>33041, p. 122], \u201cAlthough the MMBA does not expressly impose a statutory duty of fair representation, <em>under the MMBA \u2018unions owe a duty of fair representation to their members, </em>and this requires them to refrain from representing their members arbitrarily, discriminatorily, or in bad faith.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Italics added.) The board has also ruled that <em>\u201cin order to state a prima facie violation of the duty of fair representation under the MMBA, </em>a charging party must\u201d assert facts showing how the exclusive representative\u2019s action or inaction was without a rational basis or devoid of honest judgment. <em>(Siroky v. Internat. Union of Operating Engineers, Local 39 </em>(2004) PERB Dec. No. 1618-M [28 PERC <em>f </em>132, pp. 486, 487], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Thus, it is clear that PERB treats a union\u2019s violation of its duty of fair representation as an unfair practice under the MMBA. And, as we have explained, PERB has exclusive initial jurisdiction over MMBA unfair practice charges. (\u00a7 3509, subd. (b); <em>City of San Jose, supra, </em>49 Cal.4th at p. 605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Plaintiffs contend the trial court wrongly relied on a case construing a different statute, one that differed from the MMBA in a key provision. In granting defendants\u2019 demurrer, the trial court cited, among other authorities, <em>Anderson v. California Faculty Assn. </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 207, 212, 218, 220 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 406] <em>(Anderson). </em>Plaintiffs point out, correctly, that the Court of Appeal in <em>Anderson </em>was considering a different labor statute administered by PERB, the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) (\u00a7 3560 et seq.), and that HEERA includes in its listing of unfair practices by a union or employee organization the failure to represent fairly and impartially all employees for which it was the exclusive representative <em>(Anderson, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at pp. 211-213; \u00a7 3571.1). We recognize that the statutory scheme at issue in <em>Anderson </em>made explicit that a breach of the duty of fair representation constituted an unfair labor practice. However, as we have explained, PERB has considered the fact that the MMBA does not expressly impose a duty of fair representation on a union, and has nevertheless concluded that a violation of that duty is an unfair labor practice for purposes of the MMBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">This conclusion may likewise reasonably be inferred from the regulations interpreting the MMBA. The rule defining \u201cEmployee Organization Unfair Practices Under MMBA\u201d provides that it is an unfair practice for an employee organization to do various acts, including causing or attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>cause a public agency to engage in conduct prohibited by the MMBA, discriminating against public employees because of their exercise of their right to join or refuse to join employee organizations, and refusing or failing to meet and confer in good faith. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 32604, subds. (a), (b) &amp; (c).) Likewise, it is an unfair practice for a public agency employer to discriminate against public employees because of their exercise of their right to join or refuse to join a union, or to refuse or fail to meet and confer in good faith with an exclusive representative. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 32603, subds. (a) &amp; (c).) The actions allegedly taken by defendants\u2014including entering into an undisclosed secret agreement with the County to deprive plaintiffs of the overtime benefits to which they were entitled\u2014are arguably inconsistent with the duty both of defendants and of the County to bargain in good faith. (See <em>City of San Jose, supra, </em>49 Cal.4th at p. 604 [PERB has \u201c \u2018exclusive jurisdiction over activities arguably protected or prohibited by\u2019 the governing labor law statutes\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We recognize that the Court of Appeal in <em>Andrews v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 274, 283 [184 Cal.Rptr. 542] <em>(Andrews), </em>concluded the MMBA does not include an implied duty of fair representation. The court there noted that federal courts, applying the NLRA, had found such a duty implied where an employee organization had the right to be the exclusive representative, reasoning that exclusive authority required a reciprocal obligation to exercise that authority fairly. <em>(Andrews, </em>at p. 283.) The court in <em>Andrews </em>did not find such a duty implied in the MMBA because the MMBA, unlike the NLRA, allowed employees \u201c \u2018to represent themselves individually in their employment relations with the public agency\u2019 \u201d <em>(Andrews, </em>at p. 283, quoting \u00a7 3502), and \u201c[a]bsent exclusive representation, the rationale for the reciprocal duty of fair representation does not exist\u201d <em>(Andrews, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at p. 283). As explained in <em>Jones v. Omnitrans </em>(2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 273, 283 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 706] <em>(Jones), </em>\u201c[T]he [MMBA] does not explicitly provide that employee organizations created under its aegis have a duty to their members of fair representation. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3500-3510.) Nevertheless, California courts recognize that any labor organization which acts as the exclusive representative of its members has such a duty. [Citations.] This is true whether the union becomes the employee\u2019s exclusive representative by statute or by contract. [Citation.]\u201d However, \u201c[b]ecause the duty of fair representation arises from a union\u2019s status as an exclusive representative, there is ordinarily no such duty when the union does not occupy that position, or as to particular matters for which the union does not act as the employees\u2019 exclusive agent. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Lane v. I.U.O.E. Stationary Engineers </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 164, 170 [260 Cal.Rptr. 634] <em>(Lane); </em>see also <em>Buck, supra, </em>PERB Dec. No. 1898-M [31 PERC f 88, p. 304] [\u201cThe Board has long held that the duty of fair representation is limited to negotiations and contractually based remedies under the union\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>exclusive controls. <em>([Simpson </em>v.] <em>California School Employees Association &amp; its Chapter 130 </em>(Simpson) (2003) PERB Decision No. 1550 [28 PERC 1 5, p. 12] . . . .)\u201d (fn. &amp; underscoring omitted, italics added)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Thus, <em>Andrews\u2019 </em>s conclusion that the MMBA does not include an implied duty of fair representation is based on the premise that under the MMBA, employees could represent themselves with their employer, and the union was not their exclusive representative. <em>(Andrews, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at p. 283.) Since <em>Andrews </em>was decided, however, the court in <em>Relyea </em>v. <em>Ventura County Fire Protection Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 875, 877 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 614] <em>(Relyea), </em>called into question the basis for this conclusion when it held that local government employees cannot compel their employers to negotiate terms and conditions of employment with them individually. The court noted\u2014as had the court in Andrews\u2014that under the MMBA, public employees had the right to refuse to join or participate in employee organizations and to represent themselves individually in their employment relations with the public agency. (\u00a7 3502; <em>Relyea, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 880.) However, the court rejected the argument that this provision of section 3502 allowed employees to bargain with public employers individually regarding the terms and conditions of employment, concluding that such a result would conflict with other provisions of the MMBA and with the legislative intent to strengthen collective bargaining rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Relyea, at pp. 879-883; see also <em>San Bernardino Public Employees Assn. v. City of Fontana </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1220-1221 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 634].) Thus, it appears that at least as to bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment, an employee organization acts as the employees\u2019 exclusive representative and has a duty of fair representation under the MMBA. (See <em>Jones, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.4th at p. 283; <em>Lane, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d at p. 170.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">We are not persuaded otherwise by plaintiffs\u2019 contention that claims for unpaid wages are not considered unfair labor charges within PERB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. (See <em>California Teachers\u2019 Assn. v. Livingston Union School Dist. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1503, 1510-1519 [269 Cal.Rptr. 160]; <em>California School Employees Assn. v. Azusa Unified School Dist. </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 580, 591-593 [199 Cal.Rptr. 635].) Plaintiffs are not seeking statutorily due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>wages from their employer, but compensation for defendants\u2019 actions in breaching their duty of fair representation. The rule of these cases is not applicable here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Plaintiffs also contend it would be futile to seek a remedy before PERB because they filed this action as a class action and, they argue, public employees may not file unfair practice charges before PERB on behalf of other similarly situated employees. The PERB decisions plaintiffs cite do not support their argument. In <em>Hopper v. United Teachers of Los Angeles </em>(2001) PERB Dec. No. 1441 [25 PERC <em>f </em>32074, pp. 267-268], PERB ruled that a teacher who was not a member of the class she claimed had been harmed had no standing to bring an unfair practice charge. In <em>Thomas v. State of California (Dept. of Corrections) </em>(1993) PERB Dec. No. 972-S [17 PERC 1 24047, pp. 128-129], PERB ruled that an individual unit member did not have standing to pursue violations of the rights of an employee organization, and that such claims were properly brought by the union itself. Neither decision holds that a class action before PERB is impermissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In any case, nothing in the MMBA suggests a party may avoid PERB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction by pleading an action as a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Therefore, we conclude the cause of action for breach of defendants\u2019 duty of fair representation is subject to PERB\u2019s exclusive initial jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">D. <em>Tort Causes of Action</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>IV.

Defendants contend that, because plaintiffs maintained a private right of action for unpaid overtime, the union did not possess the exclusive means by which plaintiffs could obtain this compensation, and defendants therefore did not owe a duty of fair representation in connection with plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to overtime. We leave to PERB the initial determination of whether the actions plaintiffs allege, if proved, in fact constituted a violation of defendants\u2019 duty of fair representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\"> In <em>Trevisanut v. California Union of Safety Employees </em>(1993) PERB Dec. No. 1029-S [18 PERC | 25026, pp. 65-67], PERB concluded that relief should be granted only to the named charging parties in a complaint and not to all affected employees, whether or not joined as parties, but only on the ground that the administrative law judge had denied a request that the case be certified as a class action, and that to grant relief to employees not named as parties would amount to improperly amending the complaint. PERB did not decide or imply that it would have been improper to certify the matter as a class action at the appropriate stage of the proceedings. <em>(Id., </em>18 PERC ][ 25026, at pp. 67-68.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 823.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
