Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (counts 1, 3, and 5), and five counts of assault with a deadly weapon or force likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)) (counts 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With respect to each count and each defendant, the People alleged a gang sentence enhancement (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). As to counts 1, 3, and 5, the People alleged that Rodriguez personally used a dangerous and deadly weapon within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (b)(1). As to counts 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8, the People alleged that Rodriguez personally used a dangerous and deadly weapon within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23). The People also alleged that Rodriguez had suffered a prison prior (\u00a7\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b), 668), a serious felony prior (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1), 668, 1192.7, subd. (c)), and a strike prior (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (b), 668, 1170.12) in connection with an August 2000 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">A jury found Rodriguez guilty of counts 2, 4, 6, and 8. The jury found Rodriguez not guilty of the charged offense in count 7 (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)), but guilty of the lesser offense of simple battery (\u00a7 242) as to that count. With respect to count 8, the jury found that Rodriguez personally used a dangerous and deadly weapon within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23). The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the remainder of the counts and allegations. The trial court declared a mistrial as to counts 1, 3, and 5, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>later dismissed those counts and the balance of the allegations, pursuant to the prosecutor\u2019s motion. After the jury returned its verdicts, Rodriguez admitted having suffered the prior conviction. The trial court sentenced Rodriguez to an aggregate sentence of 13 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On appeal, Rodriguez claims that the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony pertaining to gangs in general, and in particular, in admitting expert testimony concerning the attitudes of gang members toward \u201csnitches.\u201d In addition, Rodriguez contends that the court erred in denying his motion to bifurcate trial of the substantive crimes from the gang enhancement allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We conclude that Rodriguez has forfeited his evidentiary claims by failing to make adequate objections in the trial court and/or by failing to present an adequate argument on appeal. We further conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rodriguez\u2019s motion to bifurcate.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Rodriguez also requests that this court independently review the transcript and the records that the trial court reviewed at its in camera Pitchess<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> hearing, to determine whether the trial court properly denied his motion for discovery of a police detective\u2019s personnel file. As is frequently the case in this court, appellate counsel has failed to ensure that the <em>Pitchess </em>materials are part of die record on appeal. While we have exercised our discretion to order the record on appeal augmented to include the <em>Pitchess </em>materials, we publish a portion of this opinion to remind appellate counsel that it is counsel\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the record is perfected in cases in which a <em>Pitchess </em>claim is raised. On the merits, we conclude the trial court did not err in determining that there were no discoverable materials in the detective\u2019s personnel file.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ai\">A. <em>The June 21, 2008 assaults</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">On June 21, 2008, Marco Hernandez was attending a party in a neighborhood in southeast San Diego known as Shelltown. Hernandez was working on a car with a few other people outside the residence at which the party was being held. Covarrubias, who had nearly gotten into a fight with Hernandez at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>a liquor store the previous day, rode by the residence on a bicycle. Covarrubias was accompanied by two other men, who were also riding bicycles. According to the testimony of San Diego Police Officer Mike Hall, one of the men who was working on the car with Hernandez said that Covarrubias and the other men \u201cmad-dogged\u201d Hernandez and his friends by giving them \u201cdirty looks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Approximately 10 minutes later, Covarrubias returned with a group of about 10 others, including Rodriguez. Rodriguez was armed with a two-by-four piece of wood, and others in the group had knives. Covarrubias challenged Hernandez to a fight. Some members of Covarrubias\u2019s group yelled out \u201c38th Street\u201d and \u201cShelltown 38,\u201d and Covarrubias and Hernandez began to fight (count 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">While Covarrubias and Hernandez were fighting, several of the partygoers came outside the residence. A large melee ensued. George Arciniega was stabbed multiple times (count 2); Jorge Martinez was stabbed three times (count 4); Javier Martinez was punched and stabbed (count 6); and Jacinto Martinez was hit in the head with a piece of wood by a person who a witness described as having \u201c1920\u201d tattooed across his neck (count 8). Rodriguez has such a tattoo. After the stabbings, Covarrubias\u2019s group ran from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">B. <em>Gang-related evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">San Diego Police Detective Greg Pinarelli testified as a gang expert at trial. Pinarelli recounted the history of the Shelltown 38 gang, and stated that the attack occurred on the gang\u2019s turf. Detective Pinarelli described several prior crimes that Shelltown 38 members had committed, for the purpose of proving the existence of the gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Detective Pinarelli also testified concerning gang culture, including gang members\u2019 unwillingness to cooperate with law enforcement, and their willingness to use violence against those who do. Detective Pinarelli testified that gang members achieve status within their gangs by committing crimes on behalf of the gang. In addition, fellow gang members are expected to provide assistance if another member of their gang is involved in an assault. Detective Pinarelli also stated that gangs commit violent acts in order to instill fear in the community, and to boost their status among rival gangs.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Rodriguez is a documented member of the Shelltown 38 gang. In prior contacts with police, Rodriguez admitted his affiliation with Shelltown 38. Rodriguez also has tattoos that reflect his affiliation with the gang, including the number \u201c1920\u201d on his neck. That number represents the 19th letter of the alphabet, \u201cS,\u201d and the 20th letter, \u201cT,\u201d which is an abbreviation for Shelltown.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>in.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">A., B<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">C. <em>The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rodriguez discovery of Detective Pinarelli\u2019s records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Rodriguez requests that this court conduct a review of Detective Pinarelli\u2019s sealed personnel file to determine if the file contains discoverable materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">1. <em>Factual and procedural background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">In the trial court, Rodriguez filed a motion pursuant to <em>Pitchess, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 531, in which he sought discovery of Detective Pinarelli\u2019s personnel records. In his motion, Rodriguez argued that Detective Pinarelli may have \u201ctainted\u201d two eyewitness identifications of Rodriguez \u201cin order to strengthen his case against Mr. Rodriguez.\u201d Rodriguez claimed that Detective Pinarelli harbored a \u201cgrudge\u201d against him based on prior contacts between the two men. The trial court conducted a hearing on the motion. During the hearing, the court concluded that it would review the personnel records in camera \u201cas to evidence of police misconduct along the lines of coercing witnesses to change testimony or something similar.\u201d After reviewing Detective Pinarelli\u2019s personnel records in camera, the court determined that there were no records that were discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">2. <em>Governing law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">a. <em>Discovery of a police officer\u2019s personnel records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaines </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 172, 179 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 627, 205 P.3d 1074], the Supreme Court summarized the manner by which a party may discover evidence in confidential police officer personnel records under <em>Pitchess </em>and its progeny: \u201c[0]n a showing of good cause, a criminal defendant is entitled to discovery of relevant documents or information in the confidential personnel records of a peace officer accused of misconduct against the defendant. [Citation.] Good cause for discovery exists when the defendant shows both \u2018 \u201cmateriality\u201d to the subject matter of the pending litigation and a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that the agency has the type of information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>sought.\u2019 [Citation.] A showing of good cause is measured by \u2018relatively relaxed standards\u2019 that serve to \u2018insure the production\u2019 for trial court review of \u2018all potentially relevant documents.\u2019 [Citation.] If the defendant establishes good cause, the court must review the requested records in camera to determine what information, if any, should be disclosed. [Citation.] Subject to certain statutory exceptions and limitations [citations], \u2018the trial court should then disclose to the defendant \u201csuch information [that] is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending litigation.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On appeal, this court is required to review the \u201crecord of the documents examined by the trial court\u201d and determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to disclose the contents of the officer\u2019s personnel records. <em>(People v. Mooc </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1229 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 482, 36 P.3d 21]; see also <em>People v. Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 330 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432].)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">b. <em>Appellate counsel has a responsibility to ensure that the record is perfected in cases in which a </em>Pitchess <em>claim is raised</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The sealed transcript of a <em>Pitchess </em>hearing and any personnel documents that the trial court reviewed pursuant to a <em>Pitchess </em>motion are not part of the normal appellate record. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.320.) Therefore, to the extent that an appellant\u2019s claim is dependent upon appellate review of the sealed transcript and the confidential personnel documents, appellate counsel is required to apply to the superior court for an order that the record include such materials, pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 8.328(c). In the absence of such an application, the record on appeal will not contain the <em>Pitchess </em>materials, making it impossible for this court to review an appellant\u2019s <em>Pitchess </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">This court has exercised its discretion in this case\u2014as it has had to do in many other cases\u2014to augment the record to include the relevant <em>Pitchess </em>materials, in order to be able to address the issue. However, the failure of counsel to perfect the record delays the processing of cases and wastes judicial resources. Accordingly, we urge appellate counsel to ensure that the record is properly perfected in cases in which a <em>Pitchess </em>claim is raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">3. <em>The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rodriguez discovery of Detective Pinarelli\u2019s personnel file</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">We have examined Detective Pinarelli\u2019s personnel records in camera and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying discovery of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Benke, Acting P.
