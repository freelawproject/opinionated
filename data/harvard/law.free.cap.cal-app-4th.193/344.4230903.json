Code, \u00a7 1695 et seq.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enacted in 1979, is designed to protect homeowners in default against unfair purchases of their home equity. The Act regulates transactions between an equity purchaser and an equity seller resulting in the sale of residential real property in foreclosure. Central to the legislative scheme is the requirement that the agreement between the buyer and seller be in writing and contain specific terms aimed at protecting the homeowner (\u00a7\u00a7 1695.2, 1695.3, 1695.5). <em>(Segura v. McBride </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1034-1036 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 436] <em>(Segura).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>This case arises from a home equity purchase transaction involving plaintiff Daniel J. Capon (plaintiff) and defendants Sidney Gladney (Gladney), Monopoly Game LLC (Monopoly Game), Charles Prael (Prael), and Los Trancos Systems, L.L.C. (Los Trancos) (collectively, defendants). Following a bench trial, the trial court awarded plaintiff a total of $660,625.48 to compensate him for the home equity he lost in the transaction and for the conversion of his personal property. On appeal, defendants challenge the trial court\u2019s findings that the deed recorded on their behalf is void and that they are liable for conversion. Plaintiff cross-appeals, contending the trial court erred in concluding that the underlying sale transaction did not violate HESCA and in failing to hold defendants Prael and Los Trancos jointly and severally liable for a portion of the amount awarded to plaintiff for loss of his home equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In the published portion of this opinion we interpret section 1695.1, subdivision (a)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which exempts from the definition of \u201cequity purchaser\u201d a person who acquires title to a residence in foreclosure \u201c[f]or the purpose of using such property as a personal residence.\u201d We conclude the trial court erred in rejecting plaintiff\u2019s HESCA claim: section 1695.1(a)(1) is inapplicable because, although the trial court found defendant Gladney intended to live in plaintiff\u2019s house, the buyer was defendant Monopoly Game, not Gladney. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude the trial court erred in failing to hold defendants Prael and Los Trancos jointly and severally liable for a portion of plaintiff\u2019s lost home equity. We affirm the court\u2019s rulings that the recorded deed is void and defendants are liable for conversion. We remand for an award of attorney fees to plaintiff under HESCA and entry of an amended judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In 1991, plaintiff purchased a house located on Woodridge Road in Hillsborough, California (the Property), for $1.31 million. Plaintiff lived at the Property with his two sons and later with his wife Miriam Siekevitz (Siekevitz). Plaintiff and Siekevitz encountered financial difficulties that ultimately resulted in a default on a second mortgage on the Property. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>October 2003, a notice of trustee\u2019s sale was recorded, setting November 14, 2003, at 1:00 p.m. as the date and time for the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Gladney is the owner of Monopoly Game; the company\u2019s primary business in November 2003 was the purchase of residential properties in foreclosure. Prael is one of the owners of Los Trancos; in 2003, 75 to 80 percent of Los Trancos\u2019s business was related to foreclosure management.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On or around October 28, 2003, defendants became aware of the scheduled trustee\u2019s sale of the Property. Thereafter, plaintiff was approached by Prael at the County of San Mateo Recorder\u2019s Office. Prael represented that he was familiar with plaintiff\u2019s situation and offered to help him seek refinancing. Prael also came to the Property and left his business card, reiterating that he could help.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">On the morning of November 14, 2003, the date set for the trustee\u2019s sale, Gladney and Prael visited plaintiff and Siekevitz at the Property. Plaintiff and Siekevitz agreed to sell Gladney their equity interest in the Property for $100,000, plus $50,000 if they moved out by December 15. Gladney instructed plaintiff and Siekevitz to go to Alliance Title Company in San Jose to complete the paperwork for the transaction. Plaintiff and Siekevitz signed a one-page \u201cAgreement to Sell Real Property\u201d (Agreement), a grant deed in favor of Monopoly Game (Deed), and a document entitled \u201cEstoppel Affidavit.\u201d The Agreement was backdated to October 29, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The Deed, as executed by plaintiff and Siekevitz, purported to convey real property located in the \u201cCity of San Mateo,\u201d did not contain a street address or other description of the Property, and referenced a parcel number that is not the correct parcel number for the Property. Subsequently, the Deed was altered to change a reference from \u201cSan Mateo\u201d to \u201cHillsborough\u201d and to attach a new second page describing the Property (Altered Deed). Neither plaintiff nor Siekevitz consented to the alterations. The Altered Deed was recorded on December 3, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Subsequently, Monopoly Game sold the Property to David Salma (Salma) for over $1.5 million; the sale netted Monopoly Game over $300,000. For services related to the Property, Los Trancos was paid $70,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">As relevant to plaintiff\u2019s conversion claim, at some point after sale of the Property to Monopoly Game, Gladney suggested to Siekevitz that she apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>for a restraining order against plaintiff; Gladney\u2019s lawyer provided the paperwork to Siekevitz. On December 10, 2003, two plainclothes police officers came to the Property and told plaintiff he had to leave. When plaintiff refused, he was arrested pursuant to the restraining order. The next day, plaintiff was allowed to return for 10 minutes with Staci Adams (Adams), who also lived at the Property, to gather what he could of his belongings. Most of plaintiff\u2019s belongings remained at the Property after that visit, including a $28,000 antique oriental rug and scientific equipment that plaintiff testified was worth more than $1 million. Adams testified that Prael told her that he would deliver her and plaintiff\u2019s remaining belongings to a warehouse. Prael failed to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">On December 15, 2003, Siekevitz turned over to Gladney her keys to the Property. On December 17, Prael and workmen began removing plaintiff\u2019s personal property under instructions from Gladney to remove it all by December 19. Prael donated some of plaintiff\u2019s belongings and some of the scientific equipment; he valued the donations at $325,745. Prael disposed of nearly everything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Prior to filing the instant action, plaintiff recorded a notice of rescission under section 1695.14 of HESCA, seeking return of the Property. On December 2, 2005, plaintiff filed the present lawsuit against, among others, defendants and Salma (who purchased the Property from Monopoly Game). The complaint asserted 12 causes of action: (1) rescission under HESCA; (2) damages for violation of HESCA; (3) declaratory relief; (4) quiet title; (5) breach of contract; (6) fraud; (7) deceit; (8) conversion; (9) unjust enrichment; (10) civil conspiracy; (11) unfair business practices within the meaning of Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.; and (12) injunctive relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The trial court conducted a bench trial and in February 2009 the court issued its final statement of decision and judgment. The court ruled in favor of plaintiff on the causes of action for declaratory relief, unjust enrichment, and unfair business practices, finding the Altered Deed was void <em>ab initio </em>because it lacked a legally sufficient property description when executed and was rendered a forgery when it was altered. As restitution, th\u00e9 trial court awarded plaintiff $306,880.48 (Monopoly Game\u2019s profits from resale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Property).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Monopoly Game and Gladney were found jointly and severally liable for that amount, based upon the court\u2019s finding of alter ego status between them. The court did not hold Prael and Los Trancos liable for the $70,000 of the proceeds that they received from Monopoly Game.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The trial court also ruled in favor of plaintiff on the cause of action for conversion, finding that defendants had taken and disposed of plaintiff\u2019s personal property without his consent. The court awarded damages of $353,745, including $325,745 for plaintiff\u2019s scientific equipment and $28,000 for an antique oriental rug.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The trial court concluded the causes of action for rescission, quiet title, and injunctive relief were moot based upon plaintiff\u2019s settlement with Salma and plaintiff\u2019s reacquisition of the Property at a foreclosure sale in April 2008. The trial court found in favor of defendants on the causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, deceit, and civil conspiracy. With respect to the claim for damages under section 1695.7 of HESCA, the court found the Property was a \u201c \u2018[Residence in foreclosure\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of section 1695.1, subdivision (b) and the Agreement failed \u201cto comply with the Act in a variety of respects.\u201d However, notwithstanding the fact that Monopoly Game acquired title to the Property, the trial court found applicable an exception from the requirements of HESCA: under section 1695.1(a)(1), Monopoly Game was not an \u201cequity purchaser\u201d because Gladney intended to use the Property as a \u201cpersonal residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Defendants appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment and plaintiff filed a cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">I. <em>The Trial Court Erred in Rejecting Plaintiff\u2019s HESCA Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">In enacting HESCA, \u201c[t]he Legislature recognized that the equity value of a residence, often a homeowner\u2019s most significant financial asset, could be lost to a third party purchaser whenever a homeowner facing foreclosure succumbed to a proposal to sell his or her home for a fraction of its value.\u201d <em>(Segura, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1034-1035.) The Act requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>a written agreement between an equity purchaser and an equity seller and specifies that the contract \u201cinclude the total consideration given, terms of payment and terms of any rental agreement; a conspicuous statement of the right to cancel within five business days or until 8 a.m. on the day scheduled for foreclosure, with an attached notice of cancellation; and a conspicuous notice that until the right to cancel has ended, the equity purchaser cannot ask the seller to sign a deed or any other document. (\u00a7\u00a7 1695.3-1695.5.) The equity purchaser must provide, and complete, the contract in conformity with these terms. (\u00a7 1695.6, subd. (a).)\u201d (Segura, at p. 1035; see also <em>Spencer v. Marshall </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 783, 793-795 [85 Cal.Rptr.3d 752] <em>(Spencer).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s second cause of action seeks damages and an award of attorney fees under section 1695.7 based on allegations that defendants\u2019 purchase of the Property violated HESCA in various respects.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court found the Property was a \u201c \u2018[residence in foreclosure\u2019 \u201d under section 1695.1, subdivision (b) and \u201con its face the . . . Agreement does not comply with the Act in a variety of respects.\u201d The court continued, \u201cThus, if the Act applied, the . . . Agreement would have violated th[e] Act, and [defendants would be liable for damages equal to any loss of the home equity which [p]laintiff possessed as of November 14, 2003.\u201d Those findings are undisputed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">For purposes of HESCA, an \u201c \u2018[e]quity purchaser\u2019 means any person who acquires title to any residence in foreclosure . . . ,\u201d subject to certain specified exceptions. (\u00a7 1695.1(a).) The trial court concluded that the exception contained in section 1695.1(a)(1) applies because Monopoly Game acquired title for the purpose of Gladney using the Property as his personal residence. The court rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that the fact that Monopoly Game acquired title, rather than Gladney, made the exception inapplicable, reasoning \u201c[t]he evidence at trial established that Monopoly Game . . . and . . . Gladney were and are alter-egos of each other, such that. . . Gladney may benefit from the safe harbor established by section 1695(a)(1) despite the form of the . . . Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In determining whether defendants\u2019 conduct violated the Act, \u201cwe apply well-established rules of statutory construction. The goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>[Citation.] Often, the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent. [Citation.] However, when the statutory language is itself ambiguous, we must examine the context in which the language appears, adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cWhen the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation ... we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rothschild </em>v. <em>Tyco Internat. (US), Inc. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 488, 496 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 721].) When, as here, \u201ca statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations, the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed [citation].\u201d <em>(Lungren v. Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) We review the trial court\u2019s decision on statutory interpretation de novo. <em>(People ex rel. Lockyer v. Shamrock Foods Co. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 415, 432 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 11 P.3d 956].)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The relevant statutory language exempts from the definition of an \u201cequity purchaser\u201d a person who acquires title to a residence in foreclosure \u201c[f|or the purpose of using such property as a personal residence.\u201d (\u00a7 1695.1(a)(1).) Plaintiff contends that, in order to fall within the scope of the exception, the person who acquires title must be the same person who intends to use the property as a residence; defendants contend that the person acquiring title and the person who will reside in the property need not be the same. The statutory language is ambiguous. The phrasing, \u201cacquires ... for the purpose of using,\u201d seems to suggest that the person who acquires title must also be the person who will use the property as a residence, because one who acquires title to a property and allows another to reside in it is arguably not \u201cusing such property as a personal residence.\u201d (\u00a7 1695.1(a); see <em>Spencer, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.4th at p. 797 [in dicta, describing exception as applying to property \u201cpurchased for one\u2019s own personal residence\u201d].) On the other hand, in this case Monopoly Game arguably bought the Property \u201cfor the purpose of using\u201d it as a residence for Gladney. In effect, defendants contend the Legislature meant to exempt both the circumstance in which a person acquires title for his or her residential use, as well as the circumstance in which a person acquires title for residential use by another.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Because the language of the statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, we look to extrinsic aids, such as the legislative purpose and legislative history. In enacting HESCA, the Legislature set forth detailed findings and statements of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Section 1695, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cThe Legislature finds and declares that homeowners whose residences are in foreclosure have been subjected to fraud, deception, and unfair dealing by home equity purchasers. The recent rapid escalation of home values, particularly in the urban areas, has resulted in a significant increase in home equities which are usually the greatest financial asset held by the homeowners of this state. During the time period between the commencement of foreclosure proceedings and the scheduled foreclosure sale date, homeowners in financial distress, especially the poor, elderly, and financially unsophisticated, are vulnerable to the importunities of equity purchasers who induce homeowners to sell their homes for a small fraction of their fair market values through the use of schemes which often involve oral and written misrepresentations, deceit, intimidation, and other unreasonable commercial practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Section 1695, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cThe Legislature declares that it is the express policy of the state to preserve and guard the precious asset of home equity, and the social as well as the economic value of homeownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Section 1695, subdivision (c) provides: \u201cThe Legislature further finds that equity purchasers have a significant impact upon the economy and well-being of this state and its local communities, and therefore the provisions of this chapter are necessary to promote the public welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Finally, section 1695, subdivision (d) provides: \u201cThe intent and purposes of this chapter are the following: [f] (1) To provide each homeowner with information necessary to make an informed and intelligent decision regarding the sale of his or her home to an equity purchaser; to require that the sales agreement be expressed in writing; to safeguard the public against deceit and financial hardship; to [ejnsure, foster, and encourage fair dealing in the sale and purchase of homes in foreclosure; to prohibit representations that tend to mislead; to prohibit or restrict unfair contract terms; to afford homeowners a reasonable and meaningful opportunity to rescind sales to equity purchasers; and to preserve and protect home equities for the homeowners of this state. [|] (2) This chapter shall be liberally construed to effectuate this intent and to achieve these purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The Act applies to any transaction under which a person acquires title to a residence in foreclosure, <em>unless </em>the transaction falls within the scope of one of the listed exceptions. <em>(Segura, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1037.) Although there is no legislative history on point,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the exceptions appear to reflect a legislative judgment that the specified transactions present lesser concerns regarding the \u201cfraud, deception, and unfair dealing\u201d (\u00a7 1695, subd. (a)) that motivated enactment of the Act. Thus, the other transactions exempted from the Act involve circumstances where the homeowner is protected by statutory procedures or title is acquired by a court judgment (\u00a7 1695.1(a)(3)\u2014(5)), where the acquisition of title is \u201cin lieu of foreclosure\u201d (\u00a7 1695.1(a)(2)), or where the homeowner is a close relative of the person acquiring title (\u00a7 1695.1(a)(6)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the exception is the more reasonable one. Defendants\u2019 broad interpretation would exempt from the requirements of the Act not only a transaction where a company acquires title for residential use by an alter ego, but also a transaction where a company acquires title for residential use by any other person, including residential use by a renter. The only type of transaction that would <em>not </em>be exempted is one where the person acquiring title did not intend to \u201cuse\u201d the property at all, but only intended to resell it. Defendants\u2019 interpretation would present more opportunity for misuse of the exception, because it would permit persons in the business of home equity purchasing to structure transactions to come within the scope of the exception. This is particularly true because the exception does not mandate personal residential use for any particular period of time, so companies could acquire title to properties under the color of the section 1695.1(a)(1) exception, and then resell them after \u201cusing\u201d them residentially for a relatively short period of time. Application of the exception in this case would be particularly ironic, because Monopoly Game, which is in the business of home equity purchasing, is the \u201carchetypal\u201d purchaser targeted by the Act. <em>(Segura, supra, 5 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1037.) The Legislature at the very least intended to regulate the transactions of such companies. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s interpretation limits the exception to the circumstance that presents the least potential for fraud\u2014where the person who acquires title and the person who will reside in the property are one and the same. In light of the legislative directive to construe the Act liberally to protect homeowners in foreclosure (\u00a7 1695, subd. (d)(2)), it is appropriate to construe the exceptions narrowly. <em>(Spencer, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.4th at p. 798 [\u201cwe narrowly construe the exceptions\u201d].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Construing the section 1695.1(a)(1) exception narrowly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>furthers the Legislature\u2019s intent \u201cto safeguard the home equities of California homeowners; encourage fair dealing in the sale of distressed residences; restrict unfair contract terms; provide homeowners with the necessary information to make an intelligent decision about selling their home; and afford them meaningful opportunity to rescind. (\u00a7 1695, subd. (d)(1).)\u201d <em>(Segura, supra, 5 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1037.) The construction we adopt does not undermine the Legislature\u2019s intent to exempt purchasers who intend to reside in the properties acquired, because such persons can bring themselves within the scope of the exception by acquiring title in their own names.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The trial court concluded that this transaction fit within section 1695.1(a)(1) because Gladney intended to reside in the property and Monopoly Game is the alter ego of Gladney. This was an improper application of the alter ego doctrine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Communist Party v. 522 Valencia, Inc. </em>(1995) 35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Cal.App.4th 980 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 618] <em>(Communist </em>Party) explained that doctrine as follows; \u201cOrdinarily, a corporation is regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from its stockholders, officers and directors. Under the alter ego doctrine, however, where a corporation is used by an individual or individuals, or by another corporation, to perpetrate fraud, circumvent a statute, or accomplish some other wrongful or inequitable purpose, a court may disregard the corporate entity and treat the corporation\u2019s acts as if they were done by the persons actually controlling the corporation. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 993.) In the present case, however, the trial court used the alter ego doctrine to <em>shield </em>defendants from liability under HESCA. \u201c[A]lter ego is used to prevent a corporation from using its statutory separate corporate form as a shield from liability only where to recognize its corporate status would defeat the rights and equities of third parties; it is not a doctrine that allows the persons who actually control the corporation to disregard the corporate form.\u201d <em>(Communist Party, </em>at p. 994; see also <em>Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 248, 257-258 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 419] <em>(Brooklyn Navy Yard) </em>[to justify application of the alter ego doctrine, it must be shown that \u201c \u2018inequitable results will follow if the corporate separateness is respected\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Opp </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

[Citations.]\u201d].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The trial court did not identify in its statement of decision, and defendants have not identified on appeal, any inequitable results that would follow from rejecting defendants\u2019 attempt to disregard the legal separateness of Monopoly Game. (See <em>Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 301 [216 Cal.Rptr. 443, 702 P.2d 601] [\u201cthe corporate form will be disregarded only in narrowly defined circumstances and only when the ends of justice so require\u201d]; <em>Brooklyn Navy Yard, supra, 60 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 259 [\u201csome cases have allowed corporations to disavow the corporate form where doing so prevents injustice\u201d].) Neither have defendants cited any cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>supporting their attempt to employ the alter ego doctrine to establish a relationship of identity between two defendants, in order to impute the intent or actions of one to the other and to allow both to avoid liability under a statutory safe harbor. The trial court erred in concluding that the alter ego doctrine rendered the section 1695.1(a)(1) exception applicable in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Based on other causes of action, the trial court ordered defendants Monopoly Game and Gladney to pay plaintiff $306,880.48, \u201crestoring [plaintiff\u2019s] equity in the Property which Monopoly Game . . . obtained on or near December 18, 2003,\u201d the date of the sale of Property to Salma. Plaintiff does not contend he is entitled to greater damages for the HESCA violation, under which the lost equity would be valued at the date of transfer to Monopoly Game on November 14, 2003. <em>(Segura, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1038-1039.) Thus, our conclusion that the court erred in denying plaintiff\u2019s HESCA claim does not require recalculation of the damages for loss of plaintiff\u2019s home equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">We are, however, required to remand to the trial court for an award of attorney fees to plaintiff. Section 1695.7 states that \u201cAn equity seller may bring an action for the recovery of damages or other equitable relief against an equity purchaser for a violation of any subdivision of Section 1695.6 or 1695.13. The equity seller shall recover actual damages plus reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u201d (See also <em>Boquilon </em>v. <em>Beckwith </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1697, 1721-1722 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 503].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">II.-IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">This matter is remanded with directions for the trial court to award attorney fees to plaintiff under HESCA and to enter an amended judgment including the award of attorney fees and specifying that Los Trancos is</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>jointly and severally liable for $70,000 of the $306,880.48 awarded to plaintiff as restoration of his lost equity in the Property.

Sess.) (hereafter Senate Bill No. 1128), which enacted HESCA, the state Assembly was considering Assembly Bill No. 827 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) (hereafter Assembly Bill No. 827). A Senate committee analysis described Assembly Bill No. 827 as a \u201c[similar bill\u201d that \u201cwould enact similar provisions, licensing and regulating the activities of persons who deal in residential real property in foreclosure.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1128 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended May, 16, 1979, p. 10.) An Assembly committee analysis stated the provisions of the bills are \u201cnot in conflict.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1128 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 31, 1979, p. 7.) Assembly Bill No. 827 was enacted as Business and Professions Code former sections 11700, 11701 and 11702. (Added by Stats. 1979, ch. 655, \u00a7 2, p. 2016, eff. Sept. 14, 1979, repealed by Stats. 1980, ch. 423, \u00a7 2, p. 834, eff. July 11, 1980.) Business and Professions Code former section 11700, subdivision (b)(1) provided that the enactment did not apply to \u201c[t]he acquisition of property <em>for use as the personal residence of the buyer.\u201d </em>(Stats. 1979, ch. 655, \u00a7 2, p. 2016, italics added.) Although the wording of the exception in Business and Professions Code former section 11700, subdivision (b)(1) is clearer than that in Civil Code section 1695.1(a)(1), we do not believe we can rely on the distinction either to support our narrow interpretation, or as support for a broader construction of the section 1695.1(a)(1) exception. In particular, although the wording of Business and Professions Code former section 11700, subdivision (b)(1) shows one way the Civil Code section 1695.1(a)(1) exception could have been drafted to avoid any ambiguity, there are many wording differences in the statutes enacted by Senate Bill No. 1128 and Assembly Bill No. 827. Nothing in the legislative history of Senate Bill No. 1128, Assembly Bill No. 827, or Assembly Bill No. 2475 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) (hereafter Assembly Bill No. 2475), which repealed Business and Professions Code former sections 11700, 11701 and 11702 and amended Civil Code section 1695.1 (Stats. 1980, ch. 423, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4, pp. 834, 835, eff. July 11, 1980), indicates that the Legislature, in passing Senate Bill No. 1128 or Assembly Bill No. 2475, considered the differences and deliberately selected the wording in section 1695.1(a)(1) rather than that in Business and Professions Code former section 11700, subdivision (b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> \u201c[A] limited liability company is a hybrid business entity formed under the Corporations Code consisting of at least two members who own membership interests.
