The principal assignment of error consists in the allegation that the trial court permitted such errors during the course of the examination on <em>voir dire </em>of one C. H. Chenoweth as to preclude the defendant from having a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">During the cross-examination of such juror the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-12\">\u201cQ. Have you any bias or prejudice against the enforcement of the Prohibition Law, Mr. Chenoweth ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-13\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-14\">. \u201cQ. And is your bias or prejudice against the enforcement of that law such that it would cause -you to be unable to act fairly and impartially between the People of the State of California on the one side and this defendant on the other ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-15\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir; I don\u2019t think it would. As a juror, I would have to consider my oath and weigh the testimony and render a decision accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-16\">\u201cThe Court: Q. But you said, Mr. Chenoweth, that you had a bias against the enforcement of the Prohibition Law ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-17\">\u201cA. Not the enforcement\u2014I didn\u2019t understand it that way. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>\u201cA. I misunderstood that question, or I said nothing against the Prohibition Law, and I have no bias against the enforcement of any law of the country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">\u201cQuestion by Hr. Henderson: Q. You believe in the enforcement, then, of the Prohibition Law, the same as any law that is upon the statute books, Mr. Chenoweth ?\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">\u201cA. Yes,- I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">\u201cQ. But you have a feeling of bias or prejudice against prohibition itself ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">\u201cA. I am against it; yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">Further questions along the same line and then the following :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-10\">\u201cQ. Well, you have a right to not like a law, but when it becomes a law, it is your duty, as a citizen, to believe in the enforcement of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-11\">\u201cA. I do believe in the enforcement of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-12\">\u201cQ. But you answered the question of the district attorney, when he first asked you, that you did not believe in the enforcement of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-13\">\u201cA. Well, I got my tongue twisted. I believe in the enforcement of this law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-14\">\u201cThe Court: You will be excused from jury duty. Any man that don\u2019t believe in the enforcement of the laws of the country is not qualified or fit to sit on the jury, and you will be excused from further duty. You will be excused from further duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-15\">\u201cMr. Russell: We desire to note exception to your Honor\u2019s ruling as to the juror, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-16\">\u201cThe Court: Note your exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-17\">\u201cMr. Russell: Cite it as prejudicial error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-18\">\u201cThe Court: You don\u2019t want any man that don\u2019t believe in the enforcement of the laws? The court will not permit anybody to sit on the jury that will get up and say they don\u2019t believe in the enforcement of the laws of this country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-19\">\u201cMr. Russell: We also take exception to your Honor\u2019s remarks, and assign, them as prejudicial error, having been made in the presence of the jurors or prospective jurors.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-20\">While the testimony shows clearly that no legal reason existed for the summary dismissal of Mr. Chenoweth from further jury duty and, also, further shows that while he was'not in favor of prohibition, or, to put it another way, of the prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>ciple of prohibition, nevertheless he was in favor of the enforcement of the law, and that as a juror he would do his duty. Nevertheless the transcript shows that a jury was finally accepted which was free from any legal disqualifications. The testimony set out in the transcript shows that three witnesses went to the place of business conducted by the defendant called Murphy\u2019s Inn, a roadhouse situated on the Stockton Boulevard some two miles south of the city of Sacramento, and purchased two rounds of drinks consisting of whisky from the defendant. The testimony of the three witnesses is without equivocation, direct, clear and convincing. The defendant went upon the witness-stand and in as few words as possible made formal denial.  Irrespective of what the trial court may have said upon the examination of the proposed juror as herein set forth, it is scarcely conceivable that the- jury would have brought in any other verdict than the one which was returned. Any other verdict under the testimony set out in the transcript would have been a clear miscarriage of justice. This being the case, the remarks of the court and the dismissal of the juror Chenoweth from further service cannot be held to have been prejudicial to the rights of the defendant, though it may be admitted that such comments ought not to be made by a trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Upon cross-examination of the defendant the district attorney was -permitted to ask a number of questions the objections to which should have been sustained as not being within the purview of direct examination, but those questions were mainly directed to immaterial matters, and in view of the testimony to which we have referred, afford no ground for reversal herein. Being of the opinion that there has been no miscarriage of justice in this case, irrespective of the errors committed, the judgment and order of the trial court will be and the same are hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Hart, J., and Finch, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
