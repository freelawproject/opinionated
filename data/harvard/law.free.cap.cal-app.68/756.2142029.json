J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ4\">The defendant was convicted of the offense of practicing medicine without a license. This appeal is from the judgment of conviction and the order denying his motion for a new trial. The cause is submitted on the appellant\u2019s opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-13\">The ground urged for a reversal is that the evidence does not show that the defendant was engaged in the practice of medicine but only that he was engaged in the sale of herbs. Several persons who had been treated by the defendant for various ailments testified for -the prosecution. The following excerpts from the testimony of the first witness examined shows the character of proof presented. \u201cQ. Whom did you see when you went to' the office of Poo On ? A.
