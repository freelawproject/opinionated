App. 217 [227 Pac. 621], <em>People </em>v. <em>French, </em>61 Cal. App. 275 [214 Pac. 1003], <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>61 Cal. App. 280 [214 Pac. 1005], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>67 Cal. App. 680 [228 Pac. 357]. All of these cases and the case at bar show that the defendants were taken from Folsom to different road camps, placed in charge of guards, and Avhile at work upon the highway, effected their escape. Under these circumstances, it was held that the superior court of the county of Sacramento had jurisdiction, and that also all the points raised in this case for reversal are without merit. Upon authority of the cases cited, judgment and orders of the trial court in this case are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Hart, J., and Finch, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
