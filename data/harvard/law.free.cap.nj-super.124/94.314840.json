(B. </em>4:40-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">Plaintiff, a steam pressing appliance dealer, instituted this action demanding $1,650 which represented the unpaid balance on two contracts for the sale of used and rebuilt machinery to defendant, a custom tailor. The form complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>contained the four counts usually found in District Court actions of this type <em>i. e. </em>1) book account; <em>2) </em>goods sold and delivered; 3) reasonable value of goods sold and delivered; and 4) account stated. (A fifth count was added seeking the recovery of $300 on a check issued to plaintiff by defendant which was not paid because of insufficient funds.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Defendant, in his answer, generally denied the allegations of the complaint and asserted five separate defenses \u2014 1) Statute of Frauds; <em>2) </em>lack of consideration; 3) breach of express and implied warranties of merchantibility; 4) that the services rendered by the plaintiff in connection with the sale of the goods was not performed in a workmanlike manner; and 5) breach of contract. Defendant in two counts counterclaimed for damages, essentially urging breach of express and implied warranties of merchantibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The factual background of the dispute was that in December 1969 plaintiff sold to defendant a pressing machine, boiler, iron and condensation unit for an agreed price of $1,900. In February 1970 plaintiff sold to and installed for defendant a sleeve-blocking machine for an agreed price of $500. Defendant made a payment on the contract in October 1970 of $400 and a second payment in February 1971 of $400. In June of 1971, approximately eighteen months after the first transaction, a third payment of $300 was tendered by check but it was not honored because of insufficient funds, whereupon plaintiff filed his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Plaintiff testified that he made normal maintenance calls during the first year the equipment was installed in defendant\u2019s shop and that there were no claims that the equipment was not functioning with the exception of a specific complaint and problem relating to a malfunctioning pilot light in the boiler. Defendant on the other hand testified that he had constant trouble with the equipment and that it only worked for a few days over the two-year period generating constant calls by him to plaintiff\u2019s office to complain. Without specifying dates, defendant testified that he offered to return the machine a few times when he \u201cwas tired\u201d of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>A defense witness, Dartley, who for many years had operated a cleaning establishment and who had done pressing work for defendant opined that the rebuilt equipment was totally inadequate \u2014 that the pressing machine was bulky and probably more than twenty years old. He further testified that defendant was required to have him assist in his pressing work and that for a time Dartley\u2019s bill to defendant was between $7.50 and $10 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">At the close of the proofs, the Court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss the counterclaim but permitted the jury to consider as a defense to plaintiff\u2019s action for the unpaid balance, defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In its instructions to the jury the court gave them the option of an \u201call or nothing\u201d choice of verdicts, advising them that if they found the plaintiff had preponderated, he would be entitled to \u201cone lump sum\u201d and that on the other hand if they found that the plaintiff had not \u201cprovided a preponderance of legal evidence\u201d they were to return a verdict fox the defendant of \u201cno cause for action.\u201d The jurors during deliberations asked for a clarification as to what rule would be applicable if they voted \u201cno cause for action\u201d or if they voted for the plaintiff. The court in response to the question instructed them that they would return a verdict for the plaintiff for the total amount due of $1,650, or if on the other hand they found \u201cno cause for action\u201d, the plaintiff would not be entitled to \u201cany funds\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">We are satisfied that the trial court committed error in the manner in which it structured the causes of action and articulated them to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The record clearly supports plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant did not reject the goods involved nor effectively cancel <em>the </em>contract and accordingly is liable to plaintiff for the unpaid balance of the contract price. However, rejection is not a prerequisite to an action by a buyer for damages for breach of warranty. All that is required where goods have been accepted, see <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:2-714, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>notification to t)ae seller \u201cwithin a reasonable time after [the buyer] discovers or should have discovered [the breach].\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:2-607(3) (a). Here the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that such notification had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The transactions between the parties here were governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, the pertinent portions being \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\"><em>N.

No factual issues were generated on the issue of reasonable value and consideration. Significantly, the counterclaim in its two counts does not seek recission or cancellation of the contract hut rather money damages on the basis of breach of warranty. <em>Cf. Hydride v. Mehlman's, Inc., </em>253 <em>S. C. </em>652, 172 <em>S. E. </em>2d 824 (1970); Annot., 17 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 1010, 1085 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">Defendant-buyer\u2019s remedy is found in <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>12A :2~ 715 <em>i. e. </em>for specific damages flowing from breach of warranty, <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>358 (1960); <em>Rudolph v. Huckman, </em>267 <em>A. </em>2d 896 (Del. Super. 1970), and the issues raised by the counterclaim should have been presented to the jury for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">Our determination that plaintiff had made out a case for recovery of the balance of the purchase price does not call for the entry of judgment in his favor for that amount. Since the trial court erred in striking defendant\u2019s counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>claim for damages for breach of contract, there will have to be a new trial on the issues raised by the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
