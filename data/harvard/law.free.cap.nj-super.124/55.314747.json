J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AKn\">Petitioner appeals from a judgment of the Division of Tax Appeals which affirmed the determination of the Sales Tax Bureau of the Division of Taxation that petitioner was obligated, under the provisions of the Sales and Hse Tax Act, <em>L. </em>1966, c. 30; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-1 <em>et seq. </em>(the act), to pay, for the period from July 1, 1966 to December 31, 1968, sales taxes totalling $27,589.45 (besides penalties and interest) on rentals it had paid for leased road building equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">The essential facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">Subsequent to the effective date of the act, July 1, 1966, petitioner, a road building contractor, had entered into a contract with the Port of New York Authority for the construction of a highway in the \u201cPort of New Jersey.\u201d It leased from \u201cFurnival,\u201d a Pennsylvania company, equipment used \u201cfor the purpose of moving sand.\u201d The leased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>equipment, which petitioner used only in performance of the Port Authority contract, was operated by persons employed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Petitioner\u2019s primary contention is that the rentals paid by it for construction equipment used in performance of its contract with the Port Authority are exempted from taxation by the provisions of section 8(w), <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-8(w), a paragraph added to the original act, prior to its effective date, by <em>L. </em>1966, c. 53. In addition, it contends that \"a lease of construction 'equipment\u2019 is not a 'retail sale\u2019 within the ambit of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-2 and is therefore not taxable under the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-3.\u201d We shall consider the contentions in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The act, insofar as here pertinent, imposes a tax at specified rates upon \"the receipts from every retail sale of tangible personal property, except as otherwise provided in this act.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The words used in the quoted clause are defined in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-2 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">Unless the context in which they occur requires otherwise, the following terms when used in this act shall mean:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_R\">[Eor purposes of clarity, we deviate from the sequence of definitions appearing in the section.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">* * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">(g) Tangible personal property. Corporeal personal property of any nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">(f) Sale, selling or purchase. Any transfer of title or possession or both, exchange or barter, <em>rental, lease </em>or license to use or consume, conditional or otherwise, in any manner or by any means whatsoever for a consideration, or any agreement therefor, including the rendering of any service, taxable under this act, for a consideration or any agreement therefor. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">(e) Retail sale. (1) A sale of tangible personal property to any person for any purpose, other than (A) for resale either as such o\u00edas converted into or as a component part of a product produced for sale by the purchaser, or (B) for use by that person in performing the services subject to tax under subsection (b) of section 3 [2V. <em>J. S. A. </em>54:32B-3] where the property so sold becomes a physical component part of the property upon which the services are performed or where the property so sold is later actually transferred to the purchaser of the service in conjunction with the performance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>service subject to tax. For the purposes of this act, sales of tangible personal property lo all contractors, subcontractors or repairmen of materials and supplies for use by them in erecting structures for others, or building on, or otherwise improving, altering or repairing real property of others are deemed to be retail sales.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">(2) The term retail sales does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">[The exclusions are not pertinent to this case.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">(d) Receipt. The amount of the sales price of any property and the charge for any service taxable under this act, valued in money, whether received in money or otherwise :l\" * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">It is immediately evident that there is no substance to petitioner\u2019s contention that \u201ca lease of construction \u2018equipment\u2019 is not a \u2018retail sale\u2019 within the ambit of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Construction equipment is \u201ccorporeal personal property\u201d and hence is to bo deemed \u201ctanglible personal property\u201d within the meaning of the act. By the express provisions of paragraph (f), the rental or lease of such tangible personal property is a \u201csale.\u201d Eurther, since the transaction did not fall within any of the exclusions listed in paragraph (e) from the statutory definition of \u201cretail sale\u201d \u2014\u201ca sale of tangible personal property to any person for any purpose\u201d \u2014 the lease transaction here involved constituted a \u201cretail sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">The receipts therefrom, the rental paid, were therefore taxable under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-3 unless, as petitioner also contends, the receipts were exempted from taxation by <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>54:32B-8(w) which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">(w) Sales made to contractors, subcontractors or repairmen of materials, supplies or services for exclusive use in erecting structures, or building on, or otherwise improving, altering or repairing real property of organizations described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 9 of this act, provided any person seeking to qualify for this exemption shall do so pursuant to such rules and regulations and upon such forms as shall be prescribed by the director.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">The Port of New York Authority is one of the organizations referred to in section 9(a) of the act <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-9).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The Sales Tax Bureau, in rejecting petitioner\u2019s claim to an exemption, followed regulations which had theretofore been adopted by the Director of the Division of Taxation \u201cto clarify the application of the Sales and Use Tax Act * * * to the building and construction trade and related activities.\u201d See <em>N. J. A. C. </em>18:24-5.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Pertinent are the following definitions set forth in <em>N. J. A. C. </em>18:24-5.2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201cConstruction equipment\u201d means any vehicle, machine, tool, implement or other device used by a contractor in erecting structures for others, or building on, or otherwise improving, altering, or repairing property of others, which does not become a physical component part of the property upon which work is performed, and which is not necessarily consumed in the performance of such work. Construction equipment includes, but is not limited to, grading, lifting and excavating vehicles, compressors, scaffolds, forms, hand tools and ladders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201cConstruction materials\u201d means items of tangible personal property purchased by a contractor for incorporation into property as a physical component part of such property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">\u201cConstruction supplies\u201d means items of tangible personal property consumed in the fulfillment of a construction contract, which items do not become a physical component part of the property upon which work is performed. Supplies include, but are not limited to lubricants, cleaning compounds, polyethylene covers, rock salt and rope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Further, <em>N. J. A. C. </em>18:24 \u2014 5.4 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">The purchase, rental or use of equipment by a contractor is subject to tax, whether or not the equipment is purchased, rented or used in fulfillment of a contract with an exempt organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Petitioner contends that the regulations constitute an impermissible dilution of the exemption granted by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-8(w). It argued before the Division of Tax Appeals, and argues to us, that since it used the leased construction equipment exclusively in the performance of its road construction contract with the Port Authority, the lease constituted an exempt sale under the express language of the statutory section exempting sales to contractors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u201cmaterials, supplies or services for exclusive use in * * * improving [or] altering real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We are sa\u00fasfied, however, as was the Division of Tax Appeals, that the construction equipment here involved is not embraced within the reference in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B\u2014 8(w) to \u201cmaterials, supplies or services\u201d and hence that the transaction floes not qualify for the exemption claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"> Statutes granting exemption from taxation \u201care most strongly construed against those claiming exemption.\u201d <em>Bloomfield v. Academy of Medicine of N. J., 47 N. J. </em>358, 363 (1966). Eurther, it is evident that the Legislature did not intend to exempt all tangible personal property sold to contractors for exclusive use in improving, altering or repairing real property owned by exempt organizations. It chose to exempt only a limited class of such tangible personal property, \u201cmaterials and supplies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">We are not persuaded by petitioner\u2019s assertion that the word \u201cmaterials\u201d used in paragraph (w) was intended to encompass construction equipment. When the Legislature intended to exempt sales of equipment, it expressly referred to \u201cequipment.\u201d See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-8 (in) (1) (deleted by <em>L. </em>1970, c. <em>7) </em>and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:32B-8(m) (2). <em>Cf. Oldfield v. New Jersey Realty Co., </em>1 <em>N. J. </em>63, 69 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Moreover, even if the construction equipment here involved were to be deemed \u201cmaterials,\u201d it would not qualify for the exemption claimed. The exemption provision requires that the materials purchased or leased be \u201cfor exclusive use in creeling structures or building on, or otherwise improving, altering or repairing real property\u201d of exempt organizations. The reference to \u201cexclusive use\u201d relates to the use and disposition to he made of the materials and not to the identity of the seller or purchaser or the particular form of contractual arrangement, be it sale or lease, by which the user acquired possession thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Materials and supplies to he incorporated in the structure or consumed in the course of construction are for \u201cexclusive use\u201d in such construction. On the other hand, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>materials or supplies will be still available for use after the construction for the exempt organization is completed, they do not qualify as materials and supplies for exclusive use in the construction for the exempt organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Here, once the contract with the Port Authority was completed, the equipment was available for use, as it had been prior thereto, for the purpose of moving sand on other construction contracts. It matters not that petitioner, instead of purchasing sand moving equipment which would remain available for use on other construction contracts after the Port Authority contract was completed \u2014 and hence would not qualify for exemption \u2014 elected instead to lease the equipment for a limited period, the duration of the Port Authority contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">As far as liability for a sales and use tax is concerned, the only difference between a sales and a lease transaction relates to the amount of tax payable. Had the equipment been purchased, the sales and use tax payable would have been a percentage of the full purchase price instead of a percentage of the rental paid for the limited period.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The judgment of the Division of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
