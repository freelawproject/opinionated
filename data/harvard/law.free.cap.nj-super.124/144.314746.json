D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ase\">Defendant appeals from an order extraditing him to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for service there of a sentence to a term of <em>l\u00f3y\u00ed </em>to 31 years for various crimes. On or about June 22, 1964 defendant James Parsells was convicted in the Atlantic County Criminal Court of breaking and entering and sentenced to th\u00b0 New Jersey State Prison for a term of not less than five nor more than seven years. On June 4, 1965 he began serving his sentence and was subsequently paroled on December 19, 1967. Parole was revoked on July 15, 1968, apparently in light of defendant\u2019s further conviction on or about May 0, 1967 on a charge of petit larceny in the same court. The record is unclear as to whether defendant was then incarcerated and served the remainder of his term or that he was again paroled. The latter is more probable (in light of the length of his original sentence), for on February 11, 1970 he was arrested in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and charged with a number of offenses, including burglary, larceny, receiving stolen goods, possession of dangerous drugs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>possession of burglary tools and conspiracy, among others. Bail having been set and later revoked, defendant was placed in the Delaware County (Pennsylvania) jail. On February 2, 1971 Parsells was tried before a jury on the above offenses and convicted three days later on February 5, 1971. Thereafter, on March 10, 1971 the Governor of New Jersey issued a requisition warrant to the Governor of Pennsylvania pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:160-1 <em>et seq. </em>On April 5, 1971 defendant' was sentenced in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County to a term of 15J^ to 31 years in the Pennsylvania State Prison and, as stated in defendant\u2019s brief, immediately thereafter extradited to New Jersey for service of his sentence as a parole violator. Defendant began serving his sentence in New Jersey during April 1971, continuing until April 28, 1972. Prior to defendant\u2019s release from the New Jersey State Prison a \u201cdetainer\u201d was filed there by Pennsylvania authorities for return of defendant to that jurisdiction. Un July 28, 1972 the .date scheduled for defendant\u2019s release from State Prison, he and -counsel appeared before the Superior Court, Law Division, Mercer County, to move for a formal extradition hearing. Upon the court\u2019s assurance that such a hearing would be required in any event prior to defendant being' extradited, the motion was withdrawn. Based upon the \u201cdetainer\u201d both the State and defense counsel considered that the proper place for defendant was in the county jail pending an application from Pennsylvania authorities for extradition. Defendant was then incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">On August 3, 1972 the Governor of Pennsylvania issued a requisition warrant requesting the apprehension and delivery of Parsells to Pennsylvania authorities to begin serving his sentence previously imposed. That request was granted on August 16, 1972, commanding that defendant be arrested and delivered to named Pennsylvania agents. Thereafter, on September 19 and 28, 1972 a hearing was held on defendant\u2019s- motion to vacate the Pennsylvania requisition and New Jersey extradition order. By letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>opinion, dated October 6, 1972, the motion was denied. On October 24, 1972 a final hearing was had on the issues, after which defendant was ordered to be extradited to Pennsylvania. A stay of judgment was granted by the Appellate Division pending a hearing before the entire panel. On November 10, 1972 a permanent stay was granted pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">On appeal defendant makes the following contentions: (a) Pennsylvania has waived its jurisdiction over the defendant and now cannot demand his return; (b) since defendant was neither arrested in New Jersey under a new complaint nor upon an information without a warrant, the proceedings below are without legal effect; (c) since no agent from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appeared within 30 days of defendant\u2019s incarceration, ho should be discharged, and (d) no proof was offered below that defendant was in Pennsylvania on February 9, 1970, the date of the alleged crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Defendant contends that at the time he was released by the Pennsylvania authorities he was in custody in that state and his release amounted to a waiver by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of the remaining part of his sentence \u2014 \u201cin effect,\u201d as said in <em>Golla v. State, </em>52 <em>Del. </em>433, 159 <em>A. </em>2d 585 (Sup. Ct. 1960), \u201ca commutation of sentence.\u201d His principal reliance is upon the case of <em>People ex rel. Barrett v. Bartley, </em>383 <em>Ill. </em>437, 50 <em>N. E. </em>2d 517 (Sup. Ct. 1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\"><em>Barrett </em>does indeed hold that where a prisoner serving a sentence is extradited as a fugitive from justice and delivered to another state, jurisdiction over his person is forever waived by the asylum state. The trial court here distinguished <em>Barrett </em>and also <em>People ex rel. O\u2019Connor v. Bensinger, </em>48 <em>Ill. </em>2d 440, 270 <em>N. E. </em>2d 1 (Sup. Ct. 1971), on the ground that in those cases the prisoners were extradited <em>while serving their sentences, </em>while defendant Par-sells, said the trial court, was \u201ctransferred <em>before </em>he began service of his sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>We disagree with the distinctions made by the trial court as to <em>Barrett </em>and also <em>O'Connor. </em>In our view, Parsells too was transferred while serving his sentence in Pennsylvania and while in custody. True, it does not appear that he was behind prison walls at that time. However, on April 5, 1971 he was sentenced in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County to a term of 15% to 31 years in Pennsylvania State Prison and \u201cimmediately thereafter\u201d was transferred to New Jersey for service of his sentence as a parole violator. There was no stay of execution of the sentence nor was he on parole. Therefore at the time of his transfer he was under sentence and in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Despite our difference with the trial judge as to whether <em>Barrett </em>is distinguishable and, indeed, considering, as we do, that it is indistinguishable on its facts, we decline to follow it. <em>Barrett </em>and its progeny represent the minority view on the question of \u201cwaiver\u201d of the surrendering state\u2019s rights to exact the full penalty for the crime committed in its jurisdiction. As the Supreme Court of Ohio stated in discussing the <em>Barrett </em>decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">This, however, is the minority view. An examination of those cases shows no sound basis at law or under the Constitution to conclude that a release of a convict to one soverign for prosecution for another crime or to serve a sentence for which crime the prisoner has already been convicted by another sovereign should constitute a waiver of its rights to exact the full penalty. <em>[Heston v. Green, </em>174 <em>Ohio St. </em>291, 189 <em>N. E. </em>2d 86-87 (Sup. Ct. 1963), <em>cert. </em>den. 374 <em>U. S. </em>822, 83 S. Ct. 1901, 10 L. Ed. 2d 1080 (1963) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\"><em>We </em>likewise see no sound basis at law for the \u201cwaiver\u201d ' recognized in <em>Barrett, </em>particularly since the proceedings here were pursuant to our Extradition Act, <em>N. J. 8. A. 2A </em>:160-1 <em>ei seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\"><em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:160-8 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">Nothing in this article contained shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by this state of its right, power or privilege to try such demanded person for crime committed within this state, or of its right, power or privilege to regain custody of such person by extradition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>proceedings or otherwise for the purpose of trial, sentence or punishment for any crime committed within this state, nor shall any proceedings had under this article which result in, or fail to result in, extradition be deemed a waiver by this state of any of its rights, privileges or Jurisdiction in any way whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has similar provisions. 19 <em>P. S. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 191.1 to 191.31. In light of the above statutory language, our courts have generally held <em>contra </em>to the position argued by defendant. <em>Rau v. McCorkle, 45 N. J. Super. </em>191 (Law Div.), aff\u2019d 47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>36 (App. Div. 1957); <em>State v. Williams, </em>92 <em>N. J. Super. </em>560 (App. Div. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">It is true that pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:160 \u2014 33, when a prisoner charged in this State with a crime is imprisoned in another state, the Governor of this State may agree with the Governor of the other state for the extradition of the prisoner before the conclusion of his term of sentence in such other state, upon condition that such prisoner be returned to the other state \u201cat the expense of this State\u201d as soon as the prosecution in this State is terminated. Defendant here argues that the foregoing section is the only authority for extradition by way of return of a prisoner to a state from which he had previously been extradited while serving his sentence, <em>i. e., </em>only when such agreement between the Governors has been entered into. We disagree. We consider that the Pennsylvania counterpart of our <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:160~8 (19 <em>P. S. </em>\u00a7 191.27), which provides that nothing in the Extradition Act shall constitute a waiver of that state\u2019s right to try a prisoner for crime committed in that state, has overriding significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We therefore hold, contrary to <em>Barrett, </em>that the surrender of defendant by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to New Jersey under the circumstances herein, did not constitute a waiver of Pennsylvania\u2019s right to exact the full penalty for the crimes committed by defendant in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
