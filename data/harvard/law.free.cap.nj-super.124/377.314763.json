She sought workmen\u2019s compensation benefits from Employers Mutual Insurance Co. of Wausau. More than two years after the accident she filed an amended petition naming the hospital as an additional respondent. At the hearing the judge of compensation dismissed the claim petition against the hospital on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-51 and entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of the insurance company, holding that there was no employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The proofs showed that petitioner was engaged through the nurses\u2019 registry to render private nursing care to a patient who had been injured in the course of his employment and whose medical and hospital bills, including those for private nursing care, were being paid by respondent insurance company as the compensation carrier for the patient\u2019s employer. She billed the insurance company directly for her services, and there were no deductions for income taxes or social security.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Petitioner contends that a compensation carrier which, in the exercise o\u00a3 its obligation to furnish an injured workman necessary medical, surgical and other treatment, as well as hospital services, authorizes and pays for the services of a private nurse, becomes thereby the employer of the nurse for the purposes of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. No ease has been brought to our attention which so holds, and our own research has disclosed none. In our view the contention is unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">It is the general rule that when a nurse who offers professional service to the public is privately engaged to look after a patient in a hospital, she does not ordinarily become the employee of the patient, or the patient\u2019s spouse or employer, whichever of them may have procured her services. 1A <em>Larson, Workmen's Compensation </em>(1967), \u00a7 45.32(c) at 731. In such ease she is ordinarily an independent contractor. On the facts here present the \u201crelative nature of the work test\u201d would not change her status to that of an employee, and we see no reason for applying a different rule to the respondent insurance carrier. <em>Cf. Marcus v. Eastern Agricultural Ass\u2019n, Inc., 58 N. J. Super. </em>584, 603 (App. Div. 1959), rev\u2019d and dissent adopted 32 <em>N. J. </em>460 (1960). The cases cited by petitioner are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>With respect to. the hospital, we do not think the petition should have been dismissed on the ground that it was filed out of time, and the record does not support the comment of the judge of compensation that the hospital\u2019s counsel consented to the dismissal. The issue was whether petitioner was an employee of the hospital. If she was, and if medical treatment was furnished her within the two-year period, then the petition was not barred by the statute of limitations. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:15 \u2014 51. <em>Zanni v. Rudolph Poultry Equipment, </em>105 <em>N. J. Super. </em>325, 328 (App. Div. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">In any case, we see no need to remand these issues to the Division because we are satisfied from the proofs that petitioner was not an employee of respondent hospital. It is evident from her own testimony that she responded to a call from the nurses\u2019 registry and proceeded directly to the patient\u2019s room after consulting the doctor\u2019s order sheet. She received no instructions except from the attending physicians, although she was required to observe the hospital\u2019s rules and regulations concerning the giving of medication and the making of entries on thee patient\u2019s chart. The hospital did not pay her. In these circumstances she retained her status as an independent contractor. <em>Brown v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, </em>222 <em>App. Div. </em>402, 226 <em>N. Y. S. </em>317 (App. Div. 1928); <em>Edith A. Anderson Nursing Homes, Inc. v. Walker, </em>232 <em>Md. </em>442, 194 <em>A. </em>2d 85 (Ct. App. 1963); <em>McDonald\u2019s Case, </em>345 <em>Mass. </em>766, 187 <em>N. E. </em>2d 388 (Sup. Jud. Ct. 1963); Annotation, \u201cNurse as independent contractor or servant,\u201d 60 <em>A. L. R. </em>303 (1929). See also <em>Chmizlak v. Levine, </em>20 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>339, 27 <em>A. </em>2d 629 (Dept. Labor 1942). <em>Cf. Bertsch v. Jones, </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>34 (Sup. Ct. 1942), aff\u2019d 129 <em>N. J. L. </em>51 (E. &amp; A. 1942), and <em>Robinson v. Levy, </em>20 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>444, 28 <em>A. </em>2d 651 (Dept. Labor 1942), which are distinguishable factually. Applying the \u201crelative nature of the work tost\u201d would not change the result on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
