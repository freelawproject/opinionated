A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AAT\">In this personal injury, slip-and-fall case, defendant Krauszer\u2019s Vending, Inc. (Krauszer\u2019s) appeals from a final judgment entered in favor of plaintiff Bertha Schramm in the sum of $5,000 and against defendants Krauszer\u2019s and Arsenal Esso Station (Arsenal), jointly and severally. Krauszer\u2019s also appeals from an order denying its motion for indemnification from Arsenal.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">The trial was bifurcated and resulted in a jury verdict on the issue of liability in favor of plaintiff and against both defendants. Thereafter, the parties waived a jury trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>as to damages and the above-noted final judgment was entered, without prejudice, however, to Krauszer\u2019s right to appeal the liability aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On February 13, 1969, at or about 1 a.m., plaintiff drove to the Arsenal Esso station to purchase some milk from a milk machine located on the premises, as she had previously done on an average of two to three times a week. When she arrived, the station was closed for business. However, bright lights illuminated the milk machine. She parked her ear, walked down a path to the machine, found it empty and was returning to her car through another path when she slipped and fell on the ice or snow accumulated on the premises. It had snowed 6.3 inches four days before the accident and 4.3 inches three days before.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Arsenal owned the service station. Krauszer\u2019s owned the milk machine, which had been placed on the premises some eight or nine years ago pursuant to an oral agreement between the parties. Krauszer\u2019s paid Arsenal one cent for each quart of milk sold, plus $12 a month to cover electricity costs. Krauszer\u2019s maintained the machine, the shelter which housed it, as well as the attached lights. Krauszer\u2019s placed milk in the machine almost daily at 8 a.m. It had been loaded on the day of the accident and on the preceding day.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">During the years Arsenal cleared the premises of snow and ice. Even though there was no express agreement with respect to the area in front of the milk machine, Arsenal included it in its clearing operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The foreman of the jury in announcing the verdict stated that the jury found that \u201cboth defendants are guilty of negligence in the maintenance of the milk machine area $ * <em>% \u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">On this appeal Krauszer\u2019s first contends that it owed no duty to plaintiff and was therefore not liable for plaintiff\u2019s injuries as a matter of law. It argues that the relationship between it and Arsenal was that of licensor-licensee and by reason thereof it was not in possession of, nor did it have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>control of, any portion of Arsenal\u2019s premises. This contention and the argument in support thereof are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We assume, without deciding, that the relationship between defendants was that of licensor-licensee. Nevertheless, Krauszer\u2019s, independent of any duty owed by Arsenal, owed a duty to those members of the public whom it openly invited to make use of the milk machine to use reasonable care to maintain in a reasonably safe condition that area of the premises in the immediate locale of the machine, as well as the direct access ways to and from it. See <em>Willett v. Pilotte, </em>329 <em>Mass. </em>610, 109 <em>N. E. </em>2d 840 (Sup. Jud. Ct. 1953); <em>Hill v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co., </em>42 <em>App. D. C. </em>170, 51 <em>L. R. A. </em>N. S. 1072, <em>Ann. Cas. </em>1915D, 1085 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><em>Green v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., La., </em>204 <em>So. </em>2d 648 (La. Ct. App. 1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 251 <em>La. </em>859, 206 <em>So. </em>2d 711 (Sup. Ct. 1968), and <em>Sullivan v. New York Telephone Co., </em>157 <em>App. Div. </em>642, 142 <em>N. Y. S. </em>735 (App. Div. 1913), aff\u2019d o.b. 160 <em>App. Div. </em>928, 145 <em>N. Y. S. </em>1147 (App. Div. 1914), relied upon by Krauszer\u2019s, are both factually inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Under the existing circumstances, the court correctly denied defendants\u2019 motion for a dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 case against it and the jury verdict finding both defendants jointly and severally liable was legally proper. <em>Cf. Krug v. Wanner, </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>174, 182-183 (1958). By reason of the above, we find no plain error in the judge\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Defendant Krauszer\u2019s next contention that its negligence was only secondary to Arsenal\u2019s and therefore Krauszer\u2019s is entitled to indemnification from Arsenal, is without merit. The trial judge correctly held that a party seeking common law indemnification from another must be without personal fault. See <em>Adler\u2019s Quality Baking, Inc. v. Gaseteria, Inc., </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>55, 79-81 (1960); <em>Public Service Elec, and Gas Co. v. Waldroup, </em>38 <em>N. J. Super. </em>419, 432 (App. Div. 1955); <em>Hut v. Antonio v. Guth, </em>95 <em>N. J. Super. </em>62, 69-70 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>(Law Div. 1967); <em>Restatement, Restitution, </em>\u00a7 96 (1937). Thus, the jury\u2019s finding that both defendants were negligent bars Krauszer\u2019s from indemnity against Arsenal.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae3\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
