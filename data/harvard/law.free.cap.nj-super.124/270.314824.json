J. Super. </em>493 (Law Div. 1972), and need not be repeated. We affirm essentially for the reasons given by Judge Botter and add only that we are not persuaded by plaintiff\u2019s argument that the statute is not operative here since the cause of action was grounded in part in breach of warranty and strict liability in tort. The act by its operative terms provides \u2014 \u201cno action whether in contract, in tort, or otherwise * * * shall be brought * * * more than ten years after * * * performance * * * construction.\u201d We are satisfied then that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :14~1.1 limits <em>any </em>action encompassed within it regardless of its genesis or label.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
