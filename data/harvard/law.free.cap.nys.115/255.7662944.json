The pleadings were oral; the plaintiff\u2019s attorney stating that his complaint was for \u201cclaim and delivery and damages.\u201d It appears from the bill of particulars that his cause of action is based upon the ownership of a safe, in the possession of the defendant, which he demands with damages sustained in consequence of defendant\u2019s refusal to deliver it to him. The municipal justice has found for the plaintiff, and directed the entry of judgment in his favor, adjudging that he recover the possession of the safe, with $6.50 damages for its detention, and costs. From the judgment accordingly entered, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">Defendant contends that the trial court had no jurisdiction, because there was no affidavit or complaint accompanying the summons, and that the latter contains no reference to the nature of the action. The plaintiff did not seek to replevin the safe. He had the right to waive this privilege, and await possession obtained under his judgment. The court acquired jurisdiction by the service of the summons, and,- where a defendant has thus been brought into court, the plaintiff is at liberty to set up any cause of action that he chooses. Sharp v. Clapp, 15 App. Div. 445, 44 N. Y. Supp. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">The judgment did not fix the value of the property, and was not in the alternative, which the appellant argues presents reversible error.' In this he is mistaken. In Hammond v. Morgan, 101 N. Y. 179, 4 N. E. 328, it was held that a judgment for plaintiff in an action of replevin may be entered, although the jury has not assessed any damages or found the value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-16\">The judgment of the Municipal Court must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
