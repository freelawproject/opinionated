These allegations are denied. The allegation of the complaint that the plaintiff, at the time in question, was a guest of the hotel, was admitted; and no denial was made of the allegation that the defendant was the keeper of a common inn. The answer set up: (1) The providing of a safe for keeping such articles as were described, and the posting of a notice thereof, of which the plaintiff had notice; (2) that no special agreement was made for the safekeeping of these articles; (3) that whatever property the plaintiff lost was lost solely by reason of her negligence without negligence on defendant\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">At common law the innkeeper was liable as an insurer of the safety of his guest\u2019s property, unless its loss occurred through the negligence of the guest. The statute modifying the common-law liability must be strictly construed. This court has carefully considered the statute in the case of Briggs v. Todd, 28 Misc. Rep. 208, 59 N. Y. Supp. 23, recently cited in Waters v. Gerard, 189 N. Y. 302, 82 N. E. 143, 121 Am. St. Rep. 886. In accordance with the construction placed upon the statute in that case, the innkeeper\u2019s liability has been modified only as to \u201cmoney, jewels, or ornaments,\u201d and a watch is not a jewel or ornament within its meaning. By analogy, a chain, a purse, and a rosary, being all articles of use, and not worn for ornament, are also not within the statute, since the court did not find that plaintiff\u2019s testimony showed that the loss was due to her negligence, but in dismissing the complaint stated;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-11\">\u201cYou must prove circumstances from which you can predicate negligence. She says she noticed a card which set forth that the hotel provided a safe for safe-keeping.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
