The party of the second part hereby agrees to furnish the taximeter cabs for the Hotel Albany, and also agrees to permit the party of the first part to examine the drivers\u2019 sheets on demand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Subsequently Pimot, purporting to act for his partnership, for $400 signed a release of said contract with the hotel company. ' The hotel company notified the license bureau that it had revoked its consent to the stand in front of the hotel and made an arrangement with the New York Taxicab Company. This action is brought in equity for an injunction against interference with the rights alleged to be existing under said two papers, and the learned court has granted the .injunction upon the ground that said papers constitute a lease, and in accordance with the line of 'authorities which permit injunctive action-in support of a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The agreement between Lynch &amp; Pimot and the hotel company is hot \u00e1 lease. As a license or privilege it is not exclusive. It is not shown that irreparable damage will ensue upon a breach thereof. If the contract has been breached, a legal remedy is afforded. It is difficult to conceive of a lease by a private individual of a portion of a public street. In Hess v. Roberts, 124 App. Div. 328, 108 N. Y. Supp. 894, the paper in consideration provided that plaintiff should have the exclusive privilege of the public stenographer\u2019s office situated in the Murray Hill Hotel. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">\u201cThis instrument is called a lease, although it is nothing of the kind. It is a mere agreement to allow a stenographer and typewriter to carry on business in the hotel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">Further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-13\">\u201cBut assuming that the defendant had no right to revoke the agreement and prevent plaintiff from continuing this business at the hotel, she had a complete remedy at law, and an appeal to a court of equity was unnecessary and unjustifiable. * * * The cases which have restrained a landlord from interfering with a tenant\u2019s possession of real property has no application, for here there was no property leased to the plaintiff, but an agreement to allow her to carry on the business of stenography and typewriting in the hotel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">That was a stronger case for plaintiff than the one at bar, but this court vacated the injunction. I find no warrant for the order appealed from, and especially so far as affects the appellant, the New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Taxicab Company, which was not a party to any of the agreements sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, and the injunction vacated, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
