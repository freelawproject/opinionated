Gearty v. Mayor, 171 N. Y. 61, 63 N. E. 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The point is raised by the defendant that the claim alleged in the complaint and on which the plaintiff was allowed to recover was a different one to that filed with the city comptroller pursuant to section 261 of the city charter (Laws 1901,. p. 114, c. 7). It suffices that there was no such issue in the case. The complaint alleged that the claim alleged in the complaint was presented to the comptroller on August 9, 1905, and that he failed to allow or pay the same, and the answer only denies any knowledge or information of this allegation sufficient to form a belief thereof. This did not suffice for a denial, i. e., it was a frivolous denial, for the claim as presented in writing was on file, in the comptroller\u2019s office, and therefore the 'defendant in presumption' of law had full knowledge of it and of its contents, and was not permitted to resort to the lenient form of denial which it used. Rochkind v. Perlman, 123 App. Div. 808, 108 N. Y. Supp. 224, 1151; Purdy v. City of New York, 126 App. Div. 320, 110 N. Y. Supp. 822; Bogart v. City of New York, 128 App. Div. 139, 112 N. Y. Supp. 549. The opinion in the recent decision in the Purdy Case by the Court of Appeals (86 N. E. 560) presents no embarrassment in respect of this rule of pleading. The order of this court reversing the judgment of dismissal of the complaint on the ground of the insufficiency of such notice was reversed, although it was pointed out here by an opinion that there was no such issue in the case, because of a denial in the answer the same as the one in the present case. But the ground for reversal stated in the opinion of the learned judge who wrote in the. Court of Appeals is solely the insufficiency of the notice, only this being said to cover the point that the pleadings presented no such issue, viz.: \u201cNone of the other questions presented need to be discussed.\u201d But as the Court of Appeals has itself fully established the said rule of pleading in City of New York v. Matthews, 180 N. Y. 41, 72 N. E. 629, it cannot be presumed that it meant to upset it in the Purdy Case. It would be more reasonable to infer that counsel' for the plaintiff omitted to stand on the point in the Court of Appeals; or else that the court considered the point as not raised on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.
