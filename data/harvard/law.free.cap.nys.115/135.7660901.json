The contract contained a clause that the contractor should not assign \u201cany of the moneys payable under this agreement\u201d unless with the consent of the city. By written instrument the contractor assigned to another \u201call moneys due, owing, or to become due to the-said party of the first part,\u201d i. e., the contractor, and the city by resolution of its common council consented thereto. The contractor abandoned the work and the plaintiff completed, the defendant failing to do so on notice. A defense was pleaded that such an. assignment was made with the plaintiff\u2019s consent and that it was a substantial change of the contract, and therefore released the surety.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b168-5\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

On the contrary, the contract provided that that might be done. Even if there had been no such provision in the contract; it is not intimated here that such assignment could in any way interfere with or impair the surety\u2019s right of subrogation to complete the contract and be paid according to its terms on the contractor\u2019s default. It would have to be' considered whether an assent of the city to pay the money as it came due to the contract- or\u2019s nominee or assignee would be any change of the contract at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.
