That subdivision of section 145 does, indeed, provide that a demurrer to a written complaint must be in writing; but this is no more in derogation of the preceding declaration in the same section that pleadings, including demurrers, in the Municipal Court, may be oral or written, than is the requirement that a pleading subsequent to a verified pleading must commonly be verified. The court should have deemed the demurrer well founded, and allowed the plaintiff, not the defendant, to amend (subdivision 4). The words indorsed upon the summons did not amount to a statement, plain, concise, or otherwise, of facts constituting a cause of action. Nor were they holpen out by the service eight days after the joinder of issue of a bill of particulars, which could not create an issue of fact not theretofore tendered the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-18\">. What was entered by the plaintiff upon the decision of the learned trial justice, and styled \u201cinterlocutory judgment on demurrer,\u201d has rather the incidents of an order than of a judgment; but, as neither point nor contention is based on that discrepancy, it may be disre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>garded or overlooked oil presumption.

Plaintiff, a street sweeper, upon a free summons brought this action by an oral complaint, indorsed upon the summons as for \u201cpersonal injuries, etc.\u201d The defendant, as appears from the indorsements on the summons, on the return day (November <em>2, </em>1908) made a \u201cdemand,\u201d and November 10th was set down as the date for the \u201canswer.\u201d On November 6th a bill of particulars, stating the date, hour, and place of the accident, and also setting forth the details of his serious injuries, his loss of employment between specified dates, and the expense of his medical attendance, was filed. No answer was presented on November 10th, when the case was set down for trial, and various adjournments were thereafter had till November 24th, when the defendant demurred to the complaint for insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As far as the record shows, since on the return day the only step taken by the defendant was to make a \u201cdemand,\u201d issue was not joined until the demurrer was interposed on November 24th. But on November 6th defendant was fully advised as to plaintiff\u2019s cause of action by the bill of particulars, which was an amplification of the complaint, and on the day upon which the answer was to be entered it could have been entered, or, if in writing, prepared and filed. It seems, however, that, having secured the information necessary before answering, it delayed nearly three weeks, and then demurred. While it has been held that, when any complaint in a Municipal Court is tested for insufficiency, it is governed by the same rules as are applied to complaints in the Supreme Court (State Board of Pharmacy v. Davey, 56 Misc. Rep. 568, 107 N. Y. Supp. 46), nevertheless I do not think the record in this case entitles the defendant to the benefit of that authority. The manifest object of a complaint is to furnish the defendant with sufficient information to enable him to plead intelligently. Here the defendant had that information before the answer was due. In the circumstances, to compel plaintiff to pay costs as a condition of amendment, or, in the event of his presumable inability to make such payment, thus remitting him to another action wherein those costs could be offset against his.demand, would seem to be unwarranted and unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The interlocutory judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
