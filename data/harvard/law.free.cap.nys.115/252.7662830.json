The plaintiff\u2019s wagon was driven onto and passed along the tracks of the defendant, some time between 4:30 and 5:30 a. m. of January 11, 1907. While the wagon was passing along the tracks it was overtaken and struck by the defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-18\">I think that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial be ordered, upon the exception taken to the refusal-to give this instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-19\">\u201cIf the jury find that the plaintiff\u2019s driver drove 200 yards or more upon the track, knowing the danger of the situation and being familiar with the conditions there existing, without making any effort to ascertain whether the car was approaching behind him, and that contributed to the accident, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>It appears that the plaintiff\u2019s driver knew that cars ran upon the track. He testifies that he passed along nearly 300 feet before the accident, and that he did not during that time look back for any approaching car, and there is no proof that he listened for one. Although the headlight of the car had gone out, there is no dispute but that the car was lighted. Under the circumstances, the defendant was entitled to this instruction. Belford v. Brooklyn Heights Railroad Co., 86 App. Div. 388, 83 N. Y. Supp. 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial is ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
