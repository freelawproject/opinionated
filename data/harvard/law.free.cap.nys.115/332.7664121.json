The answer denies the allegations of the sixth paragraph of the complaint, which is, \u201cOn information and belief that no part thereof has been paid to said bank, although demand has been duly made,\u201d and for a separate and distinct defense defendant alleges, on information and belief, that before the commencement of this action defendant satisfied and discharged the plaintiff\u2019s alleged claim by payment thereof to the Alabama National Bank. Plaintiff moved for a bill of particulars, which should state the date and place of the alleged payment, the person or persons, officer or officers, to whom made, and the amount or amounts thereof; and, the motion having been denied, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s assignor, being a corporation, must do its business through its officers and employ\u00e9s. It has had many such during the ten years which have elapsed since the judgment was obtained upon which this suit is brought. The defendant alleges payment upon information and belief. Such an averment emphasizes the necessity for a bill of particulars upon the facts disclosed in these papers. That under proper circumstances a bill of particulars of alleged payments may be required is established by authority. Coolidge v. Stoddard, 120 App. Div. 641, 105 N. Y. Supp. 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\">The order appealed\" from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
