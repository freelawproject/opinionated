The drawings, plans, and specifications were parts of the contract. Among the articles to be supplied were 81 wash tray bibbs. After being installed by plaintiff, these were stolen. He refused to replace them without pay, apd, claiming that they were replaced upon defendant\u2019s promise to pay, he sues to recover the cost, $60.75. He also claimed $21.25 for furnishing three washtubs not included in his contract. The defense is that the defendant is not responsible for loss of the wash tray bibbs, that the washtubs were included in plaintiff\u2019s contract, and that all the work done by plaintiff was embraced in the final certificate issued by the architects, dated March 3, 1908, $2,700 cash, and $50'0 note, and plaintiff\u2019s receipt therefor, \u201cfinal payment as per contract of August 2, 1907.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">In January, 1908, the loss or theft of these \u201cbibbs\u201d was discovered. Plaintiff says he told the defendant he would not replace them unless he paid for them, \u201cand he told me to go ahead and put them in.\u201d He presented no bill to the architects therefor, as extra work or otherwise, because defendant said he would pay for them. He accepted the final certificate two months later. An employ\u00e9 of plaintiff testified that he heard defendant say as to the missing bibbs, \u201cGo ahead and replace them,\u201d after plaintiff had said he would not do so without pay. Defendant testified that, when plaintiff informed him that the bibbs were stolen, he (defendant) said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">\u201cThat has nothing to do with me whatever; and I told him the same thing a number of times\u2014that we want him to go ahead, as we want him to finish the job. I did not promise to pay him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">Mr. Cleverdon testified that plaintiff asked for an order for the bibbs, to which Mr. Cleverdon replied that they must be replaced without additional compensation, and that the plaintiff must go on with the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">At the time these \u201cbibbs\u201d were stolen, plaintiff had not completed his contract, by the terms of which he was in charge of his work and materials, and therefore was obliged to replace them before he could obtain his final certificate. In the circumstances plaintiff has failed to show by a preponderance of evidence any promise of defendant to pay for the replaced \u201cbibbs.\u201d As to the wash trays, the plans and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>specifications call for five, thus including the three for which claim is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">MacLEAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b170-7\">GILDERSLEEVE, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR_\">(dissenting). It seems to me that the case turns upon a question of fact, viz.: Did defendant, after the wash tray bibbs had been stolen, promise to pay plaintiff for replacing them, upon the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to replace them unless paid therefor ? The court below decided this question in favor of plaintiff, and I do not think we should-interfere with this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
