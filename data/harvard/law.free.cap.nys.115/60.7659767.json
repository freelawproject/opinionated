The answer denied the material allegations of the complaint, and specifically denied that there was due the plaintiff the sum of $862.50, or any sum whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-18\">At the trial it appeared from the testimony on the part of the plaintiff that on the 1st of April, 1906, Butler sold to the defendants his business, and the defendants thereafter continued in possession of the store during the time for which a recovery was sought; that the rental value of the premises during that time was $75 a month; that Butler\u2019s claim was assigned to th\u2018e plaintiff, and defendants had not paid anything for the use and occupation. From the defendant\u2019s testimony it appeared that immediately prior to the purchase of the busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ness of Butler the defendants had a conversation with the landlord, and he would not accept them as tenants in place of Butler. They so reported to Butler and he thereupon said, if they would pay him $1,-043, he would turn over the store and would be liable for and pay the rent himself. This evidence was in no respect contradicted by the plaintiff. It therefore stands admitted so far as the record shows that the real transaction was as claimed by the defendants^ and, if so, then the plaintiff could not recover for the use and occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Various attempts were made to show that the full consideration of $1,043 had been paid prior to the commencement of the action. All of this evidence was excluded, apparently upon the theory that the defendants had not pleaded payment of rent in their answer. The contention was that the relation of landlord and tenant never existed; and it did not if the defendants\u2019 testimony were true. The defendants ascertained before they purchased the business carried on by Butler on the premises that the landlord would not accept them as tenants, but that he should continue to hold Butler as a tenant and they so reported to the latter, and thereupon, according to their testimony, it was arranged that the defendants should include the rent as a part of the purchase money for the store which he agreed to pay to the landlord. If it be true that this was the real transaction, then it is obvious they had a right to show they had fully paid the consideration agreed upon. The evidence showing this payment was improperly excluded, and the court erred in directing a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The judgment appealed from, therefore, is reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
