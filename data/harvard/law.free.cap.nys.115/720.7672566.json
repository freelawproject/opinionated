Upon the trial the learned justice presiding dismissed the complaint as to the defendant McClenahan, and, upon the jury finding a verdict of $2,500, the same was set aside as being excessive. The plaintiff appeals from the judgment dismissing the complaint as to the defendant McClenahan.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">We are unable to discover any good reason for dismissing the complaint as against McClenahan. He was the president, and apparently in charge of the brewing company\u2019s business. It was he who refused to give up possession of the chattels, concededly belonging to the plaintiff ; his refusal being based upon an assumed right to a lien upon the same for storage. The tortious act was his own act, and the fact that he was also acting in behalf of the brewing company does not serve to relieve him from personal responsibility. Rodney Hunt Machine Co. v.
