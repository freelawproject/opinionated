The defendant who moved, and who now appeals, is the owner of the premises. He has not appeared generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The mechanic\u2019s lien was filed on May 4, 1907. The plaintiff deposes that he began this action for foreclosure on May 1, 1908, by filing the summons and complaint, with a lis pendens, \u201cand by 'the service of a copy of the said summons and complaint upon the defendant Herman Hahn\u201d on May 1,1908; that the defendant Hurley \u201chas also been served with a copy of the said summons and complaint\u201d; and that \u201cthe defendant Thomas E. O\u2019Neill was similarly served after the year had expired and subsequent to the 4th day of May, 1908.\u201d Hurley was a mortgagee, and Hahn was the contractor, to. whom the plaintiff was a subcontractor. It does not appear that the lien was ever continued by order, or redocketed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">To keep the lien alive the plaintiff must have begun his action to foreclose within one year after the filing of his notice of the lien. Section 16, Mechanic\u2019s Lien Law (Laws 1897, p. 522, c. 418). An action is begun by service of a summons. Concededly he did not serve the owner until the lapse of that year. And hence he did not begin his action against him, unless Hahn was a codefendant-who' was \u201ca joint contractor\u201d or was \u201cotherwise united in interest\u201d with O\u2019Neill. Section 399, Code Civ. Proc. The owner of the premises and a contractor for work thereon are not joint contractors as to the subcontractor. Phillips on Mechanics\u2019 Liens (3d Ed.) 397. And they are not \u201cotherwise unit\u00e9d in interest.\u201d The interest of-the contractor is to defeat the claim, or to reduce it to the saving of his own claim against the owner. The interest of the owner is confined to see that the claim of the subcontractor rests upon a sum justly due from the owner to the contract- or under their contract, inasmuch as the lien of the subcontractor attaches perforce of the owner\u2019s indebtedness to the contractor. Van Clief v. Van Vechten, 130 N. Y. 571, 29 N. E. 1017; Brainard v. County of Kings, 155 N. Y. 538, 50 N. E. 263. Payment to the contractor of the full contract price in good faith may defeat the right of the subcontractor to his lien (De Lorenzo v. Von Raitz, 44 App. Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>329, 60 N. Y. Supp. 736), and it might be to the interest of a dishonest contractor to conceal such fact. The subcontractor\u2019s claim against the contractor rests upon their contract. His claim against the owner is perforce of his right to garnish or to attach the amount due from the owner to the contractor and to proceed to foreclosure. He seeks foreclosure against the owner, and but a personal judgment for deficiency against the contractor. If the contractor and the owner were united in interest, they must be made parties. Section 448, Code Civ. Proc. But section 3402 of the Code does not enumerate the contractor as such a party. He is not such an one. Phillips on Mechanics\u2019 Liens, \u00a7 397. There.was no unity of interest. See Smith v. Hurd, 50 Minn. 503, 52 N. W. 922, 36 Am. St. Rep. 661; Smith v. Gault, 5 Month. Law Bulletin, 54; Henry v. Lynch (Com. Pl.) 1 N. Y. Supp. 780; Moore v. McLaughlin, 11 App. Div. 478, 42 N. Y. Supp. 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">I am of opinion, then, that the service of the summons and complaint on the contractor was not a commencement of the action against the owner. As the plaintiff did not begin his action of foreclosure, or secure an order to continue it, within one year from the time of filing his lien, the lien was discharged. Albro v. Blume, 5 App. Div. 309, 39 N. Y. Supp. 215. Section 18 of the mechanic\u2019s lien law is self-operative (In the Matter of Rudiger, 118 App. Div. 86, 102 N. Y. Supp. 1053), and hence no order of the court was required as to the lien. I think, however, that the court could and should have directed that the' notice of lis pendens should be canceled. Section 1674, Code Civ. Proc.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The order should be modified accordingly, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
