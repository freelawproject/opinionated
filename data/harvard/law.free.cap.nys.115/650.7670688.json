Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co., 171 N. Y. 538, <em>64 </em>N. E. 442, 59 L. R. A. 478, 89 Am. St. Rep. 828. Such publication may now, however, be restrained in this state, under chapter 132, p. 308, of the Laws of 1903, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-22\">\u201cA person, firm or corporation that uses for advertising purposes, or for the purposes of trade, the name, portrait or picture of any living person without having first obtained the written consent of such person, or if a minor of his or her parent or guardian, is guilty of a misdemeanor,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>And that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">\u201cAny person whose name, portrait or picture is used within this state for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade without the written consent first obtained as above provided may maintain an equitable action in the Supreme Court of this state against the person, firm or corporation so using his name,- portrait or picture, to prevent and restrain the use thereof, and may also sue and recover damages for any injuries sustained by reason of such use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The complaint alleges that the defendant was engaged in the business of publishing and selling portraits, photographs, among other places, at No. 469 Broadway, borough of Manhattan, New York City, under the firm name and style of A. C. Bosselman &amp; Co., and that this defendant publicly, knowingly\u2014-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201cand without the consent, written or otherwise, of this plaintiff, or of her parents or guardians, and in spite of the remonstrances and protests of this plaintiff, and in violation of chapter 132 of the Laws of 1903 of the state of New York, entitled \u2018An act to prevent the unauthorized use of the name or picture of any person for the purposes of trade,\u2019 has used, displayed, circulated, and offered for sale, and for the purposes of trade, and is still using, displaying, circulating, and offering for the purpose of sale and trade, the portrait and picture of this plaintiff, the said Hattie Kunz.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the complaint is defective, in that it fails to allege that the acts complained of were committed in the state of New York, is without merit. It is true that it will be necessary for plaintiff to prove upon the trial that her portrait has been published in this state, and it was necessary to allege every fact necessary to bring the case within the statute. The complaint, stripped of verbiage, states that the defendant, engaged in the business of publishing and selling portraits, photographs, pictorial post cards, and souvenirs, among other places, in the city of New York, unlawfully and without the consent of this plaintiff, written or otherwise, in violation of chapter 133, p. 308, of the Laws of 1903, has used, circulated, and offered for sale, for the purposes of trade, her portrait and picture. In my opinion this amounts to an allegation that the acts complained of were committed in this state. In Rochester Railroad Company v. Robinson, 133 N. Y. 246, 30 N. E. 1008, Judge Maynard said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">\u201cA statement is not to be deemed any the less a statement of fact because its ascertainment may depend upon some principles of law applicable to various other facts and circumstances (Prickhardt v. Robertson, 4 Civ. Proc. R. 112), and it has always been held to be good pleading, under the Code, to state facts according to their legal effect (Brown v. Champlin, 66 N. Y. 214; Thayer v. Gile, 42 Hun, 268). \u2018Pleadings are not now to be strictly construed against the pleader, and averments which sufficiently point out the nature of the pleader\u2019s claim are sufficient, if under them, upon a trial of the issue, he would be entitled to give all the necessary evidence to establish his claim.\u2019 Berney v. Drexel, 33 Hun, 34-37. An allegation that due proceedings had been taken to establish a mechanics\u2019 lien was held on demurrer to be good. Mc-Corkle v. Herrmann, 22 N. Y. St. Rep. 519, 5 N. Y. Supp. 881.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">While perhaps more scientific care ought to have been exercised in drawing this complaint, it states, nevertheless, a cause of action under the statute, and the interlocutory judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>GAYNOR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2_\">(concurring). The place does not need to be alleged. It was only necessary to allege generally the use being made of the plaintiff\u2019s picture without her consent, and leave the place and particulars to the evidence. Such a complaint would not be demurrable on the theory that the place \u201cmight\u201d be out of the state. It might be and it might not, and either could be proved under the general allegation. The allegation of the statute in the complaint is mere verbiage. Because the plaintiff has alleged it the defendant demurs on the theory that the place \u201cmay\u201d be outside of the state. \u25a0 Yes, but it may not be; that is for the evidence; and if out of the state the common law there might sustain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Interlocutory judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
