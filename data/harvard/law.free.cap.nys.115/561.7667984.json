The plaintiffs claim that the legal title to the real estate involved is in the widow and heirs at law, and that, while the executors have tendered a deed of the premises, in accord with the terms of the contract of January 31st, this would not serve to give them good title.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">We think the learned court at Special Term has properly denied the motion. The executors take the title to the testator\u2019s property as trustees under the express trust, and whether it be considered as real estate, or as having been converted into personalty through the operation of the contract of January 31, 1908, under the general rule prevailing in such cases (Williams v. Haddock, 145 N. Y. 144, 150, 39 N. E. 825), can make no make possible difference. The legal title to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>the estate, whether consisting of real personal, or mixed property, vests in the trustees, subject only to the right of the beneficiaries to enforce the trust, and the executors and trustees have a perfect right to carry out the contract of the testator, and to accept the price agreed upon, constituting this a part of the trust fund. Neither the widow nor the heirs at law have any interest in this real estate, as such, with the exception, of course, of the widow\u2019s dower, and as to this the defendants allege in their answer that they are prepared to give a full title, which could be done, of course, with the consent of the widow. Indeed, with the exception noted, they have no interest in the property during the lifetime of the widow. It is vested in the trustees, subject to the right of the beneficiaries to have the trust enforced. Having no legal interest in the property, they could not be necessary parties in an action for specific performance, and the-order appealed from is therefore right and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The order\" appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
