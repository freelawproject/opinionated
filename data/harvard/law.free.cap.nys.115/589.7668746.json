The plaintiff, at the time of the accident, maintained in front of her premises a board walk, three or four feet wide, in which there was a trapdoor opening from the sidewalk into the cellar. Directly in front of this walk was a dilapidated stone walk, five or six feet wide, between the curb and the board walk. The trapdoor had been out of repair, and did not close properly, 'for some time prior to the accident, which occurred by defendant\u2019s tripping over a projection thereof, which was about an inch higher than the surface of the walk. The evidence discloses that this trapdoor was wrongfully maintained in a dangerous condition by the plaintiff, and she should not be permitted to recover for the consequences of her own wrongful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
