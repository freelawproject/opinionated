J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2f\">The action is based upon an alleged breach of contract of hiring, but the pleadings are not among the papers on appeal. The plaintiff is a resident of Orange county, and the defendant of New York county. The contract was made in the latter county. The action is brought in Orange county, and the appeal is from an order denying the defendants\u2019 motion to change the place of trial to the county of New York on the ground of convenience of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-24\">In denying the motion the learned justice at Special Term followed the practice settled in this department for more than a century. The rule was recently reiterated in Quinn v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>88 App. Div. 57, 84 N. Y. Supp. 738, and is as stated in the headnote, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-3\">\u201cThe place of trial of an action will not be changed from a rural county to either the county of New York or the county of Kings merely to subserve the convenience of witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">In that case the cause of action arose in Kings county, to which county the venue was sought to be changed;, but that fact was not regarded as of sufficient weight to overcome the long established practice. In order to justify a change of the place of trial, Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 987, requires that the ends of justice will be promoted, as well as the convenience of witnesses, and it has always been held in this department that the ends of justice are best subserved in that venue where a speedy trial can be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The plaintiff alleged, in his affidavit read on the motion, that he had a number of witnesses residing in the county of Orange; but the appellants claim that that fact could not be regarded, inasmuch as the names, addresses, and occupations are not given, nor is it stated that plaintiff is advised by counsel that the testimony of such witnesses is material and necessary. The omission does not constitute a defect, if the alleged convenience of witnesses is riot to control. As was said by the former General Term in this department in Tuthill v. Long Island R. R. Co., 75 Hun, 556, 557, 26 N. Y. Supp. 1029, 1030:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201cA cause upon the calendar of a country circuit can always be set down for trial for a day when it will be reached and tried. In that way the convenience of witnesses is best subserved, even though they all reside in the city in which the trial is sought to be had.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
