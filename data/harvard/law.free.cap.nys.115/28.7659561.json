Upon this affidavit an order was made di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>reeling the issuance of an execution to the sheriff of the county of New York, commanding him to levy and collect the plaintiff\u2019s judgment out of 10 per cent, of the income derived from such trust estate in the hands of the insurance and trust company. A motion was thereafter made by the defendant to vacate such order, which was denied, and defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">A question similar to the one presented by the appeal has already been passed upon by this court in King v. Irving, 103 App. Div. 420, 92 N. Y. Supp.1094, and Sloane v. Tiffany, 103 App. Div. 540, 93 N. Y. Supp. 149; and it was held that section 1391 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by chapter 461, p. 1071, of the laws of 1903, is not retroactive. And the Second Department, following these decisions, held in Ringe v. Mortimer, 116 App. Div. 722, 101 N. Y. Supp. 1110, that this section of the act, as amended by chapter 175, p. 370, of the Laws of 1905, did not have a retroactive effect. Since these decisions, the section was further amended by chapter 148, p. 433, of the Laws of 1908, which took effect September 1st of that year. This amendment, however, is immaterial, and in no way impairs the decisions theretofore made under the section. The trust created by the will of the defendant\u2019s father took effect upon his death, which occurred on the 23d of November, 1893. It was a valid trust, and he directed that the income from the trust fund should be paid to his son. Being a \"valid trust, he had a right to direct to whom the income should be paid, and the Legislature had no power to change it, or direct that payment should be made to any other person. A statute is not to be construed so as to have a retroactive effect, unless its terms require that it should be so construed. New York &amp; Oswego M. R. R. Co. v. Vanhorn, 57 N. Y. 473; Bottjer v. Supreme Council, 78 App. Div. 546, 75 N. Y. Supp. 805, 79 N. Y. Supp. 684. There is nothing in this statute indicating that the Legislature intended it should apply to a trust created and which became effective prior to the passage of the act; and, if such were the intent, the statute, in my opinion, would be unconstitutional, inasmuch as it would destroy at the time of its passage existing property rights, and this the Legislature does not have the power to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The order appealed from, therefore, should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
