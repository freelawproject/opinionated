The defense is the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The indebtedness is represented by a promissory note executed by said Andrew Moore to the plaintiff March 1, 1888, and payable one year after the date thereof. It is claimed that a payment was made thereon October 21, 1898. Andrew Moore died May 31, 1899. Letters of administration on his estate were issued July 10, 1899. This action was instituted January 17, 1908, or about 9 years 3 months after the alleged payment on the note. Section 1844 of the Code of Civil Procedure prohibited the institution of this action until three years had elapsed after letters of administration on the estate of the decedent were granted. It has been held that this was a statutory prohibition against the commencement of the action, within the meaning of section 406 of the Code of Civil Procedure, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201cWhere the commencement of an action has been stayed by injunction or other order of a court or judge or by statutory prohibition the time of the continuance of the stay is not a part of the time limited for the commencement of the-action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">See Mead v. Jenkins, 27 Hun, 570; Adams v. Fassett, 149 N. Y. 61, 43 N. E. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The six-year statute of limitations on the note, therefore, was extended as against these defendants in an action of this kind by the time which intervened between the death of the decedent and three years after letters of administration on his estate were issued. This latter extension was 3 years 1 month 10 days, which gave 9 years 1 month 10 days for the commencement of the action after the payment on the note of October 21, 1898. The time to commence the action, therefore, expired December 1, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s only answer to this difficulty is that section 1843 of the Code of Civil Procedure creates a new liability on which his action is based, and that the period of nine years for the commencement of the action dates from the death of the decedent, rather than from the payment on the note. It appears to have been thought otherwise in the cases above\u2019 cited. Section 1843 does not create an absolute liability against the heirs, but merely provides a method for enforcing an existing liability of the decedent against his assets which have come into the hands-of his. heirs. The same result might have been accomplished by proceeding in Surrogate\u2019s Court under section 2750 of the Code of Civil Procedure to sell the decedent\u2019s real estate for the payment of his debts. Plaintiff, for three years after letters of administration were issued, had an enforceable remedy against this real property by such a proceeding to reach, the same in Surrogate\u2019s Court, and immediately after the expiration of such remedy the present remedy became available to him. There have therefore been nine years since the payment on the note, during all of which time some action or proceeding could, have been taken for the enforcement of this indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
