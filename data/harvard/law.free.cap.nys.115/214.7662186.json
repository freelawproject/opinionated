On the 4th day of November, 1905, the relator reported for duty and was set at work temporarily as an oiler; the record showing that this was due to an exigency of the service. The position of oiler was rated at $75 per month. The relator worked one tour of duty, from midnight of November 4th to 8 o\u2019clock the following morning, and then left his work without leave of any one, and did not report again until the 9th, though he claims to have been looking for one Herrick, his superior, in order that he might protest against his work as an oiler, when he had been appointed to the position of water tender. On the 9th of November it appears that the relator found Mr. Herrick and made his protest, and that on the 13th he was dismissed from the service bn the ground, which was subsequently reported to the municipal civil service commission as required by subdivision 12 of rule 19, that he had left the service for a period of four days without leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">The theory of the relator seems to be that under rule 19, which requires that the commission shall \u201ccertify, from- the appropriate list the names of those standing highest thereon, and except as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>herein provided, such certification and appointments or selections for appointments therefrom shall be made in the manner prescribed by rule 11 for positions in the competitive class,\u201d he is entitled to a probationary appointment, which has a- secure tenure of existence during the term in a like manner as competitive appointees. Rule 11 provides that the \u201cperson selected shall be duly notified by the appointing officer, and upon accepting and reporting for duty, shall receive from such officer a certificate of appointment for a probationary period of three months\"; and it is under this clause that the relator claims exemption from the rule laid down in section 1543 of the Greater New York charter (Laws 1901, p. 636, c. 466). As we read rule 19, it has no relation whatever to the matter of the probationary appointment. It relates merely to the rule governing the selections to be made from the certified list, and not to the length of time for which they shall be appointed. The language- is that the commission shall \u201ccertify from the appropriate list the names of those standing highest thereon,\u201d and this certification \u201cand appointments or selections for appointments therefrom shall be made in the manner prescribed by rule 11.\u201d It is merely as to the certification of the commission as to those standing highest upon the appropriate list, and the \u201cappointments or selections for appointments therefrom,\u201d which are to be governed by rule 11, and it has nothing whatever to do with the terms of the employment. The Legislature and its creation, the municipal civil service commission, have not yet made it obligatory upon the municipality to retain in employment one who disregards the ordinary obligations of an employ\u00e9 in the simple duties of the noncompetitive civil service, and the relator, not being in the competitive class, and not being otherwise specially protected, comes within the provisions of section 1543 of the Greater New York charter, and .the order of the court at Special Term, dismissing the alternative writ of mandamus, is in accord with law and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
