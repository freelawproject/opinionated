He had a verdict, and from the judgment entered thereon, and an order denying a motion for a new trial, defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">The particular act of negligence complained of was a signal given by the defendant\u2019s superintendent, or a person performing acts of superintendence, by which an elevator on which the plaintiff was riding was caused to descend so rapidly that the fingers of one of his hands were injured by a wheelbarrow on the elevator coming in contact with them. The testimony offered on the part of the plaintiff tended to establish his claim, while that offered on the part of the defendant was to the effect that the plaintiff had frequently been warned not to ride on the elevator, that he gave the signal himself, and was responsible for his own injury. Which contention was correct presented a question of fact, which was for the determination of the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>and its finding on this branch of the case would be affirmed, were it not for the fact that errors were committed at the trial which call for \u2022a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The plaintiff, in order to establish his case under the employer\u2019s liability act, was permitted to introduce in evidence, against the defendant\u2019s objection and exception, a notice served upon the defendant prior to the commencement of the action. The objection to the notice should have been sustained. It is not a notice of the kind or character required by the act. The purpose of such a notice is to acquaint the employer with the particular negligent act for which it is proposed to hold him liable, and thus enable him to make the necessary inquiries, so that he can settle the claim without action, or, if action be brought, properly present his defense. Barry v. Derby Desk Co., 121 App. Div. 810, 106 N. Y. Supp. <em>575. </em>It is defective, in that it does not state the particular act of negligence complained of. It states simply that the injuries were caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, In that it failed\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">\u25a0\u201cto furnish me with a reasonably saf\u00e9 place and appliances in and with which to do the work, and failed to reasonably safeguard, inspect, and keep safe the \u25a0place and appliances with which I was directed to work, and failed to fur-nish me with proper and reasonably safe ways, works, and machinery, and \u2022in that you knowingly employed and retained incompetent foremen and co-workmen to guide, direct, and assist me in the performance of my work, .and failed to formulate, promulgate, and enforce proper rules and regulations for my safety and the safety of said coemploy\u00e9s, as a result of all of which I was caused and permitted to fall, and material fell upon me, and I sustained the injuries as aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">From this notice the defendant could gain no information as to the particular act of negligence of which the plaintiff complained. It is substantially the same as the notice pronounced defective by this court in Finnigan v. New York Contracting Co., 122 App. Div. 712, 107 N. Y. Supp. 855, recently affirmed by the Court of Appeals (not yet officially reported), 87 N. E. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The court also erred in charging the jury, to which an exception was taken, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">\u201cIf the foreman ordered the plaintiff to descend by the elevator, and gave the signal to descend rapidly, his act constituted negligence, which would \u00a1bind the defendant, and plaintiff would be entitled to recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Whether the order of the foreman, if given, were an act of negligence, was a question of fact to be determined by the jury, and not a question of- law to be determined by the court Nor was the erroneous instruction thus given cured by what subsequently occurred. In \u2022excepting to the instruction, counsel for the defendant said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\">\u201cI except to that part of your honor\u2019s charge in which you say, in effect, that, if the jury find that the foreman gave the wrong signal, that fact would \u00a1fasten negligence on the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">And plaintiff\u2019s counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-13\">\u201cWhile that is correct in substance, I ask your honor to change the form \u2022of that, so as to say that the jury would be at liberty to find negligence from ithat, instead of instructing them that that would be negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The court said, \u201cI acquiesce in the modification,\u201d and defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the charge as modified. By the modification the learned trial justice emphasized the erroneous instruction previously given, by saying it was \u201ccorrect in substance.\u201d Where a jury has been erroneously instructed as to the law applicable to the facts in the case, the error can only be cured by the trial justice withdrawing the charge as made in language so plain and explicit as to preclude an inference that the jury may have been influenced by it. Phillips v. New York Central &amp; Hudson R. R. Co., 127 N. Y. 657, 27 N. E. 978; Willard v. Press Pub. Co., 52 App. Div. 448, 65 N. Y. Supp. 73. This was not done. The jury were hot told, nor was even an intimation made, that they were not to be bound by the previous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">But, irrespective of the two errors alluded to, which require a reversal of the judgment, the record shows such statements on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel as call for condemnation, and might of themselves be sufficient ground for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u2022 Upon the grounds named, therefore, I think the judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
