Although the trial judge permitted himself to be harassed with 40 or more crude and repetitious objections to such evidence, instead of stopping them, the precise objection now urged was not presented, viz., that such expense was \u201cspecial damage\u201d and not pleaded. Strang v. Whitehead, 12 Wend. 64; Blynn v. Smith, 22 N. Y. St. Rep. 69. This objection is highly technical and has to be presented with precision like all special or technical objections. To loosely object that the evidence cannot be given under the complaint, or that such damage is not included in it, is too general. It does not point out to the court any precise objection. It was the duty of the attorney for the defendant to point out to the court that there is a rule of pleading that all special damage has to be specially pleaded, item by item, in order to be proved, and show that the damage came under that head.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Judgment and order of the Municipal Court affirmed, with costs. RICH, J., concurs. WOODWARD, JENKS, and MILLER, JJ., concur in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
