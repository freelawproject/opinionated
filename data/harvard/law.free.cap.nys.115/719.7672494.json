Among other defenses in his verified answer the defendant counterclaimed to recover the aforesaid sum paid by him, and likewise the cost of the keep of the horse, basing his claim upon an express warranty at the time of the sale, its breach, and his offer therefor to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-21\">The trial justice erroneously rendered judgment in favor of the defendant for the sum of $150 and $15 costs, because it is undisputed that the property in question was sold and delivered to, and taken away and kept by, the defendant, who from eight to ten days thereafter offered to return the property, claiming that the same was not as represented. Title had passed, and the defendant 'was not acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>\u25a0within his right; for, be the law otherwhere otherwise,* in this state, '\u201cif the sale is of existing \u00e1nd specific goods, with or without warranty. -of quality, the title at once passes to the purchaser, and, where there is an express warranty, it is, if untrue, at once broken, and the vendor becomes liable in damages, but the purchaser cannot for that reason -either refuse to accept the goods or return them.\u201d Brigg v. Hilton, 99 N. Y. 517, 529, 3 N. E. 51, 52 Am. Rep. 63, and cited as the rule in Fairbank Canning Co. v. Metzger, 118 N. Y. 260, 269, 23 N. E. 372, 16 Am. St. Rep. 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">If it be contended that the transaction between these parties was what is denominated a \u201csale or return\u201d\u2014that is, a bargain and sale upon a condition subsequent, title passing, subject to the right to rescind and return (Hunt v. Wyman, 100 Mass. 198, 200)\u2014and that '.there was evidence herein wherefrom the trial justice might find that such was the transaction in question, his finding would still be improper, because such a transaction was not alleged as claim, nor was motion made to conform the pleadings to the proof. It follows that the judgment should be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to \u2022abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">GILDERSLEEVE, P. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b752-8\">DAYTON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACl\">(dissenting). Plaintiff sold a horse and wagon to -defendant for $215, receiving on account $150 and a memorandum for $65, payable \u201cat the end of May, 1908,\u201d for which sum this action was brought June 10, 1908. The defense was breach of warranty, offer to return, and counterclaim for the $150 paid, as well as $60 board -of the horse after offer to return. Though the evidence was conflicting, it cannot be said that the findings of the trial judge on the facts \u25a0are against the weight of evidence. As plaintiff refused to accept the \u2022 return of the horse and wagon, the judgment in defendant\u2019s favor should be modified by providing that upon the payment of the judgment, with the costs of this appeal, plaintiff should be entitled to re\u25a0ceive the horse and wagon at defendant\u2019s place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">As so modified, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs as aforesaid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
