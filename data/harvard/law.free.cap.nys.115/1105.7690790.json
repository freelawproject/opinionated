The plaintiffs introduced the contract in evidence, and proved the delivery of the books, the payment of one installment, and that all the remaining installments were then due and owing. The appellant claims that, inasmuch as the contract reserved the title in the plaintiffs until the payments were complete, the plaintiffs cannot bring an action based on the theory of title having passed to the defendant upon delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-19\">Until all the installments were due the plaintiffs could not bring an action for goods sold and delivered and claim the entire piece (Mansfield v. Strauss [Sup.] 68 N. Y. Supp. 682); but after all the payments were due the plaintiffs could regard this contract as a cash sale made upon the same reservation of title. They would thereupon have the election of disaffirming the sale and replevying the goods, or of enforcing the sale and suing for the price. Kirk v. Crystal, 118 App. Div. 32, 103 N. Y. Supp. 17, affirmed without opinion Seaboard Nat. Bank v. Bank of America, 193 N. Y. 26, 85 N. E. 829. Until they have indicated their election by some unequivocal act, they have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>right to affirm or disaffirm the sale. In this case they have not previously made such election by demanding back the books, although it appears that they may have suggested that a return of the books \u2022voluntarily by the defendant would make a proper adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">The plaintiffs, therefore, have a right to maintain this action. They are entitled to interest upon the installments from the date when they wer\u00e9 due, without any demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
