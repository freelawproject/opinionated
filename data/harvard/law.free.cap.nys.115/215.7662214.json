The Special Term thereupon made an order that declared the demurrer frivolous and ordered judgment, with costs and $10 costs of the motion, but that also granted leave to the defendant, on payment of $10 costs of this motion, to serve an answer within 10 days. The plaintiff appeals from the part of the order that permits an answer. Section 497 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">When a demurrer is overruled as frivolous, the demurrant as a defendant should not be permitted to answer in course, but only upon a showing to the reasonable satisfaction of the court that the demurrer was interposed in good faith and that he has a valid defense. See Patten v. Harris, 10 Wend. 624; Miller v. Heath, 7 Cow. 101; Fisher v. Gould, 81 N. Y. 231; Osgood v. Whittelsey, 20 How. Prac. 72; Norwood v. Harris, 69 N. C. 204. It does not appear that the defendants even attempted to thus satisfy the court, and hence to permit this order to stand is a recognition of practice which is available for mere vexation or delay. Doubtless the Special Term, upon due and- diligent application, would withhold the entry of judgment upon the frivolous pleading to enable the pleader to satisfy the court that he should be permitted to answer upon proper terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The order, so far as appealed from, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, without prejudice to the respondent to apply for leave to answer. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
