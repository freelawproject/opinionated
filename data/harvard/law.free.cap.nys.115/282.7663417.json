Ninety-Nine Plaintiffs v. Vanderbilt, 4 Duer, 632. Where his want of authority transpires, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>court may arrest the prosecution he has instituted (Hudson River W. S. Ry. Co. v. Kay, 14 Abb. Prac. [N. S.] 191), and, conversely, disregard him and his contentions when he attempts to defend. To appear, therefore, for another\u2019s protection or for his own profit, a lawyer must make good the position he claims betimes and with proof. The authority herein assumed, having been impeached by the duly acknowledged statement and affidavit of the alleged client, the lawyer could not continue in the case upon his mere assertion and upon an unauthenticated statement of the person whom he would have for his client, and a direction of a verdict was proper..</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Having in view the restrictions in the paper as to costs, the learned trial justice indorsed upon the papers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201cJury directed, by the court to find for the possession of the property named in the writ, the value of which is fixed at $200.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Possibly this sum might have been for less, as the value stated by the plaintiff\u2019s witness was $150 to $200; but no harm will come thereby to the party named as defendant, if he, a janitor, without, so far as appears by the record, any pretentions to rights of ownership or possession, does not oppose the return of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
