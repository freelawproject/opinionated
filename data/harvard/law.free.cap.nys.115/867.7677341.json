The assessment is made pursuant to one of the by-laws of the plaintiff company, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-16\">\u201cWhen there are not sufficient funds in the treasurer\u2019s hands to pay the indebtedness of the corporation, an assessment shall be made on the stockholders to cover the amount necessary to cancel such indebtedness, unless otherwise arranged and paid by the board of directors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">This by-law authorizes an assessment only when there are not sufficient funds in the treasurer\u2019s hands to pay the indebtedness of the corporation, and then only authorizes an assessment for a sufficient amount to cancel the indebtedness. The proof on the trial was to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>effect that the assessment was made, not for the purpose of paying an indebtedness of the company over and above the funds on hand, but was to pay the estimates of the expenses for conducting the company for the current year. The fact that a portion of the year had expired before the assessment was made makes no difference, so long as it did not affirmatively appear that the amount of the assessment was required to pay for indebtedness then due above the moneys on hand. For this reason alone the learned County Court was correct in reversing the judgment of the justice of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
