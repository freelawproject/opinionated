Defendant was paid $25 on accqunt, but the ceremonies- did not transpire.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">The evidence was problematical as to the actual value of these articles, which had been in use about six ye\u00e1rs. \u2022 Plaintiff testified as to their cost. No market value was shown. A sexton testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>articles were'\u201cworth\u201d\" about' the sums claimed by plaintiff. As to the \u201cscroll\u201d defendant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-3\">\u201cIt\"; lays-there-in-the office; valueless things. - I wouldn\u2019t give $5 for it. Three parties .came for the scroll.\" - \u2022 .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The trial judge found for the. defendant. That the property belonged'to the plaintiff was undisputed; but that defendant did not know that fact-is also undisputed. The evidence justifies the conclusion that demand for the articles was made by plaintiff, and refused, because of the nonpayment of rent, by Potschin. _ Plaintiff is entitled to a return of the articles, or their value at the time of the trial, Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
