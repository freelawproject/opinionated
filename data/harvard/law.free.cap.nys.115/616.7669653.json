The plaintiff was. a tenant of defendant, occupying the ground floor of a building owned by her as a store. She occupied the floor over him as a residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-18\">The plaintiff testified that some time in August he heard a pounding in the defendant\u2019s apartments, and small portions of the plaster ceiling fell in his store; that he went upstairs and called the defendant\u2019s attention to it, and asked what was the matter with the ceiling, and she told him it was none of his business; that the day after the pounding was resumed, the ceiling broke,' and dirty water ran through it onto his stock of goods and fixtures, damaging them to the extent of $522. His wife, whom he called, testified to an entirely different transaction. She says that when the knocking was heard her husband said to the workmen, \u201cCome right in;\u201d that a workman came in, got up on a stepladder to fix the ceiling, and broke a pipe from which the water that flooded the store came. They both testify that after the flooding the plaintiff went upstairs and had the defendant come down<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>stairs and look at the condition of things. The defendant denies any knowledge of such a transaction. I am unable to find sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant to support the judgment. It is against the weight of the evidence, and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur, except JENKS and MILLER, JJ., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
