No appeal will lie from a default judgment, and as to that the appeal must be dismissed. Liebling v. Borg (Sup.) 113 N. Y. Supp. 549. The defendant\u2019s sufficient statements set forth in affidavits used on his motion to open his default are not contradicted, and it appears that on the day set for trial his attorney could not attend at the call of the calendar. It appears from the affidavit submitted by plaintiff\u2019s attorney that, when the case was called for trial, the defendant still not answering, plaintiff moved to strike out the answer of defendant on the ground that it was frivolous, so that no testimony was taken. This motion was granted and judgment given on the plaintiff\u2019s verified complaint in his favor, although the defendant had interposed a verified answer. This was error. There is no power given to the Municipal Court to strike out pleadings as frivolous or to give judgment on the pleadings under section 547, Code Civ. Proc., added by Laws 1908, p. 462, c. 166. The chapter of the Code \u2022 containing these provisions is applicable to courts of record only. Section 3347, subd. 4. Neither did the court below have power to impose $10 costs upon the denial of the motion to open the default. Klotz v. Frolich (Sup.) 108 N. Y. Supp. 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Appeal from judgment dismissed.
