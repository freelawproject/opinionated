At maturity the note was not paid. The defendant admitted the making of the note, and pleaded that the note was originally made and delivered as the result of fraud, false representation, and conspiracy. No evidence was offered to show that the plaintiff had any knowledge of the circumstances which the defendant pleaded as a defense. At the close'of the case the court directed a verdict for the defendant.
