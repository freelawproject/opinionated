It clearly appears that appellant has no funds of the estate in his hands wherewith to pay the costs, and the proceeding which culminated in the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>appealed from was in effect one to compel him to pay such costs personally. It was held in Matter of Humfreville, 154 N. Y. 115, 47 N. E. 1086, that the surrogate had no authority to enforce the payment of costs by contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to punish the appellant for contempt denied. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
