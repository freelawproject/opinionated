It is undoubtedly the general rule that the repetition of a legacy in the same instru* ment is substitutionary, and that the repetition of it by a second instrument, as in the case of a will and codicil, is accumulative; but this question, like every one of construction, is one of intention, to be determined from the intrinsic evidence of the documents themselves and the circumstances of the case (Dewitt v. Yates, 10 Johns. 156, 6 Am. Dec. 326; Southgate v. Continental Trust Company, 74 App. Div. 150, 73 N. Y. Supp. 718, 77 N. Y. Supp. 687), which is far from saying that extrinsic evidence may be admitted to show an intention different from that shown by the will itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Notwithstanding the general rule and the prefatory statement of the codicil that it is \u201cto be taken as a supplement and addition\u201d to the will, the internal evidence furnished by the will and the codicils conclusively sjiows that in making the second codicil the testator was engaged in substitution and not in addition. The codicil is complete in and of itself. Its evident purpose was to empower the executors to sell the real estate, and perhaps to drop out one executor. The language of the will is repeated almost literally. Why that was done, in place of merely making the desired changes, is a matter of speculation. If one part' of the codicil is to be regarded as \u201ca supplement and addition\u201d to the will, every part must be; whereas it is plain that much of it can only be substitutional\u2014i. e., the provision for the payment of debts, the disposition of the remainders, and the appointment of executors. Aside from the evidence already referred to, the disposition of the remainders by the fifth clause of the codicil is conclusive. -The language of that clause, quoted with but slight change from the similar clause in the will, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">\u2022\u201cMy executrix and executors, after paying my funeral expenses, just debts and the legacies mentioned in the above items, shall divide the balance of my property into two equal shares.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The words \u201cabove items\u201d obviously refer to the earlier provisions of the. codicil. After paying the debts and funeral expenses and the legacies mentioned in the codicil, the executors were required to divide the balance of the property into two equal shares and to distribute them as thereafter provided. The words used do not admit of a construction that the balance of the property remaining, after paying the legacies provided for in the codicil, in addition to those provided for in the will itself, should be divided; and thus the internal evidence of an intention to provide for substitution, and not accumulation, becomes conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Orange county affirmed, .with costs to the respondents, payable out of the estate. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
