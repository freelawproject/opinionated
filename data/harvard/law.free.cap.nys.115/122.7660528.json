The answer alleged the binding- and delivery of all the complete sheets and payment therefor, and that any incomplete sets of sheets were held for a reasonable time subject to the order of Joseph Cohn.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">The testimony is voluminous, but preponderates in defendant\u2019s favor to the effect that the sheets received from. the Empire Storage Company about November, 1906 (being those in controversy here) were soiled, mice-eaten, and defective from the absence of quite a number of pages, of all of which Joseph Cohn was duly notified. The evidence as to damages was based upon retail sales of the books at $1.50 to $2 each, without proof of public demand therefor, or any statement of the \u2022 actual total cost of production, including necessary business expenses or net profits per volume, so that the proper measure of damages was not furnished, even if plaintiff was entitled to recover, which he was not, as above indicated.
