J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6p\">Upon a reargument of this appeal, and a full examination of the authorities, we are satisfied that the order of the lower court must be reversed. Issue was joined herein on September 30, 1904, and up to March <em>26, </em>1908, the plaintiff made no move to bring the cause on for trial. Upon the motion to dismiss for such failure to prosecute, the only offered excuse for such delay was that \u201coffers of settlement have been made, commencing prior to the service of the summons, and renewed subsequently from time to time,\u201d and also that the case had been placed upon the calendar for trial, \u201cthough subsequent to the date of this motion.\u201d It will be observed that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>is no statement in the affidavit as to when the offers of settlement ceased, and the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney that \u201cwhatever negotiations were had in this matter were concluded before the filing of an answer\u201d stands uncontradicted in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">Affidavits have been handed up by the respondent upon this reargument in an attempt to strengthen the respondent\u2019s position; but such affidavits form no part of the return, cannot be considered, and there is neither precedent nor authority for such practice, and it is not to be regarded with favor. The only ground given by the learned Special Term justice for denying the motion was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-6\">\u201cIt appearing that a note of issue has been filed in good faith, the motion to dismiss will be denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-7\">This was an inadequate reason for a denial of the motion. Seymour v. L. S. &amp; M. S. R. R., 12 App. Div. 300, 301, <em>42 N. </em>Y. Supp. 92. In the case of Mladinick v. Livingston, 112 App. Div. 181, 98 N. Y. Supp. 46, the court relieved the plaintiff by reason of the fact that he had noticed the case for trial and placed it on the calendar prior to the making of the motion by the defendant, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-8\">\u201cIf this motion had been made by the defendant before the plaintiff had noticed the case and placed it upon the calendar, I should think that upon these papers the defendant was entitled to the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">It devolved upon the plaintiff to show a reasonable excuse for his delay, and without such excuse the court below had no discretion to deny the defendant\u2019s motion. Fisher Malting Co. v. Brown, 92 App. Div. 251, 87 N. Y. Supp. 37; Mladinick v. Livingston, 112 App. Div. 181, 98 N. Y. Supp. 46; Anderson v. Hedden, 116 App. Div. 231, 101 N. Y. Supp. 585; Toher v. Lochinvar Realty Co., 124 App. Div. 370; 108 N. Y. Supp. 667; Zafarano v. Baird, 80 App. Div. 144, 80 N. Y. Supp. 510; Regan v. Milliken Bros., 123 App. Div. 72, 107 N. Y. Supp. <em>722; </em>St. Paul\u2019s Church v. Mt. Vernon Suburban Land Co., 119 App. Div. 45, 103 N. Y. Supp. 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to dismiss granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">SEABURY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1120-12\">MacLEAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJh\">(dissenting). Where the plaintiff unreasonably neglects to proceed in his action, the justice to whom application is made is equipped by the statute (section 822, Code Civ. Proc.) truly with discretion whether or not to dismiss the complaint; but that discretion would have been exercised more discreetly in this instance had the learned justice, in denying the application, imposed terms, and so, under all the circumstances, and following Mladinick v. Livingston, 112 App. Div. 181, 98 N. Y. Supp. 46, the plaintiff should have an opportunity to try his cause, and should have that opportunity upon payment of taxable costs and disbursements before trial, with motion costs, but without costs upon this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
