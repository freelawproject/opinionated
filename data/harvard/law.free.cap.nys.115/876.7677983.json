The case was argued with the case of Mayor, etc., of the City of New York v. Broadway &amp; Seventh Avenue Railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Company (decided herewith) 115 N. Y. Supp. 872. The defendant in this case acquired a franchise by virtue of a resolution of the common council of the city of New York passed on the 28th day of December, 1853, which provided 'that the said grantees (the defendant\u2019s predecessors in title) \u201cshall keep the space between the tracks and the space for two feet each side of the same at all times in thorough repair.\u201d By chapter 411, p 715, of the Laws of 1860, this grant was confirmed, and the grantees were authorized and empowered to lay, construct, operate, and run a railroad over, upon, and through the avenues, streets, and places in said resolution mentioned, with the like power and subject to the like regulations as those specified in the said resolution. The defendant subsequently acquired the right of the grantees in this franchise and constructed the road under its provisions. It seems to me that this clearly imposed upon the defendant the obligation from time to time to lay such pavements in the street as should be necessary to keep it in thorough repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">By the provisions of section 98 of the general railroad law (chapter 565, p. 1112, of the Laws of 1890), which took effect on May 1, 1891, the obligation was imposed upon all railroads to have and keep in repair the pavement between their tracks and two feet outside of its tracks, a provision which was discussed in the opinion in the Broadway &amp; Seventh Avenue Case (decided herewith) 115 N. Y. Supp. 872. On February 24, 1890, the commissioner of public works addressed a letter to the defendant, calling its attention to the fact that the city was about to repave certain streets with granite block pavement, that the defendant was under an obligation to. repave the space between the tracks, and notifying the defendant that, unless it comply with its obligations to pave these streets, the department would proceed to make such repavement at the expense of the defendant. No reply having been received to this letter, on June 10, 1890, the commissioner again notified the defendant that the department was about to enter into a contract for repaving certain streets, asking the defendant whether they would do the work, or preferred to have the work done under the department contracts and pay the city for the expense incurred. On February 26, 1891, a similar notice was given to the defendant in relation to certain other streets specified in the notice; and on March 19, 1891, the commissioner again called attention to these notices, and stated that he was without reply and that no reply had been received. Whereupon the defendant wrote to the commissioner that the pavements between the defendant\u2019s rails and the space for two feet each side of the same in the street had been kept by the company at all times in thorough repair, and they were advised that the company was not responsible for the proposed new pavement mentioned in the commissioner\u2019s letter. \u201cWe therefore have no desire to negotiate with your contractors for repavement of any portion of the' streets within or about our tracks.\u201d Following this notice, the city went on and completed the pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">I think this was a waiver of the requirements for notice, and justified the city in proceeding with the repavement required without further notice to the defendant, and as both by the original resolution of the common council, under which the defendant acquired the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>construct its railroads in these streets, and under the provisions of section 98 of the railroad law of 1890, the defendant was bound to repave the streets when necessary, that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for the cost of the repavements.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">It follows that the judgment in this case is reversed, and a new trial ordered before the same referee, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
