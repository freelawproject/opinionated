The confession was made while appellant was in the custody of the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s office in Ft. Lauder-dale, Florida, awaiting extradition to Cincinnati. Actually, the Ft. Lauder-dale police had sought appellant for some time in their area. This was upon the recommendation of Detective Davis, who had received information through telephone calls from appellant\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">On the morning of April 1, 1985, appellant was arrested by the combined forces of the Ft. Lauderdale and the Oakland Park Police Departments. While at the Oakland Park police headquarters, he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. At that time, he acknowledged that he wished to make a statement without an attorney present, but then added: \u201cMaybe I should have an attorney.\u201d Interpreting this statement as an invocation of the right to counsel, police ceased all interrogation and informed the Cincinnati homicide department of the arrest. Appellant was then transferred to the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Department. No attorney was provided to appellant between the time when police ended their interrogation and the time, some hours later, when appellant confessed to the Cincinnati homicide detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">At 9:20 p.m., the detectives arrived at the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s office, where they met with appellant. Initially, they discussed the extradition of appellant to Cincinnati. Apparently appellant had, subsequent to his post-arrest interrogation, voluntarily communicated to the Ft. Lauderdale police that he desired to waive the extradition process so as to expedite his return to Cincinnati. This had been communicated to the homicide detectives prior to their departure from Cincinnati. They sought to confirm these facts and also to inform appellant of their intention to leave for Cincinnati on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">During the conversation, Detective Davis told appellant that he, Davis, had been in contact with appellant\u2019s mother and that \u201cwe had a lot to talk to him about.\u201d The detective informed him that the detectives could not talk to him unless appellant wanted to talk to them and make a statement. Appellant replied that he also had spoken with his mother, that she had advised him to \u201cjust tell the truth,\u201d and that he wanted to make a statement. Thereafter, police explained the <em>Miranda </em>rights to him, specifically asking if he now desired \u00e1n attorney, to which he replied that he did not. Appellant then signed a Notification of Rights/Waiver of Rights form. Afterwards, a recording device was turned on and the police again explained to appellant all of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, pausing after each right to inquire whether appellant understood. They informed him that he could end the session at any time, after which they also inquired as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. And uh you do wanna make uh statement. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">\u201cA. Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">\u201cQ. An\u2019 I understand that you were arrested today at approximately what time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\">\u201cA. 10:50 this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-12\">\u201cQ. Okay, an\u2019 as you were being booked, you were given your rights by Sgt., I believe, Perry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-14\">\u201cQ. Okay, an\u2019 I also understand at that time you indicated to him that you wanted to make uh statement but that you wanted to confer with a lawyer first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-15\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-16\">\u201cQ. Okay. But you have since changed your mind. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-17\">\u201cA. Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u201cQ.

Nobody\u2019s used any force, no coercion of any kind against you to make a statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">\u201cA. No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\u201cQ. Can you explain why you changed your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">\u201cA. Uh, I talked to my Mom today an\u2019 she jus\u2019 told me, you know, be cooperative an\u2019 jus\u2019 tell the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">\u201cQ. An\u2019 that\u2019s when you, you, did you say you\u2019re waivin\u2019 your rights to an attorney at this time, after talkin\u2019 to your Mom[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\">\u201cA. Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">Appellant then made a full and graphic confession, which is attached hereinafter as the Appendix. The confession included an admission to the killing of David Self as well as to the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">Appellant now asserts that the confession should have been suppressed in its entirety because it was the product of an interrogation which occurred <em>after </em>appellant requested to speak with an attorney and which thus violated the mandate set forth in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">In <em>Edwards, </em>it was held that a suspect who has \u201cexpressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, <em>unless the accused himself </em>initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484-485. In subsequent cases, it has been determined that police may not reinitiate an interrogation under the guise of a \u201cgeneralized discussion * * * [about] the investigation.\u201d <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 1039, 1045. Also, in <em>Wyrick </em>v. <em>Fields </em>(1982), 459 U.S. 42, 46, it was held that interrogation may not resume \u201cunless the suspect himself initiates dialogue with the authorities.\u201d Most recently, these views were reaffirmed in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Roberson </em>(1988), 486 U.S ---, 100 L. Ed. 2d 704, 108 S. Ct. 2093.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-19\">Having reviewed the record as well as the applicable case law, we conclude that the trial court did not err when it refused to suppress the confession at issue because the record demonstrates that appellant himself reinitiated his own interrogation through a third party. At the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, Detective Davis was questioned about how he came to believe that appellant had changed his mind and now wished to make a statement without the benefit of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-20\">\u201cQ. And immediately after Mr. VanHook indicated that to you did you provide him with the Miranda warning</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-21\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-22\">\u2018 \u2018Q. \u2014 and the reason \u2014. Had you had communications with Mr. Van-Hook\u2019s mother before going to Florida?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-23\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-24\">\u201cQ. And, had she indicated to you that she had talked to Mr. VanHook?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-25\">\u201cA. She had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-26\">\u201cQ. And did she indicate to you anything that Mr. VanHook had told her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-27\">\u201cMr. Mathews: To which I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-28\">\u201cThe Court: Objection will be sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-29\">\u201cQ. After speaking with Mrs. VanHook, did you think that Robert VanHook might want to talk to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-30\">\u201cMr. Mathews: To which I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-31\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled. You may answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-32\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-33\">\u201cQ. And why was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-34\">\u2018 \u2018Mr. Mathews: To which I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-35\">\u201cThe Court: Just a moment. Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u201cA. She had told me \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">\u201cThe Court: [Objection sustained.].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Throughout the hearing, it was made clear that appellant had called his mother while he was in the custody of the Florida police. Detective Davis testified that thereafter he had been in communication with appellant\u2019s mother, and that this was prior to his flight to Ft. Lauderdale. It was Detective Davis\u2019s specific testimony that he conceived a belief that appellant would <em>want </em>to talk to him because of what \u201c[s]he [appellant\u2019s mother] had told me \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Although it is abundantly clear that the trial court erroneously excluded the content of appellant\u2019s statements to his mother, see Evid. R. 101(C)(3) and 104(A), we observe that such content is inferable from the record, specifically, that appellant had told his mother that he wanted to talk to Detective Davis. Concerning the initial part of Detective Davis\u2019s meeting with appellant, at which point no interrogation had occurred, but during which appellant stated that he would waive extradition, the detective testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">\u201cWe advised him that we had a lot to talk to him about. I advised him that <em>I had been in contact with his mother, </em>[and] * * * that we could not talk to him unless he wanted to talk to us and make a statement. He at that time replied that he had talked to his mother, and she had advised him to just tell the truth, and that he had, <em>that he did want to make a statement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">This was reaffirmed in the taped conversation wherein appellant repudiated his earlier request for an attorney and stated that he had changed his mind earlier that day during a conversation with his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">As previously indicated, Detective Davis\u2019s belief that appellant would want to talk to him occurred after and because of what appellant\u2019s mother had said'to him. In the context of this conversation, both appellant and Detective Davis predicated their conversation upon what had been spoken with appellant\u2019s mother. It is most clear that appellant had agreed to act upon his mother\u2019s advice \u201cto tell the truth\u201d and thus to \u201cmake a statement.\u201d Obviously, this was the subject of appellant\u2019s conversation with his mother, and he communicated his agreement to do so to her. That this had been communicated to Detective Davis is quite apparent from the context in which the detective utilized the fact of his conversation with appellant\u2019s mother, <em>i.e., </em>as a basis for inquiring whether appellant indeed wished to make a statement. It would have had little meaning, particularly in light of appellant\u2019s response, unless both men understood that appellant\u2019s desire to make a voluntary statement had been communicated to Detective Davis through appellant\u2019s mother. Such communication constituted a reinstitution of conversation with police. A suspect who has ended interrogation by requesting the assistance of counsel may himself reinitiate the interrogation before counsel has been provided. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 477, and <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Roberson </em>(1988), 486 U.S. _, 100 L. Ed. 2d 704, 108 S. Ct. 2093. He may also reinitiate such interrogation through the agency of a non-attorney third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">Our conclusion is further strengthened by the clarity with which appellant expressed his resolve to speak with police and his explanation that it was based upon discussions which he initiated with his mother. Furthermore, the decision to speak apparently had been reached earlier in the day, and thus well before he met with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Detective Davis. As such, the decision was made independently of anything police had said or done, and only after the most excruciating care had been taken to assure the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s statement. Moreover, the record reveals that appellant is both articulate and intelligent. See, <em>e.g., </em>his unsworn statement made during the sentencing phase. Once an accused \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d elects to proceed without counsel, the uncounseled statements he then makes need not be excluded at trial. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1988), 487 U.S __, __, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 271-272, 108 S. Ct. 2389, 2393-2394. Accordingly, we affirm the introduction of appellant\u2019s confession into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Appellant\u2019s second proposition of law challenges the admissibility of this confession on the ground that the corpus delicti of the aggravated murder was not established. Appellant argues that, where a defendant is charged with aggravated murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing the commission or attempted commission of aggravated robbery, R.C. 2903.01(B), the state must separately prove the corpus delicti of the aggravated robbery as well as that of the homicide before a confession to both is admissible in its entirety. According to appellant, the court should have redacted the confession, leaving out those matters which were pertinent to the theft of the gold chains and a leather jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The corpus delicti of a crime consists of two elements: the act and the criminal agency of the act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Maranda </em>(1916), 94 Ohio St. 364, 114 N.E. 1038. Before an out-of-court confession will be admitted, the corpus delicti must be established by evidence outside the confession. However, \u201c[i]t is sufficient if there is <em>some </em>evidence outside of the confession that tends to prove <em>some </em>material element of the crime charged.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Maranda, supra, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. For example, when the offense is homicide, the corpus delicti \u201cinvolves two elements, <em>i.e., </em>(1) the fact of death and (2) the existence of the criminal agency of another as the cause of death.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manago </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 223, 226-227, 67 O.O. 2d 291, 293, 313 N.E. 2d 10, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">The purpose of requiring the evidence of the corpus delicti as a founda: tion for admitting a confession was explained by the <em>Maranda </em>court: \u201cThe doctrine * * * was born out of great caution by the courts, in consideration of certain cases of homicide wherein it had turned out that by reason of the failure of the government to prove the death of the person charged as having been murdered it so happened that such person sometimes survived the person accused as his murderer.\u201d <em>Maranda, supra, </em>at 370, 114 N.E. at 1040. In light of the myriad procedural protections granted defendants in modern criminal practice, however, \u201cthe <em>corpus delicti </em>rule is supported by few practical or social policy considerations.\u201d This court has refused to apply it \u201cwith a dogmatic vengeance.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St. 2d 31, 35-36, 30 O.O. 3d 18, 21, 358 N.E. 2d 1051, 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">With this view before us, we point out that we have ordinarily required separate proof of the corpus delicti of both the homicide and the robbery. <em>E.g., Edwards, supra, </em>at 35, 3 O.O. 3d at 20, 358 N.E. 2d at 1056; <em>State </em>v. <em>Black </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 304, 308, 8 O.O. 3d 296, 297, 376 N.E. 2d 948, 951. We hasten to point out, however, that the standard of proof is not a demanding one. The prosecution need only adduce <em>\u201csome </em>proof * * * <em>tending </em>to prove [the act and its agency],\u201d but not necessarily such evidence as would rise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>to the level of a prima facie case. (Emphasis added in part.) <em>Ma/randa, supra, </em>at 370-371, 114 N.E. at 1040. Also, as previously mentioned, Ohio does not require evidence upon all elements of the crime but only <em>\u201csome </em>material element.\u201d <em>Maranda, supra, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Turning to the case before us, evidence that the victim was murdered is evidence that deadly force and a deadly weapon were utilized. Also, at trial, Stephen Wood testified that at about 9:00 a.m. on February 19, he noticed that the door to David Selfs apartment was open. Wood went inside and found the victim\u2019s body. He testified that the victim\u2019s apartment was \u201cneat most of the time,\u201d but that \u201cthings were * * * tossed around\u201d the apartment. In support of this, the state adduced photographs taken of the apartment as it was discovered on the morning after the murder. State\u2019s exhibit 32 shows the desk in the victim\u2019s bedroom with its drawer missing. State\u2019s exhibit 33 shows the missing drawer lying face up on top of the air conditioner, and near the bed. State\u2019s exhibit 31 shows a dresser in the victim\u2019s bedroom. One drawer is open, as is the jewelry box on top of the dresser. State\u2019s exhibit 36 shows a small piece of jewelry located on the floor near the dresser. This evidence of the general disarrayed condition of the apartment, together with the specific fact that normally closed containers in which valuables were customarily kept were found open with the contents upon the floor, would indicate that a search was made of the premises, and that by the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Finally, and of even greater significance, the bartender at the Subway Bar testified that the victim wore a gold chain around his neck when he left the bar with appellant on the night of his murder. The state conclusively demonstrated that the body as found did not have the chain upon it. This chain was never recovered. Its unexplained absence coupled with the circumstances of the murder strongly indicates that the gold chain was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Appellant asserts that someone other than appellant might have been responsible for the apartment\u2019s condition, since the door had been left open and at least one other person entered before police arrived. However, the identity of the criminal agent is not part of the corpus delicti, since the purpose is simply to establish that the crime occurred. See, <em>e.g., Groves </em>v. <em>State </em>(Ind. App. 1985), 479 N.E. 2d 626. Nor is it necessary to establish that the evidence exclude all other reasonable theories. <em>Black, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">In conclusion on this point, there was considerable evidence that the victim had been robbed as well as murdered. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence <em>dehors </em>the confession to firmly establish the corpus delicti predicate for its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">By his third proposition of law, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously determined that the mitigating factor found in R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) did not exist. This statute states:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\u201cWhether, at the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a mental disease or defect, <em>lacked substantial capacity </em>to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion, set forth in its sentencing opinion and relied upon by appellant, asserted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">\u201c* * * [T]he defendant has <em>never </em>suffered from a mental disease or defect which would have prevented the defendant from distinguishing right from wrong or would have prevented him from conforming his conduct to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the requirements of the law. In other words the <em>defendant has never suffered from any psychosis. </em>Instead, he has been diagnosed over many years as having a borderline personality disorder which manifests itself in all types of antisocial behavior. This disorder is not a product of a mental illness or disease, so says the overwhelming weight of the professional testimony.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument is premised upon the testimony of his psychiatrist, Dr. Emmett Cooper, who provided expert testimony during the sentencing phase. During the guilt phase, he asserted that appellant suffered from \u201ca borderline personality disorder\u201d characterized by impulsive behavior, self-damaging acts, substance abuse, unpredictable behavior, lack of control of anger, problems with self-control and gender identity, and mood swings. He stated further that the appellant had chronic feelings of impotence, loneliness, boredom, depression and irritability. It was the expert\u2019s conclusion that appellant experienced \u201can acute break with reality and acute psychosis\u201d which interfered with his ability to perceive right from wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Even a cursory glance at these alleged indications of \u201cborderline personality disorder\u201d demonstrates the reasonableness of the trial court\u2019s conclusions. Although the prosecution presented no evidence to rebut the expert\u2019s contentions, the psychiatric opinions offered during the guilt phase, which were fully available for consideration during the sentencing phase, overwhelmingly agreed that appellant was not suffering from any mental disease or defect. Further, the court concluded that appellant\u2019s claim of voluntary intoxication, and that it caused him to lose \u201ctouch with reality for some unspecified period of time while he mutilated the body of the victim,\u201d was nothing more than an attempt by appellant \u201cto weave a story which might cause the three-judge panel to conclude that he was not in control of his faculties at the time he committed this heinous act.\u201d Dr. Cooper\u2019s testimony was based upon his assumption that appellant had indeed ingested alcohol and drugs just prior to the offense. In commenting specifically upon this testimony, the court refused to accept Dr. Cooper\u2019s theory of \u201cthe defendant\u2019s bizarre conduct.\u201d Having concluded that there was ho \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d because of which appellant lacked the \u201csubstantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law,\u201d the court was fully justified in refusing to find the existenc\u00e9 of a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Appellant also asserts under this same proposition of law that the standard to establish the above mitigating factor is identical to that required to find one not guilty by reason of insanity. Thus, once an insanity defense is disproved by the state in the guilt phase, a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) would be automatically precluded. We note that the mitigating factor as set forth above utilizes the term \u201csubstantial capacity\u201d which is a term allowing a broader range of conditions than the term \u201ccapacity\u201d standing alone. Of course, under either standard, it must be demonstrated that such lack of capacity resulted from a mental disease or defect. This appellant has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Further, appellant argues that even if his mental state could not be characterized as a mental disease or defect, his condition should have been considered under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7)\u2019s catchall provision for: \u201cAny other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>tenced to death.\u201d However, the trial court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">\u201cIt is true, that the defendant was afflicted with deficiencies of personality which suggested that he was destined to get into trouble. However, those same personality characteristics which allowed him to live and work within a community and society in a peaceful fashion when he chose to, compels [sic] this Court to a conclusion that the defendant functioned as a <em>rational human being </em>during the period of time surrounding the criminal activity of which he has been convicted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Accordingly, the trial court found, as we also do, that appellant\u2019s ability to distinguish right from wrong and/or to conform his conduct so as to abstain from the wrong was <em>not </em>impaired at all. There is therefore no need to consider the issue of such impairment under the catchall phrasing of R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Appellant, by his fourth proposition of law, asserts several arguments against the constitutionality of capital punishment and the Ohio statutes pertinent thereto. It is initially asserted that the multiple use of aggravated robbery to provide both the aggravating factor for aggravated murder and the specification rendering the offender eligible for the death penalty fails to constitutionally narrow the class of murderers to those deserving of the death penalty. Additionally, the same reasoning is applied to the use of the aggravated robbery charge during the sentencing phase of the trial. We have previously considered and rejected these arguments in <em>State </em>v. <em>Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St. 3d 1, 3-4, 520 N.E. 2d 568, 571; <em>State </em>v. <em>Greer </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St. 3d 236, 530 N.E. 2d 382; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 164, 177-178, 15 OBR 311, 322-323, 473 N.E. 2d 264, 279-280; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St. 3d 16, 23, 23 OBR 13, 20, 490 N.E. 2d 906, 914. Furthermore, the standards of appellate review set forth in the statute are fully sufficient to constitutionally guide appellate analyses in capital cases. <em>Proffitt </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 242; <em>Jurek </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Also, appellant challenges the provisions of Grim. R. 11(C)(3) which allow the trial court to dismiss the . death penalty specification if the one so indicted pleads guilty and the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d so require. It is asserted that the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d standard is so vague as to be unconstitutional and also that it unfairly encourages pleas of guilty. We have already determined that the rule\u2019s standard provides sufficient guidance to the trial court\u2019s discretion. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Nabozny </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 195, 200, 8 O.O. 3d 181, 183-184, 375 N.E. 2d 784, 789. Nor does Crim. R. 11(C)(3) improperly encourage guilty pleas. <em>State </em>v. <em>Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 111, 125-126, 31 OBR 273, 286, 509 N.E. 2d 383, 396; <em>State </em>v. <em>Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 124, 138, 22 OBR 203, 215, 489 N.E. 2d 795, 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Appellant further argues under this proposition of law that the Ohio death penalty statute is unconstitutional for the following reasons: it does not allow the jury to grant mercy; it requires the jury to recommend death if aggravating circumstances even slightly outweigh the mitigating factors; it is not the least restrictive means of achieving permissible state interests; and the statute does not require the jury to explain its recommendation in writing, does not require the trial and appellate courts to apply the reasonable doubt standard to their independent review, and does not give guidelines for the proportionality review. These arguments have all been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>previously considered and rejected by this court. <em>Steffen, supra, </em>at 125, 31 OBR at 285-286, 509 N.E. 2d at 396; <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>at 167-168 and 176-177, 15 OBR at 314 and 321-322, 473 N.E. 2d at 272 and 278-279; <em>State </em>v. <em>Zuern </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 56, at 63-64, 512 N.E. 2d 585, at 592-593.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Appellant finally argues that the death penalty is disproportionately severe in this case because the county prosecutor has declined to seek it in other cases involving aggravated murder in the commission of aggravated robbery. \u201cThis issue was not raised at trial and [appellant\u2019s] allegations are therefore not supported by the record.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 79, 86, 512 N.E. 2d 611, 619. They are deemed waived. <em>State </em>v. <em>Greer, supra. </em>Moreover, we have upheld such exercise of prosecutorial discretion in prior cases. See <em>Greer, supra, </em>at 247, 530 N.E. 2d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">We now independently evaluate whether the aggravating circumstances which characterized appellant\u2019s conviction outweighed that evidence set forth as mitigation during the sentencing phase. A review of the record discloses that none of the mitigating factors set forth in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) through (6) is applicable. Appellant presented notable evidence to the effect that his mental condition was either diseased or defective and/or that the events resulted from ingestion of drugs and alcohol. In light of the record, we find such theories not to be credible. Although we are persuaded that appellant experienced considerable difficulty due to an emotionally unstable home life while growing up, many persons encounter such difficulties without turning to violent criminal conduct. Moreover, the evidence of the aggravating circumstances associated with this savage murder and robbery clearly overwhelms the scant evidence offered in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">We now consider whether the sentence imposed upon appellant in this case is disproportionate or excessive in comparison with the penalty imposed in cases with similar facts. This court has approved the death penalty in prior cases of aggravated murder involving an aggravated robbery. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 380, 395, 513 N.E. 2d 754, 768, and cases set forth in fn. 10; see, also, <em>Greer, supra. </em>We now conclude that the sentence of death is neither excessive nor disproportionate, but, in light of the facts of the case before us, is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-12\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher and Douglas, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b325-13\">Wright and H.

Because I believe that appellant\u2019s inculpatory statement to Cincinnati homicide investigators at the Broward County, Florida, jail was the product of an unconstitutional interrogation, initiated by police after appellant had invoked his right to counsel, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b325-16\">The relevant facts in this case are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">Florida police officers arrested appellant on the morning of April 1, 1985, and took him to the police station in Oakland Park, Florida. Appellant was advised of his rights, acknowledging his understanding of each right after it was read to him. Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Kenneth Perry of the Oakland Park Police Department asked appellant \u201cif he wished to make a statement without an attorney present.\u201d Appellant agreed, then paused and said, \u201cMaybe I should have an attorney.\u201d The Florida officers then stopped the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Officer William Davis and Specialist Kerry Rowland of the Cincinnati Police Department arrived at the jail about 9:20 p.m. and asked that appellant be brought to an interview room. Appellant did not yet have counsel. When appellant entered the room, the officers identified themselves and told appellant that they were aware appellant was waiving extradition and that they were taking him back to Cincinnati.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Officer Davis then told appellant that he and Rowland \u201chad a lot to talk to him about.\u201d Davis said that he had been in contact with appellant\u2019s mother. Davis told appellant that the officers could not talk to him unless he wanted to talk to them. According to Davis, appellant told the officers that he had spoken with his mother, who had advised him to tell the truth, and that he wanted to make a statement. Appellant then made a recorded statement in which he admitted killing and robbing David Self. Appellant\u2019s statement concerning the robbery is the only probative evidence of this aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The majority opinion and the. state suggest that appellant told his mother to inform the Cincinnati police that appellant was ready to talk. THE RECORD DOES NOT SHOW THAT APPELLANT TOLD HIS MOTHER THIS AND THE TRIAL COURT MADE NO SUCH FINDING. In fact, at a hearing on a motion to suppress, this exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. And it\u2019s your testimony today that he [defendant] didn\u2019t call or <em>he didn\u2019t have anybody call you </em>and say to come to the jail when you arrived in Ft. Lauderdale, that he wanted to talk with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">\u201cA. [Officer Davis] That\u2019s correct.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Later in the hearing on cross-examination of Davis by the state, this exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">\u201cQ. \u25a0 And was it your testimony that when you approached Mr. Van-Hook you had indicated to him you were not going to interrogate him because he had previously requested a lawyer? Did you tell Mr. VanHook that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-12\">\u201cA. No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-13\">\u201cQ. How did that exactly happen then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-14\">\u201cA. I advised Mr. VanHook that we had a lot to talk about, and that we could not talk to him unless he himself wanted to make a statement. And he at that point indicated he had talked to his mother, and that she had told him just to tell the truth, and he wanted to make a statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-15\">\u201cQ. And immediately after Mr. VanHook indicated that to you did you provide him with the Miranda warning</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-16\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-17\">\u201cQ. \u2014 and the reason \u2014. Had you had \u25a0 communication with Mr. Van-Hook\u2019s mother before going to Florida?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-18\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-19\">\u201cQ. And, had she indicated to you that she had talked to Mr. VanHook?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-20\">\u201cA. She had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-21\">\u201cQ. And did she indicate to you anything that Mr. VanHook had told her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-22\">\u201cMR.

MATHEWS: To which I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled, you may answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cA.

I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: My apologies. I <em>sustained, </em>the objection rather than overruled [it]. Pardon me.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">For whatever reason, the court excluded the content of this conversation despite the fact that hearsay is admissible in a suppression hearing. Evid. R. 101(C)(1) and 104(A). Because the state made no proffer, whatever appellant\u2019s mother told Officer Davis is not in the record, and thus not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">From these facts, it is this court\u2019s duty to determine whether the interrogation by Cincinnati police was improper and whether the derivative confession should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">The starting point of any analysis into custodial interrogation is <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 477. In that case, the Supreme Court held at 484-485 that a suspect who has \u201cexpressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-17\">The prophylactic rule of the <em>Edwards </em>case came as a corollary to the rule stated in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 474, that \u201c[i]f the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d In such an instance, the Supreme Court has concluded that \u201c[i]f the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, <em>a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-19\">In <em>Edwards, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cit is inconsistent with <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny for the authorities, at their instance, to reinterrogate an accused in custody if he has clearly asserted his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Edwards, supra, </em>at 485. The court concluded that reinterrogation may only occur if \u201cthe accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-20\">The significance of the invocation of the right to counsel is premised in part on a lawyer\u2019s \u201cunique ability to protect the Fifth Amendment rights of a client undergoing custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Fare </em>v. <em>Michael C. </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 707, 719. As Justice White accurately stated in his concurrence in <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley </em>(1975), 423 U.S. 96, 110, fn. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-21\">\u201c[T]he reasons to keep the lines of communication between the authorities and the accused open when the accused has chosen to make\u2019his own decisions are not present when he indicates instead that he wishes legal advice with respect thereto. The authorities may then communicate with him through an attorney. More- to the point, the accused having expressed his own view that he is not competent to deal with the authorities without legal advice, a later decision at the authorities\u2019 insistence to make a state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ment without counsel\u2019s presence may properly be viewed with skepticism.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">It is undisputed that appellant invoked his right to counsel in the case at bar. Thus, the only issues in dispute are whether appellant (a) initiated further discussions with the police, and (b) knowingly and intelligently waived the right he had invoked. <em>Edwards, supra, </em>at 485, 486, fn. 9; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1984), 469 U.S. 91, 98. For the reasons set forth below, I believe it is obvious that the state hag failed to prove that appellant initiated further discussions with police. Indeed, the record requires a contrary finding. Therefore, the court of appeals\u2019 affirmance of the death penalty in this case is faulty and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Despite the inadequate record in this case, the appellate court believed that appellant had told his mother to tell police that he was ready to talk. This belief is borne out in the court\u2019s statement that \u201csince the Cincinnati police had information' that * * * [appellant] now wanted to talk, they were also entitled to determine whether that information was correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Although there seems to be no reason why a defendant in custody could not initiate contact with the police through a third party, the record simply does not reflect that appellant did so. Indeed, Officer Davis testified that neither the defendant nor anyone else called him to say that the defendant wanted to initiate further discussions. Therefore, Davis\u2019 statement that he and appellant \u201chad a lot to talk about\u201d initiated a \u201cgeneralized discussion about the investigation\u201d with appellant. <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 1039, 1045-1046,</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">In <em>Wyrick </em>v. <em>Fields </em>(1982), 459 U.S. 42, 46, the Supreme Court explained the <em>Edwards </em>rule as holding that a suspect in custody cannot be subjected to further interrogation after he requests an attorney \u201cunless the suspect himself initiates dialogue with the authorities.\u201d There is not a scintilla of evidence in the record to show that the appellant initiated further discussion. The court justifies its holding by drawing one inference from another. It infers that the appellant initiated further discussion from the inference about what appellant\u2019s mother supposedly stated to Officer Davis. This is guesswork about facts which are not in the record. Such inference building undermines the constitutional foundations upon which <em>Bradshaw, Fields </em>and <em>Edwards, supra, </em>are built.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">As stated above, a \u201cheavy burden\u201d rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. In <em>Bradshaw, supra, </em>at 1044, the plurality opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">\u201cBut even if a conversation taking place after the accused has \u2018expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel,\u2019 is initiated by the accused, where reinterrogation follows, the burden remains upon the prosecution to show that subsequent events indicated a waiver of the Fifth Amendment right to have counsel present during the interrogation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">To establish a waiver, it would be a <em>\u201cnecessary fact </em>that the accused, not the police, reopened the dialogue with the authorities.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Edwards, supra, </em>at 486, fn. 9. As the court in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Roberson </em>(1988), 486 U.S ___, 100 L. Ed. 2d 704, 108 S. Ct. 2093, recently pointed out, if a suspect believes that he is not capable of undergoing custodial interrogation without the advice of counsel, \u201cthen it is presumed that any subsequent waiver that has come at the authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ties\u2019 behest, and not at the suspect\u2019s own instigation, is itself the product of \u2018inherently compelling pressures\u2019 and not the purely voluntary choice of the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 100 L. Ed. 2d at 713, 108 S. Ct. at 2097-2098.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">I think it is obvious that the state has failed to meet the burden of proof required under <em>Edwards </em>and its progeny and has otherwise failed to rebut the presumption that the waiver was the product of \u201cinherently compelling pressures.\u201d Therefore, appellant\u2019s confession should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">The court of appeals based its decision to affirm in part on the fact that <em>Edwards </em>is factually distinguishable from the instant case because the police officers who interrogated appellant the second time came from a different department than those who conducted the initial interrogation. The court below stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">\u201cIn <em>Edwards, </em>officers of the <em>same </em>department initiated a compulsive [sic] discussion about the offense, after the prisoner said he did not want to talk to them. He was told he had to do so. In the instant case, the second conversation with the prisoner was begun by an entirely separate police department. Cincinnati police officers came to the place of custody for the purpose of taking Van Hook back to Cincinnati to face the charges of murder. This was their first contact with him. * * *\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">In <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Roberson, supra, </em>at _, 100 L. Ed. 2d at 717, 108 S. Ct. at 2101, the Supreme Court specifically rejected this distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-15\">\u201c* * * <em>[W]e attach no significance to the fact that the officer who conducted the second interrogation did not know that respondent had made a request for counsel. </em>In addition to the fact that Edwards focuses on the state of mind of the suspect and not of the police, custodial interrogation must be conducted pursuant to established procedures, and those procedures in turn must enable an officer who proposes to initiate an interrogation to determine whether the suspect has previously requested counsel. * * * [W]hether the same or different law enforcement authorities are involved in the second investigation, the same need to determine whether the suspect has requested counsel exists. The police department\u2019s failure to honor that request cannot be justified by the lack of diligence of a particular officer.\u201d (Emphasis added and footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">The court of appeals also based its affirmance in part on the premise that the <em>Edwards </em>rule is not a \u201cwho said what first\u201d <em>per se </em>rule. The appellate court applied a balancing test to determine whether the interrogation was impermissible: \u201cThe right of a person in custody to be free of impermissible compulsion or deception must be weighed against the need for reasonably efficient and aggressive law enforcement,.\u201d Such a test is clearly erroneous in light of the clear, bright-line rule emphasized by the Supreme Court in <em>Edwards </em>and its progeny. See <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 625, 634; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra; Solem </em>v. <em>Stumes </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 638, 646; see, also, <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 51; <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, supra, </em>at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-19\">In <em>Fare, supra, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the \u201crelatively rigid requirement that interrogation must cease upon the accused\u2019s request for an attorney * * * has the virtue of informing the police and prosecutors with specificity as to what they may do in conducting custodial interrogation, and of informing courts under what circumstances statements obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>during such interrogation are not admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718. Recently, the court stated in <em>Roberson, supra, </em>at _, 100 L. Ed. 2d at 714, 108 S. Ct. at 2098: \u201cSurely there is nothing ambiguous about the requirement that after a person in custody has expressed his desire to deal with police through counsel, he \u2018is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication * * *.\u2019 <em>[Edwards, supra,] </em>451 U.S., at 484-485 * * See, also, <em>Bradshaw, supra, </em>at 1044-1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">If the above language and the aforementioned cases do not demonstrate that <em>Edwards </em>established a <em>per se </em>rule, <em>i.e., </em>that police may not initiate a conversation on the subject of an investigation after the accused requests counsel, I do not know what does.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The appellate court erroneously relied <em>on Bradshaw, supra, </em>to support its conclusion. In <em>Bradshaw, </em>a five-to-four majority of the Supreme Court reversed a state court decision which had held that the accused did not \u201cinitiate\u201d a conversation with police. In that case, after asking for an attorney, the accused, without provocation, asked police officers, \u201cWell, what is going to happen to me now?\u201d A plurality of the Supreme Court found that this was sufficient to constitute an \u201cinitiation\u201d by the accused under <em>Edwards. </em>The four dissenting justices would require the initiation by the accused to be <em>\u201cabout the subject matter of the criminal investigation. \u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.) Bradshaw, supra, </em>at 1053. In the instant case, however, no probative evidence was ever offered to show that the accused initiated the interrogation. Without any evidence of such initiation, Davis\u2019 statement to appellant that the officers \u201chad a lot to talk to him about\u201d initiated a conversation on the subject of an investigation and led to an impermissible interrogation under <em>Edwards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b330-11\">H.
