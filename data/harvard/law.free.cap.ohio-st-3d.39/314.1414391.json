The question before us is whether the commission abused its discretion in defining the ladder as a \u201csingle ladder\u201d and in determining that Ohio Adm. Code 4121:l-5-03(C) (2)(b)(ii) was inapplicable. We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">Ohio Adm. Code 4121:l-5-03(C)(2) (b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-15\">\u201c(i) All portable ladders shall be equipped with safety shoes, metal spikes, or spurs. Safety shoes shall be surfaced with cork, carborundum, rubber, or other material with equivalent coefficient of friction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-16\">\u201c(ii) This does not apply to step ladders, lashed ladders or hook ladders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">The ladder in question was the surviving top half of an extension ladder. Appellant argues that this segment was not a portable \u201csingle ladder\u201d requiring shoes. We disagree. Ohio Adm. Code 4121:l-5-01(B)(18)(j) defines \u201csingle ladder\u201d as \u201ca portable, nonadjustable ladder consisting of but one section.\u201d Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5-01 (B)(18)(a) defines \u201c[extension ladder\u201d as \u201ca portable ladder, adjustable in length. It consists of two or more sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>tions traveling in guides or brackets so arranged as to permit length adjustment. Its size is designated by the sum of the lengths of the sections measured along the side rails.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">While the ladder in question originally comprised part of an extension ladder, it consisted, on the date of injury, of just one section. As the interpretation of a specific safety requirement is within the commission\u2019s sound discretion <em>(State, ex rel. Allied Wheel Products, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>[1956], 166 Ohio St. 47, 1 O.O. 2d 190, 139 N. E. 2d 41; <em>State, ex rel. Cox, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>[1981], 67 Ohio St. 2d 235, 21 O. O. 3d 147, 423 N.E. 2d 441), its characterization of the segment as a \u201csingle ladder\u201d was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">We also find Ohio Adm. Code 4121:l-5-03(C)(2)(b)(ii) to be inapplicable. Neither parly contends that the ladder was a step ladder or hook ladder. The commission, however, determined that it was not a lashed ladder based on the affidavit of Tom Hodges. We have stated that the commission alone is responsible for evaluating the weight and credibility of the evidence. <em>State, ex rel. Burley, v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936. In <em>Burley, </em>we also stated that as long as the commission\u2019s decision was supported by some evidence, there was no abuse of discretion and mandamus would not lie. In the present case, the Hodges affidavit constituted \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s decision. The fact that the evidence took the form of a sworn affidavit as opposed to \u201clive\u201d testimony taken at a hearing does not negate the competency of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Appellant\u2019s contention that a violation of a specific safety requirement (\u201cVSSR\u201d) must be proven \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is not well-taken. Appellant has quoted out of context <em>State, ex rel. New Departure Hyatt Bearings, Division of General Motors Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(Mar. 3, 1983), Franklin App. No. 82AP-842, unreported, and <em>State, ex rel. Wauseon Foundry Co., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(Sept. 29, 1983), Franklin App. No. 83AP-213, unreported. Both of these cases indicate that \u201call reasonable doubts concerning the interpretation of the safety standard [are] to be construed against the applicability of the standard to the employer.\u201d <em>New Departure, supra, </em>at 3. Neither case states, explicitly or impliedly, that a claimant in a VSSR case has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. (See Ohio Adm. Code 4123-3-09[C][3], which states that an applicant for workers\u2019 compensation benefits must establish his claim by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>State, ex rel. Chrysler Plastic Products Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App. 3d 15, 528 N.E. 2d 1279, is similarly misplaced. In that case, the employer was denied a fair hearing where an <em>ex parte </em>commission order vacated a prior VSSR denial based on newly obtained evidence that the employer was not given a chance to refute. It is not on point with the present case. Moreover, it contains no language requiring that a VSSR be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">Finally, appellant\u2019s contention that the commission imposed a strict liability standard upon it for the VSSR contention is not well-taken. While the hearing officer\u2019s inclusion of a hypothetical situation in his order is confusing and arguably gives the appearance that such a standard was used, a complete reading of the order indicates otherwise. The commission, based in large part on the Hodges affidavit, determined that an unlashed single ladder was not equipped with safety shoes, spurs or metal spikes, in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>tion of Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5-03 (C)(2)(b)(i). This decision was supported by some evidence. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-5\">Moyer, C.J, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
