Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936. In making a VSSR award, the commission must determine that a claimant\u2019s injury resulted from the employer\u2019s failure to comply with a specific safety requirement. Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution; <em>State, ex rel. Haines, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 15, 58 O.O. 2d 70, 278 N.E. 2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Appellant contends there is \u201cno evidence\u201d supporting a causal relationship between appellee\u2019s injury and appellant\u2019s alleged violations, <em>i.e., </em>failure to have a certificate of operation and proper lighting. Its contention is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">Regarding the operation certificate, appellant contends that: (1) Ohio Adm. Code 4121:l-l-02(C)is unconstitutional as being a denial of due process; (2) Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02 (C) is inapplicable here; and (3) in the alternative, appellant is exempted from this provision by Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(C)(3). These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">As to its first argument, appellant contends that Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(C) creates an irrebuttable presumption as to causal relationship and thus deprives it of due process. We do not find the presumption irrebuttable and thus do not find the contention to be persuasive. Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(C) rests on the premise that a valid certificate of operation indicates that minimum safety standards have been met. Conversely, the lack of a certificate implies the opposite. If an injury or death involves the latter situation, it is presumed that the injury or death was due to a safety deficiency. The employer, however, is given two chances to rebut this presumption. It can show, under Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(C)(1) and (2), that the elevator was not presumptively unsafe, or it may challenge the causative presumption by establishing that the elevator\u2019s deficiencies did not contribute to the injury or death. Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(C)(3). Appellant\u2019s contention is thus not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">Next, as to the applicability issue, Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-16\">\u201cNo elevator of an employer may be operated without a currently valid certificate of operation, issued by the department of industrial relations of the state, or similar authorization issued by a municipality having jurisdiction to do so. In the absence of a currently valid certificate or authorization, an injury or death of an employee incurred by reason of an elevator of the employer shall be presumed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>due to the violation of this specific safety requirement. Such presumption may be rebutted if the employer shows that the absence of the certificate or authorization was due to factors beyond the control of the employer for one or more of the following reasons: \u2666 * * <em>ff</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Appellant concedes that there was no operating certificate. It contends, however, that Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(C) is inapplicable as the injury was not \u201cincurred by reason of an elevator\u201d nor did it arise out of its \u201coperation].\u201d Appellant interprets the terms \u201celevator\u201d and \u201coperated\u201d too narrowly. Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-01(A) adopts the definition of \u201celevator\u201d contained in R.C. 4105.01 (A), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">\u201c \u2018Elevator\u2019 means a hoisting and lowering apparatus equipped with a car, cage, or platform which moves on or between permanent rails or guides and serves two or more fixed landings. \u2018Elevator\u2019 includes * * * all equipment, machinery and construction related to any elevator * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">We find that an elevator shaft is \u201cconstruction related to any elevator.\u201d Since the term \u201celevator\u201d is not strictly limited to the car, we do not find that YSSR liability is confined only to those injuries occurring in, or caused by, the car. Similarly, we find that \u201celevator * * * operation]\u201d is not exclusively restricted to \u201ccar operation.\u201d Thus, the mere fact that the car was stationary at the time of appellee\u2019s fall does not establish that the injury did not occur during \u201coperation].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">In the alternative, appellant argues that even if Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(0) is applicable, it is exempted from this code provision by Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(C)(3). This argument is, again, not well-taken. The presumption of causal relationship contained in Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(0) is rebutted if the employer shows, under Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(C)(3), that \u201cthe inspecting authority had inspected the elevator and no deficiency noted in the inspection report contributed to the injury or death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">The commission relied on the report of its investigator. Attached to the investigator\u2019s report is the June 14, 1982 report of the Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Elevator Inspection, stating: \u201c[p]it light, pit light switch, pit stop switch and pit ladder shall all be properly installed * * *. Keyplate shall be replaced with hoist way door key opening as required. Elevator shall not be put in service until violations are corrected and certificate post[ed].\u201d While the inspection report does not refer to causal relationship, it cites numerous deficiencies sufficient to warrant an elevator system shutdown. From these reports, the commission arrived at its conclusion that a causal relationship existed. The evidence of the lack of lighting constitutes \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s determination that the Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(C)(3) exception did not apply-</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">Based on the foregoing, we find that Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-1-02(C) is controlling. We additionally find some evidence to support the commission\u2019s determination that appellee\u2019s injury was causally related to appellant\u2019s failure to comply with that code provision. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-13\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Douglas, Wright and H.
