Buchan, Jr., </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-7\"><em>Anthony J. Celebrezze, Jr., </em>attorney general, and <em>Jeffery W. Clark, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b381-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AnB\">The issue before this court is whether, as a matter of law, R.C. 4123.58(C) requires a finding of permanent total disability when impaired vision is significantly improved by corrective measures. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">R.C. 4123.58(C) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">\u201cThe loss or loss of use of both hands or both arms, or both feet or both legs, or both eyes, or of any two thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be compensated according to this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">R.C. 4123.57(C) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-12\">\u201cFor the permanent partial loss of sight of an eye, such portion of one hundred twenty-five weeks as the commission may in each case determine, based upon the percentage of vision actually lost as a result of the injury or occupational disease, but, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for less than twenty-five per cent loss of uncorrected vision. \u2018Loss of uncorrected vision\u2019 means the percentage of vision actually lost as the result of the injury or occupational disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">R.C. 4123.58(C) does not use the term \u201closs of uncorrected vision,\u201d nor does it refer to R.C. 4123.57(C) as pertinent here. Appellant mistakenly relies on <em>State, ex rel. Swander, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App. 3d 220, 13 OBR 271, 468 N.E. 2d 913, and <em>State, ex rel. Kroger Co., </em>v. <em>Stover </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 229, 31 OBR 436, 510 N.E. 2d 356. These cases merely hold that <em>for purposes of an award under R.C. 4123.57(C), </em>subsequent improvement of vision by corrective means is immaterial. R.C. 4123.58(C) is neither referred to nor an issue in either majority decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>State, ex rel. Gassmann, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 64, 70 O.O. 2d 157, 322 N.E. 2d 660, and State, <em>ex rel. Walker, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 402, 12 O.O. 3d 347, 390 N.E. 2d 1190, is also misplaced. These cases taken together stand solely for the proposition that \u201closs\u201d as contained in R.C. 4123.57(C) and 4123.58 (C) includes \u201closs of use\u201d in addition to \u201closs by severance.\u201d In <em>Gassmann, </em>we found that a paraplegic claimant had \u201c[flor all practical purposes * * * lost his legs to the same effect and extent as if they had been amputated or otherwise physically removed. Clearly such is a \u2018loss\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 4123.58 * * <em>Id. </em>at 67, 70 O.O. 2d at 159, 322 N.E. 2d at 662. <em>Walker </em>cited with approval the <em>Gassmann </em>rationale and applied it to R.C. 4123.57(C) as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\"><em>Walker </em>and <em>Gassmann </em>undercut appellant\u2019s argument by requiring, at a minimum, irreparable total loss of use as a prerequisite to recovery. In the case at bar, while appellant may have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>loss of uncorrected vision, contact lenses have restored a significant amount of sight. He has thus not lost his vision to the same extent as if his eyes had been enucleated.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Appellant correctly asserts that subsequent reemployment has no effect on whether a party may be found permanently and totally disabled under R.C. 4123.58(C). His contention is not relevant, however, since he does not have loss of vision to the extent contemplated by R.C. 4123.58(C) and is thus not permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The determination of disputed factual situations is within the final jurisdiction of the commission, subject to correction by action in mandamus only on a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>State, ex rel. Allied Wheel Products, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 47, 50, 1 O.O. 2d 190, 192, 139 N.E. 2d 41, 44. Where the record contains some evidence to support its decision, there has been no abuse of discretion and mandamus will not lie. <em>State, ex rel. Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936. In this case, the commission did have \u201csome evidence\u201d \u2014 Dr. Bennett\u2019s report as supplemented \u2014 to support its dismissal of appellant\u2019s motion for permanent and total disability compensation under R.C. 4123.58(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b382-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
