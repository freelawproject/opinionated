This case involves the \u201cprevailing wage\u201d law, R.C. 4115.03 through 4115.16. The precise issue involved is whether the statute of limitations found in R.C. 2305.11 is applicable to prevailing wage actions brought under R.C. 4115.10. The court of appeals held that the statute of limitations does not run against an action brought to enforce the prevailing wage law. I agree with the court of appeals and I am distressed that when this court has an opportunity to give added strength to the prevailing wage law, for some reason a majority of the court declines to do so notwithstanding that the case was allowed by a vote of five to two on December 9, 1987, because it involved a matter of \u201cpublic or great general interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-24\">Further, this case was brought by James W. Harris, Director of Industrial Relations and the Ohio Department of Industrial Relations, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>enforce the provisions of the prevailing wage law. Given this court\u2019s recent ruling in <em>Ohio Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 137, 527 N.E. 2d 798, a case decided on August 10, 1988, wherein this court held that \u201c[t]he state, absent express statutory provision to the contrary, is exempt from the operation of a generally worded statute of limitations * * * [and] [t]his rule serves the public policy of preserving the public rights, revenues, and property from injury and loss\u201d (citation omitted), it would seem that the majority\u2019s decision to \u201cimprovidently allow\u201d says more about what type of case is before us rather than the principle of law involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Because I do not agree with dismissing this previously allowed case, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-5\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
