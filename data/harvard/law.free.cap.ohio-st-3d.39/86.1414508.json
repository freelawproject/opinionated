The same three elements must be shown to establish a negligence action generally, including a survivorship action predicated upon ordinary negligence or medical malpractice. Cf. <em>Hadfield-Penfield Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Sheller </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 106, 114, 141 N.E. 89, 91; <em>Baier </em>v. <em>Cleveland Ry. Co. </em>(1937), 132 Ohio St. 388, 391, 8 O.O. 208, 209, 8 N.E. 2d 1, 2; <em>Wills </em>v. <em>Frank Hoover Supply </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St. 3d 186, 188, 26 OBR 160, 161, 497 N.E. 2d 1118, 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">We review the issues before us within the framework of the traditional duty-breach-proximate-cause analysis. The complicating factor is that this case has its genesis in the mental health field. Practitioners in the mental health field treat disturbed persons. Using the traditional concepts of tort law, we must decide how these concepts apply to such practitioners for the acts of a disturbed patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Though neither party disputes the existence of a duty of care owed to Carly by Dr. Murray, for purposes of clarity we deem it important to delineate the basis and scope of this duty and to show it is consistent with established tort principles of Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Under Ohio law the existence of a duty depends on the foreseeability of the injury. <em>Menifee </em>v. <em>Ohio Welding Products, Inc. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 75, 77, 15 OBR 179, 180, 472 N.E. 2d 707, 710; <em>Gedeon </em>v. <em>East Ohio Gas Co. </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 335, 190 N.E. 924. We find no difficulty with the proposition that a reasonably prudent psychiatrist would have anticipated that an injury to Carly could result from his performance or nonperformance of certain acts, including discharging Theresa from the hospital without adequate precautions.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">However, there is no duty under Ohio law to control the conduct of another person so as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless a \u201cspecial relation\u201d exists between the actor and that person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the person\u2019s conduct. 2 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 122, Section 315 (adopted by this court in <em>Gelbman </em>v. <em>Second Natl. Bank of Warren </em>[1984], 9 Ohio St. 3d 77, 79, 9 OBR 280, 281, 458 N.E. 2d 1262, 1263; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Sonitrol of Southwestern Ohio, Inc. </em>[1988], 36 Ohio St. 3d 36, 39, 521 N.E. 2d 780, 782). Such a \u201cspecial relation\u201d exists when one takes charge of a person whom he knows or should know is likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled. Restatement, <em>supra, </em>at 129, Section 319; see Restatement, <em>supra, </em>at 123, Section 315, Comment <em>c.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">Even though Theresa was a voluntary patient, we find that Dr. Murray had sufficient charge of Theresa in the hospital setting such that a special relation was established.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>sistent with our holdings in other contexts, including landholders\u2019 liability, where we stated that \u201c \u2018liability in tort is an incident to occupation or control.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St. 3d 92, 94, 30 OBR 295, 297, 507 N.E. 2d 352, 354, quoting <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Roose </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 316, 317, 39 O.O. 145, 146, 85 N.E. 2d 545, 546. It is also consistent with Illustration 1 under Section 319 of the Restatement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201cA operates a private hospital for contagious diseases. Through the negligence of the medical staff[,] B, who is suffering from scarlet fever, is permitted to leave the hospital with the assurance that- he is entirely recovered, although his disease is still in an infectious stage. * * * B * * * communicate[s] the scarlet fever * * * to D * * *. A is subject to liability to D * * Restatement, <em>supra, </em>at 130.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Therefore, we find that Dr. Murray had a duly to take reasonable precautions to protect Carly from Theresa\u2019s violent propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The standard of care required of a medical doctor is dictated by the custom of the profession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">\u201cIn order to establish medical malpractice, it must be shown by a preponderance of evidence that the injury complained of was caused by the doing of some particular thing or things that a physician or surgeon of ordinary skill, care and diligence would not have done under like or similar conditions or circumstances, or by the failure or omission to do some particular thing or things that such a physician or surgeon would have done under like or similar conditions and circumstances * * <em>Bruni </em>v. <em>Tatsumi </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 127, 75 O.O. 2d 184, 346 N.E. 2d 673, paragraph one of the syllabus. A psychiatrist, as a medical specialist, is held to the stan-. dard of care \u201cof a reasonable specialist practicing medicine or surgery in that same specialty in the light of present day scientific knowledge in that specialty field * * <em>Bruni, supra, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">Defendants argue that the malpractice standard of ordinary care should not be applied to psychiatric decisions releasing voluntary mental patients from a hospital. They make four points in support of their argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">First, defendants claim that psychiatrists are unable to predict their patients\u2019 potential for violence with any degree of accuracy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">Second, because a reasonable psy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>chiatrist of \u201cordinary skill and training\u201d cannot make an accurate prediction of a patient\u2019s violent behavior, it can never be said that a given prediction exhibited a lack of \u201cordinary skill.\u201d In other words, there is <em>no </em>standard in the psychiatric profession with which to measure a psychiatrist\u2019s judgment of a patient\u2019s propensity for violence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Third, modern psychiatry favors the early release of mental patients.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If a psychiatrist knows that he will face liability for failing to foresee a patient\u2019s future violent behavior, the predictable result will be a court-mandated end to \u201co\u00fat-patient\u201d treatment, and the massive confinement of all patients who display even a remote possibility of violent behavior.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Fourth, the General Assembly, in delineating the liability standards pertaining to civil commitment, holds a psychiatrist to only a good faith stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>dard of care for decisions to commit or discharge a mental patient.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The standard of care required for voluntary hospitalization should reflect the General Assembly\u2019s wisdom in formulating a standard for involuntary hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In place of the conventional malpractice standard, defendants urge this court to adopt a \u201cprofessional judgment rule.\u201d Under this rule, a psychiatrist will not be liable for releasing a patient who subsequently harms another if, after carefully examining all relevant data, the psychiatrist makes a professional medical judgment that the patient does not pose an immediate danger to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The professional judgment standard has received the most attention in the New York courts where it applies to all phases of professional malpractice, including psychiatry. <em>O\u2019Shea </em>v. <em>United States </em>(E.D. N.Y. 1985), 623 F. Supp. 380, 384, citing <em>Bell </em>v. <em>New York City Health &amp; Hospitals Corp. </em>(1982), 90 App. Div. 2d 270, 279, 456 N.Y. Supp. 2d 787, 793. The seminal case in New York held that; \u201cThe rule requiring a physician and surgeon to use his best judgment does not hold him liable for a mere error of judgment, provided he does what he thinks is best after careful examination.\u201d <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Honsinger </em>(1898), 155 N.Y. 201, 210, 49 N.E. 760, 762. Since <em>Pike, </em>the New York courts have applied the professional judgment rule to exculpate physicians, and especially psychiatrists, from liability for diagnostic decisions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> treatment decisions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> decisions to release hospital patients who later harm themselves or others,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and decisions denying hospital admission.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>The New York courts have not applied the professional judgment rule to immunize psychiatric decisions where there was a failure to evaluate the condition of potentially dangerous patients before discharging them from the hospital, <em>Homere </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1975) , 48 App. Div. 2d 422, 370 N.Y. Supp. 2d 246 (discharge decision, based on a patient evaluation, was made forty-one days before the actual discharge date. In the intervening period the patient\u2019s condition markedly worsened and no reevaluation of his condition was conducted before actual discharge.); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>New York City Health &amp; Hospitals Corp., supra </em>(psychiatrist failed to inquire into a patient\u2019s delusions and auditory hallucinations); <em>Huntley </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1984), 62 N.Y. 2d 134, 476 N.Y. Supp. 2d 99, 464 N.E. 2d 467 (suicide plan of patient not told to psychiatrist in charge of leave privileges); or where there was a failure to keep detailed and proper medical notes and, consequently, it could not be established whether any evaluation of the patient\u2019s suicidal propensities had been made by a qualified psychiatrist. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1976) , 51 App. Div. 2d 494, 382 N.Y. Supp. 2d 128, affirmed (1977), 41 N.Y. 2d 1086, 396 N.Y. Supp. 2d 363, 364 N.E. 2d 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">At least one court outside New York has applied a limited standard of review to a hospitalization case. The court in <em>Currie </em>v. <em>United States </em>(M.D. N.C. 1986), 644 F. Supp. 1074, affirmed on different grounds (C.A. 4, 1987), 836 F. 2d 209, held that a \u201cpsychotherapist judgment rule\u201d should be used to review a therapist\u2019s decision not to seek involuntary hospitalization for an outpatient who subsequently became violent. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">\u201cUnder such a \u2018psychotherapist judgment rule,\u2019 the court would not allow liability to be imposed on therapists for simple errors in judgment. Instead, the court would examine the \u2018good faith, independence and thoroughness\u2019 of a psychotherapist\u2019s decision not to commit a patient. * * * Factors in reviewing such good faith include the competence and training of the reviewing psychotherapists, whether the relevant documents and evidence were adequately, promptly and independently reviewed, whether the advice or opinion of another therapist was obtained, whether the evaluation was made in light of the proper legal standards for commitment, and whether other evidence of good faith exists.\u201d (Citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 1083.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">The court derived its psychotherapist judgment rule from the business judgment rule used to review decisions of corporate directors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">\u201cIn the business judgment rule, courts defer to the decisions of disinterested directors absent bad faith or self-interest. Many of the considerations cited as justifications for the business judgment rule are applicable to the present case. For example, as with business decisions, the court is not particularly qualified to review commitment decisions involving mental health and dangerousness. In addition, these types of commitment procedures require quick action, and \u2018after-the-fact litigation is a most imperfect device to evaluate\u2019 those decisions, as in the corporate setting. * * * Finally, policy considerations favor giving psychotherapists, as well as corporate directors, significant discretion to use their best judgment, recognizing that \u2018[a] rule which penalizes the choice of seemingly riskier alternatives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>* * * may not be in the interest\u2019 of the parties or society.\u201d (Citations omitted). <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Plaintiff contends there is no basis for deviating from the malpractice standard of care set forth in <em>Bruni. </em>In response to defendants\u2019 arguments, plaintiff asserts (1) although there are limits to the degree of accuracy, many practitioners believe that prediction of violent behavior is possible<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; (2) recent scholarship suggests that predictive accuracy may be better than previously thought<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; (3) there are objective professional standards for evaluating violent potential<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>; and (4) holding psychiatrists only to a professional judgment rule in effect requires a psychiatric patient to assume the risk of improper treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We find the arguments in support of adopting the professional judgment rule persuasive. Though a psychiatrist\u2019s ability to predict violent behavior is probably better than a layperson\u2019s, and there does appear to be some consensus within the mental health community on the factors relevant to a diagnosis of violent propensities,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> diagnosing both the existence of violent propensities and their severity is still a highly subjective undertaking. Psychiatric evaluations of any given fact pattern are bound to vary widely.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And once a determination is made that a patient possesses a propensity for violent behavior, deciding upon a course of treatment poses difficult questions. The patient\u2019s right to good medical care, including freedom from unnecessary confinement<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and unwarranted breaches of confidentiali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ty,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> must be balanced against the need to protect potential victims.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Courts, with the benefit of hindsight, should not be allowed to second-guess a psychiatrist\u2019s professional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">On the other hand,- a psychiatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>patient is not required to assume the risk of improper treatment. Where there are professional standards of care a psychiatrist is required to conform to the standards at all times or suffer liability. Where there are no professional standards, a psychiatrist must exercise good faith judgment based on a thorough evaluation of all relevant factors. Professional standards will be used to determine which factors are relevant and whether an evaluation was thorough.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Therefore, we hold that a psychiatrist will not' be held liable for the violent acts of a voluntarily hospitalized mental patient subsequent to the patient\u2019s discharge if (1) the patient did not manifest violent propensities while being hospitalized and there was no reason to suspect the patient would become violent after discharge, or (2) a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s propensity for violence was conducted, taking into account all relevant factors, and a good faith decision was made by the psychiatrist that the patient had no violent propensity, or (3) the patient was diagnosed as having violent' propensities and, after a thorough evaluation of the severity of the propensities and a balancing of the patient\u2019s interests and the interests of potential victims, a treatment plan was formulated in good faith which included discharge of the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">As reflected in his discharge summaries, Dr. Murray knew that Theresa had a potential to harm Carly. He was told of Theresa\u2019s fears of harming Carly as well as her statement of June 1 that she planned to kill Carly. He, Dr. Wales and the other members of the team knew at the time of Theresa\u2019s release from the hospital that she had a potential for harming Carly. However, Dr. Murray concluded, as did the others, that Theresa did not have a \u201cplan\u201d to harm Carly or possess a severe and imminent potential for violence. He felt the plan to place Carly with Greg\u2019s relatives was adequate to protect Carly. Absent bad faith or lack of a thorough evaluation of Theresa\u2019s condition, Dr. Murray will not be held liable for this judgment, even though it led to the death of Carly.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Dr. Litvak testified that Dr. Murray did not conduct a thorough evaluation of Theresa\u2019s homicidal potential. Basing his opinion on his review of the hospital records and the depositions of Dr. Murray and Dr. Wales, Dr. Litvak concluded that Dr. Murray should have talked with Theresa and asked her what her thoughts were, trying to ascertain whether those thoughts were rational or not, what her reasons were for wanting to hurt the baby, what means she had thought of for hurting the baby, if she had a specific date, time and place that she might be doing it, and whether or not she had actually attempted to do anything like that in the past; that Dr. Murray should have ascertained in general how impulsive a person Theresa might be, and then whether her illness might make her more impulsive, unpredictable and unreliable; that Dr. Murray should have determined whether Theresa had previously acted aggressively toward anyone else and under what cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>cumstances; and that Dr. Murray should have determined whether family members had seen Theresa acting in such a way as to indicate she would hurt the baby or heard her talking about hurting the baby. Dr. Litvak found no indication that Dr. Murray went into that amount of detail in the records Dr. Litvak reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">It is clear from Dr. Murray\u2019s own testimony that he did not talk with Theresa about her statement of June 1. However, it is not- clear from the record whether another member of the treatment team talked .with her about it. Perry believed she d(id, but could not remember. More important, it is not clear whether Dr. Murray or another team member <em>should </em>have talked with Theresa about the specific threat in light of her recanting three hours later. Dr. Greenfield, expert witness for Dr. Murray and the hospital, stated he would have wanted to personally talk with Theresa about the note but that failure to do so was not malpractice.-</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">It is not clear from the record whether Dr. Murray evaluated Theresa\u2019s potential for violence. He was not in daily contact with her while she was at the hospital, nor did he conduct individual therapy sessions with her. However, he did talk with her on occasion and he received information on Theresa from members of the team who were in daily contact with her and conducting therapy. Jn addition, he received information from Dr. Wales and members of Theresa\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The plaintiff faults Dr. Murray for not being more involved in personally treating Theresa. However, \u201cteam treatment\u201d appears to be a legitimate mode of therapy within the psychiatric community. See <em>Gowan </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D. Ore. 1985),. 601 F. Supp. 1297, 1301-1302. We find that a genuine issue exists as to whether Dr. Murray acted as would a reasonable psychiatrist in evaluating Theresa\u2019s potential for violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The jury was instructed to consider whether Theresa\u2019s release from the hospital was premature, whether the treatment plan for the release was inadequate, and whether there was a failure to warn necessary persons of the known or reasonably foreseeable dangerous consequences of the release. Unfortunately, the basis of the jury\u2019s verdict against Dr. Murray was never tested. The jury could have found Dr. Murray liable for negligence in evaluating Theresa\u2019s condition or for one of the other grounds asserted by the plaintiff. However, under the professional judgment rule, the other grounds, including premature discharge and failure to warn, can be a basis for liability only in the absence of good faith or a failure to exercise professional judgment. Therefore, in light of this new standard, a new trial should be conducted on Dr. Murray\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">The final issue we address concerns the trial court's denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to add Theresa as a new party plaintiff with a cause of ao tion sounding in medical malpractice. The plaintiff\u2019s motion was made in March 1985, well after the statute of limitations had run on Theresa\u2019s claim. To come within the statute of limitations, the amended complaint would have to relate back to the date of the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Civ. R. 15(C) governs the relation back of amended pleadings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">\u201c* * * An amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the foregoing provision is satisfied and, within the period provided by law for commenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>ing the action against him, the party to be brought in by amendment (1) has received such notice of the institution of the action that he will not be prejudiced in maintaining his defense on the merits, and (2) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, including Civ. R. 15(C), were patterned after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The 1966 Advisory Committee Notes to federal Rule 15(c) state: \u201cThe relation back of amendments changing plaintiffs is not expressly treated in * * * Rule 15(c) since the problem is generally easier. * * * [T]he chief consideration of policy is that of the statute of limitations, and the attitude taken in * * * Rule 15(c) toward change of defendants extends by analogy to amendments changing plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The primary purpose of Civ. R. 15(C) is to preserve actions which, through mistaken identity or misnomer, have been filed against the wrong person. No mistake or misnomer is alleged here, and Theresa waited well over three years to bring an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Federal courts have allowed relation back when the new plaintiff is the real party in interest<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or an original plaintiff brings a new cause of action in a different capacity,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but generally not when a new plaintiff brings a new cause of action. See <em>Marlowe </em>v. <em>Fisher Body </em>(C.A. 6, 1973), 489 F. 2d 1057, 1064; <em>People of the Living God </em>v. <em>Star Towing Co. </em>(E.D. La. 1968), 289 F. Supp. 635, 641. Therefore, we affirm the dismissal of the plaintiffs motion to add Theresa as a party plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Based on our resolution of these issues, it is unnecessary to address other issues raised by the parties. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause for a new trial on all issues, including, damages, based on the professional judgment standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b161-12\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b161-13\">Douglas, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\"> We are not deciding whether a psychiatrist\u2019s duty to protect a person from the violent propensities of the psychiatrist\u2019s patient extends to the outpatient setting.

I concur in large part with the majority\u2019s adoption of the professional judgment rule, and with the affirmance of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Theresa Pearson as a party plaintiff, but I do not agree that a new trial is warranted on the issue of Dr. Murray\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">The professional judgment rule is a satisfactory approach to the thorny problem of the liability of mental health practitioners for the violent acts' of a voluntarily hospitalized patient subsequent to discharge. I am troubled to some degree, however, by the test adopted today in that it fails to include a limited duty to warn. Further, the rule seems to \u201cswallow up\u201d the concept of malpractice in this area, such that professional incompetence will not be the basis for liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-16\">Under my reading of the profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>sional judgment rule set forth in the majority opinion, a psychiatrist may never be held liable for the discharge of a patient known to be violent as long as the psychiatrist has made a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s violent tendencies and balanced in good faith the competing interests. I am not persuaded of the desirability of such a rule in all cases. Consider the example of a patient who has repeatedly stated to his psychiatrist that he intends to kill an identified individual upon discharge, and the psychiatrist believes that the patient is capable of carrying out the threat but releases him without warning the intended victim. The psychiatrist may very well have exercised his professional judgment in good faith in deciding that discharge was therapeutically appropriate] but if the patient then harms or kills the threatened victim, should there really be no liability? And what if the psychiatrist discharges a patient, having made a completely <em>incompetent </em>finding that the patient was non-violent, and the patient then kills or maims the unwarned victim? Under today\u2019s majority opinion, no liability will attach as long as the psychiatrist has made a \u201cthorough\u201d evaluation of the relevant factors and has acted in good faith. I am not convinced that such a rule is entirely fair, although I am aware of the difficulties of proving competence or lack thereof in the area of predicting dangerousness and the importance of confidentiality in treating mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">In any event, while I am willing to accept the rule set forth today as a satisfactory compromise in a difficult area of. the law, I cannot accept the majority\u2019s application of the rule to the facts presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The majority finds that a new trial is warranted on the question of Dr. Murray\u2019s liability \u201c* * * in light of this new standard,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the professional judgment rule. It is my belief, however, that a new trial is not necessary, since even under the new standard, the result would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Dr. Murray was the head of the team charged with Theresa\u2019s care. He held the ultimate responsibility for decisions made during the course of her treatment. Dr. Murray conceded that he knew of Theresa\u2019s threat to kill her baby. He admitted that he never discussed this threat with Theresa. In fact, according to Dr. Litvak, an expert witness who examined the relevant medical records in this case, \u201c* * * there is no indication in the record that * * * [Dr. Murray] <em>ever </em>talked with the patient * * (Emphasis added.) Given these facts, it is difficult to imagine how any reasonable juror could find that Dr. Murray conducted a \u201cthorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s propensity for violence * * *, taking into account all relevant factors * * A \u201cthorough\u201d evaluation of a patient\u2019s violent tendencies must surely include personal contact with the patient. Since Dr. Murray had the ultimate responsibility for all aspects of Theresa\u2019s treatment, including any decision regarding her discharge, and since he was aware of her specific threat to kill her baby, an adequate evaluation of her dangerousness could not be made without at least talking with her about her plan. Theresa\u2019s apparent retraction of her threat hours after voicing it does not negate the fact that the threat was made. After her retraction, Theresa continued to express hostile feelings toward her baby. Dr. Murray could not reasonably evaluate the depth of these hostilities without talking to Theresa.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Thus, even under the new standard adopted today, reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion: Dr. Murray is liable for failing to conduct a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u201cthorough evaluation\u201d of Theresa\u2019s potential for violence. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury cannot be considered prejudicial error because the same result would have occurred had the instructions included the new standard, which, of course, did not exist before today\u2019s decision. Therefore, there is no need for a retrial with all the expenditures of time, energy and money such a trial would entail. My review of the record reveals that Judge Kessler conducted this pro-' ceeding in a fair, thorough, and highly competent manner with full regard for the rights and interests of all parties. After hearing all the evidence and viewing all the witnesses at trial, the jury returned a verdict for $1.8 million. This jury, it should be remembered, was composed of a cross-section of the parties\u2019 peers, drawn at random, who approached the case with no previous knowledge of the facts or circumstances and, of course, no preconceived notions. Given the record before us, it is not difficult to see how the jury could render such a verdict. Nevertheless, the trial judge obviously felt the amount of the jury\u2019s verdict was excessive. Accordingly, the judge, exercising his prerogative, ordered a remittitur reducing the award to $300,000, or, in the alternative, granting a new trial on the issue of damages only.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Based upon a thorough review of the record, I support the well-reasoned decision of Judge Kessler.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">To set aside the verdict, as well as the consequent remittitur, is completely unnecessary and unwarranted. I wonder what the majority will do if the jury on retrial, properly instructed under the new standard, returns a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of, say, two million dollars. Faced with this prospect, I think the far wiser course to take at this point is to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals solely on the remittitur issue, and reinstate the judgment of the trial court in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b163-5\"> It is interesting to note that neither the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure nor the Ohio Revised Code contains a specific provision allowing for remittitur of a grossly excessive jury verdict. See, generally, however, Civ. R. 59(A). Nevertheless, the practice of ordering the remittitur of an excessive verdict or granting a new trial in the alternative has long been established in Ohio.

Co. </em>v. <em>Rahmann </em>(1872), 22 Ohio St. 446, syllabus; <em>Larrissey </em>v. <em>Norwalk Truck Lines, Inc. </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 207, 219, 44 O.O. 238, 243, 98 N.E. 2d 419, 426.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
