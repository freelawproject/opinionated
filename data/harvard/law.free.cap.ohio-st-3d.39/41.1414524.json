It does not require that each day of jail time be credited as three for purposes of reducing sentence. R.C. 2967.191 requires the Adult Parole Authority to reduce the minimum arid maximum sentences of a prisoner by the total number of days that the prisoner was confined before trial, but that statute has no relation to the three-for-one provision of R.C. 2945.71(E). To be entitled to a writ of mandamus relator must demonstrate that he has a clear legal right to the relief prayed for and that the respondent is under a clear legal duty to perform the act requested. <em>State, ex rel.
