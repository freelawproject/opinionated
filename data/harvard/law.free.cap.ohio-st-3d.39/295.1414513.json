East Ohio argues: (1) that MB and Northeast are affiliated within the meaning of R.C. 4905.03(A)(6), so that the commission cannot relieve MB from regulation as a public utility and natural gas company; (2) that even if it is not affiliated with Northeast, a producer of natural gas such as MB with an extensive pipeline system must be subject to regulation as a public utility and natural gas company; and (3) that the sale of pipeline and related facilities by MB to Northeast and the withdrawal of other property by MB from public utility service require compliance with certain statutory procedures that were not followed. The commission argues that East Ohio lacks standing to bring this appeal because, as to East Ohio, the commission\u2019s decision is not a final appealable order. We agree that MB and Northeast are affiliated within the meaning of R.C. 4905.03(A)(6), reverse the order, and remand the case to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">The commission argues that this court only has jurisdiction to hear appeals of final orders of the commission, R.C. 4903.13<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; that the existence of a final order depends on a substantial right being affected, R.C. 2505.02<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; that no substantial right of East Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>has been affected; and that, therefore, as to East Ohio, there is no final appealable order. <em>Ohio Contract Carriers Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 160, 23 O.O. 369, 42 N.E. 2d 758. To state there is no final order as <em>to East Ohio </em>is merely to state that East Ohio has no substantial right affected by the opinion and order of the commission. This is a question different from whether there is a final order with respect to the entire case. Clearly, the order, which prescribes and limits the conditions under which MB and its affiliated companies may sell natural gas, affects a substantial right of MB. The question is whether it also affects a substantial right of East Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The commission argues that the record contains no evidence of any substantial interest of East Ohio. We disagree. In <em>Ohio Contract Carriers Assn., supra, </em>we characterized the interest necessary to create a \u201csubstantial right\u201d under G.C. 544, the predecessor of R.C. 2505.02, as a \u201c \u2018present interest\u2019 \u201d and an \u201c \u2018immediate and pecuniary\u2019 \u201d interest. <em>Id. </em>at 161, 23 O.O. at 369, 42 N.E. 2d at 759. See, also, <em>In re Guardianship of Love </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St. 2d 111, 113, 48 O.O. 2d 107, 109, 249 N.E. 2d 794, 795. In its memorandum in support of its motion to intervene in this case, East Ohio, referring to the 825 case in which MB first sought exemption from regulation, alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\u201c* * * that if MBO [MB] could compete for gas customers without regulation and could so draw customers away from East Ohio unfairly, East Ohio and its remaining customers would be adversely affected. * * * Like it had in Case No. 85-825-GA-ARJ, East Ohio has an interest in this case to assure that MBO\u2019s supply and distribution are regulated so that MBO and East Ohio may compete fairly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The commission\u2019s attorney examiner granted the motion to intervene, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">\u201c* * * East Ohio alleged that it has the same interest in the instant case [as in the 825 case] to assure that MBO\u2019s supply and distribution activities are regulated so that MBO and East Ohio may compete fairly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">\u201c3) The motion of East Ohio to intervene in the instant proceeding should be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Moreover, in its opinion and order in this case, the commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">\u201cThe Commission is mindful of the circumstances in which East Ohio finds itself at the present time. East Ohio argues it has lost a part of its industrial load to unregulated gas companies and that these companies have an unfair advantage over\u2019 East Ohio because they are not regulated by the Commission. Recognizing this problem, the Commission issued its 1076 Order setting limits on the activities gas producers could engage in without being considered a natural gas company subject to our jurisdiction. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">Thus, East Ohio\u2019s interest is identified in the record as present, immediate, and pecuniary. <em>Ohio Contract Carriers Assn., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">In <em>Ohio Power Co. </em>v. <em>Attica </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St. 2d 37, 52 O.O. 2d 90, 261 N.E. 2d 123, we held that Ohio Power, as the supplier of power to a village under an existing franchise, had standing to attack ordinances granting a new franchise to a rural electric cooperative to supply power in a part of the village, stating that Ohio Power had a \u201cvital interest\u201d in the authority of the village to grant the franchise. <em>Id. </em>at 38, 52 O.O. 2d at 91, 261 N.E. 2d at 125. Those factors closely parallel the facts in this case. Here, East Ohio has a vital interest, <em>i.e., </em>a present, immediate, and pecuniary interest, in the authority of the commission to exempt MB from regulation. In both cases, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>direct effect on the appellant\u2019s sales in a given area is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">We recognize that standing to intervene in proceedings before the commission does not necessarily confer standing to appeal to this court. <em>Ohio Contract Carriers Assn., supra. </em>However, in this case, the interest identified in the record and relied on by the commission does confer standing to appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the order of the commission affects a substantial right under R.C. 2505.02, and that it is a final appealable order of the commission as to East Ohio under R.C. 4903.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Affiliation</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">R.C. 4905.03(A)(6) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">\u201c* * * The commission may, upon application made to it, relieve any producer of natural gas, defined in this section as a gas company or a natural gas company, of compliance with the obligations imposed by * * * [public utility law], so long as such producer is <em>not affiliated with or under the control of a </em>gas company or a natural gas company engaged in the transportation or distribution of natural gas, or so long as such producer does not engage in the distribution of natural gas to consumers.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">East Ohio argues that MB is \u201caffiliated with\u201d Northeast, a natural gas company. It is undisputed that JR, a company owned by the family interest that owns MB, owns 9.7 percent of the stock of Northeast and that two members of the board of directors of MB and EB are also directors of Northeast. On this issue the commission concluded, based on its finding in a previous case, case No. 85-1974-GA-AEC, which involved Northeast, that \u201caffiliated with\u201d means the ability to direct the policy of, and thus to control, another. Specifically, it found that JR\u2019s stock ownership and the common directors did not give MB the ability to control Northeast.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">East Ohio argues that to define \u201caffiliated with\u201d in terms of control is to make that phrase synonymous with \u201ccontrol,\u201d as expressly used in the statute, a violation of a canon of statutory construction. We start from the premise that construction of the phrase is a legal issue ultimately for this court to decide, and not a factual question which we subject to less intensive examination. <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 108, 110, 12 O.O. 3d 115, 116, 388 N.E. 2d 1370, 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed. 1979) 54, defines \u201caffiliate\u201d as signifying a \u201ccondition of being united; being in close connection, allied, associated, or attached as a member or branch.\u201d ' However, the commission\u2019s construction of \u201caffiliated with\u201d is markedly narrower, making the phrase virtually synonymous with \u201cunder the control of,\u201d as used in R.C. 4905.03(A)(6). In making this construction, the commission has failed to abide by a basic rule of statutory construction \u2014 that words in statutes should not be construed to be redundant, nor should any words be ignored. 50 Ohio .Jurisprudence 2d (1961) 207, Statutes, Section 227. R.C. 4905.03(A)(6) clearly contrasts the terms of \u201caffiliation\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d by stating them in the disjunctive. Equating \u201caffiliated with\u201d and \u201cunder the control of,\u201d as the commission has done, makes the General Assembly\u2019s use of the term \u201ccontrol\u201d redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">\u201cAffiliated\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d are <em>not </em>synonymous, yet the commission in its order defines \u201caffiliated with\u201d as \u201cthe power to cause the direction of policies, either directly or indirectly.\u201d That definition, coupled with the phrase \u201cunder the control of,\u201d means that the only time that a company affiliated with another entity through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>common stock ownership or interlocking directorates can not be granted exemption is when either entity exercises a degree of control akin to an \u201calter ego.\u201d This is too stringent a definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">We note from the briefs of the parties that there are various definitions of \u201caffiliate\u201d and \u201caffiliated\u201d in and outside the public utility industry.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not dictate a particular choice, but we do hold as a matter of law that the commission erred in equating \u201caffiliated\u201d with \u201ccontrol\u201d in a sentence where both terms are used. Obviously, the General Assembly intended \u201caffiliated\u201d to have a wider scope in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Therefore, we hold that as used in R.C. 4905.03(A)(6), the phrases \u201caffiliated with\u201d and \u201cunder the control of\u201d are not synonymous. In this context, \u201caffiliated with\u201d does not mean the power to cause the direction of policies, either directly or indirectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Because of our resolution of this issue, we do not decide the other issues raised by East Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Accordingly, we reverse the order of the commission and remand the cause for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">\n<em>Order reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-11\">Sweeney, Acting C.J., Young, Locher, Holmes and H.
