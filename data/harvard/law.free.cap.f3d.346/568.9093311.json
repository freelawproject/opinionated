The pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), a sixteen-level increase ' to Mendez-Villa\u2019s base offense level of eight. The increase was applied because Mendez-Villa had been deported subsequent to a conviction for a felony drug-trafficking offense, <em>ie., </em>aggravated unlawful possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, for which Mendez-Villa had been sentenced to-five years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">Mendez-Villa objected to the proposed increase, arguing that he had actually served fewer than thirteen months for his drug conviction and under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 1), only a twelve-level increase was warranted. The district court overruled the objection, and Mendez-Villa timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-17\">Mendez-Villa challenges the sixteen-level increase that was applied to his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). He contends that the \u201csentence imposed\u201d for his felony drug trafficking conviction did not exceed thirteen months. Mendez-Villa admits that he was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment for the felony drug offense. He explains, however, that he was released on parole after having served only four months. He argues that the \u201csentence imposed\u201d does not include the portion of his sentence that he spent on parole. Mendez-Villa relies on Application Note (1)(A)(iv) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 for the proposition that a paroled sentence is a sentence that has been suspended, deferred, or stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-18\">The Government argues that \u201csentence imposed\u201d means the sentence pronounced by the court at sentencing. The Government asserts that if the Sentencing Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>mission had wished to include parole in the list of events that affected the \u201csentence imposed\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1), it could have done so. The Government argues that Application Note (1)(A)(iv) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 addresses matters that occur in the sentencing court and not matters handled by an entity distinct from the sentencing court, such as a parole board. The Government urges adoption of the Eighth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Arreola, </em>313 F.3d 1064, 1065, 1067 (8th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Section 2L1.2(b)(1), U.S.S.G., provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\u201cIf the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">(A) a conviction for a felony that is (i) a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months; ... increase by 16 levels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">(B) a conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less, increase by 12 levels.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Application Note (1)(A)(iv) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 provides: \u201cIf all or any part of a sentence of imprisonment was probated, suspended, deferred, or stayed, \u2018sentence imposed\u2019 refers only to the portion that was not probated, suspended, deferred, or stayed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">We analyze the Guidelines under the rules that apply to the interpretation of statutes. <em>United States v. Boudreau, </em>250 F.3d 279, 285 (5th Cir.2001). The text of the guideline is the starting point in the analysis; the commentary is considered authoritative. <em>Id. </em>We use \u201ca plain-meaning approach\u201d in our interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>Our review of issues of statutory interpretation is <em>de novo. United States v. Perez-Macias, </em>335 F.3d 421, 425 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">In <em>Rodriguez-Arreola, </em>313 F.3d at 1065, the appellant was convicted of a felony drug trafficking offense and was sentenced to an \u201c \u2018indeterminate period\u2019 of not less than eight months nor more than five years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1065. He was paroled and deported after serving eight months. <em>Id. </em>Following his plea of guilty to a charge of illegal reentry to the United States, the district court applied to his base offense level a sixteen-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). <em>Id. </em>Rodriguez-Arreola challenged the increase on the grounds that the \u201csentence imposed\u201d for his drug conviction was less than thirteen months. <em>Id. </em>at 1066. The Eighth Circuit held that the \u201csentence imposed\u201d was the maximum term imposed in an indeterminate sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1067; <em>see United States v. Frias, </em>338 F.3d 206, 208, 212 (3d Cir.2003) (holding that the sentence imposed is the maximum term of imprisonment in an indeterminate sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">The Guideline uses the term \u201csentence imposed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) &amp; (B). Application Note (1)(a)(IV), U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, excepts from the \u201csentence imposed\u201d any portions of the sentence that were \u201cprobated, suspended, deferred, or stayed.\u201d Application Note (1)(a)(IV), U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, does not include parole in its list of exceptions. The plain language of the Guidelines and the authoritative commentary indicate that any portion of the sentence spent on parole shall be included in the calculation of the \u201csentence imposed\u201d per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1). <em>See Boudreau, </em>250 F.3d at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">Mendez-Villa also contends that the felony conviction that resulted in his increased sentence was an element of the offense that should have been charged in the indictment. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in light of the decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). MendezVilla\u2019s contention lacks merit. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
