His appeal raises issues of ineffective assistance of counsel and whether the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(b) was plain error. Because the record before us is insufficient, we decline to consider Gordon\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims. Because we find that the district court plainly erred in adding two points to Gordon\u2019s criminal history score under \u00a7 4A1.1(b), we vacate and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Gordon\u2019s presentence report calculated a criminal history score of ten. Two of the criminal history points were awarded under \u00a7 4A1.1(b) based on a six-month house arrest sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gordon\u2019s criminal history score of ten, which placed him in criminal history category V, combined with his total offense level of 22 yielded a guideline imprisonment range of 77 to 96 months. The district court sentenced Gordon to 90 months in prison and three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Gordon argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) evidence and failed to request a jury instruction limiting the jury\u2019s use of bad-act evidence. Gordon also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to subpoena David Wilson, a key witness, to testify in his defense. The Government argues that whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Rule 404(b) evidence may be decided by this court because trial counsel was effective and the statements complained of are not Rule 404(b) evidence or the court can dismiss the claim without prejudice to Gordon raising that claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. With regard to the claim that trial counsel was ineffective for not subpoenaing Wilson, the Government argues that the evidence is inadequate to establish whether Gordon told counsel about Wilson but also argues that trial counsel was not ineffective for not calling Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">As a general rule, we decline to review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>55 F.3d 173, 179 (5th Cir.1995). The Supreme Court recently has emphasized that a \u00a7 2255 motion is the preferred method for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1692-94, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). The Court noted that \u201c[w]hen an ineffective-assistance claim is brought on direct appeal, appellate counsel and the court must proceed on a trial record not developed precisely for the object of litigating or preserving the claim and thus often incomplete or inadequate for this purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1694.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">In accordance with this principle, we have undertaken to resolve a claim of inadequate representation on direct appeal only in a case where the record is adequate to allow the court to consider the claim\u2019s merits. <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 314 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>Massaro, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1696. This is not the rare case in which a claim of ineffective representation can be resolved on direct appeal. The record has not been developed with regard to counsel\u2019s motivation for his trial tactics. Additionally, the record is not sufficient to determine why Wilson could not be located before trial. We thus adhere to our general rule and decline to consider these claims on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Gordon also argues that the district court erred in assessing two criminal history points for his house arrest. He argues that house arrest is not a \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.1(b). He contends that without the erroneous two-point addition his criminal history score would have been nine points, making the guideline range 63 to 79<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> months rather than 77 to 96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Although Gordon states that he objected to the assessment of the two criminal history points, in fact, no objection was made to the application of \u00a7 4A1.1(b). We therefore review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). To demonstrate plain error, an appellant must show clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights; if he does, this court has discretion to correct a forfeited error that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, but we are not required to do so. <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994)(en banc)(citing <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 730-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Under \u00a7 4A1.1(b), two criminal history points are added \u201cfor each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days,\u201d but. not exceeding 13 months. \u00a7 4A1.1(b); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 4A1.1(a). Under \u00a7 4A1.1(c), one criminal history point is assigned for sentences not counted in \u00a7 4A1.1(a) or (b). \u201cThe term \u2018sentence of imprisonment\u2019 means a sentence of incarceration and refers to the maximum sentence imposed.\u201d \u00a7 4A1.2(b); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 4A1.1, comment, n.2 (noting that term \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d used in \u00a7 4Al.l(b) was defined in \u00a7 4A1.2(b)). \u201cIf part of a sentence of imprisonment was suspended, \u2018sentence of imprisonment\u2019 refers only to the portion that was not suspended.\u201d \u00a7 4A1.2(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Chapter 4, part A of the Guidelines does not mention home detention. The Guidelines do address home detention elsewhere. Section 5C1.1 allows the sentencing judge to substitute home detention for imprisonment for less serious crimes. \u00a7 5C1.1(c)(2) and (3). Additionally, under \u00a7 7B1.3(d), a sentencing court may require a recidivist to serve a period of \u201chome detention ... in addition to\u201d the term of imprisonment. These provisions demonstrate that the Guidelines do not consider home detention and imprisonment to be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Gordon cites decisions from the Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits in support of his proposition that home detention differs from \u201cimprisonment\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.1. The Sixth Circuit has held that, because home detention is a substitute for imprisonment, time spent in home detention is not a \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.1(a). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>107 F.3d 1147, 1165 (6th Cir.1997). The Seventh Circuit has held that electronic home detention is not a form of \u201cimprisonment\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 5G1.3. <em>United States v. Phipps, </em>68 F.3d 159, 162 (7th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Compton, </em>82 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>179, 184 (7th Cir.1996). In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>41 Fed.Appx. 134 (9th Cir.2002)(unpublished), 41 Fed.Appx. at 135-36, the Ninth Circuit held that house arrest was not equivalent to imprisonment for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.1(e), which provides for the addition of two points to the criminal history score for an offense committed less than two years after release from imprisonment counted under \u00a7 4A1.1(a) or (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">This Court has not addressed whether home detention is a \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.1. In <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>166 F.3d 723, 726 (5th Cir.1999), we held that a \u201cboot camp term was properly a sentence of imprisonment for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.1.\u201d The Government cites this case in support of its argument that the district court did not plainly err in awarding two points for Gordon\u2019s six-month term of house arrest. However, in <em>Brooks, </em>we quoted with approval reasoning from the Tenth Circuit discussing \u00a7 4A1.2(b)\u2019s definition of a sentence of imprisonment as a sentence of incarceration and suggesting that \u201c \u2018physical confinement is a key distinction between sentences of imprisonment and other types of sentences.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726-27 (quoting <em>United States v. Vanderlaan, </em>921 F.2d 257, 259 (10th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The Government also cites <em>United States v. Ruffin, </em>40 F.3d 1296, 1299 (D.C.Cir.1994), in which the District of Columbia Circuit held that, for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.1(b), a defendant who was committed to the Attorney General\u2019s custody for one year with work release ordered for 12 hours per weekday was imprisoned. However, this case is distinguishable from one in which only home detention has been ordered since, although Ruffin was released from confinement for 12 hours per weekday, he was confined to prison 12 hours per weekday and on the weekends. <em>Ruffin, </em>40 F.3d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The Government also cites <em>United States v. Schomburg, </em>929 F.2d 505, 507 (9th Cir.1991), which involved a defendant who had been sentenced to 60 days in jail with the recommendation that the sentence be served in a weekend work project during which he was required to work seven hours each Saturday and Sunday under the supervision of the sheriffs office but was not held in custody. The Ninth Circuit held that, because the defendant\u2019s eligibility to participate in the weekend work project was determined by the sheriff, \u201cthe sentence, as pronounced by the court at the outset, was a sentence of imprisonment subject to alteration at the Sheriffs discretion.\u201d <em>Schomburg, </em>929 F.2d at 507. Therefore, this decision also is distinguishable from the instant case in that there is no indication in the record that Gordon\u2019s sentence of house arrest involved any discretion by law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The Government also cites three Texas deferred-adjudication cases: <em>United States v. Valdez-Valdez, </em>143 F.3d 196, 202 (5th Cir.1998), <em>United States v. Hatchett, </em>923 F.2d 369, 376-77 (5th Cir.1991), and <em>United States v. Giraldo-Lara, </em>919 F.2d 19, 23 (5th Cir.1990). Those cases are inapposite because a particular guideline provision provides that a deferred adjudication is counted as a sentence under \u00a7 4A1.1(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.1(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">In sum, the Guidelines define a \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d as a \u201csentence of incarceration\u201d and distinguish between \u201cimprisonment\u201d and \u201chome detention.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 4A1.2(b), 601.1(c), 7B1.3(d). As Gordon points out, three circuits have held that home detention does not equal imprisonment for \u00a7 4A1.1 purposes, and none of the cases that the Government has cited indicates that we should hold otherwise. Moreover, in a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 case, we have cited with approval to <em>Phipps, </em>which held that home detention is not \u201cimprisonment.\u201d <em>United States v. Landeros-Arreola, </em>260 F.3d 407, 414 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Phipps, </em>68 F.3d at 161, for the proposition that \u201cimprisonment \u2018denote[s] time spent in a penal institution,\u2019 and Guidelines reference to imprisonment separate from home detention indicates that the \u2018Guidelines distinguish [between] the two\u2019 \u201d). Thus, the district court\u2019s error in assessing two points under \u00a7 4A1.1(b) for Gordon\u2019s house-arrest sentence is plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Gordon\u2019s substantial rights have been affected by his 90-month sentence. Absent the error, the guideline range would have been 63 to 78 months, instead of 77 to 96 months. Consequently, the district court committed plain error in assessing two points under \u00a7 4A1.1(b). We, therefore, VACATE and REMAND the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-10\">. Gordon\u2019s sentence resulting in his house arrest actually was five years\u2019 imprisonment, but that punishment was suspended for six months of \"Intensive Supervision/House Arrest Program\u201d and four and one-half years of probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\">.
