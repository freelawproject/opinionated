HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1064-36\">Thomashefsky, the bankrupt, employed Block, the appellee, on July 11,1923, as box office manager in a theatre operated by him. Block deposited $1,000\u2019 with him as a guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>anty against defalcation, under a written contract by which it was to be held \u201cas security and for no other purpose and shall be returned * * at the termination of the said employment.\u201d Block left Thoma-shefsky\u2019s employ on March 2, 1924, and got a judgment against him, for $365 on April twenty-fifth of that year in an action, the nature of which does not appear. Thomashef-sky then left the United States, and during his absence Block filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against him, which resulted in his adjudication on June 4, 1924. A trustee was appointed who took possession of Thomashe-fsky\u2019s property, and presumably distributed it, but Thomashefsky never applied for a discharge. On his return Block sued him in another action for his failure to return the deposit, and got judgment on May 29, 1929. The complaint alleged that Thom-ashefsky had received the money in a fiduciary capacity, solely as a deposit, and had converted it to his use, and the judgment provided for execution against his body. Thereafter Block procured an order for the examination of Thomashefsky in proceedings supplementary to execution upon the earlier judgment, and Thomashefsky defaulted in appearance; on January 13, 1931, the court entered an order fining Thomashefsky for this contempt. Thereupon Thomashefsky filed a petition for voluntary adjudication on January 27, 1931, was adjudicated on the same day, and procured from the District-Court an ex parte stay of -all proceedings upon the judgment in the second action, and upon the order fining Thomashefsky for contempt in the first. Block then applied to the District Court by rule nisi for a vacation of the stay, which the judge granted. Thoma-shefsky appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">The second judgment was clearly not dischargeable in bankruptcy, section 17a (6), 11 US.CA \u00a7 35(6); indeed we do not understand that the contrary is argued. The same is true of the fine for contempt, since the order imposing it antedated the bankruptcy. In re Koronsky, 170 F. 719 (C. C. A. 2); In re Hall (D. C.) 170 F. 721; People ex rel. Otterstedt v. Sheriff of Kings County (D. C.) 206 F. 566; In re Francisco (D. C.) 245 F. 216. Only two questions arise, (1) whether Block\u2019s petition for involuntary adjudication in 1924 was an election to proceed only in contract, (2) whether the bankrupt was in any event entitled to immunity from arrest under section 9a (2), 11 USCA \u00a7 27 (a) (2), until the determination of ,his application for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\"> Upon the first point the argument is that, as Bloek was the sole petitioner in 1924, and thus necessarily elected to sue in contract, he could not thereafter sue in conversion. This would have been a bad plea in the state action in any ease (Friend v. Talcott, 228 U. S. 27, 33 S. Ct. 505, 57 L. Ed. 718), but we need not consider that.. The claim is now in judgment, and cannot be impeached; it is not dischargeable in this bankruptcy proceeding, and for that matter, was equally undisehargeable in the earlier one. It may not therefore be stayed. Apparently the first judgment might have been discharged in the 1924 proceeding, but no discharge was obtained, and the time has long since passed when any application is possible. Section 14 (a), 11 US CA \u00a7 32 (a). While it is also dischargeable in this proceeding, the liability for the fine is not, and may not be stayed. Recurring to the second judgment, Block\u2019s position, as petitioning creditor, was no different from that of any other creditor who proved a claim; filing a petition is no more an election than filing a claim, and if it were, it would not be material in the face of the judgment. Thus there is no force in the first point in any aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">Coming to the second point, the relevant section is 9a (2), 11 USCA \u00a7 27 (a) (2), the last clause of which provides that when a debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy the bankrupt \u201cshall be exempt from * * * arrest when in attendance upon a court of bankruptcy or engaged in the performance of a duty imposed by the provisions of this title.\u201d Of the General Orders, No. XII (11 USCA \u00a7 53) gives to referees the power tQ issue an order of general protection to a bankrupt, which however the court may \u201cvacate or suspend\u201d; No. XXX provides that if already imprisoned, the bankrupt may be produced on habeas corpus to testify before the referee, and if arrested pending the proceedings upon \u201ca claim provable in bankruptcy,\u2019! \u201cif so provable he shall be discharged; if not, he shall be remanded.\u201d The question arose in Re Baker (D. C.) 96 F. 954, whether a bankrupt, imprisoned on a provable, but not dischargeable, claim, should be released, in the face of the language of Order XXX (11 USCA \u00a7 53) Judge Hook thought that \u201cprovable,\u201d as there used, must be understood as equivalent to \u201cdischargea-ble,\u201d and remanded the bankrupt, without considering the last clause of section 9a (2), 11 USCA \u00a7 27 (a) (2). In Re Lewensohn (D. C.) 99 F. 73, certain creditors had secured judgments for fraud against the bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>rupt and were about to arrest him. Judge Brown stayed these executions until the determination of the bankrupt\u2019s discharge, upon his giving security to obey all orders of the bankruptcy court, and not to leave the jurisdiction; and we affirmed his decision on his own opinion. 104 F. 1006. Judge Adams followed this in Re Dresser (D. C.) 124 F. 915, though in Re Kane (C. C. A.) 48 F.(2d) 96, we said that the granting of any immunity under Order XII (11 USCA \u00a7 53) and \u00a7 9a (2), 11 USCA \u00a7 27 (a) (2), rested in the discretion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">Order XII (11 USCA \u00a7 53) in permitting the referee to give a general protection to the bankrupt, meant no more than that prima facie he might be entitled to as much; as ta dischargeable debts, because he was so entitled without condition; as to those not dis-chargeable, because specific claims could be dealt with by the District Court. We agree that in general under Order XXX (11 USCA \u00a7 53) he must be remanded in all cases in which the debt is not \u201cprovable,\u201d which, with Judge Hook, we read as meaning discharge-able; but attendance upon his duties as bankrupt may require his temporary freedom at times when he is not in aetual attendance upon the court, and it may be inconvenient repeatedly to bring him from custody by habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Under the last clause of section 9a (2), 11 USCA \u00a7 27 (a) (2) this convenience will justify his release for limited periods to perform his duties as a bankrupt; it is hard to believe that Order XXX (11 USCA \u00a7 53) was meant to forbid as much, and Order XII (11 USCA \u00a7 53) seems to countenance it. We adhere to so much of our decision in Re Lewensohn. On the other hand we cannot agree with the specific application of this doctrine there made, unless it rested upon circumstances not disclosed in the record. The length of the release and its occasion are no doubt for the District Court to determine; but it is very hard to imagine circumstances requiring the bankrupt\u2019s freedom during the whole proceeding, or even until his discharge is determined. We can see no relation between the necessities of his attendance to his duties, and the interval until he is discharged. He will not ordinarily be required for much of the period before that is decided, and he may be required thereafter. Certainly he has no right to a release because of a possible discharge, which will not affect the claim. While therefore the matter is discretionary we cannot agree that the discharge is at all relevant in the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">In the ease at bar the bankrupt suggested nothing making necessary his attendance in the proceedings; the judge was therefore right in vacating the order. It will be affirmed, but without prejudice to any application by a creditor, and possibly by the bankrupt himself [In re Kane (C. C. A.) 48 F.(2d) 96], for a release for such limited periods as may be found to be necessary in the administration of the estate. In so far as this conflicts with In Re Lewensohn, that decision is to be deemed overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
