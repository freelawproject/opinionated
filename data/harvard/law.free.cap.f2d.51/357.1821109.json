In so holding, the court said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-19\">\u201cThe admitted fact that before defendant\u2019s acts complained of the words \u2018Horliek\u2019s Malted Milk\u2019 [plaintiff\u2019s trade named product] had come to mean and be understood as descriptive of plaintiff\u2019s product and no other, coupled with the similarity of the names \u2018Horliek\u2019 and \u2018Horluek,\u2019 makes it reasonably certain that advertising by the defendant, such as above set out, with the word \u2018Horluck\u2019s\u2019 prominently and closely associated with the words \u2018Malted Milk,\u2019 would mislead a part of the buying public. Therefore, if no more were shown, it is to be presumed that defendant intended to so mislead.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-21\">Plaintiff now contends that the decree should provide for an accounting for defendant\u2019s profits. The defendant objects, contending that in no event is defendant liable to account for more than the damage which the plaintiff has suffered by the defendant\u2019s unfair competition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-22\">Plaintiff cites Nims, on Unfair Competition, page 1078; N.

It is not necessary that plaintiff prove defendant\u2019s actual intent to mis-lead buyers to defendant\u2019s profit and plaintiff\u2019s loss. Men are presumed to intend the natural consequences of their voluntary acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The court has found that the defendant committed a tort in unfairly competing with plaintiff. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to full compensation for the damages which it has suffered. To decree plaintiff the defendant\u2019s profits would be to punish defendant and not to compensate the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Conceding, that a court of equity, in a proper ease, may decree the recovery of his profits from a defendant, the question still remains, Has it been shown by the requisite amount of evidence that the conduct of the defendant herein has been so culpable \u2014 so willfully fraudulent \u2014 as to merit such decree?</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The first mistake, if monopoly was the aim, was made by the predecessors of plaintiff in adopting an individual name \u2014 a surname \u2014 that of the founders of the business, as a trade name. Its goods so marked were \u201cdistinguished\u201d from the goods of all others just so long as a man of the same or a similar name did not engage in the same business, using his name in that business.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Being long first in the field, time and the results worked in the course of time partly cured this mistake, and the defendant, because of this, is no longer entirely free to associate the surname of its founders with its business as it sees fit. Plaintiff will be protected by a court of equity from loss on account of that confusion which its predecessor in the first instance invited in adopting the use of an individual name \u2014 a surname \u2014 -to designate its wares, but though a court of equity will not only enjoin defendant from further unfair competition, but will do complete justice and aid in restoring to plaintiff that which it has lost through defendant\u2019s failure to do all that was reasonable to dis-tingpfish its from plaintiff\u2019s goods, it does not follow that plaintiff should recover defendant\u2019s profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Plaintiff is entitled to an injunction and its damages, because it has been shown to be so entitled by a fair preponderance of the evidence. It cannot recover defendant\u2019s profits unless it has been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of willful fraud in the use of the enjoined trade-name.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The statutes of the state of Washington (Remington\u2019s Compiled Statutes of Washington, 1922, \u00a7\u00a7 9976 to 9980, inclusive) make it unlawful for a person to conduct or transact business in this state under any other than his own name unless he shall file a certificate in the office of the county clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\"> Each man in the court of conscience is \u201ccounsel for himself\u201d and his conclusions regarding his rights and 'duties with relation to the rights of others may be much distorted short of willful fraud. The right to deny to a man the free use of his own name in connection with his business is not so plain and clear as to show willful fraud, although he may be fully aware of the use by another of a similar name in a similar business. Under such circumstances, the sword of equity is free to lop off the objectionable practice and to enforce the restoration of damages suffered by the earlier user of the trade-name in question, but it will not touch his shoulder and bid him rise up a knight errant to avenge, for in such a ease it is not equity to create a private prosecutor, for his sense of duty is also likely to be distorted when he receives a reward in proportion to the punishment he inflicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The evidence in this ease has not shown beyond a reasonable doubt willful fraud on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Paragraph 2 of the submitted form of decree, which paragraph provides: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">\u201cThat the plaintiff recover from the defendant Horluek\u2019s Inc., all profits derived by the defendant from the operation of its shops under the names Horluek\u2019s Malted Milk Shops or Horluek\u2019s Malted Milk, and that this cause be and it is hereby referred to -as Master to ascertain and assess said profits, with full power to subpoena and order the attendance of witnesses, the taking of depositions and the production of books, papers and documents pertinent to ascertaining and assessing said profits, and to report to this court the amount of said profits when ascertained and assessed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">\u2014not being in conformity with the conclusions herein reached, the decree will not be signed as submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">Any further hearing upon the settlement of the decree will be upon notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">The clerk is directed to notify the attorneys for the parties of this ruling.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
