The Teppet patent is for a process and composition for destroying weeds\u2014 one that is toxic to weeds, nontoxie to animals, and noneorrosive to metal. A chlorate used in solution in water is the essential element of this weed destroyer, the patentee preferring sodium ehlorate because of its cheapness. The prior patent of Trauffaut discloses and teaches the use of chlorates in solution for precisely the same purpose, expressing a preference for the least costly chlorates, and mentioning chlorate of soda as one of them. The faet disclosed by Teppet that chlorates are nontoxie to animal and noneorrosive to metal is likewise disclosed by Trauffaut, who states that the products, or the mixture of the products which form the objects of his invention, cannot be noxious and give entire satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-24\"><em>We </em>therefore hold that the Trauffaut patent fully and adequately discloses the whole invention of the Teppet patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-25\">The decree of the court below is affirmed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
