and for 1922, interest on the same sum from January 1 to June 15, at the same rate, being the legal rate in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-29\">These deductions are claimed under section 234, Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 254:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-30\">\u201c(a) That in computing the net income of a corporation subject to the tax imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>by section 230 there shall be allowed as deductions: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201c(2) All interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on its indebtedness. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The Commissioner and Board of Tax Appeals in effect held that calling the payments interest did not make them interest, and that they were actually payments on the principal sums due and in discharge thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">With these findings we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">As said by Mr. Klein on page 451 of his work on Federal Income Taxation, \u201cif what is termed \u2018interest\u2019 by the parties is really part and parcel of the debt, the item cannot be deducted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Moneys paid under the 1915 contract were not to have been treated as interest until the contract of 1921, wherein the principal was considered as unchanged by their payment, but it was provided that they should form part of the settlement sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Reduced to its bones, the agreement of 1921 was a contingent settlement with creditors at 45 cents on the dollar, with a credit thereon for moneys paid under the 1915 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">While the payments under the agreement were designated \u201cinterest,\u201d there was no provision for the payment of interest in the usual acceptation of the term unless the contingency should not arise, through failure to make payments totaling 45 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">But the contingency did arise and the settlement was completed by payment of 45 per cent in less than a year and a half, from which it is evident that the officers of the corporation should have known before deduction of interest for 1921 that nothing but the 45 per cent, would in fact be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">\u201cA contingent liability per se cannot justify a current deduction; a liability must have become absolute before it can result in a deductible expense.\u201d Klein, Federal Income Taxation, 1930 Supplement, page 57, Par. 15:7.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">The question of interest was voluntarily left in abeyance for some three years, with experience suggesting that it would probably not be paid, and a deduction claimed for one year when this probability was strengthened, and for another year or part thereof, when the probability had become a certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">The amount paid by petitioner to its creditors was not interest, and the petitioner was not entitled to deduction for interest, either accrued or paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
