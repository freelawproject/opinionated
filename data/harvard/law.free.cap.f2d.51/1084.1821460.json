This agency was not secured and the corporation was never formed. If the agency had been secured and the corporation formed, the automobile business owned by Martin would \u25a0naturally have been acquired by the corporation, but on what terms had not been determined. The project having fallen through and Martin having no sales agency, Martin offered to dispose of his business to Spencer, but they could not agree on a sales price, so, as Spencer had not bought Martin\u2019s stock on hand, and as he had contributed neither money nor property thereto, and as Martin had no sales agency, he proceeded to close out and liquidate the stock on hand. True, it appears Spencer claimed an interest in the business, but, on Martin denying he had any interest, Spencer apparently acquiesced, the proof being \u201che left Martin to wind up the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>business alone.\u201d In its final opinion tbe court found that Spencer \u201cmade no contribution whatever to the capital of the business; all of the moneys were paid in by Martin,\u201d and that \u201cMartin, of course, must be reimbursed for his financial investment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\">After such liquidation by Martin, Spencer filed a bill against him for an accounting, alleging a partnership existed, and praying an accounting. On hearing, an accounting, for some months\u2019 operation during the efforts to get the sales agency as above stated was ordered. On such accounting the master reported and exceptions to his report were disposed of by the court, which held that Martin was not indebted to Spencer. We have carefully examined the proofs,- and are satisfied the court below was justified in its conclusions. In its opinion it discussed and analyzed the facts, held that under the circumstances of the case \u201cthe defendant should not be penalized for failure to take a physical inventory of automobile parts on March 11,1917, any more than the plaintiff should.\u201d It reasoned: \u201cWhat better evidence would the Master need of the value of parts on hand at that time (August first) than the actual sale price of these parts in the open market? * * * There was nothing to do but liquidate the business. Certainly the sale price of the automobile parts would then be an important element in fixing the value as of August first if they were honestly sold by the defendant.\u201d It further held that the costs up to that time be divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">Without entering into further discussion of the ease, which has been done so thoroughly by the court below, we limit ourselves to stating that we find ourselves in accord with the court below in the method of accounting it directed and in the correctness\u2019 of the results reached thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">The decree below is therefore affirmed; the appellant to pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
