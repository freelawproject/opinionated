J. 1121, the court below found the corresponding degree of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Ordinary care means that degree of care, attention, or exertion, which, under the actual circumstances, a man -of reasonable prudence and discretion would use in reference to the particular thing if it were his own property. 6 C. J. 1119; New York C. R. Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. (84 U. S.) 383, 21 L. Ed. 627; Schermer v. Neurath, 54 Md. 497, 39 Am. Rep. 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The resident manager, as a witness for defendant, testified that she did not keep the key to her own apartment on the ring in the office because the employees knew she sometimes had as much as a thousand dollars in her apartment, and she did not want her key readily accessible to the employees because of the special temptation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Nearly half that amount was stolen from plaintiff, who also had other things of value in her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">This evidence of the manager tended to show one measure of care for the key of the owner of the building, or his representative, and a lesser measure of care for the keys of his tenants left in his custody, and, along with other evidence, fully justified the court in finding a lack of ordinary care in this bailment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">The questions of evidence presented by the record go to its weight rather than to its competency to prove the value of the <em>lost </em>jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">This was antique jewelry, having no current market value, and plaintiff supplemented her testimony with opinion evidence of an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">The articles not having been recovered, this witness could testify only from a description of them and from a photograph of the plaintiff\u2019s grandmother taken while wearing the brooch.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">This testimony appears to have been the best available under the circumstances, and the court, sitting as a jury, had the right as well as the duty to exercise its own judgment after receiving it. 17 C. J. 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">We find no error, and the judgment is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
