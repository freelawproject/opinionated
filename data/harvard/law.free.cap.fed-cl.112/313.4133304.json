United States, </em>110 Fed.Cl. 210 (2013); Judgment of March 22, 2013, ECF No. 321. Appeals from that judgment are now pending before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <em>See appeals docketed, </em>Nos. 13-5096, 13-5099 (Fed.Cir. May 24, 2013, May 30, 2013). Given the appellate stage of these eases, this court has a very limited role juris-dictionally, having power to address only a restricted set of post judgment matters. <em>See Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (reiterating the principle that upon the filing of an appeal, the trial court surrenders \u201cits control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal\u201d). One of those potentially residual issues has now been put before the court, by way of a motion by the government to unseal virtually all of the sealed portions of the trial record. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. to Unseal the Trial Record, or, in the Alternative, to Redact Sealed Documents in the Trial Record (\u201cDef.\u2019s Mot. to Unseal\u201d), ECF No. 329.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sikorsky vigorously opposes this motion, arguing both that it is untimely and that it is without merit because the relevant portions of the trial record contain competitively sensitive information that is appropriately subject to a previously entered protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">Concurrently, the government has filed a second motion to seal one page of the trial transcript that has not been sealed. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Sealed Mot. to Seal Page 172 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Trial Tr. (\u201cDef.\u2019s Further Mot.\u201d), ECF No. 330. Sikorsky opposes this motion on the ground that the pertinent page contains no specific competitively sensitive information. PL\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The government\u2019s motions in effect seek to negate the protective order entered early in this litigation at the behest of the parties pursuant to Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d), to protect confidential and proprietary information from public disclosure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motions also constitute a belated <em>volte-face </em>from an earlier, timely effort by both parties to calibrate and settle the protected portions of the record on appeal. <em>See </em>Joint Mot. to Unseal Portions of the Trial Tr. (June 26, 2013), ECF No. 327. That joint motion had been filed with the court pursuant to Federal Circuit Rule 11(d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and it was promptly granted. <em>See </em>Order of June 26, 2013, ECF No. 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">On the merits, these cases concern the application of the government\u2019s Cost Accounting Standards (\u201cCAS\u201d) set out at 48 C.F.R. Chapter 99, Subehapter B, Part 9904. Sikorsky has and has had a number of contracts with the government to manufacture and supply aircraft and spare parts to the government, primarily for military use. The government challenged Sikorsky\u2019s allocation of indirect costs to its government contracts and sought reimbursement of approximately $80 million plus interest. <em>See Sikorsky, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 213. After trial, the court ruled that the government had failed to carry its burden of proof to demonstrate that Sikorsky had improperly allocated indirect costs under the CAS, and Sikorsky accordingly defeated the government\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at 230. The proofs at trial included extensive evidence of vai\u2019ious categories of Sikorsky\u2019s costs, and portions of the trial record were sealed to maintain confidentiality of cost data. Correspondingly, the court\u2019s final decision reflected redactions of data and information about specific costs. Portions of the trial record were sealed and redactions were made in the court\u2019s final decision in accord with the narrowly drawn protective order entered in the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">STANDARD FOR DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">The court\u2019s protective order is a non-final order, reconsideration of which is governed by RCFC 54(b) and 59(a). RCFC 54(b) specifies that a non-final order \u201cmay be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties\u2019 rights and liabilities.\u201d Even though these eases have been finally adjudicated, the protective order has a continuing effect and constrains the parties\u2019 public disclosure of certain factual aspects of the litigation. The protective order consequently is subject to reconsideration on grounds applicable to interlocutory orders. <em>Cf. L-3 Commc\u2019ns Integrated Sys., L.P. v. United States, </em>98 Fed.Cl. 45, 48 (2011) (addressing a motion for reconsideration of a prior order for supplementation of an administrative record in a bid protest). Substantively, RCFC 59(a)(1) provides that a court may grant a motion for reconsideration for, among other things, \u201cany reason for which a rehearing has heretofore been granted in a suit in equity in federal court.\u201d RCFC 59(a)(1)(B). In general, \u201c[t]he decision whether to grant recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>sideration lies largely within the discretion of the [trial] court.\u201d <em>Yuba Natural Res., Inc. v. United States, </em>904 F.2d 1577, 1583 (Fed.Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">A. <em>Timeliness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The government brings its motions pursuant to Federal Circuit Rule 11(d). <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. to Unseal at 1; Def.\u2019s Further Mot. at 1. Sikorsky objects that the government\u2019s motion to unseal the trial record is untimely under that Rule. PL\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 3. Federal Circuit Rule 11(d) requires parties to seek unsealing of any non-eonfidential material in the trial record and to certify compliance with the Rule \u201cwithin 45 days of docketing\u201d of the appeal. The government\u2019s appeal was docketed on May 24, 2013, and the parties consequently were obliged to complete their responsibilities under Federal Circuit Rule 11(d) and certify compliance by July 2, 2013. The parties undertook to adhere to this schedule by conferring and then filing their Joint Motion to Unseal Portions of the Trial Transcript on June 26, 2013, which motion was granted by this court on the same day. Then, 27 days later, the government sought to obviate that effort by filing the pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">A protective order ordinarily is subject to modification at any time it remains in effect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a case progresses, even on appeal, circumstances may change such that a previously entered protective order is no longer fully appropriate and modification is warranted. In this instance, however, no showing of such changed circumstances has been made, or even attempted. Nothing has happened to affect Sikorsky\u2019s posture regarding its cost data since the parties completed their obligations under Federal Circuit Rule 11(d) and filed their Joint Motion to Unseal Portions of the Tidal Transcript. The time has run under Federal Circuit Rule 11(d) for action to settle the appellate record, and the government has made no showing of any need to reopen the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">B. <em>\u201cTrade Secret or Other Confidential Research, Development, or Commercial Information\u201d Under RCFC 26(c)(1)(G)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">To support and justify the protective order, the government contends that Sikorsky \u201cmust demonstrate a trade secret qualifying for the limited protection available under RCFC 26(c)(1)(G).\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. to Unseal at 2 (citing <em>In re: Violation of Rule 28(d), </em>635 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed.Cir.2011)). The protection available under the rule is not so narrow, however. Instead, the court must also consider \u201cconfidential ... commercial information,\u201d and in that context, the court evaluates the competitive harm that may accrue through disclosure. <em>See, e.g., Violation of Rule 28(d), </em>635 F.3d at 1357; <em>Miles v. Boeing Co., </em>154 F.R.D. 112, 114-15 (E.D.Pa.1994) (issuing a protective order to shield labor costs from disclosure because \u201c[s]ueh information reflects upon Boeing\u2019s price competitiveness in its market. If the information sought was made available to the general public, it would directly reflect Boeing\u2019s labor costs allowing competitors to examine Boeing\u2019s production abilities.\u201d). That balancing process is an everyday, quotidian task for this court, particularly in acting on requests for protective orders in bid protests where competitive considerations are directly at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">In this instance, <em>all </em>of Sikorsky\u2019s cost information over recent years was pertinent to the issues raised by the government\u2019s claim under the Cost Accounting Standards. Because allocation of indirect costs was the focus of the government\u2019s claim, the evidence at trial covered direct materiel and labor costs as well as indirect costs for military and commercial applications. <em>See Sikorsky, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 223-30. In addition, in its manufacturing operations during the relevant time, Sikorsky had \u201cshift[ed] from making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>most parts in-house to buying a portion of finished components from suppliers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227. The cost data were accordingly very revealing about the consequent increase in Sikorsky\u2019s direct materiel costs and the accompanying decrease or relative stability in its labor costs and indirect costs. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Despite this explicit and extensive record, with the attendant strong showing of the competitive sensitivity of the cost data, the government asserts that Sikorsky provided only a \u201cconelusory allegation\u201d that the cost data were confidential under a competitiveness standard. Def.\u2019s Mot. to Unseal at 3. The assertion has no basis. The protective order entered in this case was narrowly drawn to shield from disclosure cost-of-production data that would cause substantial competitive harm if made publicly available. Numerous other decisions have reached the same result in comparable circumstances. <em>See United Techs. Corp. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>601 F.3d 557, 564 (D.C.Cir.2010) (holding that release of \u201cproprietary information regarding Sikorsky\u2019s manufacturing process and procedures\u201d would \u201csubstantially harm Sikorsky\u2019s competitive position because its competitors would use this information to their advantage in ... adjusting their manufacturing techniques\u201d); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>375 F.3d 1182, 1190-92 (D.C.Cir.2004) (holding that disclosure of a defense contractor\u2019s costs could likely cause competitive harm and thus that those costs were exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act); <em>Hitkansut LLC v. United States, </em>111 Fed.Cl. 228, 237 (2013) (holding that \u201ccompetitive information\u201d including \u201cmanufacturing costs\u201d was protected from disclosure under the Federal Technology Transfer Act); <em>General Elec. Co. v. Department of the Air Force, </em>648 F.Supp.2d 95, 102-04 (D.D.C.2009) (holding that protection of unit prices in engine parts contracts was proper due to likely competitive harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In sum, the government\u2019s motions have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The government\u2019s Motion to Unseal the Trial Record, or, in the Alternative, to Redact Sealed Documents in the Trial Record is DENIED, as is the government\u2019s Sealed Motion to Seal Page 172 of the Trial Transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">It is so ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\">.
