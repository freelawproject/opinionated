He further testified that he paid a man from whom he got said whisky the same amount of money which he collected from the prosecuting witness therefor. Upon the trial the charge of the court below was excepted to for its failure to submit to the jury the issue as to the sale of the liquor in question being for medicinal purposes. The attention of the learned trial court being called to this matter by the exception mentioned, it was his duty to submit the issue to the jury, instructing them that if they believed that the sale was made for medicinal purposes and not for profit or otherwise, they should acquit.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">For the failure of the court below to so instruct the jury, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
