H. Stamps. Acting under a purported search warrant, officers searched appellant\u2019s private dwelling and found therein a quantity of groceries, which the injured party identified as having come from his burglarized store. Appellant did not testify. The testimony of his wife in his behalf raised the issue of alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">The affidavit for the search warrant was based upon information and belief. The facts and circumstances upon which the belief was founded not set forth in the affidavit. Hence the search warrant was invalid, and under the provisions of Art. 727-a, C. C. P., in receiving the evidence of the result of search over proper objection on the part of appellant, the learned trial judge fell into error. Boose v. State, 2 S. W.
