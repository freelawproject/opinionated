Appellant entered into a recognizance on the 22nd day of August, 1928. It is thus seen that the recognizance on appeal was entered into before notice of appeal was given. An appeal is taken by giving notice in open court at the term at which the conviction is had and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>having said notice entered of record. Article 827 C. C. P. Among other things, Article 830 C. C. P. provides that \u201cwhen the defendant appeals in any misdemeanor case to the Court of Criminal Appeals, he shall, if he be in custody, be committed to jail unless he enter into a recognizance as provided by law.\u201d Until an appeal has been taken the trial court is not authorized to permit the accused to enter into recognizance on appeal. It follows that the recognizance appearing in the record is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">It is noted that the caption fails to show the date, upon which court convened. We call attention to this in view of the fact that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The appeal is dismissed. Appellant is granted 15 days from this date in which to perfect his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">ON MOTION TO RE-INSTATE APPEAL.</p>\n<author id=\"b130-10\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AGc\">\u2014 The record having been perfected, the judgment of dismissal is set aside, the appeal is reinstated and the case considered on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">It was charged in the complaint and information that appellant who was then and there a person of robust health and strength made an aggravated assault upon E. C. Greer who was then and there an aged person. In meeting the allegation that the injured party was an aged person the State contented itself with showing that he was 66 years old, five feet and eight inches tall and that he weighed 124 pounds. The only evidence in addition to that just mentioned relative to the injured party being aged was brought on cross-examination by appellant. In response to questions by appellant the injured party testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">\u201cI am in good health. I am not sick. I don\u2019t farm any. I can\u2019t do what I used to. Now I have somebody else do the farming. I can\u2019t do any hard work. I am healthy. I have had a couple of operations. I am about to have another performed. However, these do not disqualify me from light work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">The meaning of the term \u201caged\u201d is quite indefinite. With few exceptions, so far as its judicial interpretation has come to our attention, it grew out of some property right determined in a civil proceeding. \u2022 The only criminal statute that has come to our notice is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Art. 1147, P. C., declaring an assault aggravated \u201cwhen committed by a person in robust health upon one who is <em>aged </em>or decrepit.\u201d The few prosecutions under the statute where the State relied upon the averment that the person was an \u201caged person\u201d alone have failed for want of proof of that averment. See Black v. State, 67 S. W. 113; Hall v. State, 16 Tex. Crim. App. 6; Little v. State, 135 S. W. 119. In Black\u2019s case, supra, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u201cWe understand the word \u2018aged\u2019 as used in said statute means that the party has reached that degree of weakness which characterizes declining years. One might be quite old, and yet not aged, within the meaning of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Art. 6, P. C., 1925, declares inoperative a penal statute which is so indefinitely framed or of such doubtful construction that it cannot be understood, either from the language in which it is expressed or from some other written law of the State. Art. 8, P. C., declares that words are to be taken arid construed in the sense in which they are understood in common language, taking into consideration the context and subject matter relative to which they are employed. To illustrate the variety of opinions and circumstances which bring one within the term \u201caged\u201d considered in its legal sense, reference is made to the notes in Corpus Juris, Vol. 2, p. 402. The statutes having fixed no measure by which to determine the meaning of the term in the connection used and the decisions declaring that the application does not depend upon years but upon the degree of weakness which accompanies declining years, the opinion is expressed that the use of the word \u201caged\u201d in the statute is not sufficient to comply with the legal requirement that an offense be definitely defined before a conviction under it can be sustained. Reference is made to the following analogous cases: Ex parte Slaughter, 92 Tex. Crim. Rep. 212; Griffin v. State, 86 Tex. Crim. Rep. 498; M. K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. of Texas v. State, 100 Tex. Rep. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b131-10\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ATM\">\u2014 The State has filed a persuasive motion for rehearing in which it is suggested that there would be no impropriety in the court amplifying the meaning of \u201caged\u201d which is suggested in Black v. State, 67 Tex. Cr. R. 113, as being one who \u201chas reached that degree of weakness which characterizes declining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>years,\u201d by adding <em>\"to such an extent as to render such person comparatively helpless in a personal conflict with a person of robust health or strength.\u201d </em>There is found in Art. 1147, P. C. in conjunction with \u201caged\u201d the word \u201cdecrepit\u201d the accepted definition of which as applied to that statute appears to be \u201cone who is disabled, incapable or incompetent from either physical or mental weakness or defects, <em>whether produced by age </em>or other causes, to such an extent as to render the individual comparatively helpless in a personal conflict with one possessed of ordinary health and strength.\u201d Hall v. State, 16 Tex. Cr. App. 6; Little v. State, 135 S. W. 119. If the State\u2019s suggestion could be adopted with propriety we see no good to be accomplished thereby for there would be no practical difference then between the meaning of the terms \u201caged\u201d and \u201cdecrepit.\u201d There does not appear to be the same indefiniteness attached to the meaning of the term \u201cdecrepit\u201d as is found with the term \u201caged\u201d and we doubt the propriety of adopting the State\u2019s suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The state\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
