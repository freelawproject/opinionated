Being refused bail, he sued out a writ of habeas corpus before the District Court of Angelina County, and said Court, after hearing evidence, remanded relator without bail, from which judgment he appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">Without analyzing the testimony, suffice it to say that the State\u2019s evidence on the hearing made out a case which fully supported the action of the trial court in refusing bail. Appellant introduced his father and sister who testified to circumstances raising the issue of self-defense. His father was impeached by proof of contradictory statements to the Justice of the Peace. All the testimony for appellant comes from interested parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">It has been said:</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">\u201cBecause there may be evidence in the record of mitigating circumstances, or raising the issue of self-defense, or of an accidental killing does not in every case require overturning of the decision of a trial judge denying bail.
