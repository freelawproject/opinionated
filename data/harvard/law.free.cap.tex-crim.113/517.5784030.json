For collation of authorities and for the forms of indictments, reference is made to Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., secs. 2322, 2323, 2324, and 2329. Among the cases collated are State v. Williams, 41 Tex. Rep. 101; White v. State, 1 Tex. Cr. App. 211, and numerous others. The essential element of the crime of theft, as defined by statute, is the <em>\u201cfraudulent\u201d </em>taking of corporeal personal property. See P. C, 1925, Art. 1410. The element mentioned, namely, fraudulent taking, has been declared indispensable. See Prim v. State, 32 Tex. Rep. 157; and other cases collated in Vernon\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., Vol. 3, p. 129, note 14. That announcement is reaffirmed in the case of Phillips v. State, 231 S. W. 400. See also the case of Watt v. State, 136 S. W. 56, and collation of cases in Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., sec. 2426.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">The judgment is reversed and the cause dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">Hawkins, J., absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
