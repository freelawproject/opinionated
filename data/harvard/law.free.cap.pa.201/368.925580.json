That Albert Pitcairn, one of the defendants, had become a lunatic, and that.the inquest had found that at the date of the taking of the inquisition, April 19, 1901, he was a lunatic, and had been for upwards of four years preceding that date a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>lunatic, without lucid intervals; that the inquisition has been confirmed nisi, and that Ross Y. Pitcairn, a brother, had been appointed his committee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\">2. That the mother of the lunatic had died many years ago, but that his father, Robert Pitcairn, his brothers, Dr. Ross V. Pitcairn, Robert L. Pitcairn and Thomas Pitcairn, his sister, Annie E. Gamber, and his nephews and nieces, Alfred B. Pitcairn, Clara Pitcairn, Luella Pitcairn and Bertha Pitcairn, all of whom are of full age (children of a deceased brother, W. W. Pitcairn), were his next of kin, all of them being defendants in said bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">3. That the inquisition found complainant to be the wife of Albert Pitcairn, and that in fact she was lawfully married to him on August 29, 1897, at New Paris, Bedford county, Pennsylvania, by the Rev. J. W. Richards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-7\">4. That it was untrue that Albert Pitcairn became a lunatic four years prior to the taking of said inquisition, and that as a matter of fact he was in the full possession of his faculties up until not over eighteen months prior to the taking of the said inquisition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-8\">5. That the complainant had filed a traverse of the inquisition, because she was aggrieved in this, that although the inquisition found her to be the wife of the said Albert Pitcairn, it also found that prior to the date of her said marriage he was a lunatic without lucid intervals; and that said lunacy without lucid intervals continued up until the date of the taking of the said inquisition; and averred that she was advised and believed that she could not have a sufficient or adequate remedy by the trial of the said traverse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-9\">6. That after Dr. Ross Y. Pitcairn had been appointed committee. of the person and estate of the said Albert Pitcairn, complainant applied to the court of common pleas for an allowance out of his estate, as his wife; and that said application was met by an answer on the part of the committee, averring that Albert Pitcairn, at the date of the marriage, was, by reason of insanity, incapable of contracting marriage, and that complainant had enticed the said Albert Pitcairn, so being of unsound mind, to New Paris, Bedford county, Pennsylvania, where she had the said Albert Pitcairn make an affidavit, on which she procured a license from the orphans\u2019 court of Bod-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ford county, on August 26, 1897, and on August 29, 1897, procured one J. W. Richards, clergyman, to perform a marriage ceremony between her and said Albert Pitcairn, and further averring that your petitioner was not the lawful wife of the said Albert Pitcairn; all of which allegations, so far as they averred the lunacy of the said Albert Pitcairn at the time of said marriage or any fraud or improper conduct on her part, were denied. And she averred, that although a temporary allowance had been made by said court, her marriage was involved in doubt by reason of the aforesaid answer of said committee, and averred that she was deprived, and likely to be deprived of her marital rights, unless the validity of her marriage could be legally determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-5\">7. That under the laws of Pennsylvania there is no statute by which any provision is made for an adjudication as to a supposed or alleged marriage, where either or both of the parties to such marriage is or was, or is or was claimed to be a lunatic at the time of marriage, incapable, of entering into the contract of marriage ; and that she was advised and believed she had a right in equity to have the question of the validity or nonvalidity of her marriage determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-6\">The bill prayed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-7\">1. For an issue to be framed between the parties to the bill for the information of the conscience of the court, to determine whether or not the marriage between complainant and said Albert Pitcairn was a valid or lawful marriage, or whether the same was invalid by reason of the alleged lunacy of Albert Pitcairn at the date of the marriage, or to determine such question by such proceeding according to the forms of equity, as the court should deem best.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-8\">2. To adjudge that the complainant was lawfully married to said Albert Pitcairn at the date of said marriage, and that said Albert Pitcairn at the date of said marriage was mentally competent to enter into the contract of marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-9\">The defendants demurred to the whole bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-10\">The court entered a decree dismissing the bill.

It appears from the allegations of the bill, that plaintiff and Albert Pitcairn were married on August 29, 1897; that on the 19th day of April, 1901, under proceedings in lunacy, the said Albert Pitcairn was found to be a lunatic, and that he had been without lucid intervals for upwards of four years prior thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The plaintiff filed a traverse to this finding of the commission, which is still pending. Being advised and believing that she could not have a sufficient or adequate remedy by the trial of the said traverse, plaintiff filed this bill in equity, praying to have the question of the validity or nonvalidity of her marriage determined. The defendants demurred to the bill, and denied the jurisdiction of the court in the premises, and its power to grant the relief prayed for. The court sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill, basing its action upon the want of power in a court of equity to declare the marriage valid; it was also of the opinion that the plaintiff had a full and adequate remedy at law in the trial of the traverse. The plaintiff appealed from this action of the court, and has assigned for error the entry of the decree sustaining the demurrer, and the dismissal of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Much of the argument of appellant\u2019s counsel in support of the right to maintain the bill, would be to the. point, if the courts of equity of Pennsylvania were possessed of general equity jurisdiction. But this is not the case. The courts of equity of Pennsylvania do not possess the general powers of a court of equity, but only such as have been conferred upen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>them by statute. This has been repeatedly pointed out. In Davis v. Gerhard, 5 Wharton, 466, it was held that the powers of the courts of Pennsylvania in matters of chancery jurisdiction are limited to the cases which have been or may be specified by the legislature. And in Gilder v. Merwin, 6 Wharton, 540, atteutiozi is called to the fact that the. legislature has conferred upon the courts, not a universal or even a general equity jurisdiction, but only a limited and selected portion of equity power deemed to be suited to present exigencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Again in Dohnert\u2019s Appeal, 64 Pa. 311, Justice Shabswood says, \u201c The jurisdiction of this court to exercise the powers of a court of chancery depends upon statutory enactments. ... We must resort then to the acts of assembly for our warrant in any case of this description.\u201d This was followed in Bridesburgh Mfg. Co.\u2019s Appeal, 106 Pa. 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">As was tersely said by Stowe, P. J., in Bakewell v. Keller, 11 W. N. C. 300, \u201c In England and in the United States where there is general equity jurisdiction a bill may be sustained under the general chancery powers of the court; but in Pennsylvania we have no equitable jurisdiction except where it is specifically granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In Howard v. Lewis, 6 Phila. 50, Allison, J., said: \u201c In Pennsylvania the jurisdiction of the courts of common pleas upon the subject of divorce, and in relation to the power to declare a marriage null and void, is purely statutory, both as to the form and the substance of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Jurisdiction to declare a marriage void on account of the lunacy of one of the contracting parties, has never been conferred upon the courts of Pennsylvania, and consequently those courts have no such jurisdiction. The learned court below was, therefore, right in dismissing the bill for want of statutory jurisdiction. As to the adequacy of the remedy by means of the traverse of the inquisition, we do not decide. That question is not necessarily involved in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the cost of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
