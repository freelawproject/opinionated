There is no evidence that the assets were valued at the death of the decedent, and nothing to explain this extraordinary rise or to show that it had not taken place in his lifetime. The presumption in favor of continuance is that the value was the same in September, 1891, as in September, 1892, and the burden of proving the contrary, by clear and specific evidence, is upon the party alleging the contrary. The error, as we think, lies in the assumption or inference that because the original valuation was carried on the books of the company and, necessarily, therefore, so set forth in the balance sheet of September, 1891, it was to be accepted as the actual value in the determination of questions with regard to principal and income as between tenants for life and those ultimately entitled to the principal of, the estate of a stockholder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-5\">There was no declaration of a dividend by the New Jersey company, nor was there any sale or transfer of its assets during the time that the decedent\u2019s estate was the owner of shares of its stock. A company organized under the laws of New York offered to stockholders of the New J ersey company, individually, to purchase their stock by giving in exchange twelve shares of the purchasing company\u2019s stock for ten of the New J ersey company, with the privilege, additionally, of subscribing for ten per cent at par, payable in instalments; and at a later date, the New York company, having thus acquired the control of the stock of the New Jersey company, voted for its dissolution and a transfer of its assets,\u2014but this was not until a year after the sale or exchange of its stock by tbe decedent\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-6\">But whether the value of the stock thus received in exchange was, either intrinsically or at the brokers\u2019 board, greater than that of the original stock, is not material. The will of the testator expressly declares that the executors shall at all times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>have the right to \u201c sell and dispose of \u201d all or any part of his residuary estate, real or personal, \u201cand to invest the proceeds thereof,\u201d without liability for loss \u201c or the character of the investments made .... the investments and reinvestments .... to be in all respects subject to the provisions of \u201d the will\u2014that is to say, in trust, after payment of certain annuities, to pay the \u201c income \u201d to the wife and children of the testator in the proportions there specified. In such case, as held in Connolly\u2019s Estate, 198 Pa. 137,141,142, and in Graham\u2019s Estate, 198 Pa. 216, where the subject is exhaustively discussed by Judge Over, whose very able opinions were adopted by the Supreme Court, the profit on sale of securities \u201c is part of the principal of the estate, and as such to be held by the trustees.\u201d That the exchange in this case was one which inured greatly to the advantage of the cestuis que trust for life, no less than of those entitled to the principal, appears from the fact stated by the master that the former received as accumulated profits for five years on the 6,000 shares of the New York Company transferred to the Metropolitan Street Railway Company, in August, 1897, debenture bonds to the value of \u00a7120,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-5\">We concur, however, in the opinion of the master that the gain on sale of the stock acquired under the option to subscribe for stock of the New York Company, viz: \u00a79,437.50, is to be regarded as income, and as such to be awarded: Eisner\u2019s Estate, 175 Pa. 148; Wright\u2019s Estate, 9 Pa.
