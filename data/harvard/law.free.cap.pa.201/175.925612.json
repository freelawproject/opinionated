A large covered wagon was standing in the street between the near track and the curb, and cut off her view along the near track in the direction from which the cars came. The distance from the near track to the curb was seven feet and six inches. After the car on the far track had passed, plaintiff proceeded to cross the street, looking and listening for a oar. Just as she came to the near track a car came upon her suddenly before she was actually upon the track. She threw up her arms against the side of the car, and was in some manner thrown under it, so that the back wheels passed over her legs. The evidence as to the speed of the car and whether a signal was given was conflicting. The court was equally divided whether or not there should have been a binding direction for defendant.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b203-8\">Argued Oct. 31,1901.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ANn\">Appeals, Nos. 82 and 83, by defendant, from judgment of O.

I stopped until it left off its passengers and went on. Then I went to start to go across the street, and I looked towards town, and then I looked towards Wilkinsburg, but I could n\u2019t see for a wagon, so I listened and I thought there was nothing coming, and I started for to cross the street, and when I got within a step or so of the track, why, the car came and I had no chance to turn or nothing, and I just threw up my hands.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">\u201c Q.

And after that started, you say you then moved forward? A. Yes, sir. Q. And did you stop again ? A. No, sir.

How far was that car from you when you first saw it? A. I could n\u2019t say that. Q. Was it right on you ? A. It was right on me, yes. It was that near to me that I had n\u2019t a chance to get out of its way. Q. As you walked forward, did you look towards Wilkinsburg in your effort to see a car? A. Yes, sir; I did. Q.

No; she had just took this step or two and stopped.and looked and turned her head towards Wilkinsburg to see\u2014from the way she acted, I suppose she could n\u2019t see, and just took another step as the ear came on. Q. So far as your idea goes, she never got on to the track, and did not get in front of the car ? A. She did n\u2019t step right on the track, no. Q.
