Volkmann owned three cars and all were insured by Grange on separate policies, each containing uninsured motorists coverage. Volkmann\u2019s daughters (defendants herein), Donna Miller and Marsha Brett, sustained severe bodily injuries while occupying one of their father\u2019s cars. These injuries allegedly were caused by an uninsured motorist. Each policy also provided for medical payment coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">As . named insureds, the defendants filed' a demand for arbitration under all three policies. Grange then commenced this declaratory judgment action. Grange admits coverage under the policy covering the car that the injured defendants were occupying. However, Grange contends that the \u201cother owned car\u201d exclusion in the policies prevents the defendants from inter-policy \u201cstacking\u201d of coverages, either for damages or for bodily injury medical payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Part IV of the policy, pertaining to uninsured motorist coverage, contains the following exclusion and does not apply: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">\u201c(a) to bodily injury to an insured while occupying an automobile (other than an insured automobile) owned by the named Insured or a relative, or through being struck by such an automobile; <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Under the policy, an \u201cinsured automobile\u201d is- the automobile described in the policy for which a specific premium is charged and includes a temporary, substitute, replacement or non-owned automobile being operated by a named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Part.II, medical payments coverage, provides for coverage for .the named insured and each relative while occupying the owned automobile or a non-owned vehicle with consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u201cOwned automobile\u201d is defined \u201cas one \u2022 described in' the policy and for which a specific premium .is charged.\u201d A \u201cnon-owned\u201d vehicle means \u201can automobile * * *\u25a0 not owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative, ***.\u201d' \u25a0 , .\u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">The policy also contains standard \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in Part II, medical payments coverage, and in Part IV applicable to uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">Defendants urge as a single assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxR\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to hold that where separate policies of insurance are held by an insured on separate vehicles, and separate premiums are paid therefor \u2018stacking\u2019 of uninsured motorist and medical payment coverage is permissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">We discuss the issues separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\n<em>Stacking of \u201cUninsured Motorist Coverages\u201d \u25a0</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1969), 17 Ohio St. 2d 73, our Supreme Court held, in paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">\u201cIn the absence of specific language of limitation in an automobile insurance policy or in an uninsured motorist endorsement thereto, providing that the benefits of such endorsement shall not be received by a named insured if using another vehicle owned by him, coverage thereunder is not excluded merely because at the time of injury the named insured was using a second motor vehicle, owned by him, which was included as an insured automobile under other provisions of the automobile insurance policy but was not included under the endorsement, and for which no extra premium had been paid for uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZX\">The court further said that neither the endorsement nor the basic language in Wright\u2019s policy purported to. limit the coverage to cases where the \u201cnamed-insured\u201d is using or' occupying an \u201cinsured automobile\u201d at the time of the injury. In this situation, Wright was insured under one policy for liability on an Oldsmobile ear and a Ford truck. A separate premium was charged for each, but only the Oldsmobile had \u00e1 premium for uninsured motorists coverage. While loading the Ford truck, Wright was injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>by an uninsured motorist. The court held he was covered since there was no specific language in the 'policy to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\">Our Supreme Court permitted the stacking of two separate uninsured motorist coverages in <em>Curran </em>v. <em>State Automobile Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St. 2d 33. The court held that standard \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses were repugnant to the legislative intent expressed in R. C. 3937.18 of protecting persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">On'the other hand, in <em>Weemhoff </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 231, the Supreme Court prohibited the \u201cintra-policy\u201d stacking of two coverages where a single policy covered two automobles and charged a separate specific premium for each automobile. That policy also had an \u201cother owned car\u201d exclusion similar to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In summary, the Supreme Court held in <em>Wright, supra, </em>that in the absence of specific language in a policy, if two vehicles are covered for liability, only one need be covered for uninsured motorists as the one coverage will cover both vehicles. Then, in <em>Curran, supra, </em>the court struck down a standard \u201cother insurance clause as being repugnant to R. C. 3937.18. The court there permitted the insured to stack the uninsured motorist coverage on a friend\u2019s car that the insured was occupying with the coverage the insured had purchased on his own automobile in order to\u25a0 cover the aggregate damages. In <em>Weemhoff, supra, </em>the court limited the amount of uninsured motorist coverage to the policy limits under the declarations regardless of the number of vehicles which were named in the policy and premiums paid for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">A reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Weem-hoff, s\u00e9pra, </em>suggests that the \u201cother owned car\u201d exclusion in the uninsured motorist coverage would have precluded their recovery had they not paid the separate individual premiums for uninsured motorists coverage on the automobile in which they were riding. This, then, must be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u201ctype of specific language\u201d which the court said would have prevented the coverage in <em>Wright, supra. </em>In <em>Weem-hoff, supra, </em>the court went on to say that the separate premiums on each vehicle were consideration for the additional coverage received by the insured. However, the footnote to that sentence refers to <em>Curran, supra, </em>and says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-3\">\u201cWe do not, however, consider the individual premiums as creating two separate policies which would allow appellants to stack coverages. <em>* * *\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The syllabus in <em>Weemhoff, supra, </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">\u201cWhere the terms of an insurance policy afford uninsured motorist coverage for two automobiles, and limit the insurer\u2019s liability to a certain sum \u2018per person\u2019 on each automobile, such limit on each vehicle cannot be added together to provide coverage in excess of that stated in the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Combining that syllabus and the footnote, we would say that, when an insured purchases uninsured motorist coverage under one policy, the insured\u2019s recovery is limited to the declarations of limits stated in the coverage regardless of the number of vehicles insured under the policy. Thus, <em>Weemhoff, supra, </em>does not, <em>per se, </em>prohibit inter-policy stacking; it only prohibits intra-policy stacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Therefore, the issue before us is whether the \u201cother owned car\u201d exclusion is repugnant to the public policy stated in R. C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">In <em>Grange Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>unreported, Tenth Appellate District, No. 74 AP 335, decided December 31, 1974, the court held that an insured could stack two uninsured motorists coverages from separate policies where the insured paid separate premiums. That court based its decision on <em>Curran, supra, </em>and held that the \u201cother owned car\u201d exclusion is repugnant to R. C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the recent case of <em>Ray </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. </em>(C. A. 6, 1974), 498 F. 2d 220, reviewed Ohio case law on \u201cstacking\u201d in a fact situation very similar to our case. That court held that \u201cinter-policy\u201d stacking is excluded by the \u201cother owned car\u201d exclusionary clause in the insurance contract. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Sixth Circuit was fearful of stacking because it theorized that an insured who owned a fleet of cars could cause an insurer of one of those cars to bear increased risk created by multiple vehicle ownership without increasing premiums. The court said each vehicle created a separate risk. But the court would, not venture an opinion on whether stacking would be permissible if the insured were occupying a third party\u2019s automobile or if he were a pedestrian, on horseback, or whatever. We are prompted to ask that if it is proper under <em>Curran, supra, </em>to stack a third person\u2019s coverage with the insured\u2019s own, why cannot the insured stack two he has purchased?</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">We also must disagree with that fleet theory of increased risk. The increased risk to the insurer would only come from the number of those who would be classified as insured. It cannot come from the number of vehicles owned by the insured. There are only 168 hours in a week and one insured can only be in one place at one time and can only operate or occupy one vehicle at a time. Unless the additional vehicles are being operated by other insureds, the insurer\u2019s risk has not been increased one iota on one insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The purpose of R. C. 3937.18 is to assure that persons who become insureds under an auto liability policy are protected against an uninsured motorist. That is the risk that the carrier insures against. How then can we have a uniform application of that statute if the carriers are permitted to contractually limit that risk to certain situations? Each carrier could then have its own set of definitions as to when the insured had \u201cuninsured motorists\u201d protection. Such limitations are contrary to public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The \u201cother owned car\u201d exclusions in the policies here attempt to limit the extent of the coverage afforded the insured by not covering him when he is occupying \u201canother owned vehicle.\u201d Such a provision is repugnant t\u00f3 the intent and spirit of R. C. 3937.18..</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">. We hold that when an insured pays a single premium of uninsured motorist insurance he has purchased a policy of \u201climited personal accident insurance\u201d as it is so aptly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>described by Judge McMonagle in <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bittler </em>(1968), 14 Ohio Misc. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">When an insured pays a separate premium under a separate policy, he has additional insurance to the limits of that policy. These policies may be stacked to compensate him to the extent of his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\n<em>Stacking of Medical Payments Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">For the same reason that we sustain the first assignment of error, we overrule the second regarding the stacking of medical payment coverages. But for R. C. 3937.18, the parties could contract for exclusions provided above and limit the coverage afforded. It is the stated public policy in R. C. 3937.18 which prohibits such contracting. Here the \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions limit the insureds to a singular medical payments coverage. This is not repugnant to public policy. Consequently, it is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">We hold that the plaintiffs can stack all uninsured motorist coverages for which they have paid a separate premium in a separate policy of insurance. We further hold that they cannot \u201cstack\u201d the medical payments coverage. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter a final judgment for the defendants and establish their respective rights under the policies as set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b183-9\">Victor, P.
