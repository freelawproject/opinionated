C. 4507.40 (K), for having accumulated in excess of twelve traffic violation points within a period of two years as a juvenile driver. &lt; The trial court granted the petition, holding that \u201cafter a study of R. C. 2151.358 <em>* * * </em>no findings of a juvenile court are admissible or applicable to proceedings in Clermont County Court after plaintiff has reached majority,\u201d and restored the appel-lee\u2019s driving rights. The defendant timely filed this appeal, asserting in his single assignment of error that the trial court\u2019s judgment is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">We have examined the record and the pertinent statutory authority, and find the assignment of' error to be well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>taken. Thus, B. C. 2151.358, upon which the trial court relied, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\">\u201cThe judgment rendered by the court under this chapter shall not impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by conviction of a crime in that the child is not a criminal by reason of such adjudication, nor shall any child be charged or convicted of a crime in any court except as provided by this chapter. The disposition of a child under the judgment rendered or any evidence given in court is not admissible as evidence against the child in any other case or proceeding in any other court, except that the judgment rendered and the disposition of sueh child may be considered by any court as to the matter of sentence or to the granting of probation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We note first that, in the instant license revocation proceedings, evidence of prior juvenile court <em>disposi'ions </em>of the appellee \u2014 which, according to R. C. 2151.356, refer to the <em>sentences </em>imposed for the traffic offenses of which the appellee had been convicted \u2014 and evidence admitted against the appellee in the earlier juvenile court proceedings, are irrelevant to the trial court\u2019s determination of whether such revocation had properly issued against the appellee. Rather, proof of the mere fact of the appellee\u2019s accumulated traffic convictions themselves, and the corresponding total of violation points to be attributed thereto \u2014 without reference to the seni enees imposed for such convictions or to the evidence adduced in support thereof \u2014 is all that is required to justify the revocation of the appellee's driving privileges pursuant to R. C. 4507.40 <em>(K). Such </em>proof of the <em>fact </em>of the appellee\u2019s earlier juvenile convictions in the instant case is not, in our opinion, proscribed by the language of R. C. 2151.358, which declares only that \u201c [t]he disposition of a child under the judgment rendered or <em>any evidence given in court </em>is not admissible as evidence against the child in any other case or proceeding in any other court * * and we therefore disagree with the trial court that such proof is \u201cinadmissible and inapplicable\u201d to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Moreover, if it is argued that the revocation of the ap-pellee\u2019s driving privileges is foreclosed by that portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>R. C. 2151.358 providing that a juvenile court conviction, \u201cshall not impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by conviction of a crime,\u201d we find such language to be equally inapplicable to the instant proceedings. The \u201ccivil disabilities\u201d of which a juvenile is relieved pursuant to R. C 2151.358 refer, we believe, to those disabilities imposed under R. O. 2961.01 and 2961.03, and do not extend to relieve the juvenile of those adverse consequences attending his frequent violation of traffic laws pursuant to R. C. 4507.40. Our conclusion is supported by our reading of the latter statute, which provides that revocation proceedings in which the driver \u201cis under the age of eighteen years [are to be filed with] the juvenile court,\u201d and which therefore indicates a clear legislative intent to impose upon juveniles the same penalities for successive and frequent violations of the traffic laws as are imposed on drivers in Ohio generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">We therefore conclude that the trial court\u2019s action in granting the appellee\u2019s petition, based as it was upon the court\u2019s mistaken belief that R. O. 2151.358 precluded the revocation of the appellee\u2019s driving privileges based upon his earlier juvenile court convictions, was contrary to law. The assignment of error is sustained, the judgment entered below is reversed, and a final judgment is entered in favor of the defendant-appellant pursuant to App. R. 12 (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b214-6\">Palmer, P.
