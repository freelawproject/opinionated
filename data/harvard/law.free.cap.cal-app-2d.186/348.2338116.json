Dyer and Sybil D. Dyer against said defendant driver. Judgment was entered September 21, 1959, and on September 28th, plaintiffs, James and Clara Dyer, filed a notice of intention to move for a new trial. That motion was denied October 28, 1959. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment on October 30th. Plaintiff, Clara Dyer, subsequently dismissed her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-16\">The sole question presented on appeal is whether the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>court erred in refusing to instruct on the doctrine of \u201clast clear chance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In ascertaining whether it was error for the trial court to refuse to give appellant\u2019s instruction on the last clear chance doctrine, this court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellant. <em>(Guyton </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 354, 361 [344 P.2d 910] ; <em>Bonebrake </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>35 Cal.2d 16, 19 [215 P.2d 728].)  There must be <em>substantial evidence </em>present to justify the question of last clear chance going to a jury, and the existence of substantial evidence justifying the application of the doctrine is a question of law. <em>(Doran </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>44 Cal.2d 477 [283 P.2d 1] ; <em>Nippold </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>145 Cal.App.2d 235 [302 P.2d 367].)  In <em>Estate of Teed, </em>112 Cal.App.2d 638, 644 [247 P.2d 54] the court said with reference to substantial evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">\u201cWebster\u2019s International Dictionary defines the word as follows: 1 Consisting of, pertaining to, of the nature of or being, substance, existing as a substance; material. \u2019 Its meaning is further defined as \u2018not seeming or imaginary, not illusive, real, true; important, essential, material, having good <em>substance; </em>strong, stout, solid, firm.\u2019 The word means \u2018considerable in amount, value or the like; firmly established, solidly based.\u2019 Synonyms are \u2018tangible, bodily, corporeal, actual, sturdy, stable. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\"> \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence,\u2019 according to Words and Phrases, Fifth Series, page 564, ... is evidence \u2018which, if true, has probative force on the issues.\u2019 It is more than \u2018a mere scintilla, \u2019 and the term means \u2018 such relevant evidence as a reasonable man might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. \u2019 . . . <em>\u2018improbable conclusions </em>drawn in favor of a party litigant through the sanction of a jury\u2019s verdict <em>will not be sustained where testimony is at variance with physical facts and repugnance is material and self-evident.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">\u201cThe sum total of the above definitions is that, if the word \u2018substantial\u2019 means anything at all, it clearly implies that <em>such evidence must be of ponderable legal significance. </em>Obviously the word cannot be deemed synonymous with <em>\u2018 </em>any \u2019 evidence. <em>It must be reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value; it must actually be \u2018substantial\u2019 proof of the essentials which the law requires in a particular case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">The accident, which is the subject of this appeal, occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>on U. S. Highway 99, at a point where the highway passes the El Rancho Caf\u00e9 and Garage. In this area the highway runs generally north and south. It is a four-lane highway, separated for north and southbound traffic by a divider. Directly opposite, or to the west of the El Rancho Caf\u00e9 and Garage, the divider is broken by a cross-over, approximately 50 feet in length. At this point the slightly raised divider is approximately 27 feet wide. The collision occurred in the northbound lanes of traffic in or near the cross-over. At this point there are two lanes for northbound traffic, each of which is approximately 12 feet wide and there is a 6 to 8-foot shoulder, asphalt in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">At the time of the collision, appellant\u2019s car was headed in a generally westerly direction crossing Highway 99 and respondent\u2019s car was headed in a northerly direction on the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">According to appellant\u2019s testimony, after leaving a restaurant and filling station area, he drove in a westerly direction and stopped 2 or 3 feet from the edge of the travelled portion of the highway. Thus stopped, nothing obstructed his view of the highway to the north or to the south.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The highway to the south of the El Rancho Caf\u00e9 curves to the left, or east. When appellant\u2019s car was stopped, he could see approximately 800 feet to the south and he did not observe any cars approaching from the south going north.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Appellant further testified that after waiting for several southbound ears to pass, and then again looking south and seeing no approaching traffic, he started across the highway and \u201c. . . the next thing I knew, why, I felt this jolt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">When the collision occurred the front wheels of appellant\u2019s car were in the gravel cross-over part of the divider. He stated that from the time his automobile left the position approximately 2 to 3 feet east of the travelled portion of the highway, until the point of impact <em>it did not stop </em>and the maximum speed attained was 10 miles per hour. Appellant also stated that he did not remember whether his passengers ever said anything to him about a car approaching from the south (i.e., travelling northbound) or whether they urged him to hurry up. One of appellant\u2019s witnesses, Officer Botsford, testified that appellant\u2019s statement to him was: \u201c\u2018I made stop coming out of station. Saw no one coming. Asked my wife if it was O.K. to go. She said, \u201cHurry.\u201d Started to cross when Vehicle No. 1 (defendant\u2019s vehicle) hit us in left side.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Officer Botsford read into the record a statement of the respondent as follows: \u201cMy notes here indicate driver No. l\u2019s statement: \u2018I was northbound on 99 in lane No. 2 (i.e., lane next to shoulder\u2014lane No. 1 would refer to lane next to divider), travelling at approximately 65 to 70. Vehicle No. 2 (i.e., appellant\u2019s automobile), pulled out of station into lane No. 2 and <em>stopped. </em>I sounded my horn and changed lanes to No. 1 northbound and started to go in front of him. No. 2 then started to move across highway in front of me. I applied my brakes but it was too late and I hit him.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) When the officer arrived at the scene of the accident, he found appellant\u2019s automobile had sustained major damage to the left side and found respondent\u2019s car totally damaged in front. In investigating the accident, he measured 114 feet of two-wheel skid marks (including 75 feet of four-wheel skid marks) from respondent\u2019s vehicle prior to its jumping the north edge of the divider. The witness further testified that he measured the distance between the point of impact and respondent\u2019s vehicle and found it to be 42 feet. From his investigation of all of the evidence at the scene of the accident, he formed an opinion that at the time the respondent applied his brakes, he was travelling at approximately 58 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The next witness called on behalf of appellant was John Harris, an automobile mechanic employed by the El Rancho Garage. The witness observed the collision between the cars driven by appellant and respondent. He stated that as the respondent\u2019s car came around the curve (approximately 700 to 800 feet south of the point of impact) he, the witness, had an opinion that the car was travelling somewhere between 80 and 100 miles per hour. According to Harris\u2019 testimony, at the time he <em>first saw </em>the respondent\u2019s northbound car, appellant\u2019s car was approximately in the <em>middle </em>of the northbound highway and was <em>moving </em>at the rate of \u201cseven, eight, ten miles an hour.\u201d The witness kept respondent\u2019s vehicle under observation until he saw it collide with appellant\u2014\u201c. . . I watched it to see if he was going in front of it or behind it.\u201d The witness heard respondent\u2019s car horn blowing a few seconds after it came around the corner and heard the squeal of brakes. At the point of impact he estimated respondent\u2019s speed to be approximately 60 miles per hour. On cross-examination Harris testified that before the accident he had an unobstructed view to the south; that he observed appellant\u2019s ear pull up to the intersection and stop, at which time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>he had not seen respondent\u2019s ear coming. He then observed appellant\u2019s vehicle start up and keep on moving to the point of impact. On redirect examination he testified that there had been a split second when he could not observe both vehicles and that the appellant\u2019s ear was moving at the time he first saw the respondent\u2019s car; that neither appellant\u2019s nor respondent\u2019s vehicle stopped until the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Respondent testified that when he first observed appellant\u2019s car, the front end of his car was approximately in the center of northbound lane 2 and was stopped. At that time respondent was travelling in northbound lane 2, in the neighborhood of 50 to 55 miles per hour. Immediately upon seeing appellant\u2019s car, respondent removed his foot from the accelerator, changed lanes, applied the brakes gradually and sounded his horn. He sounded the horn from the time he changed lanes until the time he hit appellant\u2019s car. Respondent further testified that by the time all four wheels of his automobile were in northbound lane 1, appellant\u2019s car had not changed position. <em>After </em>respondent\u2019s car was in northbound lane 1, appellant\u2019s car moved forward in a westerly direction (i.e., crossing the northbound lane). At that instant respondent had no definite recollection of what the speed of his car was, but that he had not applied any more gas. When he observed appellant\u2019s ear move forward toward the center strip, he applied his brakes with more force. After the accident, respondent observed skid marks and agreed with Officer Bots-ford\u2019s testimony regarding the measurements.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Respondent\u2019s car struck appellant\u2019s ear approximately at the left front fender. Just before the impact, respondent recalled that his left front wheels scraped or even may have climbed up on the curbing of the divider before entering the cross-over section.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Based upon respondent\u2019s recollection of the relative position of the two cars, when he first observed appellant\u2019s car, he stated that the distance between the two cars at that time was about 175 feet. Subsequently, he revised his estimate to 175 yards (225 paces). On cross-examination he testified that it took him two or three seconds to remove his foot from the accelerator pedal and on to the brake pedal. The reporter\u2019s transcript discloses the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201cQ. A matter of two or three seconds? A. Yes. I mean, I wasn\u2019t in any particular big hurry to apply the brake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">\u201cQ. You saw a car stopped there, I think you told us, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the lane ahead of you down the highway? A. Yes, hut I was a way, way back there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">He then testified that when he first applied the brakes he did not use full force, that his car was gradually slowing down; that the ear was under the braking effect the entire time until he applied full force and the car started to skid; that he was applying the brakes when he changed lanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Mrs. Betty Knue, a witness, called by the respondent largely corroborated the testimony given by her husband. She testified that she was a passenger in respondent\u2019s car in the right front seat; when she first observed appellant\u2019s car it was stopped in the outside lane (i.e., lane toward the shoulder), about halfway to the line that separates lane 1 from lane 2. At this time, respondent\u2019s automobile had about finished the curve to the south of the place where the accident occurred. Prior to the collision she was thrown to the floor of the car. On cross-examination, she testified that the last time she saw appellant\u2019s car it had started with a jerk from a standing position and started off into the lane in front of respondent\u2019s car. She did not recall the squealing of any brakes, but did hear the horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The evidence pertaining to the speed of respondent\u2019s car is conflicting. Appellant, who testified that he never saw respondent\u2019s car, gave no estimate of its speed. Respondent testified that at the time he first saw appellant\u2019s car he was travelling \u201cin the neighborhood of 50, 55 miles an hour.\u201d Officer Botsford testified that defendant\u2019s statement to him was that he was travelling \u201cat approximately 65 to 70.\u201d Officer Botsford\u2019s opinion was that defendant\u2019s vehicle, at the time of applying the brakes, was going approximately 58 miles per hour. Harris testified that respondent came around the curve at between 80 and 100 miles per hour and estimated that at the time of the collision the defendant was going around 60 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">The last clear chance doctrine which relieves a party of the results of his own contributory negligence and permits him to recover despite his own negligence is applicable only in the exceptional ease wherein there is substantial evidence to support a finding on <em>each </em>of the three elements. <em>(Doran </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 477, 486 [283 P.2d 1].)  These three elements, in the language of <em>Brandelius </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>47 Cal.2d 729, 743 [306 P.2d 432], were reiterated by the Supreme Court in the recent case of <em>Hildebrand </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Junc</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>tion Ry. Co., </em>53 Cal.2d 826, wherein the court stated at page 830 [3 Cal.Rptr. 313, 350 P.2d 65]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201cThe court refused to instruct the jury on the doctrine of last clear chance. This rule can be invoked only where the evidence is such that the trier of fact can properly find \u2018 (1) <em>that the plaintiff was in a position of danger and, by his own negligence, became unable to escape from such position by the use of ordinary care, </em>either because it became physically impossible for him to escape or <em>because he was totally unaware of the danger; </em>(2) <em>that defendant knew that plaintiff was in a position of danger and further knew, </em>or in the exercise of ordinary care <em>should have known, that plaintiff was unable to escape therefrom; </em>and (3) that <em>thereafter defendant had the last clear chance to avoid the accident by the exercise of ordinary care but failed to exercise such last clear chance, and the accident occurred as a proximate result of such failure.\u2019 (Brandelius </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>47 Cal.2d 729, 743 [306 P.2d 432].)\u201d (Emphasis added.) (Also see <em>Leonardini </em>v. <em>Atchison, Topeka </em>&amp; <em>Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>183 Cal.App.2d 552 [6 Cal.Rptr. 798].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In applying the facts of this case to the requisite cited elements, the first element is satisfied. According to appellant\u2019s testimony, after looking to the south and seeing no ears approaching, he drove his car without stopping onto the travelled portion of the highway to the point of the collision. He neither saw nor heard respondent\u2019s car before the collision. Therefore, there is substantial evidence \u201cthat the plaintiff was in a position of danger and, by his own negligence, became unable to escape from such position by the use of ordinary care, . . . because he was totally unaware of the danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The second requisite element of the doctrine is divided into two parts. First, that \u201cdefendant knew that plaintiff was in a position of danger,\u201d and second, that he \u201cknew or . . . should have known, that plaintiff was unable to escape therefrom.\u201d The only testimony as to when defendant actually became aware of plaintiff\u2019s existence was that given by defendant and his wife. Defendant testified that he was about 175 yards (i.e., 525 feet) away from appellant when he first observed him. Defendant\u2019s wife testified that she first observed appellant\u2019s ear when defendant\u2019s car \u201chad finished or about finished making the curve.\u201d Thus, the only evidence as to the <em>distance </em>between the two cars when appellant\u2019s car was first observed by defendant would be between 525 to 600 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>feet. Although there is no conflict over the fact that appellant\u2019s vehicle was stopped, there is a conflict as to <em>where </em>and <em>when </em>it was stopped. Defendant and his wife testified that when appellant\u2019s vehicle was <em>first seen, it was stopped. </em>Appellant testified that he stopped some 2 or 3 feet from the edge of the travelled portion of the highway. This was corroborated by the witness Harris. Defendant testified that appellant was stopped near the center of northbound lane 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">If appellant\u2019s version of <em>where </em>he was stopped is accepted, it would be indeed difficult to draw the inference that defendant, when he first observed appellant, \u201cknew that plaintiff was in a position of danger,\u201d since appellant would not have even been upon the travelled portion of the highway when first observed. Since the evidence is viewed in a light most favorable to appellant, respondent\u2019s version of <em>where </em>appellant was positioned will be accepted. Since respondent\u2019s testimony placed appellant in the center of lane 2 (i.e., across the lane of northbound traffic), the jury could infer that respondent \u201cknew plaintiff was in a position of danger\u201d or at least, was in a position of potential danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">According to appellant\u2019s testimony, from the time his automobile left the spot approximately 2 to 3 feet east of the travelled portion of the highway until the point of impact <em>it did not stop </em>and the maximum speed attained was 10 miles per hour. Appellant\u2019s witness, Harris, corroborated the fact that appellant\u2019s vehicle did not stop once it entered the travelled portion of the highway and he testified that appellant\u2019s car was approximately in the <em>middle </em>of the northbound highway and moving when he first observed respondent\u2019s car coming around the curve, some 700 to 800 feet south of the point of impact, respondent\u2019s car travelling somewhere between 80 to 100 miles per hour. He estimated that appellant\u2019s vehicle was travelling \u201csomewhere around seven, eight, ten miles an hour.\u201d The difficulty with Harris\u2019 testimony is that the mathematical ramifications of what he testified to render his version something less than credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">If, according to Harris\u2019 testimony, appellant\u2019s vehicle was in the middle of the northbound lane, and moving, then appellant would have had some 18 feet<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to travel before he would have reached the point of impact. If appellant\u2019s vehicle was moving at 7 miles per hour, it would cover the 18 feet in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>approximately 1.75 seconds; at 8 miles per hour, it would take approximately 1.5 seconds, and at 10 miles per hour, it would take approximately 1.2 seconds. According to Harris, while appellant\u2019s vehicle was positioned and moving as above indicated, respondent\u2019s vehicle was coming around the curve some 700 to 800 feet away, travelling between 80 and 100 miles per hour. Even assuming (which is contrary to the record) that respondent maintained the same constant rate of high speed right up to the point of impact, under this witness\u2019 testimony, the accident could not have occurred. If respondent had been travelling at 100 miles per hour, it would have taken approximately 5.4 seconds to cover 800 feet and 4.7 seconds to cover 700 feet; at 90 miles per hour, approximately 6 seconds for 800 feet and 5.3 seconds for 700 feet; and at 80 miles per hour, approximately 6.8 seconds for 800 feet and 5.9 seconds for 700 feet. Based upon the time-distance interval, the more slowly respondent was driving, the more incredible Harris\u2019 testimony becomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Appellant\u2019s vehicle was either moving or standing still at the time when respondent\u2019s vehicle came into view.  As stated by Mr. Justice Peters in <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Reis, </em>21 Cal.2d 654, 660 [134 P.2d 788]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201c. . . [T]he trier of the facts may not indulge in the inference when that inference is rebutted by clear, positive and uneontradicted evidence of such a nature that it is not subject to doubt in the minds of reasonable men. <em>The trier of the facts may not believe impossibilities.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The evidence is without dispute that when respondent first observed appellant\u2019s vehicle, some 525 feet away, the latter vehicle was not in lane 1. The only open space under any possible view of the evidence available to respondent\u2019s ear was lane 1. The evidence shows without contradiction that upon observing appellant\u2019s car, respondent sounded his horn, removed his foot from the accelerator and placed it on the brake, gradually slowing as he changed from lane 2 to lane 1. The evidence discloses that it took respondent some 2 to 3 seconds to remove his foot from the accelerator pedal and on to the brake pedal, the respondent testifying, \u201cYes. I mean, I wasn\u2019t in any particular big hurry to apply the brake. . . . I was a way, way back there.\u201d In the 2 to 3-second interval prior to the time respondent applied his brakes (assuming that he was travelling somewhere in the vicinity of 60 miles per hour), respondent\u2019s vehicle covered between 175 and 263 feet. He testified that when he finally did apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>his brakes, he did not apply them full force, that \u201cThe car was under a gradual braking the entire time until I had to apply full force on the car. \u2019 <em>\u2019 </em>He further testified that he was approximately 75 feet from the point of impact when his car started to skid.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Clearly, once respondent\u2019s vehicle entered into lane 1 (the unobstructed lane) and appellant\u2019s vehicle remained <em>stopped </em>either in the middle of lane 2 or 2 or 3 feet from the travelled portion of the highway, it would be most difficult to find justification for an inference that respondent \u201cknew ... or should have known, that plaintiff was unable to escape (from a position of danger).\u201d It would only be after appellant began to proceed into lane 1 that this inference could be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The fact that a defendant actually observes a plaintiff some considerable time before the accident does not necessarily make the doctrine applicable. <em>(Kowalski </em>v. <em>Shell Chemical Corp., </em>177 Cal.App.2d 528, 536 [2 Cal.Rptr. 319] ; <em>Dalley </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 427, 435-436 [166 P.2d 595].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">While it is true that the trier of fact would not be required to believe testimony given by respondent, it is equally true that \u201c. . . disbelief does not create affirmative evidence to the contrary of that which is discarded.\u201d <em>(Lubin </em>v. <em>Lubin, </em>144 Cal.App.2d 781, 795 [302 P.2d 49].)  A legal inference can only flow from a fact actually established and not from the nonexistence of a fact. <em>(Strnod </em>v. <em>Abadie, </em>181 Cal.App.2d 737, 740 [5 Cal.Rptr. 627].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">An examination of the record as a whole fails to disclose that there is substantial evidence to support a finding on each of the three necessary elements.  While parties to a law suit are entitled to have the jury fairly and impartially instructed and to have them instructed upon their theory of the ease <em>(Sills </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Transit Lines, </em>40 Cal.2d 630 [255 P.2d 795]), this is subject to the requirement that there be substantial evidence in the record which would support the particular theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Each lane being 12 feet wide and appellant\u2019s ear being in the middle of lane 2, leaving one half of lane 2 (6 feet) and all of lane 1 (12 feet).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
