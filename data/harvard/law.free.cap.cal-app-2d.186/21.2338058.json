On June 12th of the following year an order was made transferring the action from the Los Angeles Superior Court to that of Santa Clara County. A year elapsed, during which period the costs and fees needed to accomplish the transfer were not paid, and on July 25, 1952, an order was made dismissing the action, as was authorized by section 581b, Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-14\">No attack appears to have been made on any of these orders until, June 9, 1959, the plaintiff moved to vacate the order of transfer, basing his motion on the files and records and an argument accompanying his notice. Upon the denial of his motion he filed a notice of appeal, which we interpret as an attempt to make three appeals: (a) \u201cfrom the order and judgment dismissing the within action\u201d; (b) \u201cfrom the subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ruling and order denying the motion upon which said judgment is based\u201d; and (e) \u201cfrom the jurisdiction of the court to entertain any general factual demurrer or motion to strike the complaint within. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Bach of these purported appeals must be dismissed.  That taken from the order and judgment dismissing the action is years too late.  That taken from the order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to set the dismissal aside runs afoul of the principle: \u201c It is well settled that an order made after judgment is not appealable where the motion or application merely asks the court to repeat or overrule the former ruling on the same facts.\u201d <em>(Oppenheimer </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1951), 104 Cal.App.2d 545, 550 [232 P.2d 26, 29].)  The last \u201cappeal,\u201d that from the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the court, or rather lack of it, is, of course, not from an appealable matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The attempted appeals are and each is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Shinn, P. J., and Vall\u00e9e, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 28, 1960.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b41-17\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
