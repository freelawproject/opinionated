Plaintiff alleged some 10 separate and distinct causes of action against1 \u2018 Dependants and Each op Them.\u201d This court, pursuant to the Rules on Appeal, has ordered to this court the original superior court file and proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The defendants, Robert Leebrick, Richard Leebrick and Gene Hancock, individually and doing business as Begs Oil Tool Rental, Inc. ; Robert Leebrick and Richard Leebrick, individually and doing business as Leebrick &amp; Fisher, Inc. ; Leebrick &amp; Fisher, Inc. ; filed an answer on April 18, 1958. The answer consisted of general and special denials to each and every allegation of plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">A default judgment was entered against Begs Oil Tool Rental, Inc., on February 3, 1959. The pretrial conference order filed February 16, 1959, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">\u201cPre-Trial Conference Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">\u201cIn the Superior Court . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">&lt; 6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\">\u201cThis is a complaint for money (common counts).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">\u201cThe complaint is dismissed as to the fictitious defendants. The pleadings are proper and the issues joined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-14\">\u201cPlaintiff contends as follows: His first five causes of action are common counts for goods, wares, merchandise and services in the amount of $10,410.49, upon which $1,416.36 has been paid or credited; the second five causes of action are common counts upon an assigned claim of J. B. Nelson for goods, wares, ..merchandise and services in the amount of $7,064.21 upon' which $1,764.21 has been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-15\">\n<em>(l</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201cThe default of defendant No. 6 <em>(i.e. </em>Begs Oil Tool Rental) has been entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cThe other defendants deny all of the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, contending that the first five causes of action are for two portable units for mounting desanders, which were ordered by one Ernest Snyder who was an employee of defendants 5 and 6 <em>(i.e. </em>Leebrick &amp; Fisher, Inc., a corporation and Begs Oil Tool Rental, Inc., a corporation), solely for defendant No. 6, and that the second five causes of action are for work ordered by Snyder from J. B. Nelson solely for defendant No. 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cThe parties agree:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201c1. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That defendants 5 and 6 are corporations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">\u201c3. That prior to filing the complaint J. B. Nelson assigned his claim for $5,300 against defendant plaintiff [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">&lt; &lt; &gt;&gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">As to all defendants other than Begs Oil Tool Rental, a trial was had on the merits. The trial judge very succinctly summarized the facts when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\">\u201c. . . [T]here are two separate entities (i.e. Begs Oil Tool Rental Inc., and Leebrick &amp; Fisher, Inc.), both of them represented by one individual (i.e. Mr. Ernie Snyder), both of them in one office and a salesman from (plaintiff) . . . calls upon . . . (Mr. Snyder) and . . . (plaintiff) finally ends up building . . . equipment. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-13\">\u201cNow, the one side contends they were dealing with X. The other side contends it was Y. Now, what does the testimony show ? \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">Counsel for <em>appellant </em>prepared the findings. The findings provide in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-15\">\u201cVII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-16\">\u201cThat . . . Plaintiff did fabricate and did sell and deliver to Defendants Begs Oil Tool Rental, Inc., a corporation, goods, wares and merchandise of the reasonable value of $10,410.49 for which Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-17\">\u201cVIII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-18\">\u201c. . . [T]hat no part of said sum has been paid or credited except the sum of $1,416.36 and that there is now due, owing and unpaid to Plaintiff from Begs Oil Tool Rental Inc., a balance of $8,994.13 together with interest . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201cIX</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">\u201c. . . [T]hat the Plaintiff sold and delivered to Defendants Begs Oil Tool Rental, Inc., <em>only </em>goods, wares and merchandise for which Begs Oil Tool Rental, Inc., <em>only </em>agreed to pay Plaintiff in the sum of $10,410.49. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u201cX</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u201c. . . [T]hat an account was stated <em>only </em>by and between the Plaintiff and Begs Oil Tool Rental, Inc. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">\u201cXI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">\u201c. . . [T]hat the Plaintiff furnished to Defendants Begs Oil Tool Rental, Inc. at their special instance and request <em>only, </em>upon an open book account, goods, wares and merchandise of the agreed and reasonable value of $10,410.49. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">\u201cXII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">\u201c. . . [T]hat Defendants Begs Oil Tool Rental, Inc. <em>only </em>became indebted to the Plaintiff in the sum of $10,410.49, as a commercial fabricater [sic] and welder.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">The conclusions of law are consistent with the above findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Appellant neither asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support the findings nor that the conclusions of law are contrary to the findings. Appellant does assert that the \u201ctrial court erred in ruling that under the pleadings it had no jurisdiction to make any ruling against any individual defendant\u201d and that, therefore, this court must assume that the trial court <em>\u201cdisregarded </em>the admitted facts concerning the failure to issue stock, late issuance of the permit to issue stock, insufficient capitalization, and the injustice to plaintiff should the separate entities not be disregarded.\u201d In effect appellant contends that the trial court failed to consider evidence which could justify a piercing of the corporate veil. The reporter\u2019s transcript indicates that the following was said by the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-13\">\u201cThe Court: . . . [T]his court has no jurisdiction under the present pleading to make any ruling against any individual- . . . The facts here before the Court show\u2014or what do the facts, the evidence before the Court indicate as to whom the plaintiff was dealing with ? He was dealing with somebody. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>And, at another time the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\u201cThe Court: On the <em>alter ego, </em>and the <em>alter ego, </em>I don\u2019t think that has any application here at all because you can\u2019t have an <em>alter ego </em>with four people over here and a different set of four on the other side. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">This court will not presume (or as appellant states, \u201cassume\u201d) that the trial court erred.  Appellant\u2019s contention is answered by <em>Oldis </em>v. <em>La Societe Francaise, </em>130 Cal.App.2d 461 [279 P.2d 184], wherein the court stated at page 472:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201c \u2018No antecedent expression of the judge, whether casual or cast in the form of an opinion, can in any way restrict his power to declare his final conclusion in the only manner authorized by law, to wit, by filing the \u201cdecision\u201d (findings of fact and conclusions of law) provided for by section 632 and 633 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u2019 <em>(Scholle </em>v. <em>Finnell, </em>173 Cal. 372, 376 [159 P. 1179].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">\u201cIn such a case the inquiry is not the speculative one of endeavoring to ascertain whether or not assertedly erroneous concepts putatively indicated by the opinion persisted in the mind of the judge and infected the findings which he later formulated and filed.\u201d (See <em>DeCou </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>190 Cal. 741, 751 [214 P. 444] ; <em>Strudthoff </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>28 Cal.2d 602, 615 [170 P.2d 873] ; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Flood Control Dist., </em>81 Cal.App.2d 902, 907 [185 P.2d 396].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The latter quoted statement of the judge would seem to indicate that the trial court did consider <em>\u201calter ego.\u201d </em>It was counsel for <em>appellant </em>who prepared the findings, and he does not and could not complain that there was no express finding on that issue. Appellant on its motion for a new trial again raised the <em>\u201calter ego\u201d </em>contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Whether or not the corporate entity may be disregarded is within the province of the trial court.  As stated in <em>Stark </em>v. <em>Coker, </em>20 Cal.2d 839 at page 846 [129 P.2d 390]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-11\">\u201c. . . The conditions under which the corporate entity may be disregarded, or the corporation be regarded as the <em>alter ego </em>of the stockholders, necessarily vary according to the circumstances in each case inasmuch as the doctrine is essentially an equitable one and for that reason is particularly within the province of the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">For the reasons stated the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
