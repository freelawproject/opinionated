The habeas court dismissed the petition upon determining that the petitioner\u2019s claimed right to parole was not an interest sufficient to give rise to habeas relief. While the petitioner urges that we reach the merits of his claim, at oral argument we questioned counsel about the issue of the habeas court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter. We must resolve this issue before reaching the merits of this appeal. This court has jurisdiction to determine whether a trial court had jurisdiction. <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>14 Conn. App. 583, 541 A.2d 1251 (1988) (en banc). Because we conclude that no liberty interest was implicated by the petitioner\u2019s claim, the habeas court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter. That court, therefore, properly dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The pertinent facts are undisputed. The petitioner was convicted of murder in 1974 and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twenty years to life. In 1977, he was sentenced to a consecutive term of one to four years for conspiring to bring unauthorized items into a penal institution. On August 25, 1986, the parole board conducted a hearing to determine whether the petitioner should be paroled to the consecutive sentence. At the time of the hearing, the board was operating under its own procedures and regulations, which had not been submitted to the state attorney general and the legislature for approval prior to implementation. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-169 and 4-170. The board denied the petitioner release and gave him written notice of the reasons for its decision. The petitioner then sought a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that his confinement is illegal because the board\u2019s regulations do not conform to the requirements for rule-making that it must follow as a state agency pursuant to the UAPA. After a trial to the court on March 27, 1989, the petition was dismissed on May 11,1990. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The issue presented to this court requires us to determine whether a prisoner\u2019s challenge to the parole board\u2019s failure to adopt regulations pursuant to the UAPA constitutes a cognizable claim of illegal detention that gives the habeas court jurisdiction over the subject matter. Jurisdiction over the subject matter is the court\u2019s power to hear and decide cases of the general class to which the proceedings at issue belong. <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 542, 590 A.2d 914 (1991); <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>215 Conn. 701, 709, 579 A.2d 1 (1990); <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 427, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988); <em>Shea </em>v. <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of New Haven, </em>184 Conn. 285, 288, 439 A.2d 997 (1981). A court has subject matter jurisdiction if it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the authority to hear a particular type of legal controversy. This jurisdiction relates to the court\u2019s competency to exercise power. <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Malkowski, </em>189 Conn. 101, 105-106, 454 A.2d 275 (1983); <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 185, 413 A.2d 819, appeal dismissed, 444 U.S. 801, 100 S.

The court must \u201cfully resolve it before proceeding further with the case.\u201d <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, quoting <em>Valley Cable Vision, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>175 Conn. 30, 32, 392 A.2d 485 (1978); <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>supra, 545; <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 245, 558 A.2d 986 (1989); <em>Gimbelv. Gimbel, </em>147 Conn. 561, 566, 163 A.2d 451 (1960). Whenever a court finds that it has no jurisdiction, it must dismiss the case, without regard to previous rulings. <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 351, 542 A.2d 672 (1988); <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 238, 502 A.2d 410 (1985); <em>Chzrislonk </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>101 Conn. 356, 358, 125 A. 874 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We begin by taking note of the basic purpose underlying what is one of the most extraordinary and unique <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>legal remedies \u201cin the procedural armory of our law.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>344 U.S. 443, 512, 73 S. Ct. 397, 97 L. Ed. 469 (1953). Although it is true that the United States Supreme Court \u201chas not 'always followed an unwavering line in its conclusions as to the availability of The Great Writ\u2019 \u201d; <em>McClesky </em>v. <em>Zant, </em>499 U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 1454, 113 L. Ed. 2d 517 (1991), quoting <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 411-12, 83 S. Ct. 822, 9 L. Ed. 2d 837 (1963); from the time the writ originated in seventeenth century England, its central purpose has been to test the legality of detention. English legislation and common law have been recognized by the United States Supreme Court as authoritative guides in applying the writ in the federal courts. <em>McNally </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>293 U.S. 131, 136-37, 55 S. Ct. 24, 79 L. Ed. 238 (1934), overruled on other grounds, <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>391 U.S. 54, 88 S. Ct. 1549, 20 L. Ed. 2d 426 (1968).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In applying federal habeas statutes,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court has said that \u2018[t]he purpose of the proceeding defined by the statute was to inquire into the legality of the detention .... There is no warrant in either the statute or the writ for its use to invoke judicial determination of questions which could not affect the lawfulness of the custody and detention, and no suggestion of such a use has been found in the commentaries on the English common law.\u201d <em>McNally </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra; see also <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 136, 102 S. Ct. 2286, 73 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (relief available to a prisoner only if he is held in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the United States); <em>Preiser </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 484, 93 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Ct. 1827, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439 (1973) (\u201c[i]t is clear, not only from the language of [the federal habeas statutes], but also from the common-law history of the writ, that the essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody\u201d); <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em>supra, 402 (writ\u2019s \u201croot principle is that in a civilized society, government must always be accountable to the judiciary for a man\u2019s imprisonment: if the imprisonment cannot be shown to conform with the fundamental requirements of law, the individual is entitled to his immediate release\u201d); H. Hart and H. Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System (3d Ed.) 1468 (\u201cGreat Writ always serves the function of precipitating a judicial inquiry into a claim of illegality in the petitioner\u2019s detention for the purpose of commanding his release, or other appropriate disposition.\u201d); P. Bator, \u201cFinality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners,\u201d 76 Harv. L. Rev. 441, 444-45 (1963) (\u201c[i]ts function, in the great phrase, is to test \u2018the legality of the detention of one in the custody of another\u2019 \u201d); accord <em>Allen </em>v. <em>McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 98 n.12, 101 S. Ct. 441, 66 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The history of our own jurisprudence is wholly in accord with these principles. \u201cHabeas corpus provides a special and extraordinary legal remedy for illegal detention.\u201d <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>supra, 594; <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>189 Conn. 663, 668, 457 A.2d 1072 (1983); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 9208), </em>184 Conn. 157, 167, 439 A.2d 958 (1981); <em>Mayock </em>v. <em>Superintendent, </em>154 Conn. 704, 705, 224 A.2d 544 (1966) (per curiam); <em>Wojculewicz </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>143 Conn. 624, 627, 124 A.2d 886 (1956); <em>Bissing </em>v. <em>Turkington, </em>113 Conn. 737, 740, 157 A. 226 (1931). The deprivation of legal rights is essential before the writ may be issued. <em>McPheters </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>146 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>509, 510, 152 A.2d 632 (1959). \u201c \u2018Questions which do not concern the lawfulness of the detention cannot properly be reviewed on habeas corpus.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>214 Conn. 23, 33, 570 A.2d 673 (1990), quoting <em>Flaherty </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>155 Conn. 36, 40, 229 A.2d 362 (1967). When a habeas petition is properly before a court, the remedies it may award depend on the constitutional rights being vindicated. <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>194 Conn. 510, 516, 481 A.2d 1084 (1984). Further, any remedy must be commensurate with the scope of the constitutional violations that have been established.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id., 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The gravamen of the petitioner\u2019s claim is that his confinement is illegal because the parole board operates in violation of the UAPA\u2019s rule-making provisions. For this type of claim of illegal detention to be cognizable in a habeas action, however, the petitioner would, at the very least, have to have some constitutional or statutorily created liberty interest in parole release. In <em>Greenholtz </em>v. <em>Nebraska Penal Inmates, </em>442 U.S. 1, 99 S. Ct. 2100, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1979), and <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>482 U.S. 369, 107 S. Ct. 2415, 96 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1987), the Supreme Court determined when such liberty interests arise and when they do not in the context of parole-release proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u201cIn <em>Greenholtz </em>the Court held that, despite the necessarily subjective and predictive nature of the parole-release decision . . . state [parole-release] statutes may create liberty interests in parole release that are entitled to protection under the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 371. The court also held that the mere \u201cpresence of a parole system by itself does not give rise to a constitutionally protected liberty interest in parole release.\u201d Id., 373. \u201cThe Nebraska statute involved in <em>Greenholtz </em>provides as follows: \u2018Whenever the Board of Parole considers the release of a committed offender who is eligible for release on parole, it <em>shall </em>order his release unless it is of the opinion that his release should be deferred because: (a) There is a substantial risk that he will not conform to the conditions of parole; (b) His release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect for law; (c) His release would have a substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline; or (d) His continued correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in the facility will substantially enhance his capacity to lead a law-abiding life when released at a later date.\u2019 Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 83-1, 114 (1) (1981) (emphasis added).\u201d <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 374. The statute also lists fourteen factors the Nebraska parole board must consider in reaching a decision. Id. In finding an infrangible liberty interest, \u201cthe Court found significant [the statute\u2019s] mandatory language\u2014the use of the word \u2018shall\u2019\u2014and the presumption created\u2014that parole release <em>must </em>be granted unless one of four designated justifications for deferral is found.\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) Id., citing <em>Greenholtz </em>v. <em>Nebraska Penal Inmates, </em>supra, 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Similarly, in <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>the court found that the state of Montana\u2019s parole statute<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>gives rise to a liberty interest in parole release based on its use of the \u201cmandatory language (\u2018shall\u2019) to \u2018creat[e] a presumption that parole release will be granted\u2019 when the designated findings are made.\u201d Id., 377-78, citing <em>Greenholtz </em>v. <em>Nebraska Penal Inmates, </em>supra, 12. The court also noted that both the Montana statute in <em>Allen </em>and the Nebraska statute in <em>Greenholtz </em>contained the \u201csubstantive predicates\u201d of parole release. <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 379, citing <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 472, 103 S. Ct. 864, 74 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983). Both statutes require an assessment of the effect of release on the inmate and the community, with the focal point being on whether the prisoner can live in society according to law. <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 379-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In deciding whether our parole statute, \u00a7 54-125, also gives rise to a protected liberty interest in parole release, we scrutinize it under the standards set forth in <em>Greenholtz. </em>We note at the outset that \u00a7 54-125 states that an inmate <em>\u201cmay </em>be allowed to go at large in the discretion of the panel of the board of parole for the institution in which the person is confined, if (1) . . . there is reasonable probability that such inmate will live and remain at liberty without violating the law and (2) such release is not incompatible with the welfare of society.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although \u00a7 54-125 is similar to the statutes at issue in <em>Greenholtz </em>and <em>Allen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>in that it, too, contains the \u201csubstantive predicates\u201d of parole release, it is unmistakably distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Our statute contains no language providing that an inmate <em>shall </em>be released if the two statutory criteria are met.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It vests broad discretion in the judgment of the parole board. The statute does not give an inmate any right to demand or even apply for parole. It does not require that a parole board actually consider any inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole, even if he has fulfilled the statute\u2019s two requirements. \u201cThe only statutory limits upon the discretion of the board of parole are the requirement that the inmate serve his minimum sentence, that it appear that the inmate will remain at liberty without violating the law, and that the release of the inmate not be incompatible with the welfare of society.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>171 Conn. 691, 697-98, 372 A.2d 102 (1976). Our analysis is consistent with our Supreme Court\u2019s view in <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>206 Conn. 267, 271, 537 A.2d 1004 (1988), that our commutation statute, \u00a7 18-26, \u201ccreates no right or entitle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ment that may be claimed by any prison inmate . . . and [bears] no mandates giving rise to a duty to commute a sentence or grant a pardon, or creating a constitutional entitlement to an exercise of clemency.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Connecticut Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Dumschat, </em>452 U.S. 458, 466-67, 101 S. Ct. 2460, 69 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Similar claims against the United States Board of Parole also have proven to be unavailing. In dismissing a habeas challenge to that board\u2019s parole release process as violative of the federal Administrative Procedure Act; 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq. (A.P.A.), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit acknowledged that if the parole board is subject to the A.P.A., then its procedures must comport with those required by the act. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lundgren, </em>528 F.2d 1050, 1053 (5th Cir.), cert denied, 429 U.S. 917, 97 S. Ct. 308, 50 L. Ed. 2d 283 (1976). The Fifth Circuit held, however, that \u201ca prisoner challenging the decision of the board or the process by which that decision was reached must show that the action of the board was so unlawful as to make his custody in violation of the laws of the United States. There must be a sufficient nexus between the allegedly illegal action and the legality of his custody for habeas corpus to lie. A prisoner has no right to release on parole; he has only a statutory right to have the board comply with the A.P.A. and its own rules and guidelines. A departure by the board does not necessarily make his custody illegal.\u201d Id., 1054-1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In light of these factors, we hold that \u00a7 54-125 also creates no protected constitutional or statutory liberty interest in parole release that gives rise to a claim of illegal confinement in a habeas action. Although the petitioner alleged that his confinement was illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>because the parole board did not adhere to the UAPA\u2019s procedures for rule-making, no such liberty interest can arise. The habeas court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Indeed, it would be utterly incongruous to dismiss an inmate\u2019s habeas petition for lack of any right or entitlement to commutation, as in <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>supra, while on the other hand permitting a habeas challenge to a parole proceeding by that same inmate, now armed with a protected liberty interest. That the petitioner in this case does not challenge the propriety of his convictions only heightens the absurdity of his claim: One lawfully convicted of a crime, lacking any protected liberty interest in parole release, may nevertheless win his freedom by asserting in a habeas action that his confinement has been made illegal because a parole board allegedly failed to promulgate regulations in accordance with state law. In this respect, the action before us today is not unlike <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>156 Conn. 339, 346-47, 240 A.2d 877, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 884, 89 S. Ct. 192, 21 L. Ed. 2d 159 (1968), where our Supreme Court held that intrastate transfer of an inmate from one prison to another does not constitute illegal detention so as to warrant release. To expand the boundaries of habeas jurisdiction by recognizing a claim such as the one before us today would swallow the writ\u2019s central purpose and, as Justice Jackson warned nearly four decades ago, sanction its \u201cprogressive trivialization\u201d with even further \u201cfarfetched or borderline petitions.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 536 (Jackson, J., concurring in the result).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Since it is clear that an inmate has no liberty interest in or right to parole release, it follows a fortiori that he cannot invoke a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in a habeas action by claiming his confinement is illegal based on a parole board\u2019s failure to adhere to rule-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>making procedures. Unless a liberty interest in parole exists, the procedures followed in the parole determination are not required to comport with standards of fundamental fairness. <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>District of Columbia Board of Parole, </em>823 F.2d 644, 648 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>Georgia State Board of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>678 F.2d 940, 942 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1043, 103 S. Ct. 462, 74 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1982). The petitioner\u2019s contention that he has a right to parole release because the board failed to adhere to the UAPA\u2019s rule-making provisions is utterly lacking in support, in either law or logic, and is \u201canalytically indefensible.\u201d <em>Shango </em>v. <em>Jurich, </em>681 F.2d 1091, 1100 (7th Cir. 1982); <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>District of Columbia Board of Parole, </em>supra, 648; accord <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 698-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">While we remain mindful of the unique and critically important role of habeas corpus in our jurisprudence, we cannot permit litigants who have no cognizable claim of illegal detention to leapfrog into court by ignoring the threshold element of a habeas action in order to surmount our jurisdictional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\"> Discussing the difficulties in defining the scope of habeas, Justice Frankfurter noted that \u201cthe writ has potentialities for evil as well as for good. . . . The circumstances and conditions for bringing into action a legal remedy having such potentialities obviously cannot be defined with a particularity appropriate to legal remedies of much more limited scope. To attempt rigid rules would either give spuriously concrete form to wide-ranging purposes or betray the purposes by strangulating rigidities. . . . The fact that we cannot formulate rules that are absolute or of a definiteness almost mechanically applicable does not discharge us from the duty of trying to be as accurate and specific as the nature of the subject permits.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>344 U.S. 443, 512-13, 73 S.
