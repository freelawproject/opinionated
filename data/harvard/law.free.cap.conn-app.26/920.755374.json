Douglas Nolan, appeals from the judgment of the trial court in a quiet title action in which the trial court granted the plaintiff title in a strip of land serving as a common boundary between the plaintiff\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s properties. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly interpreted the evidence at trial. Accordingly, he asks us to interpret the evidence presented at trial independently and to reverse the decision of the trial court. We decline to undertake such a review.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">Although much of the trial testimony was disputed, the credibility of witnesses, the findings of facts and the drawing of inferences are all within the province of the trier of fact. <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Grayson, </em>4 Conn. App. 275, 293, 494 A.2d 576 (1985), appeal dismissed, 202 Conn. 211, 520 A.2d 225 (1987). \u201cIt is futile to assign error involving the weight of testimony or the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>Maykut, </em>176 Conn. 147, 149, 405 A.2d 76 (1978).
