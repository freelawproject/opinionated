The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to satisfy the notice provisions contained in General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149 because issues of material fact existed concerning whether (1) the notice adequately described the location of the alleged accident, (2) the plaintiff intended to mislead the city regarding the location of the alleged accident and (3) the city was in fact misled regarding the location of the alleged accident. We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The pertinent facts are as follows. On November 20, 1990, the plaintiff filed a revised complaint claiming that he suffered physical and emotional injuries as the result of tripping over a raised manhole cover and falling in the center of South State Street, outside the Stamford railroad station. The second count of the revised complaint alleged that the city breached its duty to keep the road in repair.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u00a7 13a-149.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff, in an attempt to comply with the notice requirements of \u00a7 13a-149, sent a certified letter dated November, 3,1987, to the city. The letter informed the city that the plaintiff was injured after he \u201ctripped on a raised sewer hole at the Stamford Railroad Station on October 18, 1987, at approximately 11:45 P.M., while [he] was exiting the Railroad Station on the Northbound side.\u201d The city filed a motion for summary judgment on May 2,1991, claiming that the plaintiff failed to comply with the notice provisions of \u00a7 13a-149. In support of its motion, the city filed an affidavit sworn to by John R. Mitola, its attorney. Mitola stated in the affidavit that because \u201c[t]he only facts necessary for determination of the instant motion for summary judgment can be gleaned from the examination of the court\u2019s file . . . no factual affidavit is necessary to support this motion.\u201d The plaintiff responded by filing a written objection to the motion together with an affidavit sworn to by the plaintiff personally. In his affidavit, the plaintiff did not address the adequacy of the notice. Rather, he simply restated the central allegations contained in his complaint that after he exited the \u201cnorthbound train at the Stamford Railroad Station, and . . . walked under the underpass to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>southside of the station\u201d he was injured when he tripped over a \u201craised manhole in the center of [South State Street].\u201d The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, reasoning that (1) the description of the accident\u2019s location was so indefinite that it constituted a complete failure of notice, and (2) even if the notice was simply inaccurate, the plaintiff failed to invoke the saving clause of \u00a7 13a-149 by alleging either that the plaintiff did not intend to mislead the city or that the city was not in fact misled. The plaintiff appealed from the trial court\u2019s summary judgment rendered in favor of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Under our rules of practice, any party may move for summary judgment once the pleadings in a case are closed. Practice Book \u00a7 379. The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact, which is any fact that will make a difference in the result of a case. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>26 Conn. App. 293, 297, 600 A.2d 1040 (1991). To satisfy this burden, the moving party must offer \u201csuch documents as may be appropriate, including but not limited to affidavits . . . written admissions and the like.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u201cOnce the moving party has filed the appropriate documents, the party opposing the motion \u2018must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue.\u2019 <em>Strada </em>v. <em>Connecticut Newspapers, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 313, 317, 477 A.2d 1005 (1984); <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Carriage Lane Associates, </em>[219 Conn. 772, 781, 595 A.2d 334 (1991)]. The mere presence \u2018of an alleged adverse claim is not sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\u2019 <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>182 Conn. 34, 39, 438 A.2d 415 (1980). Rather, \u2018the defendant must recite specific facts . . . which contradict those stated in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavits and documents.\u2019 Id., 39-40.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>supra. \u201cThe judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Here, the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment was based on the plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the notice requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149. \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 13a-149 requires that before a plaintiff may sue a municipality for damages for injuries suffered as a result of that municipality\u2019s failure to maintain its roads properly, that plaintiff must, within ninety days of the occurrence, provide written notice of the occurrence to a selectman or clerk of the municipality. Section 13a-149 also contains a saving clause that provides that notice given under the statute will not be invalidated because of inaccuracies in its content as long as there was no intent to mislead the municipality or the municipality is not in fact misled.\u201d <em>Giannitti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>25 Conn. App. 67, 75, 593 A.2d 140, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 918, 597 A.2d 333 (1991). While the saving clause will excuse inaccuracies in the content of the notice, however, it will not excuse a complete absence of notice. <em>Nicholaus </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>117 Conn. 398, 401, 167 A. 826 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment on the basis of its determination that the plaintiff had failed to comply with the statutory notice provisions. The court further concluded that the saving clause was inapplicable as a matter of law because the notice in this case \u201cfailed completely\u201d to describe the accident site. In its memorandum of decision on the motion for summary judgment, the trial court focused on a discrepancy between the description in the notice of the alleged nature and location of the defect and that included in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit in opposition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>motion for summary judgment. The notice recited that the plaintiff had tripped \u201con a raised sewer hole at the Stamford Railroad Station while [he] was exiting the Railroad Station on the Northbound side.\u201d The affidavit described the defect as a \u201craised manhole in the center of [South State] street.\u201d After examining the definition of the term \u201csewer hole\u201d the trial court concluded that \u201c[u]nder this indefinite description the city could have understood the notice to refer to a variety of places, e.g.: a catch basin, an open sanitary sewer, an open drainpipe, but not necessarily a \u2018raised manhole in the center of the street.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Our analysis of the notice reveals no basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the notice was insufficient as a matter of law. Whether notice is sufficient is normally a question of fact for the jury. <em>Morico </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>134 Conn. 218, 223-24, 56 A.2d 522 (1947). \u201cThe sufficiency of the notice is to be tested by the purpose of the statute, and not by the requirements of a pleading.\u201d <em>Sizer </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>113 Conn. 145, 157-58, 154 A. 639 (1931). \u201c \u2018The obvious purpose of [the statutory notice provision] is that the officers of municipal corporations, against which suits for injuries are about to be instituted, shall have such precise information as to time and place as will enable them to enquire into the facts of the case intelligently.\u2019 <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>[46 Conn. 263, 266 (1878)].\u201d Id., 156. Notice \u201cis sufficient if it enables one of ordinary intelligence, using ordinary diligence <em>under the circumstances, </em>to ascertain where the injury occurred.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 158. The notice in this case stated that the plaintiff\u2019s injury occurred when he \u201ctripped over a raised sewer hole at the Stamford Railroad Station on South State Street\u201d as he \u201cwas exiting the Railroad Station on the Southbound side\u201d and \u201cgoing to the taxi stand . . . .\u201d While the notice in this case could be more specific as to the precise location of the sewer hole over which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>plaintiff tripped, it is not so indefinite that no reasonable jury could find that, under the circumstances, it was adequate to identify the alleged defect for the city. The oblique assertion made by the city\u2019s attorney in his affidavit that \u201c[t]he only facts necessary for determination of the instant motion for summary judgment can be gleaned from the examination of the court\u2019s file\u201d is insufficient to demonstrate that the circumstances are such that the notice is inadequate. See, e.g., id., 158-59. Because the defendant failed to show that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d; Practice Book \u00a7 384; the trial court improperly granted the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\"> Only the first and second counts of the revised eomplaint were directed against the city. The first count, which alleged that the city was negligent with respect to the claimed defect, was stricken by the trial court on Decern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ber 17, 1990, leaving only the second count. The third and fourth counts of the revised complaint were directed against the state of Connecticut, which is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person injured in person or property by means of a defective road or bridge may recover damages from the party bound to keep it in repair. . . .
