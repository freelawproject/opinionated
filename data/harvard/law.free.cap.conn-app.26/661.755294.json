The trial court concluded that because the policy was unambiguous, the plaintiff was not covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>by the policy issued to his employer, Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc., a family owned business. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The trial court found the following facts. On September 13, 1986, the plaintiff was a pedestrian when he was struck by an underinsured motorist. He requested uninsured motorist benefits pursuant to a business automobile policy of insurance issued by the defendant to Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc. The policy was effective from July 15, 1986, through July 15, 1987, and covered three pickup trucks and two trucks owned by the corporation. The policy identified Victor Ceci, Inc., as the \u201cnamed insured\u201d and did not identify any individual officers or employees. The policy classified the insured\u2019s business as a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">At issue in this case are the provisions of the insurance policy that dealt with uninsured motorist coverage. According to these provisions, the defendant would pay for damages caused by an uninsured vehicle. Individuals covered by this provision included: \u201c(1) you or any family member (2) anyone else occupying a covered auto or a temporary substitute for covered auto.\u201d The policy defined \u201c \u2018Family member\u2019 \u201d as \u201ca person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household, including a ward or foster child.\u201d The policy defined \u201coccupying\u201d as \u201cin, upon, getting in, on or off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The plaintiff submitted his claim for uninsured motorist benefits to an arbitration panel. The arbitrators denied the plaintiff\u2019s claim for coverage, finding that because the plaintiff was neither a family member of the named insured nor occupying any of the insured vehicles, he was not an insured under the policy. The plaintiff filed an application to vacate the arbitration award. The defendant asserted a counterclaim seeking to confirm the decision of the arbitration panel. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant by confirming the arbitration award. The plaintiff appealed that decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The plaintiff contends that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the policy was unambiguous. He argues that because the policy was issued to a corporation, the language referring to coverage of family members created an ambiguity in the policy\u2019s coverage that should be resolved in his favor. The plaintiff argues that the provisions dealing with uninsured motorists are ambiguous because the language indicates that these provisions covered persons and their families, unlike the rest of the policy which involves the named insured corporation. The plaintiff argues that the references to family members and bodily injuries apply only to persons and not to a corporation. Thus, according to the plaintiff, because the policy language has two different definitions of who is insured, it is ambiguous and should be construed in favor of the plaintiff. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">We begin by noting that an ambiguous provision in an insurance policy is to be construed in favor of the insured. <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 696, 702, 569 A.2d 1131 (1990). Before an insured can take advantage of this principle, however, there must be a finding that the insurance policy provisions were in fact ambiguous. <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>214 Conn. 573, 583-84, 573 A.2d 699 (1990) . The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the policy provision was not ambiguous was a legal conclusion concerning the construction of the contract, which is subject to de novo review on appeal. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Bulaong, </em>218 Conn. 51, 58, 588 A.2d 138 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Under Connecticut law, the named insured refers only to the name actually appearing on the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>policy. <em>Testone </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>165 Conn. 126, 129-30, 328 A.2d 686 (1973). <em>Testone </em>involved an employee injured by an uninsured motorist during the course of his employment. The employee sought coverage under the employer\u2019s uninsured vehicle provisions. The named insured was a corporation and the policy protected \u201cagainst damages caused by an uninsured vehicle to \u2018(a) the named insured and any designated insured and, while residents of the same household, the spouse and relatives of either . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id. The court determined that he was not entitled to protection under the uninsured policy provision. Id., 130. The court looked to the language of the policy and held that because the employee was not a \u201cdesignated insured,\u201d he was not covered by the corporation\u2019s policy. It is important to note that our Supreme Court did not find that the policy language referring to a \u201cspouse and relatives\u201d of the named insured, the corporation, to be ambiguous or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">According to the language of the policy in this case, Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc., was the named insured. The policy did not list any other people as designated insureds. The policy specifically stated that \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d referred to the \u201cname insured,\u201d Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc. Because the plaintiff was not the named insured, to be entitled to uninsured motorist coverage, he must satisfy one of the provisions referring to who is insured. The resolution of this case turns on whether the language referring to \u201cyou or any family member\u201d applied to the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Neither our Supreme Court nor this court has interpreted language referring to a \u201cfamily member\u201d in a policy where the named insured is a corporation. A corporation is a distinct legal entity that acts only through its agents. <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>Reliable Refuse Co., </em>212 Conn. 661, 673, 563 A.2d 1013 (1989). Although the plaintiff is the brother of the owner of the corporation, he cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>be related to a corporation. The inclusion of language concerning family members in a policy issued to a corporation does not make the policy ambiguous. Because it is clear that the plaintiff could not be related to the corporation, there was no ambiguity that would entitle him to coverage based on the presumption favoring an insured where an insurance policy is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The plaintiffs status as an employee of the named insured corporation also fails to bring him within the uninsured motorist provision for family members. We adopt the majority position that employees do not qualify for uninsured motorist benefits as \u201cfamily members\u201d of a corporation by which they are employed. <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Savannah, </em>171 Ga. App. 671, 672, 320 S.E.2d 555 (1984); <em>Kaysen </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>268 N.W.2d 920, 923-24 (Minn. 1978); <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Maine Bonding &amp; Casualty Co., </em>133 N.H. 569, 573, 579 A.2d 804 (1990); <em>Giambri </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>170 N. J. Super. 140, 143, 405 A.2d 872 (1979), aff'd, 174 N.J. Super. 162, 415 A.2d 1202 (App. Div. 1980) (per curiam); <em>Buckner </em>v. <em>Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnity Co., </em>66 N.Y.2d 211, 214, 486 N.E.2d 810, 495 N.Y.S.2d 952 (1985); <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>636 S.W.2d 437, 440-41 (Tenn. App. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The reasoning for this rule as explained by the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>Buckner </em>v. <em>Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnity Co., </em>supra, is persuasive. In that case, the plaintiff, a child of the sole shareholder of a family owned corporation was struck while riding his bicycle by a hit-and-run driver. The plaintiff had worked part-time for the corporation but was not involved in the corporation\u2019s business when he was injured. The plaintiff sought uninsured motorist benefits under the corporation\u2019s insurance policy. The language of the policy was very similar to the language in the policy at issue in this case. The court noted that an average person reading the entire policy would conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>a corporation could not have family members related by blood, marriage or adoptions. <em>Buckner </em>v. <em>Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 214. The court noted that its construction of this provision concerning a family member of a corporation did not render the uninsured vehicle coverage without meaning because the other provision covered \u201cany person while occupying an automobile owned by the corporation . . . .\u201d Id., 215. In this case, the uninsured vehicle provision also covers other persons who occupy a covered automobile, so our construction of the inapplicability of the family member provision does not leave the uninsured vehicle provision without meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The plaintiff argues that the family member provision of the insurance policy must be construed to cover his claim. His argument is based on the principle that \u201c \u2018[ejvery provision [of a contract of insurance] is to be given effect, if possible, and no word or clause eliminated as meaningless, or disregarded as inoperative, if any reasonable meaning consistent with the other parts of the policy can be given to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>A.M. Larson Co. </em>v. <em>Lawlor Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 618, 622, 220 A.2d 32 (1966), quoting <em>Downs </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>146 Conn. 490, 495, 152 A.2d 316 (1959). The policy in this case was issued to a corporation, not an individual person. The endorsement concerning uninsured motorist coverage was to be read in light of the entire policy. It is impossible to give any reasonable meaning to \u201cfamily member\u201d that would qualify the plaintiff as a family member of a corporation. Construing this insurance policy as a layperson would understand it; <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Remington Electric Shavers, </em>179 Conn. 494, 497, 427 A.2d 810 (1980); there is no reasonable interpretation of the family member provision that would entitle the plaintiff to recover under this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">When interpreting an insurance policy, \u201c[a] court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>nary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity, and words do not become ambiguous simply because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings.\u201d <em>Downs </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>supra, 494-95. The language of the uninsured motorist provision was clear and unambiguous. We will not torture the meaning of family member to accept the plaintiffs claim that he was related to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision confirming the arbitration panel\u2019s ruling was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
