The plaintiff seeks an order from the trial court directing the issuance of a prejudgment attachment, in the amount of $300,000, against certain real property owned by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">In determining whether to grant an application for a prejudgment remedy, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cthe trial court\u2019s function is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a judgment will be rendered in favor of the plaintiff in a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>on the merits. . . . \u2018The hearing in probable cause for the issuance of a prejudgment remedy is not contemplated to be a full scale trial on the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The plaintiff does not have to establish that he will prevail, only that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the claim. . . . The court\u2019s role in such a hearing is to determine probable success by weighing probabilities.\u2019 . . . Moreover, this weighing process applies to both legal and factual issues.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Bank of Boston Connecticut </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, </em>220 Conn. 152, 156, 595 A.2d 872 (1991). On appeal, our review is limited to \u201c \u2018whether the determination of the trial court constituted clear error.\u2019 \u201d Id., 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In denying the plaintiff\u2019s application, the trial court found that it did not have \u201cenough here to enter a $300,000 judgment,\u201d even though it accepted all of the testimony presented by the plaintiff. The trial court, therefore, held the plaintiff to a higher standard than is required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-278d.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The denial of the application is reversed and the case is remanded for a new hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-278d (a) provides: \u201cThe defendant shall have the right to appear and be heard at the hearing. The hearing shall be limited to a determination of whether or not there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiffs claim. If the court, upon consideration of the facts before it, finds that the plaintiff has shown probable cause to sustain the validity of his claim, then the prejudgment remedy applied for shall be granted as requested or as modified by the court unless the prejudgment remedy or application for such prejudgment remedy was dismissed or withdrawn pursuant to the provisions of section 52-278j.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
