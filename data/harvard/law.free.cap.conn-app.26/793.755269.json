Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>220 Conn. 30, 594 A.2d 977 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The facts of the present case are set forth in <em>Forsberg </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>24 Conn. App. 655, 657, 591 A.2d 147, remanded for reconsideration, 220 Conn. 922, 597 A.2d 342 (1991), and do not warrant repetition here. The dispositive question before us in that case was \u201cwhether the trial court correctly determined that Staci Forsberg\u2019s vehicle was an \u2018under-insured motor vehicle\u2019 under General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 38-175C (b) (2) (now \u00a7 38a-336 [d]). Id., 656. We determined that the vehicle was <em>not </em>an underinsured vehicle as defined by the relevant statute and that the plaintiff, Forsberg, should be allowed to stack her uninsured-underinsured motorist coverage under policies held by her individually and by her parents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id., 659-61. Accordingly, we remanded the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment confirming the arbitration award, which was in accordance with our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Subsequent to our decision, our Supreme Court decided in <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>supra, that, in determining the liability limit for purposes of underinsured motorist insurance, the relevant amount to be examined is the per person limit available to the victim, and that, for the purpose of determining whether a tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle is underinsured, the uninsured motorist insurance statute, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336, limits consideration of underinsured motorist coverage to each individual policy available to the claimant separately. Id., 34. Under this analysis, our decision in <em>Forsberg, </em>which directly conflicts with <em>Covenant, </em>must be changed to conform to that recent Supreme Court case.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\"> The parents\u2019 policy covered the plaintiff as a member of her parents\u2019 household.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
