The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss filed on the basis of the failure to notify him of his statutory speedy trial rights pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-82c and 54-82d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The defendant was arrested on the charges underlying his conviction on July 15,1989. Having failed to make bond, the defendant was held in custody at the North Avenue correctional facility in Bridgeport. On December 20,1989, while those charges were still pending, the defendant was sentenced to a four year prison term for an unrelated charge and immediately began serving his sentence at the Somers correctional institution. Thereafter, the defendant was transferred to correctional facilities in Enfield and Cheshire before being transferred back to the Bridgeport facility on April 6,1990. On July 25,1990, the defendant filed the motion to dismiss that is the subject of this appeal. At the start of the defendant\u2019s trial on July 26, 1990, he was still serving the four year prison term, which had commenced 218 days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, additional facts were adduced. The department of correction had maintained a personal inmate file on the defendant since his incarceration on the unrelated charge on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>December 20,1989. Such a file follows an inmate from one institution to another as he is transferred through the facilities of the correctional system. The defendant\u2019s inmate file contained a \u201crap sheet.\u201d The rap sheet indicated the charges then pending against the defendant arising out of his July 15,1989 arrest. The file contained no indication that any correction official had given the defendant notice of his speedy trial rights under General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c. The defendant testified that he was never notified by any warden or other prison official of his speedy trial rights under \u00a7 54-82c while incarcerated at the Somers, Enfield, Cheshire or Bridgeport correctional facilities. The warden of the North Avenue correctional facility in Bridgeport testified that, pursuant to advice received from the office of the attorney general, inmates are not notified of their \u00a7 54-82c speedy trial rights concerning charges that are already pending and for which the inmate has already been arraigned at the time the inmate commences his term of imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant never requested a final disposition of the charges against him pursuant to \u00a7 54-82c. Neither the state nor the defendant introduced any evidence regarding the effect, if any, the pending charges may have had on the conditions of the defendant\u2019s incarceration, or on his ability to participate in rehabilitative or other programs while in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court articulated the following reasons in support of its decision to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss: (1) there was nothing in the defendant\u2019s inmate file that would have put any correction official on notice of any untried indictment or information against the defendant; (2) correction officials did not have to provide notice to the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 54-82c because he had already been arraigned on the subject charges; (3) the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>ant never requested final disposition of the pending charges pursuant to \u00a7 54-82c; and (4) constitutional speedy trial analysis did not require dismissal of the charges against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">This appeal revolves about the statutory interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c. The brief legislative history of the bill that became \u00a7 54-82c indicates that its purpose was to \u201callow a prisoner who was committed to jail to ask that he be tried within 120 days on any information or indictment pending against him.\u201d 7 S. Proc., Pt. 6,1957 Sess., p. 3712, remarks of Senator John H. Filer; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>202 Conn. 93, 96, 520 A.2d 155 (1987). The rationale of affording speedier trials to those serving criminal sentences than to those not yet incarcerated has been previously explored by this court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>14 Conn. App. 244, 249, 540 A.2d 395 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Foshay, </em>12 Conn. App. 1, 530 A.2d 611 (1987). The rationale has also been considered by other courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has thoroughly analyzed the concerns that arose because of the prior system that allowed detainers to remain on file against a prisoner without disposition, concerns that eventually led to the drafting and adoption of interstate and intrastate detainer statutes across the country. \u201cThe disadvantages and potential abuses of this system were many. Prison authorities often accorded detainers considerable weight in making decision with respect to the terms and conditions of the prisoner\u2019s incarceration and release on parole. Sometimes the prisoner would automatically be held under maximum security. Sometimes he would be ineligible for special work programs, athletic programs, release for visits to relatives\u2019 death beds or funerals, or special minimum security facilities. Often detainers precluded the granting of parole. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>\u201cIn addition, the pending charges forming the basis of a detainer might themselves significantly impede the development of a coherent program for the prisoner\u2019s punishment and rehabilitation. . . . [P]arole boards and prison authorities found it difficult to formulate the prisoner\u2019s rehabilitative program, since they were forced to act without knowing whether the prisoner would be convicted on the other pending charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">\u201cThis same uncertainty also often adversely affected the prisoner\u2019s attitude towards his own rehabilitation. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">\u201cMoreover, the prisoner subject to a detainer was handicapped by delay in preparing for trial of the charge upon which it was based. As in all cases of trial delay, witnesses might die, evidence disappear, and memories fade.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>550 F.2d 732, 737-40 (2d Cir. 1977), aff'd sub nom. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mauro, </em>436 U.S. 340, 98 S. Ct. 1834, 56 L. Ed. 2d 329 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Similar concerns are reflected in the legislative history underlying General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c, our intrastate detainer statute. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 1, 1957 Sess., pp. 229-30, remarks of Representative Marjorie D. Farmer; id., pp. 230-31, remarks of Howard Jacobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c is patterned after General Statutes \u00a7 54-186, which is known as the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) and which applies to prisoners who are incarcerated in one state and face charges in another. \u201cA primary purpose behind both statutes is to alleviate problems posed by outstanding detainers on efforts at prisoner rehabilitation. At committee hearings on the bill that became General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c, Representative Marjorie D. Farmer noted that \u2018[a]ny program of rehabilitation which is undertaken in a penal institution is ineffective if a man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>has time hanging over his head.\u2019 Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 1, 1957 Sess., p. 229. Similarly, proponents of the Interstate Agreement noted that the uncertainty and anxiety accompanying outstanding charges often inhibits prisoner response to training programs and thwarts efforts at rehabilitation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mauro, </em>supra, 359; see also Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Federal and Intergovernmental Relations, 1957 Sess., pp. 37-42. General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c, like \u00a7 54-186, then, provides a mechanism by which an inmate can remove the uncertainty of pending charges and can compel a speedy resolution of those charges.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foshay, </em>supra, 11\u201412; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 248-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In order to further the purposes of \u00a7 54-82c, the statute places clear and unambiguous obligations on state correction officials. Whenever a person has begun a term of imprisonment in a correctional institution in this state, \u00a7 54-82c (c) provides in pertinent part that a \u201cwarden, community correctional center administrator or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him in writing of the source and contents of any untried indictment or information against him concerning which the warden, administrator or other official has knowledge and of his right to make a request for final disposition thereof.\u201d This provision, by its very terms, places two related but independent obligations on correction officials: (1) to inform a prisoner of charges pending against him; and (2) to inform the prisoner of his right to request speedy disposition of those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In order to dispose of this appeal, we must decide whether the correction officials failed to fulfill both obligations of the statute, and whether these obligations must be fulfilled even if the defendant is aware of the charges pending against him. If the former questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>are both answered in the affirmative, we must also decide whether the charges against the defendant must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The Obligation to Inform</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The trial court found that \u201c[t]here is nothing in [the defendant\u2019s personal inmate] file that would have put any warden, community correctional center administrator or any other official having custody of the prisoner on notice of any untried indictment or information against him.\u201d If this finding is correct, then the defendant\u2019s claims necessarily fail because the notification requirements of subsection (c) of the statute are made operable only when a correctional official \u201chas knowledge\u201d of \u201cany untried indictment or information\u201d against a prisoner. We conclude that this finding is not supported by the evidence of record, and, therefore, it cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">\u201cOn appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. See Practice Book \u00a7 [4061]. . . . [W]here the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); <em>Forox Corporation </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>24 Conn. App. 72, 77, 585 A.2d 707 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, Warden Edward Davies testified that the defendant\u2019s inmate file, which was maintained since the date of his initial imprisonment, at each correctional institution to which the defendant was transferred, contained a rap sheet. The rap sheet indicated the precise charges on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the defendant was arrested on July 15,1989, and indicated that those charges were pending. Contrary to the finding of the trial court, the undisputed evidence shows that correction officials had notice of the charges pending against the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The state next argues that while the rap sheet may have provided correction officials with notice of the charges pending against the defendant, it did not provide knowledge of \u201cthe source and contents of any untried . . . information\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 54-82c. The state claims that something more than awareness on the part of the warden that a case is pending is required to activate the remedial provisions of the statute. That something, according to the state, is a detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The word detainer does not appear in the text of \u00a7 54-82c. Our courts, however, have incorporated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>term detainer in the intrastate act. See, e.g., <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>supra, 104 (referring to \u00a7 54-82c as a \u201cdetainer statute\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 585-86, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986) (\u00a7 54-82c provides \u201ca statutory method by which an inmate of a Connecticut penal institution who has a detainer placed against him can request and receive an expedited disposition of pending charges\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Foshay, </em>supra, 11 (noting that a primary purpose behind \u00a7 54-82c \u201cis to alleviate problems posed by outstanding detainers\u201d). The use of the word detainer in these cases is warranted by the title of the 1957 legislative enactment, Public Acts 1957, No. 551, now codified at \u00a7 54-82c, and its legislative history. Public Acts 1957, No. 551, is entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Disposition of Detainers within this State.\u201d House Bill 683, which became Public Acts 1957, No. 551, contained the following statement of purpose: \u201cTo make it possible for a prisoner to institute disposition of detainers.\u201d Both the title of a bill and its statement of purpose are valuable aids to construction. <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 405, 528 A.2d 805 (1987). Moreover, Public Acts 1957, No. 551, was modeled after a proposal of the Committee of State Officials on Suggested State Legislation of the Council of State Governments in its 1957 program, which also advocated adoption of an Agreement on Detainers for prompt disposition of charges against out-of-state prisoners. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 1, 1957 Sess., pp. 229-30, remarks of Representative Marjorie D. Farmer. A review of the Council of State Governments report leaves little doubt that the intrastate act is intended to apply to detainers, as does its interstate counterpart, which is replete with use of the term detainer. See Council of State Governments, Suggested State Legislation Program for 1957, pp. 74-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Having concluded that a detainer is required to invoke the notification provisions of \u00a7 54-82c (c), we now turn to the question of whether the rap sheet in the defendant\u2019s inmate file constituted a detainer for purposes of the intrastate act. We have found no case that presents this issue for resolution and, therefore, we know of no case that holds that a rap sheet is or is not the equivalent of a detainer. Interpretations of the interstate agreement on detainers (IAD), however, are helpful in our resolution of this issue. There is abundant authority for the proposition that the intrastate and the interstate legislation should be similarly interpreted because they impliedly have the same legislative intent; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>supra, 104-105; <em>State </em>v. <em>Foshay, </em>supra, 12-13; although we recognize that there may sometimes be reason to interpret the intrastate legislation on detainers differently from the interstate legislation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1980-6), </em>36 Conn. Sup. 327, 331-32, 419 A.2d 904 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The IAD contains no definition of the word detainer. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mauro, </em>436 U.S. 340, 359, 98 S. Ct. 1834, 56 L. Ed. 2d 329 (1978). The United States Supreme Court has accepted the congressionally approved definition of a detainer as \u201c \u2018a notification filed with the institution in which a prisoner is serving a sentence, advising that he is wanted to face pending criminal charges in another jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting H.R. Rep. No. 91-1018, p.2 (1970), and S. Rep. No. 91-1356, p.2 (1970). A detainer, however, need not take any particular form; its purpose is to provide \u201cwritten notice to prison authorities . . . that charges are pending against the prisoner.\u201d <em>Gilbreath </em>v. <em>State, </em>651 P.2d 699, 701 (Okla. Crim. App. 1982); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mauro, </em>supra, 358 (\u201ca detainer merely puts the officials of the institution in which the prisoner is incarcerated on notice that the prisoner is wanted in another jurisdiction for trial upon his release from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>prison\u201d); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>26 Conn. App. 254, 256, 600 A.2d 17 (1991). Thus, a letter from a police department to prison officials; <em>People </em>v. <em>Browning, </em>108 Mich. App. 281, 291-92, 310 N.W.2d 365 (1981); a letter from the clerk of court to prison officials; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beamon, </em>83 Mich. App. 121, 132, 268 N.W.2d 310 (1978); and a letter from a prosecuting attorney to prison officials; <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State, </em>180 Ga. App. 409, 412, 349 S.E.2d 274 (1986); have all been held to fall within the IAD definition of a detainer. This view of what constitutes a detainer accords well with the requirement that the IAD \u201cshall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-186, Article IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">These authorities serve as a guide for the answer to the question of whether the rap sheet in the defendant\u2019s prison inmate file constituted a detainer for purposes of \u00a7 54-82c. See <em>Remick </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>203 Conn. 494, 498, 525 A.2d 502 (1987). The rap sheet in this case provided prison officials with information concerning the precise charges pending against the defendant as a result of his July 15, 1989 arrest. Although the informal nature of this notice to prison officials may have left some questions unanswered concerning the source or contents of the untried information in question, we conclude that, in the context of the intrastate act, the rap sheet in this case sufficed as a detainer. Should the correction officials have desired more information, a minimal effort would have allowed them to gather any additional data about the intrastate charges. To require more formal notice in order to invoke the remedial provisions of the intrastate act, as is urged by the state, would exalt form over substance. The notice, here the rap sheet, informed prison officials of the continuing prosecution against the defendant. The spectre of that prosecution for the pending charges was sufficient to produce \u201c \u2018the uncertainty and anxiety accompanying outstanding charges [that] often inhibits prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>response to training programs and thwarts efforts at rehabilitation,\u201d which the act was intended to address. <em>State </em>v. <em>Foshay, </em>supra, 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The rap sheet in the defendant\u2019s inmate file, which came to the attention of correctional officials having custody of him, was sufficient to serve as a detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Relevance of the Prisoner\u2019s Knowledge of the Pending Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The defendant claims that because he was not notified of the charges pending against him, he could not request a final disposition of the pending charges, and that his knowledge of the pending charges or his arraignment as to those charges did not exonerate the correction officials of their obligation to inform him of his right to request a speedy trial. The trial court concluded that the failure of correction officials to notify the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 54-82c (c) was not due to any malfeasance on the part of correction officials, \u201cbut rather compliance with advice from the attorney general\u2019s office indicating that the notice required by statute applied only to untried indictments or informations the existence of which a prisoner might be unaware.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we conclude that notice to a prisoner by correction officials of the right to request speedy disposition of pending charges is required notwithstanding the prisoner\u2019s awareness of the charges, we cannot sustain the decision of the trial court on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">By its terms, \u00a7 54-82c (c) has placed the obligation on correction officials to notify prisoners of their particular speedy trial rights. To allow prison officials to escape this duty on the basis of a prisoner\u2019s awareness of the charges against him would be contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>plain and unambiguous language of the statute. The duty would have little meaning if it did not exist when a prisoner is aware that charges against him remain outstanding, since such an awareness is almost always present. Nor has the legislature made a distinction between prisoners who know little of the criminal system and those who have been prisoners on many occasions. In fact, the purpose of the act is most likely to be best served when the prisoner is not a stranger to incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\u201cOn the few occasions that we have had the opportunity to apply General Statutes [\u00a7 54-82c] ... we have required strict compliance with the statutory notice procedures.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>supra, 588. In addition, there is nothing in the record on which to conclude, nor does it necessarily follow, that the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the charges against him provided him with any information concerning his speedy trial rights pursuant to \u00a7 54-82c or the statutory method of invoking those rights. To conclude otherwise would nullify the separate and independent obligation placed by the statute on prison officials \u201cpromptly [to] inform [a prisoner] in writing ... of his right to make a request for final disposition\u201d of any untried indictment or information against him. General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c (c). \u201cBecause of the importance of this requirement, a [warden\u2019s] failure to fulfill the duties imposed by [\u00a7 54-82c] is itself a violation of the [detainer statute], independent of any violation of the requirement that the prisoner be brought to trial within [120] days of receipt of the prisoner\u2019s request by the court and the prosecuting official. . . .\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Trancoso, </em>776 P.2d 874, 377-78 (Colo. 1989); <em>People </em>v. <em>Higinbotham, </em>712 P.2d 993, 996 (Colo. 1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>37 Ohio App. 3d 159, 162, 524 N.E.2d 912 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The failure of correction officials to notify the defendant of the charges pending against him and of his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>to demand speedy disposition of the pending charges, violated the provisions of the act, regardless of his knowledge of the pending charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The defendant argues that dismissal of the charges against him is the penalty to be exacted from the state for its violation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-82d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides a remedy of dismissal if the state does not try the defendant within 120 days after the defendant invokes his statutory speedy trial rights and the warden causes the same to be delivered to the court and prosecuting authority. No remedy, however, was expressly created by the legislature for a violation of the notice requirement of \u00a7 54-82c (c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In a case involving a delay by New Jersey prison officials in providing a prisoner with IAD forms and forwarding them to Connecticut officials as required by the IAD, our Supreme Court concluded that, in the absence of a statutorily prescribed remedy, \u201cthis defendant\u2019s right to prompt IAD notification can appropriately be protected by invoking the balancing principles of <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972), which determine when a deprivation of [constitutional] speedy trial rights requires dismissal of criminal charges against a defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 89, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989). Because a failure by prison authorities to notify a prisoner of his rights under \u00a7 54-82c (c) does not fall within the express terms of \u00a7 54-82d, we follow the <em>Herring </em>court\u2019s reliance on a constitutional speedy trial analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The four factors that form the matrix of an analysis under <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>supra, are the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and the prejudice to the defendant. Id., 530; <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 89-90; <em>State </em>v. <em>Foshay, </em>supra, 13. \u201cA balancing test is to be applied on a case by case basis. None of the factors standing alone demands a set disposition; rather it is the total mix which determines whether the defendant\u2019s right was violated.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foshay, </em>supra, 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In conducting this analysis, however, we recognize that a complete failure to notify the defendant of his statutory rights and how to invoke them, as opposed to a delay in the processing of his request, will skew the four factors found in <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>supra. Any analysis must not permit the state to benefit from its statutory violation. \u201cWe would be remiss in our obligation to effectuate the . . . purposes and principles [of the intrastate detainer statute] if we were simply to ignore such a violation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">First, we examine the length of the delay in the present case. Had the defendant been promptly notified of his statutory speedy trial rights by prison officials as required by \u00a7 54-82c, he could have requested speedy disposition of the charges against him as early as the commencement of his term of imprisonment. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the absence of such notification by prison officials, the calculation of time for statutory speedy trial purposes must be viewed as having commenced upon the triggering of the state\u2019s duty to give notice of the right to demand speedy disposition. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>supra. The length of the delay here, therefore, runs from the date of the defendant\u2019s incarceration (December 20, 1989) until the commencement of the defendant\u2019s trial (July 26, 1990), a period of seven months. A delay of seven months, while certainly \u201cnot an overwhelming period of time\u201d for constitutional speedy trial purposes; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>172 Conn. 531, 536, 375 A.2d 1024, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 847, 98 S. Ct. 153, 54 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1977); is longer than the 120 day period established by \u00a7 54-82c.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Application of the <em>Barker </em>balancing test next requires a consideration of the reasons for the delay. As previously noted, the delay was occasioned by the state\u2019s noncompliance with the notification requirements of \u00a7 54-82c (c). The defendant was not notified of his statutory speedy trial rights because he was a postarraignment, pretrial detainee with respect to the outstanding charges at the time he entered upon a term of imprisonment at a state correctional facility. Warden Edward Davies testified that the failure to comply with \u00a7 54-82c (c) reflected a policy involved in such cases.' This testimony indicates a deliberate and systematic policy that necessarily undermines a prisoner\u2019s speedy trial rights under the statute. As such, this reason for the delay must be weighed heavily against the state. Cf. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>supra, 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">As to the third <em>Barker </em>factor, it goes without saying that the defendant did not vigorously assert his right to a speedy trial under \u00a7 54-82c. He first indicated his reliance on \u00a7 54-82c when he filed his motion to dismiss on the eve of trial. While our consideration of his failure to seek speedy disposition of the charges against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>him pursuant to \u00a7 54-82c cannot logically be separated from the failure of prison officials to advise him of his right to do so; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>supra; we find it significant that at no time during the pendency of the charges against him did the defendant request a speedy trial to effectuate his separate constitutional speedy trial rights. The failure of the defendant to assert his constitutional right to a speedy trial and the state\u2019s failure to notify him of his statutory rights under \u00a7 54-82c precludes reliable use of this factor in our analysis. Cf. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>supra, 530 n.30. On the basis of the record before us, therefore, this factor weighs in favor of neither the defendant nor the state. See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>State, </em>650 S.W.2d 396, 400-401 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The final <em>Barker </em>factor that we must consider is prejudice caused by the delay. \u201cPrejudice, of course, should be assessed in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect.\u201d <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>supra, 532. Our detainer statute, however, was intended to supplement and expand the speedy trial rights of prisoners for reasons distinct from those underlying constitutional speedy trial concerns. Thus, \u201c[w]hen faced with a situation such as is presented here, a court should analyze the implications of the violation for the defendant\u2019s prison rehabilitation program as well as the subsidiary concern of the impact of the violation on the defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Higinbotham, </em>supra, 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The seven month delay here caused the defendant to wait only three additional months beyond the 120 day period set forth in the statute for the disposition of the charges against him. Given that the defendant had only recently commenced a four year prison term, it is very unlikely that any of the concerns involved in the passage of \u00a7 54-82c; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>supra; would have come into play during the three addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>tional months of incarceration suffered by the defendant before the disposition of the pending charges. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s failure to request a speedy trial pursuant to his constitutional speedy trial rights, coupled with the startling lack of any evidence of record suggesting that he would have invoked his rights under General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c had he been properly informed of them, lead us to the conclusion that the effect of the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights here was minimal or nonexistent. In light of the lack of any evidence that the conditions of the defendant\u2019s incarceration including his ability to participate in particular prison programs was adversely affected by the delay caused by the statutory violation, we must resolve the final <em>Barker </em>factor against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">We recognize that \u201cthe linchpin of the speedy trial cl\u00e1im is a showing of prejudice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>185 Conn. 199, 209, 440 A.2d 867 (1981); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 90; <em>State </em>v. <em>Foshay, </em>supra, 15. Applying the principles of <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>supra, to the facts of this case, we conclude that the appropriate remedy for the violation of the defendant\u2019s statutory speedy trial rights is not dismissal of the charges. The trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 54-82c. prisoner\u2019s right to speedy trial ON PENDING CHARGES, (a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a correctional institution of this state and, during the continuance of the term of imprisonment, there is pending in this state any untried indictment or information against such prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred twenty days after he has caused to be delivered, to the state\u2019s attorney or assistant state\u2019s attorney of the judicial district or geographical area, in which the indictment or information is pending, and to the appropriate court, written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for final disposition to be made of the indictment or information.

The state contends that our review of this document is crucial and that the defendant has not satisfied his obligation to provide this court with an adequate record for review. Practice Book \u00a7 4061. According to the state, a determination of whether the rap sheet contained \u201cthe source and contents of any untried . . . information\u201d requires our review of the document. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">First, the testimony of Davies was specific as to the content of the defendant\u2019s rap sheet. Reading from the rap sheet contained in the defendant\u2019s personal inmate file, he was able to state the exact charges still pending against the defendant arising out of his July 15, 1989 arrest. Our review of the document itself is unnecessary where there was testimony concerning the contents of the document and where the veracity of those contents is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Second, Davies testified that this information concerning the pending charges, which was contained in the defendant\u2019s inmate file, was available to any correctional official having custody of the defendant. The file was created on December 20, 1989, and it followed the defendant as he was transferred as a state prisoner within the correctional system. The inmate file, therefore, adequately notified correctional officials of the July 15,1989 charges against the defendant and their pending status beginning on December 20, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\"> See footnote 2, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\"> See footnote 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b738-10\"> Subsections 1 (a) and 1 (b) of the Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Act are strikingly similar to General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c, but subsection 1 (c) of the Uniform Act provides a remedy for the type of statutory violation at issue in this case: \u201cFailure of the [warden, commissioner of correction or other official] to inform a prisoner, as required by this section, within one year after a detainer has been filed at the institution shall entitle him to a final dismissal of the [indictment, information or complaint] with prejudice.\u201d 11 Uniform Laws Annotated 328.
