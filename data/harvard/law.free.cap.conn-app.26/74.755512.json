William Burns, the commissioner of transportation for the state of Connecticut, can be held liable under the highway defect statute, General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>sioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the plaintiff appealed. We affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">There is no dispute as to the facts in this case. On November 18,1985, a motor vehicle and a Conrail train collided at the intersection of Toelles Road and South Colony Street in the town of Wallingford. The plaintiffs decedent, Michelle Gagne, was a passenger in the motor vehicle and died as a result of the accident. Her administratrix brought suit on her behalf against the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Consolidated Rail Corporation, the town of Wallingford and Burns. This appeal concerns only the fourth count of the amended complaint which asserts a cause of action against Bums based on General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The trial court granted the commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff then appealed that ruling. The dispositive issue raised by this appeal is whether the commissioner was obligated to keep Toelles Road in repair, thus giving rise to liability under \u00a7 13a-144. We find that in this case as a matter of law the commissioner did not have a duty to repair Toelles Road. Thus, we affirm the decision of the trial court granting summary judgment in favor of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">At common law, the state could not be sued without its permission. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 623, 376 A.2d 359 (1977); <em>Kuchinski </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>23 Conn. App. 198, 199, 579 A.2d 585, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 826, 582 A.2d 204 (1990). The highway defect statute, General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144, created a cause of action \u201cwholly unauthorized by the common law.\u201d <em>Wethersfield </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co., </em>145 Conn. 368, 371, 143 A.2d 454 (1958); <em>Kuchinski </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 200. Thus, \u201cbecause there was no right of action against the sovereign state at common law, a plaintiff, in order to recover, must bring himself within \u00a7 13a-144.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>213 Conn. 307, 321, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 295, 298, 294 A.2d 290 (1972). Section 13a-144 must be \u201cstrictly construed in favor of the state.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra; <em>Kuchinski </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In this case, the commissioner sought the following admissions from the plaintiff: (1) Toelles Road was not a state highway within the framework of General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144; (2) at all times relevant in this complaint, the state of Connecticut had no statutory duty to keep and repair Toelles Road; (3) at all times relevant in this complaint, Toelles Road was a town road, which the town of Wallingford had the duty to maintain and repair. The plaintiffs failure to respond to the commissioner\u2019s requests for admission resulted in the requests being deemed to have been admitted. Practice Book \u00a7 239.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not attempt to withdraw or amend her admissions pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 240.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the facts recited in the requests for admission are \u201cconclusively established.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 240. The granting of summary judgment can be based on admissions resulting from a party\u2019s failure to respond to requests for admissions. <em>Orenstein </em>v. <em>Old Buckingham Corporation, </em>205 Conn. 572, 575-77, 534 A.2d 1172 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Due to the plaintiff\u2019s admissions, she fails to satisfy the statutory requirements of \u00a7 13a-144. The plaintiff admitted that Toelles Road was not a state highway and that Toelles Road is a public road of the town of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Wallingford. To prevail under \u00a7 13a-144, the plaintiff must establish that \u201cthe commissioner had the statutory duty to maintain the portion of the roadway where the defect was located.\u201d <em>Merola </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>21 Conn. App. 633, 639, 575 A.2d 1025 (1990). The commissioner does not have a duty to maintain a town road.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The plaintiff, relying on <em>Cairns </em>v. <em>Shugrue, </em>186 Conn. 300, 441 A.2d 185 (1982), argues that the requests for admissions were not relevant to her cause of action against this defendant. She argues that the various duties imposed on the commissioner by General Statutes \u00a7 13b-200 et seq. establish a cause of action under \u00a7 13a-144.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\"><em>Cairns </em>v. <em>Shugrue, </em>supra, involved a plaintiff who fell because of an accumulation of ice on Whitney Road, located on the campus of the University of Connecticut. The trial court granted summary judgment for the commissioner concluding that Whitney Road was not part of the \u201cstate highway system.\u201d Id., 302. Our Supreme Court reversed, holding that where the commissioner has \u201ca legal duty to maintain a particular highway,\u201d he can be sued pursuant to \u00a7 13a-144 for injuries resulting from negligent performance of that duty. Id., 310. General Statutes \u00a7 13b-30<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> required that the commissioner remove ice and snow from Whitney Road where the accident occurred. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\"><em>Cairns </em>v. <em>Shugrue, </em>supra, does not control this case because the commissioner is under no statutory duty to repair the Toelles Road intersection. The plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>complaint refers to eight statutory provisions involving railroads and railways. Of these eight statutory provisions, only one statute imposes an affirmative duty on the commissioner to take action regarding a railroad crossing. General Statutes \u00a7 13b-345<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides that \u201cwhere the tracks cross at grade on state highways,\u201d the commissioner is obligated to provide \u201ctraffic control measures.\u201d The plaintiff has admitted that Toelles Road is not a state highway, so \u00a7 13b-345 does not apply to create a duty on the commissioner. The other statutes in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint require the commissioner only to investigate or to make recommendations. Thus, <em>Cairns </em>v. <em>Shugrue, </em>supra, is distinguishable because in that case \u00a7 13b-30 imposed a duty to repair on the commissioner. Id., 303. The statutes raised in the present complaint fail to impose a duty on the defendant to repair that would enable the plaintiff to assert a cause of action under \u00a7 13a-144.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144 provides in pertinent part: \u201cdamages FOB INJURIES SUSTAINED ON STATE HIGHWAYS OR SIDEWALKS.
