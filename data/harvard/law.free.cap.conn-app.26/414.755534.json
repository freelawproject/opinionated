This action was brought by the commissioner of children and youth services by way of a petition to terminate the parental rights of Patricia M. and Carl M.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with respect to their daughter Shana. The trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship between the respondent and Shana and that it was not in Shana\u2019s best interest to allow further time for such a relationship to develop. Furthermore, it found that termination of the respondent\u2019s rights was in Shana\u2019s best interest. The respondent appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The respondent raises two claims on appeal. First, she contends that the trial court engaged in improper ex parte contact with the assistant attorney general representing the petitioner. Second, she argues that the trial court should have found that Shana\u2019s foster parents and the department of children and youth services (DCYS) prevented her from maintaining a meaningful relationship with Shana. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The respondent\u2019s first claim concerns an alleged ex parte contact with the petitioner\u2019s counsel by the trial judge. The respondent argues that the delivery of a copy of an English House of Lords decision<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the petitioner\u2019s counsel prior to the hearing was improper. The record discloses that the trial judge\u2019s independent research discovered the 1988 English case that he felt touched on many of the issues involved in the present case. Recognizing that most Connecticut attorneys may have limited access to English case law, the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>made a copy of the decision for each counsel. At the opening of court the next day, he handed one copy to the respondent\u2019s attorney and one copy to the attorney for the minor child and remarked that he had given a copy to the petitioner\u2019s attorney earlier that morning.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From this scenario, the respondent\u2019s attorney asks us to conclude that the judge must have had an improper ex parte meeting with petitioner\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The petitioner argues that we should not review this claim because it was not raised at trial, but rather was brought up for the first time in the respondent\u2019s brief. Despite the merit of this argument, we elect to review the claim under the plain error doctrine because it implicates the ethical conduct of the trial court and reflects on the entire process of justice. Practice Book \u00a7 4185; <em>In re Jonathan P., </em>23 Conn. App. 207, 211, 579 A.2d 587 (1990). It is firmly established that \u201cany ex parte communication concerning a pending proceeding between a lawyer and a judge is prohibited by both the rules of professional conduct and the code of judicial conduct. Connecticut Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.5; Connecticut Code of Judicial Conduct, Cannon 3.A. (4).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 672, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Impartiality on the part of a judge is a fundamental tenet of our system of jurisprudence. Furthermore, not only is actual impartiality required but also the appearance of impartiality. <em>Bonelli </em>v. <em>Bonelli, </em>18 Conn. App. 207, 211, 557 A.2d 559 (1989), rev\u2019d, 214 Conn. 14, 570 A.2d 189 (1990). \u201c[JJustice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u201d <em>Offutt v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 11, 14, 75 S. Ct. 11, 99 L. Ed. 11 (1954). The trial judge must be ever vigilant to consider his conduct from the viewpoint not only of an unbiased observer, but also of the biased litigant who is desperately searching to find a flaw in the judge\u2019s conduct. To paraphrase the Scottish poet Robert Burns, Oh, what a power to give us, to see ourselves as others see us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">To find bias and misconduct on the part of the trial judge in the present case, however, requires a stretch of our legal imagination beyond the elasticity contained therein. Our examination of the record discloses a hard working trial judge who commendably wanted to share the fruits of his research with the attorneys before him. Although it would have been a better procedure for the trial judge to have delivered copies of the English decision to all counsel simultaneously, this slight departure from preferred procedure does not, in this case, warrant the drastic remedy of reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The respondent\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly failed to find that unreasonable conduct by DCYS and Shana\u2019s foster parents prevented her from maintaining a meaningful relationship with Shana. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>respondent challenges the factual basis for the trial court\u2019s decision. We cannot retry the facts. <em>In re Noel M., </em>23 Conn. App. 410, 418, 580 A.2d 996 (1990). \u201cOn appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was legally correct and factually supported. . . . The trial court, following the mandates of General Statutes [Rev. to 1987] \u00a7 17-43a, properly determined, on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, that no ongoing parent-child relationship existed.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>In re Megan M., </em>24 Conn. App. 338, 342, 588 A.2d 239 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> The trial court terminated the parental rights of Carl M. on the ground that he had abandoned Shana.

For what it\u2019s worth, I was in the state library on a\u2014last week, doing some research on a number of cases, and I found a\u2014an English case from 1988, it\u2019s quite a recent case, by the House of Lords, which is the English equivalent of our Supreme Court, that touched on a lot of concerns raised in the trial. Not that it\u2019s, by any means, on all fours, and not that it\u2019s not distinguishable, and not that our system\u2019s laws are not somewhat different from the English . . . [and] not that I thought counsel should be aware of it. Attorney Bakulski, I gave a copy this morning, if I could, Mrs. Lamb, I just made copies for all counsel, knowing that sometimes your English law libraries tend to get a little bit out of date when you\u2019re in private practice. And you can read them, that\u2019s nothing I expect you to be prepared on today, by any means, but, you might want to read it, at your convenience.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> The actual text of Robert Bums\u2019 verse from <em>To a, Louse </em>is:</p>\n<p id=\"AIj\">\u201cO, wad some power the giftie gie us</p>\n<p id=\"AEj\">To see oursels as ithers see us!</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">It wad frae many a blunder free us</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">And foolish notion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
