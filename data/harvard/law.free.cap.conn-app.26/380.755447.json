The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, where the verdict permitted a recovery for unjust enrichment in a relationship between the parties that was governed by express contract and was determined to be untainted by fraud or by a Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>cut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> violation. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. On July 9,1988, the plaintiffs signed a written agreement with the defendant for the purchase of a house to be constructed by the defendant in the Mountain View Estates subdivision in South Windsor. A closing date of September 25, 1988, was set forth in the purchase agreement. The agreement also provided that the defendant could extend the date for closing up to sixty days in the event the defendant was unable to deliver a certificate of occupancy to the premises on the date originally set for closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The defendant was unable to complete construction of the house by September 25, 1988. The plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage commitment with American Savings Bank was due to expire on October 17,1988. The defendant obtained a certificate of occupancy on October 26,1988, at which time the defendant was ready, willing and able to close on the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the plaintiffs had paid a total deposit of $20,500 prior to October 17, 1988. No closing took place prior to the expiration of the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage commitment. On November 7, 1988, the plaintiffs demanded the return of their deposit from the defendant and the payment of other expenses incurred by them as a result of their reliance on the purchase agreement. The defendant did not refund any money to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs commenced this action, alleging in a four count complaint (1) breach of contract, (2) unjust enrichment, (3) fraud, and (4) a CUTPA violation. After trial to a jury, the court directed a verdict in favor of the defendant on the CUTPA claim, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the jury returned a defendant\u2019s verdict on the breach of contract and fraud claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury, however, found the defendant liable on the claim of unjust enrichment (count 2) and awarded the plaintiffs $21,205. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u201c[P]arties who have entered into controlling express contracts are bound by such contracts to the exclusion of inconsistent implied contract obligations.\u201d <em>H. B. Toms Tree Surgery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>187 Conn. 343, 346-47, 446 A.2d 1 (1982); see also 42 C.J.S., Implied Contracts \u00a7 34. Proof of a contract enforceable at law precludes the equitable remedy of unjust enrichment; <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins. Co., </em>10 Conn. App. 125, 127, 521 A.2d 1048, cert. denied, 203 Conn. 806, 525 A.2d 521 (1987); 12 S. Williston, Contracts (3d Ed. Jaeger) \u00a7 1478; at least in the absence of a breach of the contract by the defendant; <em>Rabinovitz </em>v. <em>Marcus, </em>100 Conn. 86, 95-96, 123 A. 21 (1923); 3 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 373, comment a; J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, Contracts (2d Ed.) \u00a7 15-3; a nonwillful breach by the plaintiff; <em>Vines </em>v. <em>Orchard Hills, Inc., </em>181 Conn. 501, 505-10, 435 A.2d 1022 (1980); <em>Stahenau v. Cairelli, </em>22 Conn. App. 578, 581, 577 A.2d 1130 (1990); or a mutual rescission of the contract. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Staub, 78 </em>Conn. 459, 466, 61 A. 760 (1906). None of these exceptions was presented to the jury by the pleadings or instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Although the plaintiffs do not dispute the rule of law set forth in these authorities, they respond that the defendant\u2019s argument \u201crest[s] on the false premise that there was a determination that the relationship between the [parties] was governed by an express contract.\u201d Invoking general verdict principles; see <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. 190, 201-204, 520 A.2d 208 (1987); the plaintiffs contend: \u201cFrom the jury\u2019s rejection of the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim, the defendants have inferred that the jury found that there was a contract and that the contract was not breached. The defendants\u2019 inferences are unjustified. An inference could easily be drawn that the jury found the parties did not enter into a binding agreement. No interrogatories were submitted to the jury. . . . Did the jury reject the claim because they found that there was a contract but no breach of it or did the jury reject the claim because there simply was no contract between the parties? . . . The defendants\u2019inference that there was a contract is not well founded since the jury may have found that there was no contract whatsoever between the parties.\u201d Because we conclude that the general verdict rule does not apply to the circumstances of this case, we cannot agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u201cThe so-called general verdict rule provides that, if a jury renders a general verdict for one party, and no party requests interrogatories, an appellate court will presume that the jury found every issue in favor of the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 202. <em>In Finley, </em>because the jury rendered a general verdict for the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s claim of breach of an express contract, it was presumed to have determined both that a contract did not exist between the parties and that the defendant\u2019s conduct did not constitute a breach of the contract. Id. This was so, however, only because \u201cthe defendant\u2019s answer controverted both of the principal claims raised by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>plaintiffs complaint. The defendant\u2019s denials of the contract\u2019s existence and of its breach presented the jury with distinct and severable defenses to the plaintiff\u2019s claims.\u201d Id., 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In the present case, by contrast, the defendant\u2019s answer admitted the existence of a written purchase agreement between the parties. Additionally, the defendant also served requests for admission upon the plaintiffs, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 238, that assumed the existence of the parties\u2019 written contract. At trial, moreover, the evidence and arguments of counsel focused primarily on the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a breach of the terms of the contract between the parties. Finally, the fact that the defendant did not dispute the existence of the contract was further reflected in the court\u2019s charge to the jury, which was devoid of any instructions on the law of contract formation.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Because \u201cwe will decide the appeal on the theory on which it was tried and decided in the trial court\u201d; L. <em>F. Pace &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>9 Conn. App. 30, 35 n.4, 514 A.2d 766, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 811, 516 A.2d 886 (1986); the general verdict rule cannot be applied to the circumstances presented in this case. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the jury\u2019s verdict cannot be understood to include any \u201cimplicit finding\u201d that a contract never existed between the parties. Instead, the parties at all times operated under a theory of the case that admitted and established a written contract pertaining to the purchase and sale of the property in question. The pleadings and the jury\u2019s verdict, then, necessarily determined that there was an express contract between the parties which was not breached by the defendant\u2019s failure to close on the transaction on September 25. Because the undisputed existence of a contract enforceable at law precludes recovery under a theory of restitution or unjust enrich<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ment under the circumstances of this case; <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins. Co., </em>supra; the trial court should have set aside the verdict on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of unjust enrichment (count two) and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\"> In addition to the named defendant, Jeanne Huppe was also a defendant in the trial court and a party to this appeal.

As such, it satisfied the prerequisite to our full review of the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal. <em>See Pietrorazio </em>v. <em>Santopietro, </em>185 Conn. 510, 441 A.2d 163 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
