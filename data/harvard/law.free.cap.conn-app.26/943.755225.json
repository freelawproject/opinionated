Licamele challenged the amendment on the basis of the alleged participation of a commissioner at a public hearing and executive session after she had disqualified herself from participating in the proceedings because of a potential conflict of interest. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-11. The trial court found no evidence to support Licamele\u2019s allegation that the commissioner had participated in either the public hearing or the executive sessions at which the amendments were adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>Our examination of the record in this matter, including the transcript of the testimony before the trial court, persuades us that the trial court\u2019s judgment was correct and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
