We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The evidence presented to the trial court revealed that Joshua was born on April 3, 1988. He has been in foster care since the age of three months. Approximately three months after the child\u2019s birth, the respondent mother experienced suicidal ideation as well as homicidal ideation concerning her child. She was diagnosed at the time of the child\u2019s birth as having a borderline personality disorder as well as other possible forms of mental illness. The respondent voluntarily placed him in foster care. After placing Joshua in foster care, she maintained minimal contact with him. The respondent failed to cooperate with the department of children and youth services (DCYS) and at times refused to disclose her address or location to DCYS. The child was adjudicated to be a neglected child on April 18, 1989, and committed to the care and custody of DCYS for a period not to exceed eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>In April, 1989, the respondent entered into a treatment program for her psychological problems. The respondent also gave birth to a second son on April 21, 1989. She decided to discontinue her treatment in July, 1989, against the advice of her therapist. In October, 1989, the respondent was told by DCYS that she would have to participate in counseling before Joshua could be returned to her. The respondent refused further treatment for her psychological problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">In March, 1990, the respondent was arrested for disorderly conduct and assault on a police officer. She failed to appear for her scheduled visitation with Joshua in March, 1990. The respondent was allowed to visit with Joshua twice each month, yet she visited only four times between April and August, 1990. Even when the respondent visited with her two children, who were both under DCYS care, she virtually ignored Joshua. In fact, Joshua referred to the respondent as \u201cthat other lady.\u201d Joshua has been in the care of his current foster mother since December, 1988. Testimony revealed that Joshua appears to be a happy, outgoing and well adjusted child.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The respondent claims that the trial court improperly terminated her parental rights because there was no showing that Joshua would be in \u201cimmediate physical danger\u201d should he be returned to her. The respondent\u2019s claim is based on the reasoning of <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 287-89, 455 A.2d 1313 (1983), which upheld the constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b). Section 46b-129 governs the assumption of temporary custody by the state. The statute allows the state to take temporary custody where \u201cthere is reasonable cause to find that the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s condition or the circumstances surrounding his care require that his custody be immediately assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>to safeguard his welfare . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b). Our Supreme Court decided that the criteria used in determining if emergency removal of a child pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101 (e)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> should be allowed must also be applied when deciding if the state can take temporary custody of a child pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (b). <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>supra, 289. The respondent asserts that \u00a7 17a-101 (e) criteria should also be applied to the termination of parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112. The respondent also asserts that because termination of parental rights is a more invasive action by the state than a temporary custody order, termination should not be allowed unless there has been evidence that the parental relationship constitutes a serious threat to the child\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The procedure for termination of parental rights is controlled by General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112. The termination of parental rights is \u201ca most serious and sensitive judicial action.\u201d <em>Anonymous </em>v. Norton, 168 Conn. 421, 430, 362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 294, 46 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975). Thus, there must be \u201c \u2018strict compliance with the statutory criteria [of \u00a7 17a-112] before termination of parental rights and subsequent adoption proceedings can occur. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-BC), </em>194 Conn. 252, 257 n.9, 479 A.2d 1204 (1984). There is no requirement in \u00a7 17a-112 that there must be a finding of immediate physical danger to the child before parental rights can be terminated. We decline an invitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>to add an additional requirement to the established statutory framework of \u00a7 17a-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The termination of parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 is different from a temporary custody determination pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129. Section 17a-112 (b) sets forth specific situations that permit the state to terminate parental rights. There is no need to apply the criteria for emergency removal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-101 through 17a-112. For example, the standard of proof for each procedure is different. Termination of parental rights, because of its finality, requires clear and convincing evidence while temporary custody is governed by the lesser fair preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>supra, 299-300. The higher standard of proof recognizes the seriousness of termination of parental rights by the state. Thus, it is unnecessary to add an additional element of proof not required by \u00a7 17a-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In this case, the trial court correctly applied General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that for at least one year there was an absence of an \u201congoing parent-child relationship, which means the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a day to day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Before the absence of an ongoing parent-child relationship can be the basis for terminating parental rights, the trial court must also find that \u201cto allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of such parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interest of the child.\u201d Id. Such a finding was made by the trial court, which based its decision on expert testimony as to the necessity for placing Joshua in a permanent home instead of continuing foster care. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>There could be no final placement of Joshua if the respondent were allowed to maintain her parental rights. Therefore, it was in Joshua\u2019s best interest to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The second ground found by the trial court concerns the respondent\u2019s inability to rehabilitate herself in order to care properly for Joshua. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2) provides for termination of parental rights where \u201cthe parents of a child who has been found by the superior court to have been neglected or uncared for in a prior proceeding have failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, they could assume a responsible position in the life of the child . . . .\u201d \u201c \u2018 \u201cPersonal rehabilitation\u201d . . . refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Rayna M., </em>13 Conn. App. 23, 32, 534 A.2d 897 (1987), quoting <em>In re Migdalia M., </em>6 Conn. App. 194, 203, 504 A.2d 533 (1986). The trial court must \u201canalyze the respondent\u2019s rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, [determine] that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable \u2018within a reasonable time.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Luis C., </em>210 Conn. 157, 167, 554 A.2d 722 (1989). The trial court correctly followed this analysis in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The respondent next claims that there was insufficient evidence to support the termination of her parental rights. This court\u2019s duty is to ensure that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s conclusion was legally correct and factually supported.\u201d <em>In re Megan M., </em>24 Conn. App. 338, 342, 588 A.2d 239 (1991). \u201c \u2018It is not our function to retry the case or to pass on the credibility of witnesses . . . and we will not.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In re Christine F., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>6 Conn. App. 360, 366-367, 505 A.2d 734, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 808, 809, 508 A.2d 769, 770 (1986), quoting <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Flammia, </em>169 Conn. 491, 497, 363 A.2d 1048 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">There was ample evidence to support the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights. Joshua has been under foster care for all but three months of his life. The respondent during this period has failed to make any sustained attempt to address her psychological problems. The respondent also has failed to maintain regular visits and contact with Joshua during this period. She has refused to follow DCYS proposals aimed at reuniting her with her son. See <em>In re Shavoughn K., </em>13 Conn. App. 91, 534 A.2d 1243 (1987), cert. denied, 207 Conn. 805, 540 A.2d 374 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">On the basis of this record, the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision was legally correct and factually supported. The trial court properly followed \u00a7 17a-112 in determining that there was clear and convincing evidence justifying the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(b) The superior court upon hearing and notice, as provided in sections 45a-716 and 45a-717, may grant such petition if it finds, upon clear and convincing evidence, that the termination is in the best interest of the child and that . . . with respect to any nonconsenting parent, over an extended period of time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>which, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, shall not be less than one year ... (2) the parents of a child who has been found by the superior court to have been neglected or uncared for in a prior proceeding have failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, they could assume a responsible position in the life of the child .... or (4) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship, which means the relationship that ordinarily develops as a result of a parent having met on a day to day basis the physical, emotional, moral and educational needs of the child and to allow further time for the establishment or reestablishment of such parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the best interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\"> Only the respondent mother has appealed.
