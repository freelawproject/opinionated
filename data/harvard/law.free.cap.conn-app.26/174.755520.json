The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) limited his discretion as the custodial parent, (2) disallowed a claimed credit, (3) ordered a reconveyance of the stock at issue, (4) imposed on him an obligation to support the plaintiff beyond the age of eighteen, (5) found a portion of his divorce agreement to be for the benefit of the plaintiff, and (6) awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff. We reverse the judgment of the court only as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">The plaintiff, Craig Plikus, is the son of the defendant, who was divorced from the plaintiffs mother in 1981. The plaintiff was a minor at the time of the divorce, and is one of two issue of the marriage. During the marriage, the defendant and his wife transferred 150 shares of stock in the Southern New England Telephone Company to each son under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Uniform Gifts to Minors Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to the dissolution of their marriage, the defendant and his wife entered into a separation agreement that made no mention of the stock. The divorce was uncontested and the decree provided in part: \u201cThe defendant shall continue to hold the Southern New England Telephone Company stock on which he is presently trustee for the benefit of the children and shall disburse the same in payment for the educational needs of Craig Plikus. In the event that Craig Plikus does not opt to incur educational expenses, the defendant shall convey to Craig Plikus on his 22nd birthday, the aforesaid stock on which he is now trustee.\u201d After the dissolution, the defendant transferred all of the stock into his own name. The stock has since split two for one, and the defendant has retained legal title to the 600 shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In his appeal, the defendant challenges several factual findings. In his first claim, the defendant points out that the Uniform Gift to Minors Act affords a custodian of property broad discretion in handling property and expending moneys for the benefit of a minor. He claims that the trial referee and the court improperly limited his discretion as a custodial parent. He claims that he spent approximately $12,000 on high school tuition, uniforms, sports equipment and transportation for the plaintiff. The attorney trial referee found, however, that the defendant did not use the stock for the plaintiffs benefit and that the facts do not support the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The referee found that the defendant told the plaintiff that he could afford to send the plaintiff to a private high school only if the plaintiff left his mother\u2019s custody and resided with the defendant. The plaintiff did so. Thus, the referee concluded that the $12,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>expenditure was part of the defendant\u2019s legal duty to support his child under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-215 and 46b-84. The referee also found that by the time the defendant had transferred the stock into his own name he had expended only a nominal amount for his son\u2019s educational needs, and had not made payments equal in value to the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In addressing a challenge to the facts found by the trial referee and adopted by the trial court, this court\u2019s function is to determine whether those findings were clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 4061. Because the resolution of conflicting factual claims falls within the province of the trial court, we can reverse the judgment only if the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Nor\u2019easter Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 468, 473, 542 A.2d 692 (1988). We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. Id. The referee\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In his second claim, the defendant alleges that, at a minimum, he is entitled to a credit for amounts spent on the plaintiff\u2019s education. The referee found, however, that the defendant did not use custodial funds for his son\u2019s benefit and that the defendant had an obligation to support his son at that time. Here again, the defendant questions the factual findings of the trial referee. It is well settled that the factfinder determines with finality the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. <em>State </em>v. <em>Speers, </em>17 Conn. App. 587, 592, 544 A.2d 769, cert. denied, 211 Conn. 808, 559 A.2d 1142, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 851, 110 S. Ct. 150, 107 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1989). Thus, we leave undisturbed the findings of fact made by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly ordered a reconveyance of the stock to the plaintiff because (1) the plaintiff did not seek injunctive relief, (2) the plaintiff did not show immediate and irrepara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ble injury, and (3) the attorney trial referee lacked jurisdiction over a matter involving injunctive relief. While the plaintiff did not seek injunctive relief, he did seek \u201csuch other relief as the court deems appropriate.\u201d The trial referee found that the defendant converted the stock that belonged to the plaintiff, and that the stock was still in the defendant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">At common law, if the converted property remained in the hands of the converter, the return of the identical property was allowed. The general rule is that the measure of damages in a conversion is the value of the goods at the date of the conversion; <em>Kuzemka </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>109 Conn. 117, 122, 146 A. 17 (1929); although this is not an exclusive determination. <em>Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., </em>193 Conn. 208, 222, 477 A.2d 988 (1984). Additionally, a wrongdoer should not be allowed to benefit from his misdeed. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>182 Conn. 193, 205, 438 A.2d 55 (1980). He should not be allowed to retain a converted item, which may have greatly increased in value, and pay a lesser amount. Under the general rule, damages totaling the value of the item at the time of conversion plus consequential damages and interest may still be less than the value of the item itself. Additionally, in the case at hand, the defendant did not raise the issue of the measure of damages specifically on appeal or in his objection to the acceptance of the attorney trial referee\u2019s report. Thus, we conclude that the order of reconveyance of the converted stock from the defendant to the plaintiff was proper under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The defendant next challenges what he maintains was the referee\u2019s finding that the parties\u2019 divorce decree required the defendant to pay for the plaintiff\u2019s college education. The defendant claims that, if the decree limited the use of the stocks to payments for postsecondary education, then, in substance, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>solution court was ordering postmajority support. He maintains that a dissolution court cannot order post-majority support without a signed, written agreement of the parties formulated prior to the dissolution orders. While he argues that he \u201cis not at this time strenuously pressing the issue of postmajority support,\u201d the defendant asks us to view it in light of the result of the trial court\u2019s ruling. He also argues that the court improperly enforced the dissolution judgment by allowing it into evidence as proof of an agreement between the parties to the dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The defendant\u2019s arguments once again must fail because of the referee\u2019s factual findings. The referee found that the defendant had not expended custodial funds for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit. Therefore, the issue of whether the meaning of the word education in the divorce decree was limited to college education never arose. The trial referee was free to accept the clear meaning of the words in the decree as the agreement of the parties, intended for the benefit of their son, the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees. We agree with this contention. The plaintiff sought relief that included monetary damages, interest, punitive damages and \u201csuch other relief as the court deems appropriate.\u201d In approving the proposed decision of the attorney trial referee, the court awarded $5300 in attorney\u2019s fees, without statutory or contractual authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Absent statutory or contractual authorization, attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable. <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 297, 472 A.2d 306 (1984). An exception to this general rule, however, is that a court may award attorney\u2019s fees as a component of punitive damages. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Industrial Park Cor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>poration, </em>211 Conn. 648, 651, 560 A.2d 968 (1989). Punitive damages may be awarded upon a showing of fraud. See <em>Markey </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>195 Conn. 76, 77, 485 A.2d 1305 (1985). In this case, however, the attorney trial referee did not find fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Fraud is not a necessary part of a conversion. Conversion occurs when one assumes and exercises the right of ownership over property belonging to another, without authorization and to the exclusion of the owner\u2019s rights. <em>Falker </em>v. <em>Samperi, </em>190 Conn. 412, 419, 461 A.2d 681 (1983). The intent required for a conversion is merely an intent to exercise dominion or control over an item even if one reasonably believes that the item is one\u2019s own. <em>Luciani </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Co., </em>15 Conn. App. 407, 411-12, 544 A.2d 1239, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 809, 548 A.2d 437 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The plaintiff argues that common law punitive damages are permissible when a plaintiff prevails in conversion, and that punitive damages may include attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff fails to recognize, however, that the attorney trial referee did not award punitive damages in this case. The court accepted the referee\u2019s report and then rendered a judgment that included attorney\u2019s fees. Because the court lacked statutory or contractual authority to award attorney\u2019s fees, however, and because there was no award of punitive damages, the court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The judgment, insofar as it allows an award of attorney\u2019s fees, is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to vacate the award of attorney\u2019s fees. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-11\"> The plaintiff brought this action in four counts alleging breach of contract, conversion, fraud and breach of a fiduciary duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-546 through 45a-556 (formerly \u00a7\u00a7 45-101 through 45-109b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
