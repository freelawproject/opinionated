On June 15, 1934, defendant gave plaintiff written notice that it had elected to cancel the lease on September 1, 1934. The request for cancellation was not acceded to by plaintiff as being effective to terminate further obligation on the part of defendant to pay rental. Each machine described in the contract, with the exception presently to be noted, remained on installation subject to the use of defendant until January 1, 1935. Upon refusal of defendant to pay the rentals alleged to have accrued according to the terms of the contract, this suit was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Two of the machines described in the contract were removed by agreement of the parties, the tabulator, about June 1, 1934, and one of the automatic key punches about September, 1935.

The total of the rentals sued for by plaintiff for the machines described in the contract is $316.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\">The principal item sued for is the rental alleged to have accrued upon the alphabetical tabulator described in the purchase order. Plaintiff alleged it was installed and placed on rental on May 1, 1934, and that rentals were paid thereon at the stipulated rate of $225.00 per month for only four months of the one year term after date of installation, and that defendant failed and refused to pay rentals accrued thereon, for the remaining months of such term (September, October, November and December of 1934 and January, February, March and April of 1935), at the rate of $225.00 per month. An itemized exhibit in evidence showis. the aggregate accruals, under plaintiff\u2019s construction of the contract, to be $1,240.00 for 1934, and $36.12 for 1935, to May 1st of that year. The total ($2,176.12), with interest, was sued for.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Defendant alleged that on or about June 15, 1934, it gave written notice to plaintiff that it desired to and did terminate and cancel all then existing contracts, <em>\u201cif any\u201d </em>as of September 1, 1934. After setting out the termination provisions of the contract it alleged that these provisions, \u201cif ever in force,\u201d covered the automatic key punch, the sorter and the alphabetical key punch described in said contract; that \u201csaid machines\u201d were installed and placed on rental under its terms of September 2, 1932, and that these machines, <em>\u201cor instruments substituted in the place thereof, </em>were used by the defendant until September 1, 1934, * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Defendant alleged as to the purchase order, among other things, that if its \u201cwords, \u2018This machine to apply on our present contract,\u2019 had or have <em>any meaning,\u201d </em>it was that \u201csaid machine should replace the tabulator removed (the one described in the contract) <em>and should be substituted therefor </em>with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>same force and effect as if * * * placed on use at the date the contract tabulator was placed on use,\u201d which date it alleged to be the date of the contract; that if any connection existed between the purchase order and the contract, which was denied, the court should apply to the order the meaning with respect to substitution just stated, and that such was the meaning intended by the parties at the time the contract was, executed. By trial amendment it alleged the termination provisions of the contract gave and were intended to give to defendant the right of termination at the end of any year during its existence, and that such right would govern all property thereafter placed with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\">After the trial had been in progress several days defendant filed what it denominates a supplemental answer in which it alleged, \u201cin addition to\u201d the matters theretofore alleged, that \u201cby the use of the word \u2018machine\u2019 the parties meant the entire property leased as one unit or battery\u201d; and that \u201cby * * * the word \u2018equipment\u2019 * * *, except where used in connection with the word \u2018additional,\u2019 <em>the parties </em>* * * <em>meant all of the property described in the contract considered as a whole or one machine.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Defendant does not allege that in the making of the contract there was any overreaching, fraud, or accident, or any mutual mistake of parties. So far as the pleadings and evidence are concerned the parties deliberately chose the words and stipulations of the contract to convey their meaning. The defendant apparently contents itself, with respect to its pleading, with allegations of what the parties \u201cmeant and intended\u201d by their words and stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The parties agreed at the outset of the trial that the machines described in the contract were first installed on the following dates respectively: Both the alphabetical key punch and sorter, on January 16, 1931; the automatic key punch, January 2, 1932; and the printing tabulator, April 15, 1931. It was agreed also that the tabulator described in the purchase order was installed on May 1, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The trial court filed findings of fact covering several pages. The first eight relate to the incorporations respectively of Remington Rand, Inc. finder the laws of Delaware, Remington Rand, Inc. under the laws, of Maryland, and the dissolution of the latter, and to transactions between themselves; and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tween themselves and Remington Rand Business Service, Inc. and plaintiff, whereby, in effect, the obligations created by the contract and purchase order sued upon became effective as between plaintiff and defendant. It found that at the time Mr. Burer signed the contract he and defendant\u2019s attorney, Mr. Curtis, discussed with O\u2019Deay as a representative of plaintiff\u2019s predecessor, some of the terms of the contract; that O\u2019Deay stated to them the words \u201cadditional equipment,\u201d as used in the contract, referred to property other than that which might thereafter \u201cbe substituted for any member of the <em>unit\u201d </em>composed of the items of equipment mentioned in the contract; and that \u201cif any substitutions, were made * * * such <em>substituted property </em>would not be additional equipment but would * * * be considered * * * as if * * * originally listed,\u201d and as if then installed; <em>and, that the property listed \u201cconstituted and would be considered as one unit, machine or battery\u201d-, </em>that the defendant so understood the contract, and \u201csuch was the intent of the said parties,\u201d and that the word \u201cmachine\u201d appearing in the contract is ambiguous, and that by its use <em>the parties meant that the entire property described \u201cconstituted one unit or battery.\u201d </em>The court concluded in this connection that the \u201cinstallation date\u201d of the machine described in the purchase order, (dated December, 1933) was September 2, 1932, and that September 2, 1932, was \u201calso the installation date of the property described in the second contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\">The court also made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">\u201cThe said property * * * constituted a unit or \u2018one machine\u2019 and that the use of all of .same together was necessary in order to obtain the effective and efficient use of said leased property, and that neither the automatic key punch, the alphabetical key punch, the sorter nor the printing tabulator could be effectively and efficiently used alone and without the use at same time of all of the other leased property; * * * that if the contract was terminated as to any part of the said machine and not as to others, that defendant would have on hand part or parts of said machine,, which could not be used; that * * * the parties intended * * * the contract, as to the listed property and/or (that) substituted therefor, should be terminated at the same date (and) that <em>any other construction of said contract toould be injurious, harsh and unreasonable.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">There are other findings concerning a contract of date December 15, 1930, (referred to as the first contract) between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>plaintiff and Remington Rand Business Service, Inc., with terms identical with those of the contract sued on (but with an immaterial difference in machine and monthly listing), which are made the basis of a conclusion that the \u201cinstallation date\u201d of the machine described in the purchase order, and the \u201cinstallation date\u201d of the equipment described in the contract of September 2, 1932, (denominated in the findings as the second contract) are the same. They need not be further noticed, however, as they were erroneously made contrary to the agreement of the parties theretofore made as to the respective dates of installation above referred to, which are all subsequent to the date of the first contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">The trial court rendered judgment that plaintiff take nothing. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the judgment. 122 S. -W. (2d) 728. The writ was granted \u201con all assignments of error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The foregoing findings and conclusions, among others not necessary to state, form the basis of the trial court\u2019s judgment, and reflect the construction by the courts below of the contract and purchase order sued upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The trial court predicated its conclusions largely upon the parol testimony of Mr. Burer, who, it will be observed, signed the contract for defendant. He was permitted to testify, over the plaintiff\u2019s objections, that at the time the contract sued on was executed he negotiated with Mr. O\u2019Deay (O\u2019Deay, it will be observed, signed the conract as a witness) ; that he \u201cfirst refused to sign a new contract, but Mr. O\u2019Deay insisted that because we were making some terrific changes his company was after him to get a new contract, * * *\u201d; that in his discussion with O\u2019Deay <em>\u201cit turn definitely understood that all rental dates on the equipment </em>that we then had * * * would begin anew at that time, and all this back stuff was washed out\u201d; also that O\u2019Deay stated the words \u201cadditional equipment\u201d referred to property other than that which might be thereafter \u201csubstituted\u201d for that described in the contract; that Mr. Curtis, O\u2019Deay and he were in the office a short time \u201cwhen this thing (the contract) was signed and Mr. Curtis gave his opinion that we were leasing a group of of equipment, certain machines to do certain work\u201d; that if any other machine was substituted for the equipment we had, \u201cit would still be under contract, but if we would * * * get another machine from Remington Rand, * * * that would be additional equipment, and that that ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ditional equipment would <em>go </em>under the terms of the contract; we would have to keep it for the term specified, but if we substituted any equipment, it would be a different matter, as part of a battery of machines, one of which could not work without the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\">Testimony of Mr. Burer of conversations with O\u2019Deay concerning the execution of the purchase order, also admitted over plaintiff\u2019s objection, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">\u201cQ. Do you have anything referring to this order, which is called No. 572? Was there any specific discussion between you and any representative of the plaintiff in this case, in reference to the meaning of the word <em>\u2018apply'm used in that contract ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\"><em>\u201cA: </em>Yes, sir, there was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201cQ: Who was it with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">\u201cA: Mr. O\u2019Deay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">\u201cQ: Will you please state what this discussion was, and at the same time state the matters that led up to the execution of this order No. 572 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">\u201cA: Mr. O\u2019Deay requested this, order, that he might have something to send to <em>his so-called </em>superiors'. At that time I asked Mr. O\u2019Deay the direct question, I said: <em>\u2018does taking this machine tie us up on a twelve months contract ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">\u201cQ: What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">\u201cA: He said <em>\u2018it does not; it is- a substitution.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-12\">the court: It is what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-13\">\u201cA: It is a substitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-14\">\u201cQ: (by Mr. Peareson) : A substitution for what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-15\">\u201cA: For the other tabulator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-16\">\u201cQ: Which tabulator was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-17\">\u201cA: The tabulator that was previously in use, the one covered by the September 2nd contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-18\">\u201cQ. The one that was in use at the time that contract was executed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-19\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-20\">The respective contentions of the parties are stated in the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals, to which reference is here directed. It states also what is considered to be the basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>gf-\u2019</em>idea underlying the trial court\u2019s findings, and concludes that the \u201cmain and practically the only question to be determined * * * is the <em>termination date </em>of the lease,\u201d as to the <em>\u201cvarious articles </em>enumerated in the contract * * *, and the * * * tabulator referred to in the purchase order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">We cannot agree either with the construction of the contract evidenced by the trial court\u2019s findings, or with the statement of the law, or its application, by the Court of Civil Appeals in approving such construction. Nor can we agree with the statement of what constitutes the main question to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The lease contract sued upon provides that defendant rented \u201cthe equipment * * * specified, <em>wpon the terms and conditions </em>* * * <em>set forth\u201d </em>in the contract. Five machines are described as the equipment leased. It is stipulated that the equipment may \u201cbe removed by the lessor * * * at any time <em>after the termination of the contract as therein set forth. </em>The contract specified that \u201crental on each machine installed is to be paid monthly <em>for a minimum period of twelve months </em>* * It stipulates how the lease may be cancelled. The termination provisions are unambiguous. They are clear to the effect that after the lease has continued in force for one year \u201cwith respect to <em>each machine installed </em>cancellation may be had upon thirty days\u2019 written notice \u201cby either party to the other before the expiration of eleven (11) months after the date <em>each such machine is placed on rental.\u201d </em>It is clearly stipulated also that if, at the expiration of the period mentioned, a cancellation notice has not been served \u201cthis contrace becomes a continuous automatic yearly renewal contract\u201d; and further in connection with this provision that <em>\u201crental on each machine covered by this contract\u201d </em>is to be paid monthly for a <em>\u201cminimum renewal period of twelve (12) months, </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">It is pointed out in connection with the stipulations as to* the period of continuation of the lease with respect to \u201ceach machine installed,\u201d and with respect to- when each is <em>\u201cplaced on rental,\u201d </em>that rental upon each machine <em>\u201cshall accrue from the date of the completion of installation.\u201d </em>In other words the lease continues in force as to each machine described therein from the date it is \u201cplaced on rental,\u201d which date is identical with its installation date.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The \u201ctermination\u201d provisions of the contract do not provide, as held by the Court of Civil Appeals, for cancellation on the basis of <em>one </em>\u201ctermination date of the lease\u201d as to the \u201cvarious articles enumerated in the contract.\u201d On the other hand, the contract is so conditioned with respect to cancellation as to forbid its termination by the lessee on such basis. The \u201cvarious articles\u201d referred to are the machines described in the contract, which carry their varying dates of installation. We find no basis for the holding that the contract provides for cancellation on the basis of <em>the same termination, or same installation, date, </em>for all of the machines. Such a finding is at variance with the provisions of the lease, and with the agreement of the parties as to' the respective dates of installation. The findings as to \u201csubstitution,\u201d as to the property intended to be embraced in the word \u201cmachine\u201d and as to the meaning of \u201cadditional equipment,\u201d are at variance with the provisions of the contract and purchase order.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\">The trial court made the above findings and conclusions upon the view the contract is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Even if ambiguous (which it is, not as to any of its provisions applicable to facts upon which the parties have not agreed by stipulation), the testimony of Mr. Burer was not admissible to either vary its meaning or show that the language was employed \u201cin a sense different from its ordinary meaning.\u201d Morrison v. Hazzard, 99 Texas 583, 92 S. W. 33. Such evidence is admissible to \u201cexplain an ambiguity\u201d when it is; \u201cconsistent with the writing,\u201d but not to vary its terms. Higginbotham Cattle Co. v. Whaley &amp; Lewis (Com. App.), 41 S. W. (2d) 34; Distributors Investment Co. v. Patton (Com. App.), 130 Texas 449, 110 S. W. (2d) 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The trial, court concluded further that \u201ceven though the contract be held not ambiguous,\u201d its meaning was nevertheless in accordance with the findings made.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The Court of Civil Appeals states that oral testimony \u201cis not generally admissible to contradict or vary the terms\u201d of an unambiguous contract, but that there is, also a rule \u201cperfectly consistent\u201d with the rule referred to, that written instruments, <em>whether ambiguous or not, </em>are to be interpreted according to their subject matter, and that oral testimony is admissible for the purpose of applying the contract to the subject matter, and that in, case of <em>\u201cambiguity then appearing,\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the language may read in the light of the environment in order to establish the facts under which the agreement was made; and applied the rule as stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\">1 We cannot agree that parol evidence is admissible to determine whether a writing, clear in terms, may become ambiguous, and that <em>in the event ambiguity appears, evidence of surrounding circumstance may be offered to show the intention of the parties. </em>The rule as applied by this Court is as follows, as-stated in the recent case of Lewis et al v. East Texas Finance Company, 136 Texas 149, 146 S. W. (2d) 977, 9 TSCR 146:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\">\u201cIf a written contract is so worded that it can be given a certain or definite legal meaning or interpretation, <em>it is not ambiguous. It follows that parol evidence is not admissible to render a contract ambiguous, </em>which, on its face, is capable of being given a definite certain legal meaning. This rule obtains even to the extent of <em>prohibiting proof of circumstances surrounding the transaction </em>when the instrument involved, by its terms, plainly and clearly discloses the intention of the parties, or is so worded that it is not fairly susceptible of more than one legal meaning or construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The opinion in the recent case of Anderson &amp; Kerr Drilling Co. v. Bruhlmeyer (Com. App.), 134 Texas. 574, 136 S. W. (2d) 800, 127 A. L. R. 1217, is cited in the Lewis case and states the rule as applied by this Court. It recognizes, as does the case quoted from, that when an instrument does not by its terms plainly disclose the intention of the parties, it may be ascertained, \u201cnot solely from the words of the instrument, but from its language when read in the light of the circumstances surrounding the transaction\u201d; and cites some of the cases relied upon by the Court of Civil Appeals in the present cases in support of the rule applied by it, notably Colquitt v. Eureka Producing Co. (Com. App.), 63 S. W. (2d) 1018 and Gulf Production Co. v. Spear, 125 Texas 530, 80 S. W. (2d) 452. These cases are in harmony with Lewis v. Finance Co. and the Bruhlmeyer case, but do not support the rule as stated and applied by the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">It is. unnecessary to discuss the other cases cited in the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals, some of which contain statements not in harmony with the above quoted rule, further than to say such statements are inapt. It may be noted in this connection that the express!,ons of the parties simul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>taneous with the making of the contract are never treated as \u201csurrounding circumstances.\u201d Wigmore on Evidence, Sec. 2471. To so treat them would be to remove the protection inherent in written instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\">To construe the purchase order as not ordering \u201cadditional equipment\u201d pursuant to the provision of the contract that \"additional equipment will be * * * leased\u201d under its <em>terms </em>and <em>conditions </em>at rental rates \u201cin effect at the time the order * * * is received,\u201d is to' give it a meaning inconsistent, to say the least, with the language of the two instruments. There is no language in either subject to the construction adopted by the courts below, that the \u201cmachine\u201d described in the order was, as stated in the trial court\u2019s findings, \u201cto be substituted for and become a part of the original machine.\u201d The \u201cmachine\u201d ordered' was \u201cadditional equipment\u201d and, under the language of the order (written by Mr. Surer) considered with that of the contract, was an additional machine, and was to be applied as such \u201con our present contract.\u201d If such is not the obvious meaning of the language in question it is certainly a meaning consistent with the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">2 We find no basis upon which to consider whether the terms of the contract are inequitable. They were agreed upon by the parties and defendant makes no claim either that it was lacking in business acumen or was imposed upon. No-ground for reformation is presented. The machines described in the contract constituted defendant\u2019s bookkeeping equipment, and it rested with defendant to determine whether it would have its bookkeeping done by machines under the supervision of an operator, or by personal bookkeepers and accountants.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Eliminating the facts erroneously considered we find none upon which judgment could be correctly rendered for defendant, and the Court of Civil Appeals erred in affirming a judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Assignments properly complaining of this error upon the grounds \u00a1discussed herein:, and complaining ithjat judgment should have been rendered by the trial court in favor of plaintiff, are before us. in its application for the writ. The writ was granted upon all assignments, but we have found it necessary to pass upon only those raising the questions discussed, which are determinative of the case. These assignments are sustained. The judgments of the courts below are reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and judgment is here rendered for plaintiff for $2,176.12, with interest upon $1,240.00 of such amount from January 1, 1935, to the date of the judgment, and upon $936.12 of the amount from May 31, 1933, to such date, at the rate of 6% per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\">Opinion adopted by the Supreme Court June 25, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Rehearing overruled July 23, 1941.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
