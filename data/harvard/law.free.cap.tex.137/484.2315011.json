The only material question to be determined is whether or not, under the contract beteen the parties, there was an implied covenant to so develop the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In 1919, G. N. Powell and wife sold a section of land including the land in question to one Eldridge, and reserved and retained an undivided 7/8th interest in and to the minerals, oil, etc., under the land, with the understanding that l/8th of such minerals, including the oil and gas, when mined should be delivered to Eldridge free of cost. On July 24, 1929, Powell and wife executed and delivered to Danciger Oil &amp; Refining Company an assignment of their 7/8th interest in the minerals in two quarter sections of said land. Said assignment recited the fact that the land had previously been sold to Eldridge and the conditions of such sale. The remainder of the assignment was as follows;</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u201cwhereas, the said G. N. Powell and wife, Sarah Powell, are now the owners of the mineral interest reversed in said deed as aforesaid, and they have now sold to the Danciger Oil <em>&amp; </em>Refining Company of Texas, a corporation, the undivided seven-eighths (7/8) interest in the oil, gas and casinghead gas reserved and retained in said deed, with the reservations hereinafter made, insofar as the same are in and under the following described two tracts of land situated in Gray County, Texas, to-wit: (Description of land) ; the said G.

(2d) 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">1, 2 In the outset it should be noted that when parties reduce their agreements to writing, the written instrument is presumed to embody their entire contract, and the court should not read into the instrument additional provisions unless this be necessary in order to effectuate the intention of the parties as disclosed by the contract as a whole. An implied covenant must rest entirely on the presumed intention of the parties as gathered from the terms as actually expressed in the written instrument itself, and it must appear that it was so clearly within the contemplation of the parties that they deemed it unnecessary to express it, and therefore omitted to do so, or it must appear that it is necessary to infer such a covenant in order to effectuate the full purpose of the contract as a whole as gathered from the written instrument. It is not enough to say that an implied covenant is necessary in order to make the contract fair, or that without such a covenant it would be improvident or unwise, or that the contract would operate unjustly. It must arise from the presumed intention of the parties as gathered from the instrument as a whole. 21 C. J. S. 888; 13 C. J. 558; 15 C. J. 1214; 14 Amer. Jur. 490; Freeport Sulphur Co. v. American Sulphur Royalty Co., 117 Texas 439, 6 S. W. (2d) 1039; Grass v. Big Creek Development Co. 75 W. Va. 719, 84 S. E. 750, L. R. A. 1915E, 1057. However, covenants will be implied in fact when necessary to give effect to the actual intention of the parties as reflected by the contract or conveyance as constructed in its entirety in the light of the circumstances under which it was made and the purposes Sought to be accomplished thereby. See Property Interest Created by Lease, by A. W. Walker, Jr., Professor of Law, University of Texas, 11 Texas Law Review 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">There are numerous authorities in Texas which recognize the doctrine of an implied covenant in the usual gas and oil mining lease for the reasonable development of the property after the discovery of oil or gas in paying quantities. W. T. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Waggoner Est. v. Sigler Oil Co., 118 Texas 509, 19 S. W. (2d) 27, and cases cited; Grubb v. McAfee, 109 Texas, 527, 212 S. W. 464; Munsey v. Marnet Oil &amp; Gas Co., 113 Texas 212, 254 S. W. 311; Kentucky Rock Asphalt Co. v. Milliner, 234 Ky. 217, 27 S. W. (2d) 937; Merrill on Implied Covenants, p. 122; Summers on Oil &amp; Gas, Vol. 2, p. 333, sec. 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">3 In recognition of the distinction between a lease and a conveyance of the minerals, some authorities seem to hold that if the instrument is a lease there is an implied covenant for reasonable development after the discovery of oil, but if the instrument is a conveyance of the minerals there is no such \u2022implied- covenant. Adams v. Elkhorn Coal Corp., 199 Ky. 612, 251 S. W. 654; Looms v. Gulf Oil Corp. (Civ. App.), 123 S. W. (2d) 501; Carpenter v. Smith (Com. App.), 272 S. W. 128, Grain v. Pure Oil Co., 25 Fed. (2d) 824; Feather v. Baird, 85 W. Va. 267, 102 S. E. 294; Prof. Walker on Express Clauses Affecting Implied obligations, 13 Miss. Law Journal 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">4 However, we are of the opinion that there can be such an implied covenant to develop the property even though the instrument be a conveyance of the minerals and not a lease. This Court so held in the Freeport Sulphur Company v. American Sulphur Royalty Company case, supra. It must be recognized, however, that there is much stronger reason for favoring an implied covenant to develop under an ordinary gas and oil mining lease than there is in a conveyance of the minerals with a reservation of a fractional part thereof. Among these are the fact that a lease is usually for only a limited time, with provision for termination thereafter upon a cessation of production; whereas, a conveyance is unlimited as to time. But the most essential difference is the fact that the predominating purpose of a lease is to secure the exploitation and development of the property for the purposes set out in the lease. Often the consideration paid to the lessor as a down payment is very small, and it is evident that the main purpose is granting the lease is the lessor\u2019s desire to have his land promptly explored, and thoroughly and diligently developed, with the hopes of receiving more handsome returns in royalties. W. T. Waggoner Est. v. Sigler Oil Co., supra; Munsey v. Marnet Oil &amp; Gas Co., supra; Kentucky Rock Asphalt Co. v. Milliner, supra; Mills v. Hartz, 77 Kans. 218, 94 Pac. 142; Mansfield Gas Co. v. Alexander, 97 Ark. 167, 133 S. W. 837; Merrill on Covenants Implied in Oil and Gas Leases, pp. 40, 128, 279. On the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>hand, conveyances of minerals are frequently actuated by a motive of investment on the part of the grantee and the cash consideration or other down payment is the moving cause for the conveyance by the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\">5 A careful consideration of the instrument here under consideration discloses that it is a conveyance of the minerals, and is not a lease. By its terms the grantors for a substantial cash consideration did unconditionally \u201cgrant, sell and convey\u201d the minerals to the grantee for an unlimited period of time. It was therefore a conveyance of the minerals. Lindsay v. Texas Iron 6 Steel Co., 9 S. W. (2d) 287; Carpenter v. Smith, 272 S. W. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">There is nothing in the instrument to indicate that its dominant purpose was to obtain an exploitation or development of the property for oil and gas mining purposes. There was a substantial consideration, $50,000.00, paid as a down payment. Fifty Thousand Dollars additional was to be paid in oil in monthly installments, but care was exercised to see that these payments were to be made regardless of whether the production from the land was or was not sufficient to meet the payments. Specific provision was made for the drilling of offset wells to prevent drainage, but no provision was made for the drilling of any wells at any time for any other purpose whatever. Grantee was given the \u201cright <em>at any time </em>to prospect for and develop such oil, gas and casinghead gas,\u201d but the conveyance is absolutely silent as to' any provision <em>requiring, </em>grantee at any time to either explore the land for the discovery of oil or gas, or to develop it in any manner after the discovery thereof. The conveyance was unlimited as to time, with no provision for forfeiture or reverter for lack of exploitation or development. Furthermore, we call attention to the fact that the conveyance in question provided that the grantees should have title to such minerals \u201cwith such reasonable use of the surface ground as may be necessary to win, work, and carry away such oil, gas and. casinghead gas, and <em>with the right at any time </em>to prospect for and develop such oil, gas, and casinghead gas, <em>subject only to the limitations and covenants hereinafter set forth.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Italics ours.) In view of the facts heretofore recited, we think that this provision has great weight in evidencing an intention to exclude every covenant except those expressly set forth. From these circumstances, it can hardly be said that it was so clearly within the con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>temptation of the parties that there should be development .\"of the property that such parties deemed it unnecessary to so provide therefor in the contract. The only circumstance whatever in favor of an implied covenant to develop is the fact that the grantor retained an overriding l/8th interest in the minerals, to be delivered to him, free of cost, when mined. We are of the opinion that this provision standing alone, unaided by any other circumstance, is. under the circumstances in this case not sufficient to justify the reading into the written contract of an additional provision binding the grantee to make speedy development of the property in the event of the discovery of oil or gas in paying quantities. We are of the opinion that there was no implied covenant to develop the property for oil and gas mining purposes. Hence, plaintiffs were not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Opinion delivered July 23, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Rehearing overruled October 15, 1941.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
