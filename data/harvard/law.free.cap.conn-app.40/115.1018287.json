Przybysz from a judgment of strict foreclosure, the granting of a motion for deficiency judgment and the attendant valuation of the subject real property. The defendant alleges that the trial court improperly (1) retracted its order to reset the law day, (2) denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>for deficiency judgment, and (3) admitted the testimony of the plaintiffs appraiser. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The following facts are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. On or about December 29, 1989, the defendants Phillip B. Kneller and Przybysz executed a promissory note in the amount of $205,000 in favor of the plaintiff. The note was secured by an open-end mortgage on premises at 222-224 Pearl Street, Middle-town. Kneller and Przybysz defaulted on the note, and, as a result, the plaintiff instituted this foreclosure action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">On October 5,1992, the trial court rendered judgment of strict foreclosure in the plaintiffs favor and set a law day of October 28, 1992. On October 27, 1992, the defendant filed motions to open the judgment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to enjoin the passing of the October 28, 1992 law day and to present evidence. The October 28,1992, law day passed without the trial court\u2019s hearing or acting on the defendant\u2019s motions and, without the defendant\u2019s redeeming his interest in the subject property. Thereafter, on November 2, 1992, the plaintiff filed a motion for deficiency judgment dated October 30, 1992, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>On November 9, 1992, the trial court, <em>Higgins, J., </em>conducted a hearing regarding the defendant\u2019s motions. The plaintiff objected to both the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment and his motion to enjoin the law day. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure and his motion to enjoin the October 28, 1992 law date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Higgins then reset the law day to December 9,1992, by ordering, \u201cDecember 9th, owners of the equity, subsequent days, junior encumbrancers, inverse order of priority.\u201d The defendant did not redeem on or before the December 9, 1992 law day.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">On January 11, 1993, the plaintiff filed a certificate of foreclosure in the Middletown land records certifying that title to the subject property had vested in the plaintiff on December 10,1992. On that same day, the plaintiff attempted to file a motion for deficiency judgment dated January 6, 1993. The clerk\u2019s office date stamped the motion January 11, 1993, but later crossed out the date stamp and returned the motion to the plaintiff for the lack of an order and certification sheet. The plaintiff subsequently refiled the motion with the required order and certification sheet. The clerk\u2019s office date stamped the plaintiffs motion for deficiency judgment as being filed on January 14, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">On or about March 5, 1993, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a motion to impose fees and costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and an objection to the January 14, 1993 motion for deficiency judgment alleging untimely filing, pursuant to the thirty day limitation stated in \u00a7 49-14. On March 10, 1993, the plaintiff sought to reclaim its motion for deficiency judgment dated October 30, 1992, for the short calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on March 22,1993. On that same day, the defendant filed an objection to the plaintiffs reclaim of its motion for deficiency judgment dated October 30, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In a memorandum of decision on objections to motions for deficiency judgment dated July 9, 1993, the trial court, <em>Higgins, J., </em>overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to the plaintiffs motion to reclaim its motion for deficiency judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision held that it had \u201cerred in hearing the defendant\u2019s motion to reopen judgment on November 9, 1992, and in resetting the law day for December 9,1992.\u201d The trial court also concluded that \u201cit had no authority to reset the law day to December 9, 1992, the operative law day for the purposes of this foreclosure action was October 28, 1992.\u201d The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs October 30, 1992 motion for deficiency judgment was timely filed and could be reclaimed. On October 29, 1993, the plaintiff filed an amended certificate of foreclosure on the Middletown land records to correct the date on which title vested in the plaintiff to correspond to Judge Higgins\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Subsequently, on May 10, 1994, the trial court, <em>R. O\u2019Connell, </em>J., conducted a full evidentiary hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the plaintiffs October 30, 1992 motion for deficiency judgment. The trial court issued a written memorandum of decision, dated September 16, 1994, granting a deficiency judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The trial court determined that title had vested in the plaintiff on October 29, 1992, that the value of the subject property on that date was $180,000, and that the mortgage debt on that date was $235,990.13. The trial court then rendered a deficiency judgment against the defendant in the amount of $60,990.13, plus interest from October 29, 1993. Further, the trial court awarded the plaintiff additional attorney\u2019s fees of $5000. The defendant appealed from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly retracted its order to reset the law day. The defendant argues that the trial court extended and reset the law day in accordance with the consent and agreement of the parties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The defendant maintains that the transcript from the November 9, 1992 hearing clearly demonstrates that both parties knew that the original law day had passed and mutually agreed to extend and reset the law day. The defendant stresses that despite the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to open the judgment and to enjoin the law day, that court left all aspects of the judgment of strict foreclosure intact, and merely extended and reset the law day in accordance with the express consent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The defendant acknowledges that because the trial court did not disturb any aspect of its judgment of strict foreclosure, any question of error is limited to the extension and resetting of the law day. Moreover, the defendant concedes that if General Statutes \u00a7 49-15<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is strictly construed, an opening of the judgment under these circumstances would be deemed improper. The defendant correctly argues, however, that the courts of this state have long held that the otherwise erroneous opening of a judgment of strict foreclosure, after the time fixed by statute, is an error that may be waived. See <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Sabo, </em>115 Conn. 619, 622-23, 162 A. 844 (1932). Consequently, the defendant reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the consent of the parties to the resetting of the law day, constituted a waiver by the parties of any error the court may have committed in resetting the law day, thereby giving legal effect to the trial court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The defendant insists that the plaintiffs acceptance of the trial court\u2019s order, as well as the plaintiffs subsequent conduct, are convincing proof that the parties acquiesced in the resetting of the law day, thereby effecting a waiver by the parties of the provisions of \u00a7 49-15. The specific behavior exhibited by the plaintiff on which the defendant relies to substantiate his claim that the plaintiff waived the provisions of \u00a7 49-15, is the plaintiffs lack of subsequent objection to the resetting of the law day, the plaintiffs filing of the certificate of foreclosure, which certified the vesting of title as of December 10, 1992, and the plaintiffs second filing of a motion for deficiency judgment on January 14, 1993. The defendant argues that all of these facts demonstrate that the plaintiff placed no reliance on the October 28, 1992 law day, accepted the December 9, 1992 law day as the only true law day for purposes of this suit and conducted itself accordingly, fully embracing the court\u2019s action in resetting the law day and waiving the provisions of \u00a7 49-15. We find the defendant\u2019s reliance on the theory of consent and waiver by the parties to the provisions of \u00a7 49-15 unpersuasive and without basis in Connecticut law.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The dispositive controversy in this case is whether the defendant\u2019s motion to open precipitated an automatic stay that tolled the running of the law days. It is a well settled principle of law in this state \u201cthat the mere filing of a motion to reopen the judgment does not result in an automatic stay. \u201d <em>Brooklyn Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Frimberger, </em>29 Conn. App. 628, 631, 617 A.2d 462 (1992); <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>216 Conn. 341, 349, 579 A.2d 1054 (1990); see Practice Book \u00a7 4046.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Our Supreme Court examined the effect of timely filing a motion to open after a judgment of strict foreclosure has been rendered in <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 341. The court noted that the trial court in that case had relied on a legal principle from a leading Connecticut treatise, D. Caron, Connecticut Foreclosures (2d Ed. 1989) \u00a7 9.01C, which stated, \u201c[a] critical factor to be recognized in connection with a motion to reopen a judgment of strict foreclosure is that the motion must be heard, and not merely filed, prior to the vesting of title.\u201d The Supreme Court qualified this legal proposition by adding that \u201c[t]his observation would be correct if limited to a motion made after the expiration of the time to appeal from the initial foreclosure judgment, because no automatic stay would result from its filing.\u201d <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In <em>Sullivan, </em>the Supreme Court held that a motion to open had been filed within the time for appeal from the judgment of strict foreclosure, thereby effecting an automatic stay and nullifying the original law day. In this case, however, the facts are dissimilar- from those in <em>Sullivan. </em>Here, the trial court rendered judgment of strict foreclosure on October 5, 1992. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4009,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendant had twenty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>in which to file an appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment of strict foreclosure. The defendant allowed the twenty day appeal period to expire without filing an appeal. After the appeal period had expired, the defendant then filed a motion to open the judgment, but failed to secure a hearing date before the law date passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">When a motion to open a judgment of strict foreclosure has not been filed within the time limited to appeal, no stay will come into effect. In this situation, or where the automatic stay pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4046<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> has been terminated, a law day may pass and if the defendant fails to redeem, the equity of redemption is extinguished and title to the property vests absolutely in the plaintiff, whether a hearing on a motion to open is pending. <em>Brooklyn Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Frimberger, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 631-32; <em>Barclays Bank of New York </em>v. <em>Ivler, </em>20 Conn. App. 163, 167, 565 A.2d 252, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 809, 568 A.2d 792 (1989). In this case, the defendant did not file his motion to open until after the expiration of the time to appeal from the initial foreclosure judgment. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s motion to open, filed subsequent to the appeal period, did not produce a stay; nor did a stay result from the defendant\u2019s filing of a motion to enjoin the effect of the law day. Because the trial court did not hear either of these motions prior to the October 28, 1992 law day, title to the property vested absolutely in the plaintiff on October 29, 1992, pursuant to \u00a7 49-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The order of the trial court, setting a new law day after the prior law day had passed without being stayed, was void ab initio and subject to both direct and collateral attack. <em>Broaca </em>v. <em>Broaca, </em>181 Conn. 463, 467, 435 A.2d 1016 (1980); <em>Jensen </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>158 Conn. 251, 260, 259 A.2d 598 (1969). \u201cIt is an acknowledged principle of . . . every court in the world, that not only the decisions, but eveiy thing done under the judicial process of courts, not having jurisdiction, are, ipso facto, void.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Broaca </em>v. <em>Broaca, </em>supra, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">We conclude that on October 29, 1992, the outstanding right of redemption by the defendant had been foreclosed and title became absolute in the plaintiff. Therefore, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to reset the law days.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We turn now to the defendant\u2019s contention that by mutual assent, the parties waived the provisions of \u00a7 49-15. An examination of this court\u2019s discussion of the issue of waiver in <em>Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tarro, </em>37 Conn. App. 56, 654 A.2d 1238 (1995), serves to dispel the defendant\u2019s misguided understanding of the requirements of a waiver by the parties. In that case, this court reiterated the well established standards for waiver in Connecticut, stating, \u201cwaiver involves the intentional relinquishment of a known right. . . . <em>There cannot be a finding of waiver unless the party has both knowledge of the existence of the right and intention to relinquish it. . . . </em>Moreover, a party claiming waiver has the burden of proving it.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In <em>Tarro, </em>this court held that the trial court had improperly concluded that the defendant\u2019s filing of subsequent pleadings constituted a waiver: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s filing of pleadings after the judgment of dismissal did not waive the four-month period of [General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>utes] \u00a7 52-212a. Any subsequent pleadings by the defendant could not logically have constituted a waiver. Rather, those pleadings <em>were no more than a necessary attempt to defend his interests in this litigation. </em>The defendant had no choice but to file requisite pleadings and motions after the . . . opening of the judgment. At that time, the court\u2019s decision became the law of the case.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In applying the legal principles of <em>Tarro </em>to the facts of this case, we conclude that the plaintiff did not waive the statutory provisions of \u00a7 49-15. Through its counsel, the plaintiff objected to the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure and the defendant\u2019s motion to enjoin the passing of the law day, and the trial court denied these motions. After denying the defendant\u2019s motions, the trial court then improperly reset the law day. The plaintiffs attorney\u2019s acquiescence to the trial court\u2019s action \u201chardly constitutes the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege, which is the cornerstone of a claim of waiver. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>201 Conn. 598, 603, 519 A.2d 9 (1986), citing <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938).\u201d <em>Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tarro, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 61. This court is in accord with the plaintiffs contention that subsequent documents filed in court or recorded on the land records by the plaintiff did not constitute a waiver of any right, and were no more than a necessary attempt to defend the plaintiffs interests in the litigation because on July 9, 1993, the revised, but incorrect, law date was a part of the law of the case. It would be unfair to penalize the plaintiff for conforming its behavior to the court\u2019s order. Under all of the circumstances, including the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment and motion to enjoin, as well as the plaintiffs submission to the trial court\u2019s ruling, we conclude that the plaintiff did not waive the provisions of \u00a7 49-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss the plaintiffs motion for a deficiency judgment as untimely. The defendant argues that the operative law day was reset to December 9,1992, and therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 49-14,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the plaintiff had thirty days, commencing on December 10, 1992, and expiring on January 8, 1993, to file a motion for deficiency judgment. Since the defendant did not file his second motion for deficiency judgment until January 14, 1993, the defendant maintains that the plaintiff did not file a motion for a deficiency judgment within the period specified by \u00a7 49-14, and, hence, the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss the plaintiffs motion for deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">As we have fully discussed in part I of this opinion, the trial court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure on October 5, 1992, and set a law date of October 28, 1992. On October 29,1992, due to the defendant\u2019s failure to redeem his interest in the subject property, coupled with his inability to stay the running of the law day, the plaintiff became the unconditional owner of the equity in the subject property. We conclude that the plaintiffs October 30, 1992 motion for deficiency judgment, dated November 2, 1992, was proper and timely filed pursuant to \u00a7 49-14 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted the testimony of the plaintiffs appraiser. Resolution of this issue requires recitation of the following additional facts.</p>\n<p id=\"AnK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>At the May 10,1994 hearing on the plaintiffs October 30, 1992 motion for deficiency judgment, the plaintiff offered the testimony of Charles Burr, a licensed, certified real estate appraiser, to establish the value of the subject property. Burr testified that he had been requested by the plaintiff to appraise the value of the subject property as of October 10,1991, and, in conjunction with said appraisal, Burr prepared a full written report as of that date. Burr further testified that he had updated the October 10, 1991 report on or about September 26, 1992 in accordance with the plaintiffs request. Burr valued the property on October 29, 1992, at $160,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The defendant objected to the admission of Burr\u2019s testimony on the bases of alleged noncompliance with Connecticut regulations with respect to real estate appraisals and certain alleged inconsistencies in Burr\u2019s appraisal report. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">To refute Burr\u2019s testimony and to establish a higher value, the defendant offered the testimony of three witnesses. William Pinto, coordinator with the state department of children and families, testified as to a proposal pending in December, 1992, between the department and the defendant to show the property\u2019s then market rental value.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The defendant\u2019s second witness was Richard H. Barry, a general appraiser of residential commercial property, licensed and certified by the state. Barry testified that he had been hired by the defendant to appraise the property as of December 10, 1992. Barry stated that as on December 10, 1992, he valued the property at $230,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The defendant himself took the stand as the third witness and testified concerning his efforts to rent the property during the period of July through December, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>1992. The defendant further testified as to the actual rent derived from the property based upon his ownership of the property and his experience in managing the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The defendant alleges that the testimony of Burr was improper for the following reasons: (1) Burr did not make a separate and distinct certification on his September 26, 1992 addendum report as required by \u00a7 20-328-29 (a) (11) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies; (2) Burr applied the use of a gross rent multiplier in his September, 1992 report, but did not use a gross rent multiplier in his October, 1991 report; (3) Burr was unable to recall and articulate various stages and processes undertaken in the appraisal in contravention of \u00a7 20-328-30 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies; (4) Burr violated \u00a7 20-328-31 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies in that he calculated the value of the property using the income approach but was not able to explain the adjustments made to the square footage of the comparables used in his September, 1992 report;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (5) Burr could not testify as to the value of the property on the date of the vesting of title, October 29, 1992, and was qualified to testify only as to the value of the property on September 26, 1992, the date of his most recent report. For all of these reasons, the defendant maintains that the trial court should have excluded Burr\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In <em>Eichman </em>v. <em>J &amp; J Building Co., </em>216 Conn. 443, 451-52, 582 A.2d 182 (1990), our Supreme Court held that in a deficiency judgment proceeding, \u201c[t]he determination of [a property\u2019s] value by a couit is the expression of the court\u2019s opinion aided ordinarily by the opinions of expert witnesses, and reached by weighing those opinions in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing upon value and its own general knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>edge of the elements going to establish it. <em>Appeal of Cohen, </em>117 Conn. 75, 85, 166 Atl. 747 [1933]. <em>Lomas &amp; Nettleton Co. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>122 Conn. 228, 233, 188 A. 433 (1936). <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>196 Conn. 172, 183, 491 A.2d 1084, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 920, 106 S.

The trial court determined the value of the subject property to be $180,000, a figure not asserted by either of the parties. Thus, the valuation of the property by the trial court appears to be an independent determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\u201cIn determining valuation pursuant to \u00a7 49-14, the trier, as in other areas of the law, is \u2018not bound by the opinion of the expert witnesses . . . .\u2019 <em>Birgel </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>163 Conn. 23, 30, 301 A.2d 249 (1972). . . . \u2018The evaluation of testimony is the sole province of the trier of fact.

We will disturb the trial court\u2019s determination of valuation, therefore, only when it appears on the record before us that the court \u2018misapplied or overlooked, or gave a wrong or improper effect to, any test or consideration which it was [its] duty to regard.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>West Haven Sound Development, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 69-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">After a thorough review of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, as well as the evidence presented at trial, we conclude that the trial court did not improperly admit the testimony of Burr. The trial court was entitled to admit the evidence of Burr and to weigh that evidence along with all of the other evidence presented. Given that the trial court did not select the property valuation submitted by either party, it appears that the trial court accepted and rejected portions of each appraiser\u2019s testimony in an effort to reach a compromise between the conflicting evidence presented. The defendant did not present any evidence to indicate that the trial court relied solely on the testimony of Burr in calculating the value of the property. Under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s determination clearly appears to have been an effort to give due regard and appropriate weight to all of the evidence presented and, therefore, was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In addition to the testimony of the appraisers, the trial court also had before it photographs of the property, photographs of the comparable properties and the testimony of the defendant stating that he had been able to rent only one out of four units in a four month period. The trial court could have considered all of this evidence in reaching its decision. Although it is true, as the defendant emphasizes, that a litigant \u201cis presently entitled to raise on appeal the issue of whether the valuation was properly supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d <em>Eichman </em>v. <em>J &amp; J Building Co., </em>supra, 216 Conn. 454, we conclude that the plaintiff met its burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>of presenting sufficient evidence for the trial court to determine the value of the property on the date that title vested in the plaintiff. The trial court\u2019s admission of the testimony of Burr was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\"> The plaintiff named as defendants Phillip B.
