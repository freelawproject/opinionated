Scott Guilmartin individually in connection with the performance of site work at an office park in East Granby. F &amp; G asserted a counterclaim against the plaintiff and a third party complaint against Terrence P. Brewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">After a trial, the court rendered judgment on the complaint in favor of the plaintiff against Philip Fine, Morton Fine and J. Scott Guilmartin on the theory of quantum meruit. The court also rendered judgment on the counterclaim in favor of the plaintiff and on the third party complaint in favor of Brewer. Subsequently, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant F &amp; G on the complaint. See <em>T.P. Brewer Construction Co. </em>v. <em>F &amp; G </em>Associates, 34 Conn. App. 714, 643 A.2d 308 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">While much of the evidence at trial was disputed, it is axiomatic that this court cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Speers, </em>17 Conn. App. 587, 592, 554 A.2d 769, cert. denied, 211 Conn. 808, 559 A.2d 1142, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 851, 110 S. Ct. 150, 107 L. Ed. 2d 108, cert. denied sub nom. <em>George </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>493 U.S. 893, 110 S. Ct. 241, 107 L. Ed. 2d 192 (1989). The claims raised on appeal attack the court\u2019s factual findings. There was neither a motion to correct nor a motion for articulation filed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>defendants have failed to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous or that its decision was otherwise erroneous in law. Practice Book \u00a7 4061.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our review of the record falls to disclose that those factual findings were unsupported by the evidence. <em>Cromwell Common Associates </em>v. <em>Hoziuro, </em>21 Conn. App. 1, 5, 570 A.2d 1131 (1990). The court\u2019s findings that led to the conclusion that damages were proven with reasonable certainty were not shown to be clearly erroneous. See <em>Fuessenich </em>v. <em>DiNardo, </em>195 Com. 144, 156-57, 487 A.2d 514 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-17\"> The named defendant, F &amp; G Associates (F &amp; G), was listed as an appellant on the defendants\u2019 docketing statement. Because the supplemental judgment was rendered in favor of F &amp; G, it is not an aggrieved party. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 52-263; Practice Book \u00a7 4000. We refer to the appellants Morton Fine, Philip Fine and J. Scott Guilmartin as the defendants in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\"> The stock of the plaintiff corporation was owned in equal amounts by Terrence P. Brewer, its president, and J. Scott Guilmartin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\"> The general partners of F &amp; G Associates were Philip Fine, Morton Fine and J. Scott Corporation. J. Scott Corporation was owned in equal shares by J. Scott Guilmartin and Terrence Brewer. Terrence Brewer was the president of J. Scott Corporation. J. Scott Corporation was not made a party to this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b86-11\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4061 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe court may reverse or modify the decision of the trial court if it determines that the factual findings are clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record, or that the decision is otherwise erroneous in law. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
