(Newbrook), appeals from the judgment of foreclosure rendered after the trial court granted the named plaintiffs motion for summary judgment. On appeal, New-brook asserts that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment because (1) Newbrook held an equitable lien on the subject premises that was superior to the mortgage being foreclosed, (2) the equitable lien was a charge on property and not an interest in property and thus not subject to the time limitations of General Statutes \u00a7 47-33a,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) Newbrook commenced a timely action on its statutory lien pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-92c,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (4) genuine issues of material fact existed. We disagree with Newbrook\u2019s assertions and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The relevant facts are as follows. On December 16, 1986, Newbrook entered into a real estate contract to purchase a parcel of real estate from the named defendant, International Site Consultants, Inc. (International). The contract provided for a deposit of $120,000. On February 26, 1987, International and Newbrook executed an addendum to the contract that provided for Newbrook to purchase a second parcel and to make an additional deposit of $45,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The contract and addendum were recorded on March 12, 1987. The contract clause at issue is termed \u201cBuyer\u2019s Lien\u201d and provides that \u201c[a]ll sums paid on account of this Agreement are hereby made hens thereon, but such hens shall not continue after default by the Buyer under the terms of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In addition, paragraph eleven of the contract makes Newbrook\u2019s obligation to purchase the parcels contingent on International\u2019s obtaining the necessary approvals for the development of a thirteen lot subdivision. The contract further provided that should International fail to obtain such approvals by December 1,1987, New-brook could elect to accept title, rescind the contract or provide International with additional time, not to exceed three years, to seek the necessary approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The first parcel of land was subsequently mortgaged by International to the named plaintiff, Columbia Federal Savings Bank (bank), to secure a $250,000 note. The mortgage was dated February 27, 1987, and recorded on March 2, 1987. As further collateral for the note, International assigned to the bank the December 16, 1986 contract entered into by International and New-brook. Although the contract was not recorded until March 12, 1987, the bank conceded that it had actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>notice of the contract and addendum at the time the bank and International executed the February 27, 1987 mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The second parcel was then mortgaged by International to the bank to secure a $130,000 note. This mortgage, dated July 21,1987, and recorded on July 22,1987, also covered the first parcel of land as a second mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The record reflects that International did not obtain the necessary approvals by December 1, 1987. New-brook terminated the real estate contract on December 5, 1989, and demanded the return of the deposits it had paid. After International refused to return the deposits, Newbrook brought suit against International seeking rescission of the contract and money damages. The bank brought an action to foreclose the mortgages because International had defaulted on its payments. Newbrook was made a party to that action because of its claim that it possessed both a common law equitable lien and a purchaser\u2019s lien pursuant to the provision in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The bank filed a motion for summary judgment as against Newbrook only. The trial court, in granting the bank\u2019s motion, concluded that Newbrook possessed only a purchaser\u2019s lien, not an equitable lien, and that such lien had expired prior to the commencement of the action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-92c<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 47-33a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure in favor of General Financial Services, Inc., which had been substituted as plaintiff after the mortgage was transferred to it. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Newbrook first claims that it held an equitable lien that was not subject to the statutory two year time limitation provided in \u00a7 49-92c.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree and conclude that any equitable hen held by Newbrook was subject to the two year time limitation and, thus, had expired prior to the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Both parties agree that Newbrook once held a purchaser\u2019s lien in the amount of the deposit it had paid pursuant to paragraph ten of the contract. This paragraph of the contract, however, merely recites a statutory right already conferred upon purchasers. General Statutes \u00a7 49-92a provides in pertinent part: \u201cA purchaser\u2019s lien is created for the amount of the deposit paid pursuant to and stated in the contract for the conveyance of land by the recording of that contract . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The primary issue on appeal centers around the intent of this legislation and what effect the statute has on the common law equitable lien. The common law equitable lien is \u201ca right, not existing at law, to have specific property applied in whole or in part to payment of a particular debt or class of debts.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). As such, it \u201cconstitutes a charge or encumbrance upon the thing, so that the very thing itself may be proceeded against in an equitable action . . . .\u201d 3 J. Pomeroy, A Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence (4th Ed. 1918) \u00a7 1233, p. 2958.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Newbrook asserts that the enactment of \u00a7 49-92a does not abrogate or impact its common law equitable lien, and that its equitable lien retained priority over the bank\u2019s mortgage. The trial court concluded that Newbrook\u2019s claimed lien expired by the passage of the statutory two year time limitation of \u00a7 49-92c. The trial court reached this conclusion after noting that while our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>courts recognize the equitable lien doctrine, \u201cNewbrook has cited no legal authority for the position that the equitable lien can exist independent of and contrary to the statutory provisions.\u201d Newbrook claims that the equitable lien does exist independent of the statutory lien and that the legislature did not intend to affect the equitable lien through its passage of \u00a7 49-92a.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">We are guided by our well established rules of statutory construction in ascertaining the statute\u2019s intent and effect. It is well settled that \u201c[i]n construing a statute, common sense must be used . . . .\u201d <em>Norwich Land Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>170 Conn. 1, 4, 363 A.2d 1386 (1975). Further, we must construe a statute to avoid results that are irrational and insensible. <em>Caltabiano </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 662, 667, 560 A.2d 975 (1989); <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 152, 480 A.2d 519 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Common sense dictates that the legislature intended to subject the common law equitable lien to the statutory lien provisions. One obvious purpose of \u00a7 49-92c is to ensure that a lienholder could not hold a lien over the subject property indefinitely. For this reason, the legislature enacted the statute, which provides for the termination of all purchaser\u2019s liens that have continued in force for two years absent any action to foreclose the lien within that two year period. Irrational and insensible results would follow were we to conclude that an equitable lien can exist independent of and contrary to the time limitations posed by \u00a7 49-92c. Such a conclusion would allow Newbrook to circumvent the time limitations of \u00a7 49-92c, and thereby nullify the effect of the statute and thwart its purpose. We do not interpret a statute in such a way that thwarts its purpose. See <em>Kron v. Thelen, </em>178 Conn. 189, 192, 423 A.2d 857 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Our Supreme Court has held that one cannot, by bringing a common law action of indebitatus assumpsit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>circumvent the statutory time limitations of General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a (appeal from property tax valuation) and General Statutes \u00a7 12-119 (claim of wrongful tax assessment). <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>200 Conn. 697, 708-13, 513 A.2d 77 (1986). The Supreme Court reasoned that one could not resort to the equitable writ of assumpsit because \u201cwhere a statute has established a procedure to redress a particular wrong a person must follow the specified remedy and may not institute a proceeding that might have been permissible in the absence of such a statutory procedure.\u201d Id., 708. \u201cAlthough resting on the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies, our decision in <em>Norwich </em>recognized that the legislative purpose behind the limitation periods for challenging tax assessments would be thwarted if an action for refund of taxes paid upon a disputed assessment could be brought far beyond the time limits for contesting an assessment established by these statutes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>224 Conn. 110, 122-23, 617 A.2d 433 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Similarly, were we to accept Newbrook\u2019s theory, then once a contract for the sale of land is recorded, the buyer\u2019s equitable lien would exist for an indeterminate period of time, casting a shadow over the title to the subject property. This is precisely the problem that the legislature intended to cure by enacting \u00a7 49-92c. We, therefore, conclude that \u00a7 49-92a circumscribes the common law equitable lien by subjecting it to the time limitations of \u00a7 49-92c.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In its brief, Newbrook also raises the issue of whether the trial court improperly failed to recognize that its equitable lien was a charge on property and not an interest in property, and thus not subject to the time limitations of \u00a7 47-33a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because we find that New-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>brook\u2019s lien rights are barred pursuant to \u00a7 49-92c, we need not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Newbrook next claims that its statutory lien is not barred because its action to foreclose was timely. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 49-92c, \u201c[n]o purchaser\u2019s lien shall continue in force for a longer period than two years after such lien has been perfected, unless the party claiming such lien, within said period, commences an action to foreclose the same and proceeds therewith to final judgment. . . .\u201d \u201cThe legislature is supreme in the area of legislation, and courts must apply statutory enactments according to their plain terms.\u201d <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>196 Conn. 546, 550, 494 A.2d 564 (1985). According to the plain terms of \u00a7 49-92c, New-brook\u2019s action was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The contract was recorded on March 12, 1987. New-brook terminated the contract on December 5, 1989. In 1990, Newbrook commenced an action against International seeking rescission of the contract and money damages. Newbrook did not institute a foreclosure action. Furthermore, Newbrook cannot rely on the bank\u2019s foreclosure action against International because Newbrook, although made a party to that action, did not file a cross claim seeking foreclosure of its hen. The trial court\u2019s finding that Newbrook\u2019s hen had expired was, therefore, proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">We next address Newbrook\u2019s final claim that genuine issues of material fact existed to preclude summary judgment. After a careful inspection of the record, we find that this claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Our standard for reviewing a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment is well established. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 384 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact .... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Water &amp; Way Properties </em>v. <em>Colt\u2019s Mfg. Co., </em>230 Conn. 660, 664, 646 A.2d 143 (1994). Moreover, the party seeking summary judgment \u201chas the burden of showing the nonexistence of any issue of [material] fact.\u201d <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Newbrook claims that genuine issues of material fact existed as to the time of performance of the real estate contract, the amount of the deposit and the bank\u2019s obligation on the contract. Newbrook filed no counteraffi-davits, but claims that the bank\u2019s complaint created these questions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">As to the time of performance, paragraph eleven of the real estate contract sufficiently details the parties\u2019 respective times for performance. Because Newbrook conceded that it had actual notice of the contract and its provisions, and because there was no other evidence before the trial court at the time it considered the bank\u2019s motion, we conclude that no genuine issue of fact existed as to the time of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Newbrook also claims in its brief that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the amount of the deposit. Newbrook cites nothing in the record, however, to guide us in determining whether such an issue of fact existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Finally, no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the bank\u2019s obligation on the contract. The bank\u2019s obligation emanates from International\u2019s assignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>its contract with Newbrook to the bank. The assignment clearly establishes the bank\u2019s obligation. No issue of fact thus existed as to the bank\u2019s obligation on the contract. We conclude that the trial court acted properly in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"><em> </em>General Statutes \u00a7 47-33a (a) provides: \u201cNo interest in real property existing under an executory agreement for the sale of real property or for the sale of an interest in real property or under an option to purchase real property shall survive longer than one year after the date provided in the agreement for the performance of it or, if the date is not so provided, longer than eighteen months after the date on which the agreement was executed, unless the interest is extended as provided herein or unless action is commenced within the period to enforce the agreement and notice of lis pendens is filed as directed by section 52-325.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-92c provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo purchaser\u2019s lien shall continue in force for a longer period than two years after such lien has been perfected, unless the party claiming such lien, within said period, commences an action to foreclose the same and proceeds therewith to final judgment. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\"> Although the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, recited that Newbrook had paid deposits totaling only $87,500, both parties agree, in their briefs, that Newbrook had paid a total of $110,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\"> See footnote 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b93-8\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> See footnote 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
