Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the informations on the ground that they failed to charge an offense constituting harassment in the second degree. The state contends that the trial court\u2019s ruling was improper. The state asserts that in order to establish a violation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2), it does not have to prove that the defendant directly communicated with the persons whom the defendant intended to harass, and that, therefore, its informations did not fail to charge an offense. We agree with the state and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The facts essential to an understanding of our resolution of this appeal are as follows.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In April, 1993, Joseph Sullivan, the acting superintendent of public schools in Waterbury, and Charles Joy, the assistant superintendent for instruction, were jointly involved in the suspension of the defendant from duty for one week. The defendant was the principal of Crosby High School.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Commencing in July, 1993, Sullivan, Joy, and Foster Crawford, the assistant superintendent for special education, began receiving by mail magazine subscriptions to which they had not subscribed and packages of merchandise and services that they had not ordered. For example, Joy received dozens of video cassettes, audio discs, rpusic cassettes, and collector plates and cards. Joy estimated that as of October, 1993, he had received over 500 pieces of mail and merchandise valued at approximately $5620.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">All three of the victims had been billed for these unsolicited items and had received second and third notices from billing services. In these past due notices, the billing agencies threatened that they would take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>aggressive collection action if the outstanding bills were not paid. The notices caused the victims to believe that such action would have an adverse effect on their credit standings.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Additionally, Sullivan, Joy and Crawford had spent a considerable amount of time making telephone calls and mailing numerous forms and letters in attempts to cancel unwanted magazine subscriptions, and to stem the tide of unordered and unwanted merchandise and services. Joy changed his telephone number in an effort to stop solicitors from calling at all hours of the day and night.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">On September 8, 1993, Joy attended a meeting in the defendant\u2019s office at Crosby High School. Joy wanted to take notes at the meeting and picked up a note pad from the defendant\u2019s desk. Joy noticed that the pad had an imprint of his name and home address. On September 15, 1993, Joy again attended a meeting at Crosby High School and, while he was using the telephone in the defendant\u2019s office, he saw ten or twelve subscription forms protruding from the defendant\u2019s desk drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">On September 21, 1993, Joy received a telephone call from a person claiming that Joy was registered for a particular seminar. Joy asked the caller to send him the original registration card and the envelope in which it had been mailed, and the caller did so. When Joy received the registration materials, he compared the handwriting on the materials with the handwriting on certain documents that the defendant had prepared and signed. Joy concluded that the handwriting on the registration materials was very similar to that of the defendant. Joy also recognized that the postage on the registration envelope was from a postage meter at 236 Grand Street, the building where Joy\u2019s office was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>On October 8,1993, Joy intercepted the mail from the Crosby High School mail bag and noticed a subscription card with his name and address listed as the subscriber. Joy asked a secretary to examine the contents of the mail bag, and the secretary found six pieces of mail similar to the one that Joy had discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The false subscription cards and known samples of the defendant\u2019s handwriting were submitted to the state forensic laboratory for handwriting comparison. The examiner concluded that the cards and the known samples were written by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">On October 21,1993, pursuant to a warrant, the police searched the defendant\u2019s office at Crosby High School. The items seized included thirty-one assorted mail orders and requests for magazine subscriptions and a box containing over 510 homemade address labels. Among the addresses printed on the labels were those of Joy\u2019s residence, Sullivan\u2019s residence and Crawford\u2019s residence and office. Over 300 of the labels contained the residential address of Guy DiBiasio, a former superintendent of public schools in Waterbury. The police also found three order forms containing the Waterbury address of Robert Rousseau, Karen Rousseau and James Wigglesworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">During the search, the defendant told the police that he had been subjected to harassment by the school officials who had suspended him, and, that for this reason, he was ordering subscriptions to be sent to the officials. The defendant also stated that he was having problems with a student, and that he had a confrontation with the student\u2019s father. Because the defendant was upset with this student and his father, he began ordering magazine subscriptions to be sent to the student\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Approximately one month after the search of the defendant\u2019s office, Robert Rousseau and Karen Rous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>seau reported to the police that they had been involved in a verbal confrontation with the defendant and that, thereafter, they had begun to receive numerous items of unsolicited mail. Karen Rousseau stated that the argument with the defendant pertained to Wig-glesworth, her son. According to Karen Rousseau, one unwanted item sent to her home was a giljt allegedly from Joy to Wigglesworth, an item that Joy claims he did not send.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Also subsequent to the search of the defendant\u2019s office, DiBiasio filed a complaint with the police, claiming that he had been receiving hundreds of unsolicited mail subscriptions at his residence. DiBiasio reported that while he was superintendent, he had disciplined the defendant for a violation of school policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">On the basis of these facts, the defendant was arrested and charged in three informations with a total of five counts of harassment in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2). The informations allege that the defendant, \u201cwith intent to harass and annoy\u201d the complainants, \u201cdid communicate by mail with other persons to cause numerous pieces of unsolicit[ed] mail and packages to be received by\u201d the complainants \u201cin a manner likely to cause annoyance and alarm.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the informations, claiming (1) that the informations were defective because they failed to charge an offense, and (2) that the law defining the offense charged was unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. The defendant based his motion on Practice Book \u00a7 814, article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution, and the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion on the ground that the informations failed to charge an offense constituting the conduct proscribed in \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court found that in order to establish a violation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2), the state must prove that the defendant directly communicated with the person whom he intended to harass, and that the informations charging the defendant with violating \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) failed to allege such a direct communication. According to the trial court, \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) \u201cdoes not encompass within its ambit content-neutral communications made to a party other than the complainant which are not in any way annoying or alarming to such other party. While the defendant\u2019s intention may have been to annoy or harass the complainants and their receipt of numerous unsolicited mail order items was, in all likelihood, annoying and possibly alarming, his alleged actions do not constitute criminal conduct.\u201d Following the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the informations, the state appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">On appeal, the state asserts that to establish a violation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2), it need not prove that the defendant communicated directly with the persons whom the defendant intended to harass, and that, therefore, its informations did not fail to charge an offense. The defendant disagrees with the state\u2019s position and argues that the statute proscribes a defendant only from engaging in direct communication with a victim in an effort to harass the victim. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">To resolve this appeal, we must determine whether \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) requires the state to prove that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>defendant, with the intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, directly communicated with that person, or whether the state may also prove a violation of that statute where it demonstrates that a defendant, with the intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, communicated with a third party. The resolution of this question requires us to engage in statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">\u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . Ordinarily, if the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 481, 668 A.2d 682 (1995). Thus, we first must consider whether \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) is plain and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The statutory language applicable to this case is as follows: \u201cA person is guilty of harassment in the second degree when . . . with intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, he communicates with a person by . . . mail ... in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2). We conclude that this language is not ambiguous and that it applies to a person who, with the intent to harass a victim, communicates with a third party by mail in an effort to cause such harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The legislature decreed in \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) that a person is guilty of harassment in the second degree when with the requisite intent to harass <em>\u201canother </em>person, he communicates with <em>a </em>person\u201d in a prohibited manner. (Emphasis added.) These words \u201care to be understood according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>205 Conn. 386, 392, 533 A.2d 866 (1987); and \u201cmust be given their plain and ordinary meaning and be interpreted in their natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>and usual sense unless the context indicates that a different meaning was intended.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>33 Conn. App. 133, 140, 634 A.2d 1181 (1993). The language of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) plainly states that for a defendant to violate that statute, he must first have the intent to harass, annoy or alarm \u201canother\u201d person, i.e., the intended victim, and, second, he must communicate with \u201ca\u201d person, possibly a third party, in a manner likely to achieve his ends. Thus, a defendant is prohibited from intending to harass \u201canother\u201d person and then acting on his intent by communicating with \u201ca\u201d person. The statute by its terms does not require direct communication with the person who is the target of the harassment, and we will \u201cnot by construction read into statutes provisions which are not clearly stated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>227 Conn. 534, 542, 630 A.2d 1059 (1993). Were we to countenance an interpretation different from that set forth here, we would render words of the statute mere surplusage because we would fail to recognize the distinction made by the legislature that proscribes someone from having an intent to harass \u201canother\u201d person, but prohibits only that he communicate with \u201ca\u201d person. \u201cNo word or phrase in a statute is to be rendered mere surplusage.\u201d <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 8, 16, 615 A.2d 1032 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">On the basis of our interpretation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2), we conclude that the trial court improperly interpreted that statute. Contrary to the finding of the trial court, \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) does not require the state to prove that the defendant engaged in a direct communication with the person whom he intended to harass. Furthermore, having examined the language of the informa-tions filed by the state in light of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2), we conclude that those informations did not fail to charge the defendant with the offense of harassment in the second degree. The informations alleged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>defendant, with the intent to harass and annoy the complainants, communicated by mail with other persons to cause numerous pieces of unsolicited mail and packages to be received by the complainants, in a manner likely to cause annoyance and alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The judgments are reversed and the case remanded with direction to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the counts alleging a violation of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) based on the failure to charge an offense and for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\"> The state appeals pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96, which provides: \u201cAppeals from the rulings and decisions of the superior court, upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases, may be taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to the supreme court or to the appellate court, in the same manner and to the same effect as if made by the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\"> This is a consolidated appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-10\"> The trial court also dismissed the counts of the informations that charged the defendant with violating General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2), but no appeal was taken from that action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b571-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of harassment in the second degree when ...
