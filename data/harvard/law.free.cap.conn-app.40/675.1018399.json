J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVs9\">This appeal arises from the judgment dissolving the marriage between the plaintiff, Cheryl Schult, and the defendant, Jeffrey Scot Schult. The plaintiff and the defendant had only one child, who was born on October 6, 1988. The principal issue in this appeal is the proper construction and application of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56b<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which creates a rebuttable presumption \u201cthat it is in the best interest of the child to be in the custody of the parent\u201d in any dispute as to the custody of a minor child involving a parent and a nonparent. The trial court relied on a \u201cshowing that it would be detrimental to the child to permit the parent to have custody,\u201d as provided in the statute, to rebut that presumption. Accordingly, the court awarded sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>physical and legal custody of the child to his maternal grandmother, Joan Radin, who is an intervenor in the dissolution action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff appeals from that judgment and from a subsequent judgment rendered on two postjudgment motions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The plaintiff filed a dissolution action on March 7, 1991, seeking (1) dissolution of her marriage to the defendant, (2) custody of their child, (3) child support, (4) alimony and (5) reasonable counsel fees. The defendant filed a cross complaint on April 26, 1991, which did not dispute the relief of dissolution of marriage, but which sought (1) custody of the child, (2) in the alternative to sole custody, joint legal custody of the child, and (3) child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In order to understand fully the unfortunate situation with which the trial court was confronted, it is necessary to spell out in some detail the background of the parties and the sequence of events that led to this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff was married to the defendant on February 14,1986. Their child has a history of emotional and psychological problems and developmental delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">On April 18, 1991, shortly after the action for dissolution of marriage was initiated, the defendant moved out of the family home. On that same date, Steve Norman moved into the family home as a boarder. On the evening of November 19, 1991, Norman was baby-sitting while the plaintiff, a licensed nurse practitioner, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>at work. The child was three years old at the time. Norman testified that about five minutes after the child had gone to bed, he came out of the bedroom and was crying. Norman observed that the child had a mark above his eye and treated the injury with an ice pack. After fifteen to twenty minutes, the child stopped crying and went back to bed. The following morning, Norman noticed that the child was limping and would not put any pressure on his leg. When the plaintiff returned home at 7:30 a.m., Norman told her that \u201cwe\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The plaintiff called Karen Laugel, their pediatrician, who was in her office in Bridgeport. The plaintiff and Norman took the child in the plaintiffs car to Laugel\u2019s office. After examining the child, Laugel stated that \u201cit looks like a broken leg.\u201d Feeling that the child\u2019s injury was \u201cvery worrisome for the possibility of abuse\u201d and that the child\u2019s injury could not \u201cbe explained by falling out of the bed,\u201d Laugel instructed the plaintiff and Norman to bring the child to Bridgeport Hospital where the child could be treated for his injury and where an investigation would be initiated for child abuse. Laugel also told the plaintiff and Norman that she would meet them at the hospital shortly.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The plaintiff and Norman then took the child to the University of Connecticut Health Center, John Dempsey Hospital (Dempsey Hospital), where the child was admitted on November 20, 1991. After approximately two hours at the hospital, Norman told the plaintiff that he had to go home and feed the animals and left the hospital. After remaining at home for approximately two hours, Norman then drove the plaintiffs car to Stratford, where he checked into a Days Inn at about 8:30 p.m. The following day, November 21, Norman drove around New York City and returned to the Days Inn in Stratford for the evening. On November 22, Norman drove to the Boston area and checked into a motel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>in Devon, Massachusetts. On November 23, three days after he had left the hospital, Norman returned to Dempsey Hospital. The doctors at Dempsey Hospital did not conclude that the child had been abused and released the child to the plaintiff on November 25. The child\u2019s discharge diagnosis stated that he had suffered a fractured leg.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">At the request of Laugel, the department of children and family services (DCF) conducted an investigation for abuse. After meeting with the child, the plaintiff, Norman, and several doctors at Dempsey Hospital, DCF concluded that the origin of the child\u2019s injury was unknown and that abuse could not be confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">On January 3, 1992, Radin filed a motion for third party intervention pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-57,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> asserting that she was the child\u2019s maternal grand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>mother. On that same day, the trial court granted the motion and issued the following oral order regarding the custody of the child: \u201cI\u2019m going to say that this was the attorneys agreement. That there would be joint legal custody in the mother and the maternal grandmother with primary physical residence with the maternal grandmother.\u201d After that order, the custody battle became increasingly bitter and was marked by disputes between the plaintiff and the intervenor concerning visitation rights. Almost three years after the initiation of the underlying matter, and over two years after the date of the child\u2019s injury, the trial court rendered judgment, granting sole physical and legal custody of the child to the intervenor.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In its accompanying memorandum of decision, the trial court made the following finding: \u201cThe court finds as a fact that [the child\u2019s] leg was broken by [Norman], that [Norman] told [the plaintiff] when she came home what he had done and they both decided to tell the story that [the child\u2019s] leg was broken while [he] was alone in the bedroom in bed. When they told [Laugel] they did not know what happened to [the child], [Laugel] told them that she felt there was some abuse involved and that an investigation would be made for child abuse. They did not follow the doctor\u2019s order to go to Bridgeport Hospital but went eventually to John Dempsey Hospital in Farmington. [Norman] left that hospital as soon as he could and testified that he wanted to get away, that he did not know what was going to happen to him. Under these circumstances, it is clear that it would not be in the best interest of [the child] for him to be given into [the plaintiffs] custody with [Norman] there, knowing that he got away with breaking [the child\u2019s] leg as the court has found and with the opportunity to abuse [the child] further. <em>The court cannot conceive of a situation more detrimental to [ the child] than to permit [the plaintiff] to have custody of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><em>[the child] now. </em>Under the above circumstances, [the plaintiff] sided with [Norman] against [the child]. She should not be given the opportunity to do that again.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Upon rendering judgment awarding sole physical and legal custody of the child to the intervenor, the trial court also ordered that the plaintiff shall have rights of \u201creasonable visitation\u201d with the child and specifically ordered that the plaintiff \u201cshall have visitation on Saturdays from 2:30 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. on Sundays, and one weekday afternoon per week.\u201d On April 6, 1994, the plaintiff filed a motion for contempt and order, claiming that the intervenor had wilfully failed to comply with the court\u2019s order of visitation. The intervenor then filed a motion for modification on May 26, 1994, requesting the court to terminate the plaintiffs right to overnight visitation. The intervenor\u2019s motion for modification also sought a court order preventing the plaintiff from conducting visitation at the plaintiffs residence and from conducting visitation when Norman is present. After conducting hearings, the trial court issued a second memorandum of decision on August 1, 1994, in which it denied the inteivenor\u2019s motion for modification. The trial court did not grant the plaintiffs motion for contempt, and issued an order permitting the plaintiff to have the child for overnight visitation each weekend and for visitation one afternoon each week.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims the trial court (1) improperly concluded that the intervenor should be awarded custody of the child and that it would be detrimental to him to be in the custody of the plaintiff because the court misconstrued \u00a7 46b-56b, and made factual findings not supported by the evidence, (2) failed to issue orders to assist the family in eventual reunification and improperly allowed the attorney for the minor child to argue against the recommendation of the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, and (3) improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>granted temporary custody of the minor child to the intervening nonparent. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">We note initially that \u201c[t]he factual findings of a trial court on any issue are reversible only if they are clearly erroneous. . . . This court cannot retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rosick </em>v. <em>Equipment Maintenance &amp; </em>Service, <em>Inc., </em>33 Conn. App. 25, 40-41, 623 A.2d 1134 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that it would be detrimental for the child to be in the custody of his mother. The presumption in favor of a parent over a nonparent mandated by \u00a7 46b-56b \u201cmay be rebutted by showing that it would be <em>detrimental </em>to the child to permit the parent to have custody.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court found as a fact that the child\u2019s leg was broken by Norman, that the plaintiff knew that Norman broke the child\u2019s leg, and that Norman was apart of the plaintiffs household.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result of those findings, the trial court concluded that it could not conceive of a situation more detrimental to the child than to permit the plaintiff to have custody and, as a result of that conclusion, awarded legal and physical custody of the child to the intervenor.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Our determination as to whether the trial court misconstrued or improperly applied \u00a7 46b-56b to the facts of this case rests on two factors. First, we review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>trial court\u2019s findings to ensure that the findings are based on reliable and sufficient evidence. If we conclude that the findings are based on reliable and sufficient evidence, we must then determine whether those findings are sufficient to rebut the presumption that it would be in the child\u2019s best interest to be in the custody of his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">From our review of the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence. The trial court\u2019s most critical findings are that Norman broke the child\u2019s leg and that the plaintiff sided with Norman against the child.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Presumably, the latter finding arises from the subsidiary finding that the plaintiff knew that Norman broke her child\u2019s leg and that she continued to live with Norman.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court further noted that both the plaintiff and Norman failed to follow Laugel\u2019s instructions to take the child to Bridgeport Hospital for treatment and instead drove an extra hour to Dempsey Hospital in Farmington. The trial court could reasonably have found that fact to be especially relevant in light of Laugel\u2019s testimony that she had given the plaintiff an admissions note allowing the child to be admitted directly to pediatrics without having to wait in the emergency room. Laugel also testified that she felt the child\u2019s fractured leg was inconsistent with the claim that he had twisted his leg on the waterbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>The trial court also took note of Norman\u2019s questionable absence from the hospital and the area for nearly three days and the fact that Norman did not telephone the plaintiff to tell her where he was during this period. Norman\u2019s reason for his absence was that \u201che wanted to be away, to think about everything that was going to happen\u201d to him. Further, the trial court considered Norman\u2019s nervous demeanor while giving testimony. In light of the evidence presented and the reasonable inferences that could have been drawn therefrom, the record contains sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We must next determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings were sufficient to rebut the presumption that it would be in the child\u2019s best interest to be in the custody of a parent. The trial court correctly recognized that \u00a7 46b-56b mandates a presumption in favor of a parent over a nonparent, and permits that presumption to be rebutted only by a showing that it would be detrimental to the child for the parent to have custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">A rebuttable presumption is equivalent to prima facie proof of a fact and can be rebutted only by the opposing party\u2019s production of sufficient and persuasive contradictory evidence that disproves the fact that is the subject of the presumption. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Litchfield, 4 </em>Conn. App. 24, 28, 492 A.2d 210 (1985). A presumption requires that a particular fact be deemed true until such time as the proponent of the invalidity of the fact has, by the particular quantum of proof required by the case, shown by sufficient contradictory evidence, that the presumption has been rebutted. Id. The failure of a trial court to discuss a presumption or the standard of proof is not sufficient to reverse a finding that a presumption has been rebutted. Id., 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The powerful language used by the trial court in finding that it could not \u201cconceive of a situation more detri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>mental to [the child than] to permit [the plaintiff] to have custody of the child,\u201d indicates that the trial court determined that the statutory presumption in favor of a parental custody had been rebutted in this case. We are not persuaded by the plaintiffs arguments that the trial court improperly concluded that the presumption was rebutted. The trial court properly applied \u00a7 46b-56b in determining, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that it would be to the child\u2019s detriment if the court were to permit the plaintiff to have custody in light of the court\u2019s findings of fact that Norman had broken the child\u2019s leg, that the plaintiff had sided with Norman over that incident of abuse and that Norman, nevertheless, remained a member of the plaintiffs household.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The plaintiffs second claim is that the trial court failed to issue orders to assist a family in eventual reunification. The plaintiffs assertion that a trial court is required to issue orders to assist the family in eventual reunification is premised on the notion that a dissolution action, where custody of a minor child is at issue, is the equivalent of an action case involving termination of parental rights brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-706 through 45a-765.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree with that premise. A termination of parental lights is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 45a-707 (g) as \u201cthe complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and his parent . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>In the present case, the rights of the plaintiff as the child\u2019s mother were not permanently terminated. Unlike cases involving the termination of parental rights, the court\u2019s order did <em>not </em>require the complete severance of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and his parent. The trial court ordered that the plaintiff shall have the right to consult with the intervenor on any and all matters concerning the child\u2019s health and well-being. Furthermore, the trial court ordered visitation allowing the plaintiff to have the child for overnight visitation each weekend and for one afternoon each week. We conclude that there is no authority for the proposition that a trial court is required to issue orders designed eventually to return a child to the custody of a natural parent in the context of an action for dissolution of marriage and \u00a7\u00a7 46b-56b and 46b-57. The trial court, however, does have continuing jurisdiction to issue further future orders in the event a motion for modification of custody is subsequently made and the circumstances merit any modification of its existing orders. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the attorney for the child to argue against the recommendation of the child\u2019s guardian ad litem. The attorney for the child and the guardian ad litem had divergent views as to whether the child\u2019s mother or grandmother should have custody. Both the attorney for the child and the guardian ad litem were appointed by the court. The attorney for the child was appointed on a motion by the defendant, and, subsequently, the guardian ad litem was appointed on a motion by the plaintiff. The former believed that custody should be with the grandmother, and the latter believed that custody should be with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>The guardian ad litem testified, as a witness for the plaintiff, that, on the bases of the 300 hours that she had worked on this case and her numerous observations of the child with his mother, she did not \u201csee any detriment at all to [the child] if he would return to his mother.\u201d The trial court, over objection, permitted the attorney for the child to cross-examine the guardian ad litem and to give a recommendation to the court that the child should remain with the intervenor. The plaintiff argues that the conspicuous lack of participation by the attorney for the child evidenced by her absence from some court proceedings and by her limited role in the case after the appointment of the guardian ad litem, should have precluded the trial court from permitting the attorney for the child to give a recommendation that was purportedly based on the child\u2019s best interest. The plaintiff claims that this alleged error was not harmless because it served to nullify the testimony of the guardian ad litem, thereby causing prejudice to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The guardian ad litem challenges whether the attorney for the minor child had the authority to make a recommendation as to the child\u2019s best interests, when such a recommendation was in direct conflict with the recommendation of the child\u2019s guardian ad litem. In her brief, the guardian ad litem claims that the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the attorney for the minor child to make a recommendation, purportedly based upon the child\u2019s best interest, \u201cwas so egregious as to deny a fair trial on the question of custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-54 (a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> permits the trial court to appoint an attorney to represent a minor child during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>a dissolution proceeding if \u201cthe court deems it to be in the best interests of the child or children\u201d \u201cThe purpose of appointing counsel for a minor child in a dissolution action is to ensure independent representation of the child\u2019s interest and such representation must be entrusted to the professional judgment of appointed counsel within the usual constraints applicable to such representation. <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Schaffer, </em>187 Conn. 224, 224 n.1, 445 A.2d 589 (1982).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Knock </em>v. <em>Knock, </em>224 Conn. 776, 791, 621 A.2d 267 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The obligations and limitations of the role of counsel for children in custody cases have not yet been definitively determined by the appellate courts of this state. Furthermore, although one appellate case has recognized that there is a potential for conflict between the roles of guardians ad litem and counsel for children when both are appointed by the court, the precise issue of this case has not been resolved. <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>235 Conn. 82, 96, 663 A.2d 980 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In <em>Knock, </em>the role of counsel for a child in custody cases was not delineated because the counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>unable to demonstrate any prejudice arising from the conflict between the trial court\u2019s belief that the counsel should only minimally participate in the trial and the counsel\u2019s belief that she should participate by cross-examining witnesses, making evidentiary objections, and otherwise fully participating in the trial, including the preparation and submission of oral and written arguments. Because the counsel was able to participate fully in the trial, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s view of counsel\u2019s role . . . did not impair her ability to represent her client in an appropriate manner.\u201d <em>Knock </em>v. <em>Knock, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 792. Although <em>Knock </em>did not resolve the parameters of a minor child\u2019s counsel\u2019s role in a dissolution action, and did not involve both a guardian ad litem and counsel for a child, this statement of the court implies that counsel acted appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><em>Knock </em>establishes that any testimony that is relevant to assess what is in the best interest of a child in custody cases may be heard by a trial court without an abuse of discretion occurring. The trial court in <em>Knock </em>heard relevant testimony relating to the issue of custody from four witnesses, a court-appointed evaluator, a family relations counselor, a licensed psychologist, and an expert on the subject of battered women\u2019s syndrome. Two witnesses opined that custody should be with the father, one witness opined that custody should be with the mother, and the fourth witness opined that the mother manifested battered woman\u2019s syndrome. Id., 779. The trial court did not rely solely on any one person\u2019s testimony and, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in allowing and considering testimony relevant to its determination of whether the best interests of the child required custody to be with the mother or the father. Unlike the present case, there was no claim that the child\u2019s counsel should not have been heard on the issue of custody, nor was there a conflict between a counsel and a guardian ad litem. In the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the counsel was not a witness and gave no testimony, although the guardian ad litem testified as a witness for the plaintiff and argued that the plaintiff should have custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In <em>Newman </em>v. Newman, supra, 235 Conn. 82, the issue to be resolved by the court was whether an appeal should be dismissed if counsel appointed pursuant to \u00a7 46b-54 takes the appeal rather than a guardian ad litem or counsel, as the child\u2019s next friend. In the course of concluding that such counsel could pursue an appeal without the appointment of a guardian ad litem if the trial court determines that it is in the best interests of the child to appeal, the Supreme Court shed some light on whether such counsel may be heard on the issue of custody, and the distinction between the roles of counsel and guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">A guardian ad litem is usually appointed by a court to bring a civil action on behalf of a child. Id., 95. The counsel appointed pursuant to statute in dissolution actions and recognized by judicial precedent is an indication that \u201cthe law deems it sufficient to protect [the interests of children] by way of an appointment of an attorney, rather than also requiring a simultaneous appointment of a guardian ad litem or the naming of a next friend . . . .\u201d Id., 97. The role of the counsel is an advocate for the child; id., 102; and that counsel shall be heard on all matters pertaining to the interests of the child so long as the court deems the representation to be in the best interests of the child. Id., 99-100, citing General Statutes \u00a7 46b-54 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">In the present case, although there was a conflict of opinion between the attorney for the child and the guardian ad litem, the claimed abuse of discretion does not arise because of a conflict of roles, but because of a conflict in the resolution of whether the mother or grandmother should have custody of the child. We do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>not need, therefore, to determine or examine the parameters of the roles of the two court-appointed persons,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but rather, must decide whether the trial court should have allowed the counsel to offer her opinion as to custody when it differed from that of the guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 46b-54 (c), the attorney for the minor child \u201cshall be heard on all matters pertaining to the interests of any child, including the custody, care, support, education and visitation of the child, as long as the court deems such representation to be in the best interests of the child.\u201d The trial court, therefore, was obligated to hear the position of the attorney for the child as long as the court deemed that opinion to be relevant to the best interests of the child.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> An opinion as to who should be given custody of a minor child, as determined by the \u201cbest interests of a child,\u201d is not strictly a legal conclusion, but it is a conclusion that counsel for a child may submit to the court, as a recommendation, for the court\u2019s consideration, in the proper circumstances. There is no indication in the record that the counsel for the child had no basis at all for her recommendation or that the trial court relied solely on it. There was relevant testimony, including that of the guardian ad litem, as well as the opinion of the child\u2019s counsel, which the trial court had before it, in determining who should have custody of the child. We conclude that the trial court correctly permitted the attorney for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the child to offer her recommendation concerning the custody of the child. The weight it gave to that recommendation became one more ingredient in the ultimate issue of custody that the trial court had to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the trial court improperly granted temporary custody to the intervening non-parent. Any issues involving the order of temporary custody,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> however, are moot because that order merged with the trial court\u2019s final dissolution decree granting sole legal and physical custody of the child to the intervenor. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>186 Conn. 118, 439 A.2d 447 (1982). In such a case \u201c[t]he order of temporary custody is therefore academic. Appellate courts will not consider academic questions, particularly where no appropriate relief may be afforded. <em>Connecticut Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>International Ladies Garment Workers Union, </em>177 Conn. 17, 19, 411 A.2d 1 (1979).\u201d <em>In re Carl O., </em>10 Conn.

Although both the mother and the father initially sought custody, the father eventually agreed that it was in the best interest of the child to award custody to the grandmother. The defendant father is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\"> The relevant part ol' the child\u2019s discharge diagnosis from Dempsey Hospital, dated November 25, 1991, provides as follows: \u201cPhysical Examination: The physical exam on admission was significant for dry, cracked lips, bruises under the left eye and on the left hand dorsum about 5 x 5 cm in size, swollen right fourth digit with decreased flexion, left knee warm with decreased range of motion, left medial thigh with abrasion 5 cm above the knee, and bruising of the lateral aspect of the left thigh.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">\u201cA bone scan showed recent fracture of the left proximal tibia in the area of the growth plate. This fracture is also noted on x-ray. The bone scan also showed increased uptake in the distal ulna and in the fourth digit of the right hand.

The court may award full or partial custody, care, education and visitation rights of such child to any such third party upon such conditions and limitations as it deems equitable. Before allowing any intervention, the court may appoint counsel for the child or children pursuant to the provisions of section 46b-54.
