Karen, appeals from the trial court\u2019s assignment of certain funds to the defendant Karen Parciak-Karen. The plaintiff claims that the trial court abused its discretion and improperly held (1) that the plaintiff made an inter vivos gift to the marital estate when he converted certain bank accounts, formerly in the plaintiffs name alone, to joint bank accounts in the names of the plaintiff and the defendant, and (2) that the defendant was entitled to have assigned to her a portion of the plaintiffs inheritance. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The trial court found the following pertinent facts. The parties were married in Manchester on May 5,1984. At the time of the marriage, the plaintiff was employed by the Connecticut department of revenue services. In late 1985 or early 1986, the plaintiff terminated his employment with the state and became involved in the sale of real estate in the Manchester area. The defendant managed a family restaurant in Manchester from approximately 1977 until it was sold in 1993. The defendant is also a licensed real estate broker and appraiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The defendant testified at trial that the plaintiff stopped working in 1989 when his mother became ill, and that the defendant supported the plaintiff by working two jobs. In 1990, the plaintiff was appointed conservator for his mother, who later died on February 13, 1991. As a result of her death, the plaintiff became the sole owner of several bank accounts totaling $384,117, that had been held by the plaintiffs mother in survivor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ship with the plaintiff. Since the plaintiffs mother was the sole contributor to these accounts, it was conceded that these accounts were 100 percent taxable for Connecticut succession tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Although the parties had no children of their marriage, two children were placed with the parties in July, 1991, in accordance with a joint plan to adopt them. Both of these children have long standing emotional problems.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Shortly after the children were placed with the parties for adoption, the plaintiff began a series of consultations with a representative of Mechanics Savings Bank relative to the investment of money that he inherited from his mother. The defendant was present at some of these meetings. As a result of these consultations, several investment accounts were established using the funds inherited by the plaintiff. Two of these accounts, the Keystone B-l account and the Van Kampen Bond Fund, with a total current value of $262,256, were converted by the plaintiff from his name alone to the joint names of the plaintiff and the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The trial court determined that the plaintiffs action of converting these two funds from the plaintiffs name alone to the joint names of the plaintiff and the defendant created \u201ca rebuttable presumption that [the] plaintiff intended to make a gift of that property to the marital estate.\u201d The trial court determined that the evidence was lacking to indicate that the plaintiff did not intend a gift when he converted the two accounts. The trial court therefore concluded that these two funds should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>be considered apart of the marital estate<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and assigned pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court also considered the relevant statutory criteria contained in \u00a7 46b-81 (c), and noted that the responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage rested with the plaintiff. It further compared the yearly income of the parties, and concluded that the defendant\u2019s contribution to this portion of the marital estate \u201cfar and away exceeds that of [the plaintiff].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The total marital estate determined by the trial court to be available for assignment was $372,710. This total consisted of $110,454, representing the estate excluding the funds, and $262,256, representing the total amount of funds in the two investment accounts in the joint names of the plaintiff and the defendant. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>assigned to the plaintiff 20 percent of the marital estate excluding the funds, or $22,091. The court assigned to the defendant the remaining 80 percent of the estate excluding the funds, or $88,363. The court assigned to the plaintiff 67 percent of the total amount of the two joint investment accounts, or $175,712, and assigned to the defendant 33 percent, or $86,544, of these accounts. In sum, the trial court assigned to the plaintiff $197,803 of the $372,710 marital estate. The court assigned $174,907, the balance of the marital estate, to the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court declined to award either spouse alimony or counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">This appeal by the plaintiff challenges only the assignment to the defendant of $86,544 of the investment account funds in the joint names of the plaintiff and the defendant. The trial court, in its decree, made various other orders, none of which is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The principal claim of the plaintiff is that the trial court improperly determined that, in converting two of his inheritance fund accounts from his name alone to his and the defendant\u2019s joint names, he made an inter vivos gift to the marital estate. In support of this claim, the plaintiff argues that \u201cthere is no evidence that [he] relinquished control over the accounts in question,\u201d and, further, \u201c[t]here was no evidence that [the] defendant ever withdrew or deposited any money from or to these accounts and no evidence that [the] defendant could make withdrawals without the plaintiff\u2019s consent.\u201d The plaintiff concludes that \u201c[s]ince [he] did not relinquish possession or control of these accounts, there is insufficient evidence on which the court could find that a valid inter vivos gift was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>The plaintiffs argument implies that if the defendant is not the owner of all or any part of the investment fund accounts, the trial court would be powerless to assign to the defendant all or any part of the funds. The plaintiffs argument and its implication misses the mark, and has been previously rejected by statute; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (a);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as by the Connecticut Supreme Court in <em>North </em>v. North, 183 Conn. 35, 39, 438 A.2d 807 (1981). Under \u00a7 46b-81 (a), property assignment is not restricted to the spouse that owns the property. Once it is determined that the property is part of the \u201cestate\u201d of either the husband or wife, the only limitation on the trial court\u2019s power of assignment is General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, our Supreme Court has stated: \u201c \u2018\u00a7 46b-81 confers broad powers upon the [trial] court in the assignment of property. It provides, in part, that the court \u201cmay assign to either the husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other.\u201d Among the factors to be considered in any order entered under \u00a7 46b-81 are the \u201cestate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties.\u201d ... In this context, the \u201cestate\u201d of the parties, as referred to in the statute, comprehends the aggregate of the property and liabilities of each.\u2019 This includes any property a party may have received by reason of inheritance.\u201d <em>North </em>v. <em>North, </em>supra, 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Because it is uncontroverted that these two investment accounts were included in the plaintiffs inheritance, and since the trial court under \u00a7 46b-81 (a), \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>assign to either the husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other,\u201d we conclude that it is unnecessary to decide whether the plaintiff made a gift to the defendant when he converted these two accounts from his name alone to his and the defendant\u2019s joint names. The trial court correctly determined that these two investment accounts were part of the marital estate and subject to assignment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The plaintiffs second and final claim is that the trial court abused its discretion by assigning a portion of the plaintiffs inheritance to the defendant. Before addressing this claim, it is helpful to state the standard of review in family relations cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">\u201c \u2018The standard of review in family matters is that this court will not disturb the trial court\u2019s orders unless it has abused its legal discretion or its findings have no reasonable basis in fact.\u2019 <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Graham, 25 </em>Conn. App. 41, 47, 592 A.2d 424, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 903, 593 A.2d 969 (1991). It is within the province of the trial court to find facts and draw proper inferences from the evidence presented. <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>196 Conn. 359, 378, 493 A.2d 193 (1985).\u201d <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Rummel, </em>33 Conn. App. 214, 220, 635 A.2d 295 (1993). \u201cThe trial court is accorded wide discretion in determining the proper allocation of the assets of the parties. . . . [G]reat weight is given to the judgment of the trial court because of its opportunity to observe the parties and the evidence. . . . [Wjhere the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, these facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 220-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The plaintiff appears to rely on <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>17 Conn. App. 431, 553 A.2d 631 (1989), to support his claim that the trial court improperly assigned a portion of his inheritance to the defendant. His argument implicitly asserts that the value of the property at the time of inheritance should be assigned to the spouse receiving the property by inheritance, and the other spouse, at most, should share in the preservation and appreciation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In <em>Jackson, </em>the husband inherited real property in 1977 valued at $25,000 for probate purposes. The appraised value of the property at the time of the dissolution was $102,400. The trial court awarded the wife $35,500, which represented one half of the appreciation on the property since the time that the husband had inherited the property, less a 6 percent real estate commission. Id., 432-33. The plaintiff concedes that the facts of <em>Jackson </em>are much different from those in this case. He argues, however, that, although <em>Jackson </em>implies that under \u00a7 46b-81 inherited property could be assigned from one spouse to the other, the <em>Jackson </em>court did not elaborate further.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In our view, the trial court in <em>Jackson, </em>like the trial court in this case, exercised that broad discretion conferred on it by \u00a7 46b-81.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the past, we have declined to pronounce a draconian rule concerning the assignment of inherited property. We likewise reject that invitation today. \u201cThe ultimate question on appellate review is whether the trial court could have concluded as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>did. <em>Dubicki </em>v. <em>Dubicki, </em>186 Conn. 709, 713, 443 A.2d 1268 (1982). Examination of the record, the appellate briefs and consideration of the parties\u2019 oral arguments does not persuade us that the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>36 Conn. App. 597, 601, 652 A.2d 527, cert. denied, 232 Conn. 917, 655 A.2d 260 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\"> The parties separated in February, 1992.
