We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. The defendant and Rosalie Scarpiello were married in 1973. At the wedding, Andrew Lupo, the victim, served as the best man. The defendant and Rosalie Scarpiello were divorced in 1978. After the divorce, the defendant left Connecticut and began dividing his time between Florida and California. The defendant eventually remarried and took up residence in Cahfomia with his new spouse, Frances Scarpiello. Rosalie Scarpiello began a relationship with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In 1979, the defendant visited Connecticut and met with Rosalie Scarpiello at the Grantmoor Hotel. The couple was engaging in sexual intercourse in one of the hotel rooms when the telephone rang. The defendant answered the telephone and the caller was the victim, who was apparently upset that the defendant and Rosalie Scarpiello were engaging in sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">In the summer of 1987, the defendant returned to Connecticut driving a reddish brown pickup truck registered to Frances Scarpiello. After spending several nights at local motels, the defendant moved into a house owned by the victim\u2019s brother at 89 Linnmoore Street in Hartford. The defendant resided in these premises rent free. The victim had previously lived at these premises, but he had been evicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">On at least four occasions after the defendant\u2019s return to Connecticut, the defendant and Rosalie Scarpiello had drinks together. The defendant told Rosalie Scarpiello that he had left his wife and had returned to Connecticut to find a new job and to start over. The defendant also met with the victim, who attempted to help the defendant find a job. On August 13, 1987, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>defendant telephoned Rosalie Scarpiello and asked to meet with her. She declined. The defendant became angry and told her that \u201cno one will ever love you like I did,\u201d and, upon completing this statement, the defendant hung up the telephone. At that time, Rosalie Scarpiello was living with the victim and they planned to be married on December 22, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Rosalie Scarpiello was the owner of Ro\u2019s Place, a bar located on Newington Avenue in Hartford. The victim helped Rosalie run the establishment. On August 14, 1987, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Rosalie Scarpiello and the victim arrived at Ro\u2019s Place. Prior to arriving at the bar-, they were out having a few drinks and getting something to eat. Rosalie Scarpiello remained at the bar until about midnight, when the victim told her to go home. The victim explained that he would stay and close up the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The victim was still at the bar at approximately 1 a.m. on August 15, 1987. He was seated on a bar stool located in the left comer of the bar, angled toward the corner. One of the bar\u2019s entrance doors squeaked when it opened, and the squeak of the door was quickly followed by what sounded like firecrackers exploding. The sound, in fact, was the sound of gunshots. Patrons of the bar observed the defendant with a gun in his right hand, standing six or seven feet away from where the victim was sitting. The defendant had fired about six shots at the victim. The victim stood up, put a hand to his chest, said \u201cOh no,\u201d and fell face down on the floor. The defendant fled with the gun still in his hand, and was seen leaving the parking lot of Ro\u2019s Place in a reddish brown pickup tmck with California plates. The defendant was driving at a high rate of speed with the lights turned off. The vehicle was the pickup truck registered to Frances Scarpiello.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Sergeant Robert Seiler of the Newington police department responded to the call regarding the shooting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>because no Hartford police cruiser was close enough to respond quickly. When Seiler arrived, the victim was lying face down on the floor. Seiler did not observe a gun on the floor or in either of the victim\u2019s hands. Soon after Seiler\u2019s arrival, paramedics arrived on the scene. When the paramedics removed the victim\u2019s pants, Seiler heard something hit the floor with a \u201cclunk,\u201d and then observed a small gun at the victim\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">An autopsy performed on the victim revealed that he had suffered five gunshot wounds, including wounds to the front of his right thigh, the back of his right hand, the front of his right forearm, the right side of his chest, and the right side of his back. The bullets caused injuries to the liver, the right lung and major vessels around the heart. The bullet to the back entered the right side of the victim and traveled in an upward direction to the left side of the body. The bullet damaged the lung and pulverized the liver and was a fatal wound. The shot to the chest caused damage to the major vessels around the heart that was also capable of causing death.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The pickup truck that the defendant was operating at the time of the shooting was found abandoned near the intersection of Dalton and Brown Streets in Hartford. The Hartford police obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant but they could not locate him in the Hartford area. The defendant was apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and local police in Glendale, California, and was returned to Connecticut on June 20, 1989. At the time of his arrest, the defendant gave a voluntary statement to FBI agents that he felt he had shot the victim in self-defense, that he had never seen a gun in the victim\u2019s hand although he assumed that the victim was carrying one, and that he had prevailed in a western style shoot-out because he was faster on the draw than was the victim. The defendant also told the agents that he had thrown his gun into some bushes.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The defendant\u2019s case proceeded to trial on November 2, 1990. At trial, the state and the defendant stipulated that as of August 15, 1987, the defendant did not have a proper pistol or revolver permit issued to him by the city of Hartford. The defendant also admitted that he shot the victim, but claimed that he acted in self-defense pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The defendant testified as follows. After he returned to Connecticut in 1987, he stayed in motels for several nights and then moved into the apartment on Linnmoore Street owned by the victim\u2019s brother. The defendant was aware that the victim had previously lived there and that the victim had been evicted. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>was also aware of the victim\u2019s violent propensities and that the victim carried a gun. The defendant had heard that the victim\u2019s gun had been taken away from him at a bar after he had threatened to shoot his brother over a property dispute. Additionally, the defendant stated that the victim was jealous and resentful because the defendant was back in town. According to the defendant, the victim was also becoming angry because the patrons at Ro\u2019s Place were making comments about the fact that Rosalie Scarpiello and the defendant had been seen together.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The defendant testified that the animosity between him and the victim was increasing. Consequently, the defendant felt that it was necessary to meet with the victim. The defendant and the victim met for breakfast on two separate occasions, the second meeting taking place two days before the shooting. The first meeting was amicable. The second meeting was not amicable, and the victim accused the defendant of sneaking around with Rosalie Scarpiello. According to the defendant, the victim asked whether the defendant had come back to \u201cbreak his balls.\u201d After the second meeting, the defendant claimed to have grown a little \u201cleery\u201d of the victim and testified that he became apprehensive about his relationship with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The defendant testified that on the evening of August 14, 1987, he called Ro\u2019s Place from a pay telephone to speak with Rosalie Scarpiello about a possible loan. According to the defendant, the victim answered the telephone and said to the defendant, \u201cyou motherfucker, don\u2019t ever call this bar again or you\u2019re dead.\u201d After this conversation, the defendant was extremely concerned that the victim would be lying in wait for him on Linnmoore Street. The defendant knew that the victim had previously lived in the same house, and the defendant was concerned that the victim could gain access to the house in some manner. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>decided to sit in his truck and think about what he should do. He finally decided to go to Ro\u2019s Place to try to work things out with the victim. He drove to the bar, parked the truck in the back of the parking lot and locked the door. The defendant had a pistol in his vehicle, and he took the pistol and placed it in his pants pocket under his shirt as a \u201cprecautionary\u201d measure, just in case the victim \u201cwent a little wacky.\u201d The defendant claimed that he always carried a pistol in his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The defendant claimed that he entered the bar and that the victim, who was seated on a bar stool, spotted the defendant and immediately began to get off of the stool. According to the defendant, the victim faced the defendant and said \u201cyou fucker,\u201d swung the stool in front of him, dropped into a crouched position, and held up the stool as a shield. The defendant observed the victim\u2019s hand move toward his pocket, and at that moment, the defendant saw the handle of a gun. The defendant testified that he fired his gun in the general direction of the victim in an attempt to incapacitate him. According to the defendant, the victim\u2019s gun and the victim both fell to the floor, and when the victim slumped to the floor, the defendant stopped firing. The defendant admitted that he fired the first shot, but he did not remember how many shots he fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The defendant asserted that after the shooting he turned and walked out of the bar and went to the truck. He exited the parking lot without turning on the vehicle\u2019s lights, claiming that he was in such a daze that he forgot to do so. He fled because he was afraid that the victim\u2019s family would seek revenge. Furthermore, because a member of the victim\u2019s family was a Hartford police officer, the defendant felt that the investigation of the shooting would be biased and that he would not receive a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The defendant further asserted that he drove the truck until it ran out of gas, and then abandoned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>track on a side street near Goodwin Park in Hartford. He also stated that he threw away the gun. The defendant then hitchhiked to New Haven. From New Haven, he took a bus to New York. He then went to Fort Myers, Florida, where he worked on a shrimp boat. The defendant became concerned that the police might look for him in the Fort Myers area because his former wife had relatives in that area. The defendant finally returned to California where he was eventually apprehended and arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The jury acquitted the defendant of the murder count and found him guilty of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. The jury also found the defendant guilty of carrying a pistol without a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court\u2019s comments and accompanying facial gestures directed toward the defendant\u2019s credibility exhibited partiality toward the state and violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process of law, to a fair and impartial trial by jury, and to present a defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">We first address the aspect of the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the trial court\u2019s facial gestures. At trial, defense counsel complained that the trial court \u201cmad[e] faces\u201d and was \u201cgrimacing\u201d while defense counsel questioned the defendant about the defendant\u2019s intentions upon entering Ro\u2019s Place at the time of the shooting. The trial court, however, neither denied nor acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>that it had engaged in such conduct. Other than the complaint by defense counsel, the transcript is silent with respect to the trial court\u2019s facial expressions during defense counsel\u2019s questioning regarding the defendant\u2019s intent. Consequently, the record is not adequate for us to review the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the trial court\u2019s facial expressions. Therefore, \u201c[w]e cannot conclude that the defendant has shown that the trial court\u2019s demeanor or conduct denied him a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boone, </em>15 Conn. App. 34, 49-50, 544 A.2d 217, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 811, 550 A.2d 1084 (1988) (defendant unable to show on appeal that trial court laughed or snickered and could not prevail on claim that such conduct precluded him from obtaining fair trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We next address the defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court made inappropriate comments in its ruling on whether the defendant should be permitted to testily as to his intentions upon entering Ro\u2019s Place at the time of the shooting. On direct examination, defense counsel asked the defendant whether he intended to kill the victim. The state\u2019s attorney objected to the question and the trial court sustained the objection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When defense counsel made a second attempt to question the defendant as to whether he intended to kill the victim, the state\u2019s attorney again objected. The trial court, in the course of its ruling on the state\u2019s objection, permitted defense counsel to ask the question, but commented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>disparagingly on the \u201cworth\u201d of the testimony and stated that it was going to give the jury an instruction on credibility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subsequently, the defendant asked for a short recess. The jury was excused and the defendant moved the trial court for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion. When the jury returned to the courtroom, the trial court, sua sponte, gave an instruction with respect to its colloquy with defense counsel. As part of the instruction, the trial court directed the jury to disregard the comments that the trial court made during the direct examination of the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The state concedes that the trial court\u2019s comment regarding the \u201cworth\u201d of the defendant\u2019s testimony and the trial court\u2019s statements that it was going to give an instruction to the jury on credibility were inappropriate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While we agree that the statements at issue were inappropriate and should not have been made, this does not end our inquiry. In determining whether a trial court\u2019s comments directed at the credibility of a testifying defendant deprived the defendant of his constitutional rights, our Supreme Court has examined such comments in the context of the entire trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>193 Conn. 350, 366-67, 478 A.2d 581 (1984). We find that in the context of the entire trial, the comments of the trial court did not deprive the defendant of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Our determination that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights have not been violated is heavily influenced by the fact that the trial court, in its instructions after the recess and in its charge to the jury, \u201crestored the defendant\u2019s testimony to the same ground as other witnesses\u2019 testimony.\u201d Id., 367. After the jury returned to the courtroom following the short recess requested by the defendant, the trial court immediately made reference to the colloquy that preceded the recess and instructed the jury to \u201cdisregard everything that was said by the court during the course of that colloquy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>because I was wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court also explained that it had sustained the state\u2019s objection to the form of defense counsel\u2019s question about the defendant\u2019s intent at the time of the shooting, and that defense counsel was free to question the defendant about such intent as long as the form of the question was proper. The defendant neither objected to this instruction nor requested that the trial court amplify or extend its statement in any way. After the trial court gave the instruction and inquired, \u201cOkay, [defense counsel]?\u201d defense counsel immediately resumed questioning. Defense counsel proceeded to ask the defendant, \u201cwhen you went into the bar did you intend to shoot [the victim]?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney did not object to the question and the trial court did not intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In its charge to the jury at the close of trial, the trial court admitted that it had been wrong during the colloquy about the defendant\u2019s right to testify as to his intent at the time of the shooting, and that the defendant had the right to testify about such intent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In its charge, the trial court also properly instructed the jury as to the differing responsibilities of the court and the jury. The court charged that the jury is the sole and absolute judge of the facts of the case, and that anything the court says about the facts is not binding on the jury. Moreover, the trial court charged that the jury is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>exclusive judge of the credibility of witnesses and that it is the jury\u2019s duty to determine the weight to be given to the testimony of any witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We are satisfied that the trial court\u2019s instruction candidly admitting that it was wrong and to disregard its comments, coupled with its charge regarding the defendant\u2019s right to testify and the proper roles of the trial court and the jury concerning fact-finding and assessments of credibility, taken in the context of the whole record, adequately protected the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. The trial court acted promptly and firmly to dispel any possible prejudice or import that the jury could ascribe to the trial court\u2019s improper remarks. The trial court\u2019s forceful actions thus restored the defendant\u2019s testimony to the same level playing field as that of any other witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 367. We cannot conclude that the jury ignored the instructions and the charge of the trial court and \u201cinstead fixated on the court\u2019s [remarks] to determine credibility and ultimately guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is without merit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court violated his state<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and federal constitutional rights when it improperly instructed the jury on three separate components of self-defense. The defendant posits that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>rights to due process of law, to present a defense and to a fair trial were violated. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We begin by examining the fundamental principles of law that govern our review of this claim. It is a fundamental element of due process that a defendant charged with the commission of a crime be permitted to establish a defense. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967). Furthermore, \u201c[a] person is entitled to a proper jury instruction on the elements of every defense that the legislature has created so that the jury may determine whether the state has sustained its burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>32 Conn. App. 687, 692, 631 A.2d 324, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 932, 632 A.2d 708 (1993). It is the function of the jury charge to assist the jury in applying the law correctly to the facts that the jury finds to be established. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u201cAn improper instruction on a defense, like an improper instruction on an element of an offense, is of constitutional dimension. ... In either instance, [t]he standard of review to be applied to the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. ... In determining whether it was indeed reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 284, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We first address the defendant\u2019s challenge to that portion of the trial court\u2019s self-defense charge relating to the degree of force used by the defendant. The defendant asserts that the trial court misguided the jury when it instructed that \u201creasonable force\u201d is \u201cthat force which an average person of ordinary intelligence and like circumstances would judge to be necessary to prevent injury and no more.\u201d The defendant contends that this particular aspect of the charge improperly directed the jury to employ a simple objective standard in determining whether the defendant reasonably believed it necessary to use deadly physical force to defend himself. Thus, the defendant posits that the instruction failed to explain adequately to the jury the necessity of examining and evaluating the defendant\u2019s subjective belief as to the amount of force necessary to defend himself. The state, however, responds that taking the charge as a whole, the trial court sufficiently instructed the jury as to the law governing the degree of force that may be justifiably used in self-defense. According to the state, the charge properly conveyed to the jury that the defendant\u2019s subjective perspective must be considered in evaluating the degree of force used by the defendant. Although we agree with the defendant that an instruction employing only a simple objective standard would not withstand constitutional challenge in isolation; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>25 Conn. App. 456, 464, 595 A.2d 895, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 916, 597 A.2d 339 (1991); we are satisfied that from the facts of the case, the issues presented, and the charge as a whole, there is no reasonable possibility that the trial court\u2019s instruction misled the jury to an improper verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>A person may justifiably use deadly physical force in self-defense pursuant to \u00a7 53a-19 (a) \u201conly if he <em>reasonably </em>believes <em>both </em>that (1) his attacker is using or about to use deadly physical force against him, or is inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm, <em>and </em>(2) that deadly physical force is necessary to repel such attack. . . . We repeatedly have indicated that the test a jury must apply in analyzing the second requirement, i.e., that the defendant reasonably believed that deadly force, as opposed to some lesser degree of force, was necessary to repel the victim\u2019s alleged attack, is a \u2018subjective-objective\u2019 one.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) Id., 285-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u201cThe subjective-objective inquiry into the defendant\u2019s belief regarding the necessary degree of force requires that the jury make two separate affirmative determinations in order for the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense to succeed. First, the jury must determine whether, on the basis of all of the evidence presented, the defendant in fact had believed that he had needed to use deadly physical force, as opposed to some lesser degree of force, in order to repel the victim\u2019s alleged attack. . . . The jury\u2019s initial determination, therefore, requires the jury to assess the veracity of witnesses, often including the defendant, and to determine whether the defendant\u2019s account of his belief in the necessity to use deadly force at the time of the confrontation is in fact credible. This probe into the defendant\u2019s actual state of mind clearly demonstrates the function of the jury in [its] evaluation of the self-defense claim.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 286-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u201cIf the jury determines that the defendant had not believed that he had needed to employ deadly physical force to repel the victim\u2019s attack, the jury\u2019s inquiry ends, and the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim must fail. If, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ever, the jury determines that the defendant in fact had believed that the use of deadly force was necessary, the jury must make a further determination as to whether <em>that belief </em>was reasonable, from the perspective of a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances. . . . Thus, if a jury determines that the defendant\u2019s honest belief that he had needed to use deadly force, instead of some lesser degree of force, was not a reasonable belief, the defendant is not entitled to the protection of \u00a7 53a-19.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) Id., 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The self-defense issue in this case was marked by the divergent testimony of the witnesses present at the time of the shooting. While no witness observed the defendant enter the premises, there was evidence that the door through which the defendant entered made a squeaking noise that was heard by several patrons and that almost as soon as the door squeaked the defendant fired at the victim. The defendant admitted that he fired first, but he testified that he fired in response to his observation of the victim getting off of a bar stool and reaching for a pocketed gun, which eventually fell out of the victim\u2019s hand after the victim was shot. There was also testimony, however, that when the victim\u2019s body was examined at the scene of the shooting, his weapon had not been drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In our examination of the trial court\u2019s charge as a whole, we conclude that the charge adequately alerted the jury that it must consider both subjective and objective factors in determining whether the defendant reasonably believed that deadly force was necessary to repel the victim\u2019s alleged attack. In this regard, the trial court instructed that \u201cthe danger or apparent danger claimed by the defendant <em>is to be determined from, his standpoint </em>at the time of the attack and under all the existing circumstances. The act leading to the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense may not be an actual threat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>or assault The test is not what the other person actually intended, but what the aggressor\u2019s act caused the defendant to reasonably believe was his intention.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, the trial court noted that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s belief of danger must be honest and sincere.\u201d Thus, the trial court clearly alerted the jury that it must evaluate the defendant\u2019s subjective beliefs as to the degree of force necessary to protect himself. After these instructions, the trial court described reasonable force as the amount of force that would be used by an average person. The court stated: \u201cIn deciding whether the force used in this case is reasonable, you may examine such factors as the physical attributes of the parties involved, including age, sex, height and weight. The use of deadly force is reasonable only to resist a threat of death or serious physical harm. You people are going to have to make some decisions whether or not such a threat existed.\u201d Thus, the trial court also alerted the jury that it must determine whether the defendant\u2019s perception of danger was objectively reasonable. Finally, in a supplemental charge, the trial court reiterated the need to consider both subjective and objective factors. The trial court instructed that the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense would fail if the state proved, inter alia, that the defendant \u201cdid not <em>really believe </em>that he was in imminent danger\u201d <em>and </em>that he \u201chad no <em>reasonable grounds to believe </em>that he was going to have to act in self-defense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This particular instruction essentially mirrors the interpretation of \u00a7 53a-19 that our case law requires. See id., 285-87; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 25 Conn. App. 464. Thus, the charge sufficiently apprised the jury that the test for self-defense is both subjective and objective. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 466. It is therefore \u201cnot reasonably possible that the jury could have concluded that its inquiry was to be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>solely in an objective manner.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 290.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s attack on that portion of the trial court\u2019s self-defense charge relating to the concept of \u201cinitial aggressor.\u201d The defendant asserts that the trial court failed to instruct the jury specifically that the first person to use physical force was not necessarily the initial aggressor. According to the defendant, the trial court therefore misled the juiy to believe that in a self-defense case, the first person to use force, such as the defendant here, must be considered the initial aggressor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Jiminez, </em>228 Conn. 335, 636 A.2d 782 (1994) in support of this claim. The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Jiminez </em>is misplaced. In that case, the trial court affirmatively charged the juiy that an initial aggressor is necessarily the person who first uses physical force; id., 338; and our Supreme Court determined that such a charge constituted reversible error. Id., 342. In <em>Jiminez, </em>however, our Supreme Court \u201cdid not indicate that a trial court must <em>explicitly state </em>that the \u2018initial aggressor\u2019 is not necessarily the first person to use force.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 293 n.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">We rely on our Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 293, to resolve this claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>In Prioleau, </em>as in the present case, \u201c[although the trial court did not specifically instruct the jury that the initial aggressor is not necessarily the first person actually to employ the use of force, that premise was implicit throughout the entire self-defense instruction.\u201d Id. The trial court clearly instructed the jury that \u201c[a] person is justified in the use of reasonable physical force on another when he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to protect himself or another person from the use <em>or impending use </em>of physical force [by] another.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court also instructed the jury that it must find the defendant not guilty on the ground of self-defense if the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe defendant did not believe that he was in <em>imminent </em>danger of death or injury and that the use of force was not necessary to protect himself.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court also referred to the danger or <em>apparent </em>danger that the defendant claimed to have faced, and also correctly paraphrased the language of \u00a7 53a-19 (a) that the defendant \u201cmay justifiably use deadly force only if he reasonably believed that the other person was using <em>or about to use </em>deadly physical force\u201d or \u201cthe other person was inflicting <em>or about to inflict </em>great bodily harm.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Thus, as was the Supreme Court in <em>Prioleau, </em>we are persuaded that \u201c[i]n light of the entire self-defense instruction . . . the trial court sufficiently apprised the jury that it could have found the defendant not guilty of murder [or manslaughter] on the ground of self-defense even if the defendant was the first person actually to have used physical force, so long as the defendant had reasonably believed that the victim was about to use deadly physical force against him.\u201d Id., 293-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The defendant\u2019s last claim with respect to the trial court\u2019s self-defense charge relates to the trial court\u2019s instruction on the duty to retreat. The defendant claims that the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to instruct that \u00a7 53a-19 (b) requires a defendant to retreat rather than use deadly physical force only where the defendant <em>knows </em>that he can retreat with complete safety. The defendant concedes that he neither requested an instruction concerning the duty to retreat nor excepted to the trial court\u2019s charge concerning the duty to retreat. Thus, the defendant seeks review of this issue under the well established principles of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or under the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 4185.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The trial court charged the jury that \u201c[t]he law does not encourage the use of deadly force, and in most circumstances a person must retreat from a perceived harm if he\u2019s able to do so with complete safety.\u201d Later, the trial court also stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any retreating in this case, because I think, based upon the defendant\u2019s own testimony, that there was no time for retreat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">This court has already held that a charge on the duty to retreat is flawed if it fails to instruct the jury to consider the subjective component of the duty to retreat: the defendant\u2019s knowledge of his ability to retreat. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>34 Conn. App. 610, 617, 642 A.2d 1223 (1994). The state concedes, and we agree, that the trial court\u2019s charge failed to address this subjective component properly. Id., 617. Nevertheless, we find that such failure constituted harmless error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>209 Conn. 34, 46, 547 A.2d 534 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 47-48, our Supreme Court determined that under the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>stances of that case, the failure of the trial court to charge on the subjective component of the duty to retreat was harmless error, because \u201c \u2018[t]he principal factual issues . . . were not classically dependent upon [the subtleties of the law of self-defense] for their proof, as is true in cases where the principal factual issue is the . . . [defendant\u2019s subjective knowledge of the availability of safe escape].\u2019 \u201d We conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to charge on the subjective component was harmless for the same reasons as those set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>supra, 47-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Here, the issue of retreat was not presented to the jury as a significant factor to consider in the resolution of the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The jury was presented with two conflicting versions of the shooting, neither of which implicated the duty to retreat. The jury\u2019s principal task was to determine which version of the event was more plausible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 618. Thus, because the issue of retreat in this case was relatively insignificant, we find that the self-defense instruction, read as a whole, \u201calthough not in strict accordance with \u00a7 53a-19 (b), presented the case to the jmy in such a manner that no injustice resulted.\u201d Id. We conclude that the defendant cannot satisfy the fourth prong of <em>Golding </em>because the improper instruction constituted harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the trial court improperly commented on the defendant\u2019s credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u201cin a manner that was not evenhanded.\u201d The defendant acknowledges that the trial court correctly instructed the jury that a witness\u2019 interest in the outcome of a case may be considered in determining that witness\u2019 credibility.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant asserts, however, that in four separate instances, the trial court improperly \u201csingled out\u201d the defendant\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case as compared to the other witnesses\u2019 interests in the outcome of the case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendant posits that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>this constituted a violation of rights guaranteed to him by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States and by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The defendant concedes that this claim was not properly preserved for review by this court, and accordingly seeks review under the aegis of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u201c \u2018We have treated the basic claim that specific mention of the defendant\u2019s interest infringes upon his right to a fair trial as falling within the claimed deprivation of a \u201cfundamental constitutional right\u201d . . . [and] [w]e must, therefore, examine the nuances of language belatedly relied upon by the defendant, only for the purpose of determining whether they are significant enough to have affected the fairness of his trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>220 Conn. 385, 396-97, 599 A.2d 1053 (1991), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>197 Conn. 629, 637, 500 A.2d 1303 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court\u2019s four references to the defendant\u2019s interest in the outcome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of the case were not \u201cevenhanded\u201d is not supported by the record. The trial court specifically instructed the jury that in weighing the testimony of the defendant, the same principles should be applied as are applied to any other witness\u2019 testimony. Similarly, the trial court carefully reiterated to the jury that the defendant stands before it like any other witness and is entitled to have his testimony measured in the same way as that of any other witness. The trial court further reminded the jury that it must weigh \u201call the factors\u201d that the trial court has enunciated regarding credibility. The trial court also prudently noted that the same standards of credibility attached to the defendant\u2019s testimony as attached to that of any other witness. Finally, the trial court reminded the jury of the trial court\u2019s general charge on credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Thus, the continual emphasis by the trial court was that the testimony of the defendant was to be evaluated in the same fashion as that of the other witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 397. In such situations, both our Supreme Court and this court have held that a defendant\u2019s claim of lack of evenhandedness is without merit. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>37 Conn. App. 635, 640-41, 657 A.2d 247, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 911, 660 A.2d 354 (1995). \u201cWe have repeatedly approved the use of similar language and do not find its use here unduly repetitive or transcending the bounds of evenhandedness.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 397; <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>supra, 640.

In that case, the Supreme Court rejected the state\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 46-48, because \u201c[u]nlike the circumstances in <em>Quintana, </em>the state\u2019s case [in <em>Ash] </em>hinged substantially on whether the defendant, at some point either prior to or during the fatal altercation, failed to retreat within the meaning of the self-defense statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>supra, 498.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b239-5\"> The trial court charged the jury on the issue of credibility of witnesses as follows: \u201cNow there is another area where you have the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to make certain findings, and that deals with the credibility of witnesses. Only you people <em>can </em>determine which witnesses are credible and which are not credible. The credibility of witnesses and the weight, to be given is\u2014to their testimony are matters which axe peculiarly your function to determine .... And in weighing the testimony of a witness you should consider his appearance on the stand, you try to seize him up. And you have in mind all those little circumstances which point to his truthfulness or his untruthfulness. You should consider any possible bias or prejudice that witness may have, whether for or against the accused or the state. Witnesses\u2019 interest or lack of interest of whatever sort in the outcome of the trial, his ability to observe facts correctly and to remember and relate them truly and accurately. You should test the evidence the witness gives you by your own knowledge of human nature and the motives which influence and control human nature.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\"> The defendant belatedly claims that the following four instances constitute improper comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">(1) After discussing the credibility of witnesses in general, the trial court specifically addressed the issue of the credibility of the defendant as a witness as follows: \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to address now as to the accused taking the stand as a witness. Now, an accused does not\u2014is not obliged to take the witness stand in his own behalf. On the other hand, the accused has a perfect right to do so, as this particular' defendant has done. In weighing the testimony he has given you, you should apply the exact same principles by which the testimony of other witnesses are tested, and that necessarily involves a consideration of interest in the outcome of the case. You\u2019ll consider the importance to the accused of the outcome of the trial and his motives on that account, for not telling the truth. An accused person, having taken the witness stand, stands before you just like any other witness and is entitled to the same consideration and must have his testimony measured in the same way as any other witness, including, however, his interest in the verdict you are going to be asked to render.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">(2) In the course of discussing intent as an element of the crime of murder, the trial court stated: \u201cNow intent is a mental process. A person may take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the stand and testily as to what his intention was. And incidentally, I want to reiterate here that the defendant had a perfect right to get on the stand and say what his intent was. You may recall there was a colloquy between me and the defense attorney about that issue. I was wrong and they were right, and he is entitled to take the stand and testily to his intent. Now you may believe that testimony or not according to whether or not you find that it warrants belief. And that\u2019s going to go back to the credibility you attach to the defendant\u2019s testimony after you\u2019ve weighed all the factors that I\u2019ve given you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">(3) In discussing the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense, the trial court stated in part: \u201cAgain, that was the defendant\u2019s testimony. And whether you accept it or not is up to you. You apply the standards of credibility to his testimony just as you do for all the other witnesses, as I said before. And you do consider his interest in the outcome of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">(4) In discussing the issue of evidence relating to consciousness of guilt, the trial court stated in part: \u201cAn accused person [is not] obliged to take the witness stand in his own behalf. On the other hand\u2014well, I\u2019ve already charged you on that, credibility. You can\u2014as far as the defendant taking the stand, a factor you can [consider in] determining his credibility is his interest in the outcome of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\"> See footnote 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
