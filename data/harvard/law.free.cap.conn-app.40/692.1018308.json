J.</author>\n<p id=\"agk-dedup-0\">In this declaratory judgment action, the plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seek a judgment declaring a decision of the zoning board of appeals of the town of Fairfield (board) null and void. The trial court refused to grant declaratory relief and rendered judgment in favor of the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment to this court. Because we conclude that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to render a judgment on the present record, we reverse the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">The following facts are necessary for the resolution of this appeal. On June 23, 1993, the plaintiffs applied to the board for a variance for their property located at 1011 Fairfield Beach Road in the town of Fairfield. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Legal notice of a public hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application was published in a Fairfield newspaper on June 25 and July 2, 1993. The legal notice listed the date of the public hearing as July 8, 1993. In addition to legal notice, the board posted notice on the plaintiffs\u2019 property that provided that a public hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application would be held on July 5, 1993.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The hearing was actually conducted on July 8, 1993. Thereafter, the board issued a decision granting in part, and denying in part, the plaintiffs\u2019 variance application.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">On July 29, 1993, the plaintiffs filed this action in the Superior Court seeking to void the board\u2019s decision, which partially denied their request for a variance. The plaintiffs claimed that notice of the public hearing was improper and contradictory and, thus, deprived them of due process of law. On April 26, 1993, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision in which it found that the plaintiffs had abandoned the issue of whether the notice was improper due to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to brief that issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fact, no brief had been filed in this case. The trial court, however, had reviewed the brief in a companion zoning appeal<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and concluded that the legal notice that was published in a Fairfield newspaper complied with General Statutes \u00a7 8-7.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court also stated that the \u201c[posted] notice was not legally required and amounts to personal not statutory notice. While this additional notice may have been misleading, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>it did not mislead the plaintiffs, who attended or were represented at the public hearing on July 8. Attendance at the hearing is a waiver of any defect in the notice as to them.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">We initially note that the relief sought by the plaintiffs, as stated in their complaint, is for \u201c[a]n order declaring the decision rendered by the defendant board be declared null and void.\u201d Neither the phrase \u201cdeclaratory judgment\u201d nor the phrase \u201cdeclaratory relief\u201d appears in the complaint; we nonetheless conclude that the language used in the complaint is sufficient to be treated as alleging that the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment. See <em>Beit </em>v. <em>Beit, </em>135 Conn. 195, 202, 63 A.2d 161 (1948). The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, therefore, invokes the declaratory judgment provision of General Statutes \u00a7 52-29,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as implemented by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 389<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 390.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Mannweiler </em>v. <em>LaFlamme, </em>232 Conn. 27, 34, 653 A.2d 168 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-29 (a) permits the Superior-Court to \u201cdeclare rights and other legal relations.\u201d In order for a trial court to have jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action, the notice requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d) must be satisfied. <em>Mannweiler </em>v. <em>LaFlamme, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Because neither the Appellate Court record nor the trial court file disclosed compliance with \u00a7 390 (d), we asked the parties for clarification. At oral argument, counsel for the plaintiffs conceded that the plaintiffs have not attempted to obtain, nor had the trial court issued, an order of notice. This lack of notice deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to render a judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">This conclusion, however, does not necessarily require a dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 action. \u201cA jurisdictional defect relating to notice can be remedied in any of the ways noted in <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Raymark Corporation, </em>[215 Conn. 224, 230, 575 A.2d 693 (1990)].\u201d <em>Serrani </em>v. <em>Board of Ethics, </em>225 Conn. 305, 309, 622 A.2d 1009 (1993). On remand, the plaintiffs may take appropriate action to cure the jurisdictional defect regarding the notice requirement. <em>Mannweiller </em>v. <em>LaFlamme, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The only pleading before the trial court was the complaint. There is no answer, special defense or counterclaim and the record is devoid of any of the standard pleadings as provided by Practice Book \u00a7 112. \u201cThe proposition that the pleadings frame the issues before a trial court is well established in our caselaw.\u201d <em>Doublewal Corp. </em>v. <em>Toffolon, </em>195 Conn. 384, 390, 488 A.2d 444 (1985). In order properly to adjudicate a case, \u201ca trial court must have, \u2018[b]esides jurisdiction of the person of the defendant and of the general subject-matter of the action . . . jurisdiction of the precise question which its judgment assumes to decide, or of the particular remedy or relief which it assumes to grant.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting 1 Black, Judgments (2d Ed. 1902) \u00a7 242; <em>New Haven Sand Blast Co. </em>v. <em>Dreisbach, </em>104 Conn. 322, 329-30, 133 A. 99 (1926); <em>Case </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>93 Conn. 550, 552-53, 106 A. 822 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The issues in this case have not been joined and the case was not ready for final judgment when the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>court decided it. See <em>Cavalli </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>174 Conn. 212, 215, 384 A.2d 374 (1978). \u201cA failure to close the pleadings, where all the parties were present and represented, will not fatally affect the jurisdiction of a case.\u201d <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Rummel, </em>33 Conn. App. 214, 219, 635 A.2d 295 (1993). Because we must remand the case in order to cure the lack of the notice required by \u00a7 390 (d), we also remand with direction to the trial court to open the judgment so that the pleadings may be closed, thus enabling the trial court to properly adjudicate the issues as framed by the pleadings. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-11\"> The plaintiffs in this appeal are John C.
