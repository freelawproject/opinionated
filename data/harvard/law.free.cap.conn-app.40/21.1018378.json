We find those issues to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ... (4) displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm, except that in any prosecution under this subdivision, it is an affirmative defense that such pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm was not a weapon from which a shot could be discharged. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The information charged a violation of subsection (a) (4) of the statute, but omitted the words \u201cwhat he represents by his words or conduct to be.\u201d The evidence revealed that the defendant displayed what he represented to be a gun and threatened to shoot the victim. The defense was misidentification. The court read \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) to the jury and told them several times that they had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe defendant displayed or threatened the use of what he represented by his words or conduct to be a firearm\u201d in order to convict him. The defendant makes no claim of lack of notice, surprise or prejudice. There is no merit to this claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>37 Conn.
