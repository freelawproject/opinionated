The plaintiffs assert that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>improperly (1) concluded that their claim was preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq.; and (2) refused to consider legislation pending in Congress that would clarify the issue of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was, in fact, preempted by ERISA. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The following facts are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. The Stone Building Company (general contractor), a defendant in this action, entered into an agreement to construct the Jewish Community Center of Greater New Haven. The project was a bonded public project. The general contractor hired CA-MI Contracting, Inc. (subcontractor), to perform the masonry work required for the project. The subcontractor thereafter hired members of a labor union to perform the work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to an agreement between the subcontractor and the labor union, the subcontractor was required to contribute to the Connecticut Bricklayer\u2019s Pension Fund (fund). This fund constitutes a recognized employee pension benefit plan established pursuant to \u00a7 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, later amended as 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186, and also constitutes an employee benefit plan established pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002 (1), (2) and (3). The plaintiffs in this action are duly appointed trustees of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">On July 28,1992, the general contractor on the project entered into a labor and material payment bond with the named defendant, Insurance Company of North America (surety) as required by General Statutes \u00a7 49-41.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the terms of the bond, the surety promised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>to pay subcontractors and suppliers for labor performed and materials supplied on the project in the event of nonpayment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Payments for labor included payments of pension and health contributions into the plaintiffs\u2019 fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The subcontractor subsequently defaulted on its payments into the fund. The plaintiffs, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-42,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> served written notice on the surety and the general contractor, as principal on the bond, seeking payment for the contributions owed to the fund by the subcontractor. After the defendants refused to make the required payments, the plaintiffs filed a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>plaint pursuant to \u00a7 49-42.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that ERISA preempted the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion and later denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The plaintiffs first challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion that ERISA preempts their claim brought pursuant to \u00a7 49-42. The plaintiffs maintain that their claim is not preempted because (1) \u00a7 49-42 does not sufficiently \u201crelate to any employee benefit plan\u201d as required by \u00a7 514 (a) of ERISA; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 (a); (2) ERISA does not adequately provide redress to the plaintiffs since ERISA excludes a surety from its definition of an employer, (3) \u00a7 49-42 concerns the business of insurance and is thus exempt from preemption, (4) ERISA affords to state courts concurrent jurisdiction over actions by participants and beneficiaries, and (5) remedial statutes, such as \u00a7 49-41, that merely provide an enforcement mechanism, are not subject to federal preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Our discussion of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is preempted by ERISA necessarily begins with an analysis of ERISA\u2019s preemption provision. Section 514 (a) of ERISA; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 (a); provides for the preemption of \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in section 1003 (a) . . . .\u201d The United States Supreme Court has addressed a standard for determining whether a state law <em>\u201crelates to\u201d </em>any employee benefit plan. (Emphasis added.) <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85, 96-97, 103 S. Ct. 2890, 77 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1983). \u201cA law \u2018relates to\u2019 an employee benefit plan, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d Id.; see also <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Greater Washington Board of Trade, </em>506 U.S. 125, 129-30, 113 S. Ct. 580, 121 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1992) (\u201cERISA pre-empts any state law that refers to or has a connection with covered benefit plans . . . \u2018even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only indirect . . .\u2019 and even if the law is \u2018consistent with ERISA\u2019s substantive requirements\u2019 \u201d [citations omitted]); <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>514 U.S. 645, 656, 115 S. Ct. 1671, 131 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Our resolution of whether \u00a7 49-41 \u201crelates to\u201d any employee benefit plan is greatly facilitated by two cases recently decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that are factually analogous to the present case. In <em>Greenblatt </em>v. <em>Delta Plumbing &amp; Heating Corp., </em>68 F.3d 561 (2d Cir. 1995), decided October 13, 1995, the defendant-surety appealed from the judgment of the District Court awarding recovery on a surety bond to the plaintiffs. On appeal, the defendant claimed that the federal District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs\u2019 claim on the bond that was issued pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Id., 567.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Because federal jurisdiction over a state law claim can arise through the preemption of that state law claim, the Second Circuit entertained the issue of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was preempted by ERISA. \u201cIn determining whether a state law [relates to any employee benefit plan], we look first to see whether that law makes explicit reference to ERISA plans. . . . If it does not, we inquire whether pre-emption would serve the basic purpose of \u00a7 514 (a): namely, to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 574. The court then found that \u201cstate surety law makes no explicit reference to ERISA plans and does not . . . regulate them in any fashion. Nor does the application of state surety law to bonds ensuring ERISA obligations threaten a \u2018multiplicity of regulation\u2019 that would interfere with \u2018the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.\u2019 \u201d Id; see also <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>supra, 514 U.S. 656-58. The Second Circuit therefore concluded that \u201c[a]lthough obviously affecting and involving ERISA plans, <em>surety bond claims are not pre-empted by \u00a7 514 (a).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greenblatt </em>v. <em>Delta Plumbing &amp; Heating Corp., </em>supra, 68 F.3d 574; see also <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Lanier Collection Agency &amp; Service, </em>486 U.S. 825, 833, 108 S. Ct. 2182, 100 L. Ed. 2d 836 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The Second Circuit reached the same conclusion in <em>Bleiler v. Cristwood Construction, Inc., </em>72 F.3d 13 (2d Cir. 1995), decided December 8, 1995, when the court addressed the identical issue now confronting us, spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>cifically, whether ERISA preempts claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 49-42. In <em>Bleiler, </em>the Second Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court dismissing the plaintiff-trustee\u2019s \u00a7 49-42 claim on the ground that the state law claim was preempted by ERISA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On an appeal brought by the plaintiff, the Second Circuit, relying on its recent decision in <em>Greenblatt, </em>concluded that the \u201cstate contract claim on [the] surety bond was not preempted by ERISA . . . [because] such a claim neither related to any employee benefit plan nor conflicted with any enforcement mechanism specified in ERISA.\u201d Id., 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Because the issue of preemption is a matter of federal law; <em>Times Mirror Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Public Utility Control, </em>192 Conn. 506, 510, 473 A.2d 768 (1984); we are bound by the decision in <em>Bleiler </em>under the supremacy clause of article six of the United States constitution. While \u00a7\u00a7 49-41 and 49-42 have an obvious effect on ERISA plans, the statutes do not explicitly make reference to ERISA plans or regulate such plans in any fashion. As such, \u00a7\u00a7 49-41 and 49-42 do not sufficiently \u201crelate to any employee benefit plan\u201d to fall within the preemption provision of \u00a7 514 (a) of ERISA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 [a]). The trial court, therefore, should have denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The plaintiffs also assert on appeal that the trial court improperly refused to consider pending legislation in Congress that would clarify the issue of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was preempted by ERISA. Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>have independently concluded that \u00a7 49-42 claims are not preempted by ERISA, we need not address the merits of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\"> The labor union involved in this action is the District Council of Northern Connecticut of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, AFL-CIO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-41 provides in pertinent part: \u201cPublic structures.
