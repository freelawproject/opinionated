We conclude that the bond provision of \u00a7 47a-35a (a) does not apply to this appeal and, therefore, deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">After the defendant failed to pay rent pursuant to a lease agreement between the parties, the plaintiff commenced a summary process action. The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">The plaintiff argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 47a-35a (a), upon filing its appeal, the defendant was required to give a bond to guarantee payment of rents that may accrue while the appeal is pending. Section 47a-35a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen any appeal is taken by the defendant occupying a <em>dwelling unit </em>as defined in section 47a-l in an action of summary process, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>shall, within the period allowed for taking such appeal, give a bond with surety to the adverse party to guarantee payment for all rents that may accrue during the pen-dency of such appeal . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The defendant asserts that \u00a7 47a-35a (a) does not apply to this appeal because the defendant does not occupy a dwelling unit as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 47a-l. Section 47a-l (c) defines a dwelling unit as \u201cany house or building, or portion thereof, which is occupied, is designed to be occupied, or is rented, leased or hired out to be occupied, as a home or residence of one or more persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The parties\u2019 lease agreement is entitled \u201cshopping center lease\u201d and provides for the use of the leased premises as a restaurant. Because the space was leased to the defendant for business purposes, the property does not satisfy the definition of a dwelling unit under \u00a7 47a-l and, therefore, \u00a7 47a-35a (a) does not apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-12\"> The relevant portion of \u00a7 47a-35a (a) is set out in the body of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-13\"> We note that General Statutes \u00a7 47a-35a (b) provides: \u201cIn any other appeal the court on its own motion or on motion of the parties, may fix a sufficient bond with surety to the adverse party in such amount as it may determine.\" If the plaintiff in this case desired an appeal bond from the defendant, the plaintiff should have moved the court to set a bond pursuant to \u00a7 47a-35a (b).
