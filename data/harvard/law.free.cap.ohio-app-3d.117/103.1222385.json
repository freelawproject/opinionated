While working for the Cincinnati Enquirer in the pressroom, plaintiff-appellant Darrell Harris apparently experienced a seizure, struck his head on the concrete floor as he fell, and sustained a subdural hematoma. His claim for workers\u2019 compensation was administratively denied, and his appeal to the court of common pleas fell victim to a motion for summary judgment. In his single assignment of error, Harris claims that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for summary judgment and sustaining the defendants-appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, specifically asserting that he was injured during the course of his employment by an object in the work environment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We overrule his assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Civ.R. 56(C) states that a motion for summary judgment should be granted if the court, upon viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made, determines that (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, (2) the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, and (3) the evidence is such that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the opposing party. <em>State ex rel. Howard v. Ferreri </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 587, 639 N.E.2d 1189; <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267. An appellate court\u2019s review of a summary judgment is <em>de novo. Smiddy v. The Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 30 OBR 78, 506 N.E.2d 212; <em>Koos v. Cent. Ohio Cellular, Inc. </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 579, 641 N.E.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">R.C. 4123.01(C) states that for an injury to be compensable from the workers\u2019 compensation fund, it must be \u201creceived in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d This test is conjunctive. <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 551 N.E.2d 1271. Here, it is certain that Harris\u2019s injury was sustained in the course of his employment; however, we must also determine whether it arose out of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\"> We hold that Harris\u2019s injury did not arise out of his employment. This case is factually like <em>Stanfield v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 583, 33 O.O. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>70, 67 N.E.2d 446, where a fall to the floor was precipitated by an idiopathic condition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Stanfield </em>set forth a bright-line rule as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u201cIn the instant case the floor was in no sense an added risk or hazard incident to the employment. The decedent\u2019s head simply struck the common surface upon which he was walking \u2014 an experience that could have occurred to him in any building or on the street irrespective of his employment. The fall resulted from the seizure alone and not from any circumstance of his employment. Concededly to entitle a claimant to compensation there must be an accidental injury not only in the course of but also arising out of the employment. Evidence of an injury arising out of the employment is not disclosed by the record in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585-586, 33 O.O. at 71-72, 67 N.E.2d at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We are compelled to follow the <em>Stanfield </em>rationale and hold that no causal connection existed between Harris\u2019s injury and his employment by virtue of an unimpeded fall to a concrete floor precipitated by his idiopathic condition. Therefore, we affirm the granting of summary judgment in favor of the defendants-appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-8\">Gorman, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b139-9\">Painter, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-11\">.

An idiopathic condition, for purposes of workers' compensation, is an employee\u2019s preexisting physical weakness or disease which contributes to the accident. <em>Waller v. Mayfield </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 118, 121, 524 N.E.2d 458, 461, fn. 3, citing 1 Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1985) 3-308, Section 12.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b139-10\">Painter, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AdL\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">The \u201carising out of\u2019 requirement for participation in worker\u2019s compensation refers to the causal connection between employment and the injury. <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 551 N.E.2d 1271. The right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund does not depend on any fault of the employer, but on whether a causal connection existed between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment, either through the activities, conditions, or environment of the employment. <em>Bralley v. Daugherty </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 302, 303, 15 O.O.3d 359, 359-360, 401 N.E.2d 448, 449-450, citing <em>Indus. Comm. v. Weigandt </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 1, 130 N.E. 38.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The parties stipulate that Harris\u2019s fall, was precipitated by an idiopathic condition. An injury sustained from a fall brought on by an idiopathic condition is compensable \u201cif the employment significantly contributed to the injury by placing the employee in a position which increased the dangerous effects of the fall.\u201d <em>Waller v. Mayfield </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 118, 123, 524 N.E.2d 458, 462, citing <em>Indus. Comm. v. Nelson </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 41, 186 N.E. 735. In <em>Nelson, </em>an employee suffered an epileptic seizure and fell, hitting his head against a welding machine. The employee was granted compensation because the presence of the machine was a workplace condition that was a factor in causing the injury, and therefore the injury arose out of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Similarly, in <em>Bill v. Great Lake Windows, supra, </em>an employee, suffering from an idiopathic condition, fell and struck his face on a picnic table in the lunchroom. In deciding that the injury was compensable under workers\u2019 compensation, the court stated that the table benefited the employer and that in certain circumstances common objects in the workplace can be dangerous, and even lethal. The court held that \u201cwhen objects in the zone of employment exacerbate injury during an employee\u2019s idiopathic episode, the degree to which that injury is exacerbated arises out of the injured employee\u2019s employment and is, therefore, compensable from the workers\u2019 compensation fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Finally, in <em>Whitt v. Mayfield </em>(June 25, 1992), Franklin App. No. 91AP-1156, unreported, 1992 WL 142303, an employee sweeping the sidewalk area around a hospital suffered an epileptic seizure, fell into the street and suffered injuries. The court of appeals reversed the trial court, holding that a material issue of fact remained as to whether the conditions of employment, such as being required to sweep next to a busy street, created an enhanced risk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Harris was discovered on the. concrete floor of the pressroom. Apparently, he had suffered a seizure and fallen, striking his head either on the floor or possibly on a printing press. Because Harris has no recollection of the events and there were no witnesses, he cannot present any evidence that he struck his head on the press. Therefore, we must presume that the injury was caused by the hard concrete floor in the pressroom. As in <em>Nelson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>and <em>Bill, </em>the injury that Harris sustained was exacerbated by the conditions of employment, whether the injury was sustained from Harris striking a printing press or the concrete floor. Surely the concrete floor benefited the employer. I find it untenable that a distinction should be drawn determined by whether the employee hit his head on a machine or on the concrete floor upon which the machine was situated. See <em>Stanfield v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 583, 587, 33 O.O. 70, 72, 67 N.E.2d 446, 449 (Bell and Williams, JJ., dissenting). Undoubtedly, the hard concrete floor was a workplace condition that increased the effects of Harris\u2019s fall, just as falling into a machine could increase the effects of a fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Of course, this decision must be squared with <em>Stanfield. </em>In <em>Stanfield, </em>an employee suffered a heart attack, fell on the tile floor, striking his head, and died. The court stated that the floor was not an added hazard of employment because the employee could have fallen and struck his head anywhere irrespective of his employment. However, this discussion by the court was merely dicta, as the court had already determined that the employee had died from the heart attack and not from the fall. The court\u2019s decision, therefore, rested on the fact that the employee had not sustained any injury related to his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">This court should not follow the dicta of <em>Stanfield, </em>but instead extend the <em>Nelson </em>holding in light of recent instruction by the Ohio Supreme Court and statutory mandate calling for a liberal construction of the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 in determining workers\u2019 compensation claims, favoring the awarding of benefits. <em>Fisher v. Mayfield, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 278, 551 N.E.2d at 1274; R.C. 4123.95. Applying a liberal construction, the pertinent facts being undisputed, we should hold as a matter of law that Harris is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In passing, I note that such a determination would not create a groundswell of new claims or burden the workers\u2019 compensation system as an unlimited insurer. Surely, incidents of injuries from falls to the floor brought on by idiopathic conditions must be relatively rare in the workplace. An injury, to be compensable, would still have to be brought on by a condition of the workplace. Of course, we are not dealing with any injury that stemmed from the idiopathic condition itself \u2014 no one contends that Harris\u2019s condition itself is in any way compensable \u2014 only the injury caused by hitting his head on the concrete floor. Or perhaps, no injuries of this type should be compensable \u2014 I am simply not willing to hold that one who hits his head on a picnic table in a lunchroom can recover, but if he falls all the way to the floor he is out of luck. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b139-13\">. The Ohio Supreme Court refined the test for the \"arising out of\u201d element by considering the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a causal connection existed between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment. See <em>Fisher v. Mayfield, 49 </em>Ohio St.3d at 277, 551 N.E.2d at 1274, citing <em>Lord v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441, 20 O.O.3d 376, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>423 N.E.2d 96. I agree with the reasoning of the court in <em>Bill v. Great Lake Windows </em>(Feb. 18, 1994), Wood App. No. 93WD072, unreported, 1994 WL 50261, that the standards established in <em>Lord </em>and <em>Bralley </em>were created to determine whether employment hazards existed to the extent that an employee could be deemed to be constructively at the workplace. These standards are different from the standards used to determine whether hazards at the workplace exacerbated the results of an idiopathic episode.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b140-9\">. I agree with the result in <em>Whitt, </em>but disagree with its analysis to the extent that the court relied on dicta in <em>Stanfield v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 583, 33 O.O. 70, 67 N.E.2d 446, which I dispose of below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
