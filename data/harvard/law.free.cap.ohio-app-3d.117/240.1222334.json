Scurry, appeals <em>pro se </em>from a Madison County Court of Common Pleas entry of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee, Bruce Rafferty, on the issue of appellant\u2019s legal malpractice and from the trial court\u2019s award of $46,281.47 in damages. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Appellee retained appellant to represent him in an action for restitution of real estate. The underlying facts in that case were that appellee\u2019s mother and stepfather resided in a house situated on approximately forty-seven acres of land. After appellee\u2019s mother died, appellee\u2019s stepfather wanted appellee to continue to reside in the home and to provide lifetime care for the stepfather. In return, the stepfather would give appellee the house and five acres of land, with the stepfather retaining a life estate subject to a life care contract. Another attorney prepared the contract and the deed. Both were executed, but the deed was never recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">After the stepfather died, a dispute arose between appellee and his stepbrother, Harold Stroupe, as to the ownership of the house and the five acres. Stroupe filed suit against appellee as described above <em>(\u201cStroupe </em>case\u201d). Appellant, as counsel to appellee, moved to dismiss. The Madison County Municipal Court responded to the motion by an entry transferring the case to the common pleas court due to lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">Stroupe ultimately moved for a default judgment due to Rafferty\u2019s failure to file an answer. The trial court entered a default judgment on December 30,1993. Appellant\u2019s subsequent motion for relief from judgment being legally insufficient, appellee retained new counsel. The new counsel filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment, which was overruled by the trial court. Appellee then filed suit against appellant for legal malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">After appellant failed to respond to appellee\u2019s request for admissions, appellee filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the legal malpractice issue, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>was granted by the trial court. Following a trial on the issue of damages, the trial court awarded appellee $46,281.47. Appellant filed a motion for a new trial on the damages issue, which was overruled. On appeal, appellant raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant for its failure to disqualify itself on its own motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law by granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, since genuine issues of material fact exist in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 3:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant by granting appellee damages for the real property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 4:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant in not requiring expert testimony as required to establish an attorney\u2019s breach of duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 5:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-14\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant in finding that appellant\u2019s action was the proximate cause of appellee\u2019s dilemma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-15\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 6:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-16\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant in holding that appellee would have obtained a more favorable judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-17\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 7:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-18\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant in allowing attorney fees for the predicated case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-19\">Appellant argues in his first assignment of error that the trial judge erred in failing to recuse himself from the malpractice case. Appellant alleges that the trial court\u2019s bias is apparent from the court\u2019s decision and entry on- Rafferty\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion in the <em>Stroupe </em>case, where the court stated that appellant\u2019s neglect was inexcusable and that Rafferty was not entitled to relief from judgment, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-20\">\u201cScurry\u2019s default was certainly prejudicial, but did not constitute abandonment. He attempted to remedy his failure to timely answer by a motion to vacate judgment. He apparently continued his representation; simply stated, the representation was not in accordance with appropriate standards expected of lawyers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>A judge\u2019s knowledge gained from involvement in a prior proceeding is not indicative of personal bias that would affect his participation in a later case stemming from the same set of facts. <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 185, 188, 616 N.E.2d 909, 913. What is dispositive here, however, is the fact that appellant did not file an affidavit of bias and prejudice with Ohio Supreme Court pursuant to R.C. 2701.03. Because appellant did not take advantage of the statutory remedy for disqualification, any alleged error was waived. See <em>State v. Cook </em>(Dec. 29, 1995), Hamilton App. No. C-950090, unreported, 1995 WL 763671. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact exist in the case. Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and when viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the non-moving party, reasonable minds could only come to a conclusion adverse to that party. <em>Bostic v. Connor </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 144, 146, 524 N.E.2d 881, 883-884.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">To establish a cause of action for legal malpractice relating to civil matters, the plaintiff must show (1) an attorney-client relationship giving rise to a duty, (2) a breach of that duty, and (3) damages proximately caused by the breach. <em>Krahn v. Kinney </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 103, 105, 538 N.E.2d 1058, 1060-1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\"> When a party fails to respond, without justification, to a properly served request for admissions, those matters to which the requests were addressed will be deemed admitted. Civ.R. 36; <em>Cleveland Trust Co. v. Willis </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 66, 67, 20 OBR 364, 367, 485 N.E.2d 1052, 1053-1054, certiorari denied (1986), 478 U.S. 1005, 106 S.Ct. 3295, 92 L.Ed.2d 710. \u201cAn admission arising by failure to respond to a request for admissions * * * is a \u2018written admission\u2019 for the purposes of Civ.R. 56(C).\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>T &amp; S Lumber Co. v. Alta Constr. Co. </em>(1984), 19 Ohio App.3d 241, 244, 19 OBR 393, 396-397, 483 N.E.2d 1216, 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Appellant\u2019s failure to respond to appellee\u2019s requests for admissions in this case resulted in appellant\u2019s unqualified admission that appellant represented appellee in the <em>Stroupe </em>case, that appellant failed to respond to the complaint, that appellee would have obtained a more favorable judgment had the complaint been answered, and that appellant breached his duty to appellee by failing to provide competent legal services, resulting in damages to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>These admissions conclusively establish that appellant\u2019s actions constituted legal malpractice by which appellee incurred damages. See <em>Cleveland Trust Co., </em>20 Ohio St.3d at 67, 20 OBR at 365, 485 N.E.2d at 1053-1054. There being no remaining material issues of fact for litigation, summary judgment became inevitable and was properly granted by the trial court in this case. See Civ.R. 56; <em>Bostic, </em>37 Ohio St.3d at 146, 524 N.E.2d at 883-884. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Appellant argues in his third assignment of error that the trial court erred by granting damages to appellee for the property involved in the <em>Stroupe </em>case. Appellant contends that he had no duty to appellee to file an answer in the <em>Stroupe </em>case because he did defend by filing the motion to dismiss, which appellant claims was still pending when the trial court granted the default judgment. Appellant further contends that appellee cannot show damages because he still owns the property, since the deed was executed and delivered to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument that he was not required to answer the Stroupe complaint is noted. Even if appellant\u2019s claim had merit, appellant nevertheless failed to respond to that effect when the trial court gave him leave to file an answer to Stroupe\u2019s amended complaint. Appellant further failed to bring that argument to the court\u2019s attention in response to Stroupe\u2019s subsequent motion for a default judgment. In fact, appellant failed to answer the amended complaint or respond to the motion for default judgment at all. Appellant\u2019s admissions in this case established that his actions as Rafferty\u2019s counsel in the <em>Stroupe </em>case amounted to a breach of his duty to provide competent legal representation. See <em>Ward v. Hester &amp; Continental Cas. Co. </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 38, 44, 65 O.O.2d 181, 184, 303 N.E.2d 861, 865, (default judgment is appropriate if the conduct of the party or counsel involves willful conduct, bad faith, or fault). Appellant\u2019s argument is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> As to the trial court\u2019s damages award, in an action for legal malpractice, a client is entitled to compensation for damages proximately caused by his attorney\u2019s malpractice. <em>Huffer v. Cicero </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 65, 75, 667 N.E.2d 1031, 1037. The default judgment in the <em>Stroupe </em>case resulted in Stroupe\u2019s prevailing over appellee in the action for restitution of the real estate. Evidence as to the real estate\u2019s value was taken at the trial on damages. No appeal was taken from the judgment in that case. In this malpractice action, the trial court found from appellant\u2019s failure to respond to the request for admissions that legal malpractice resulting in damages was established. There is competent, credible evidence in this case to support the trial court\u2019s determination that appellee was entitled to recover the value of the real estate as damages, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>will not disturb that finding. See <em>id. </em>Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Appellant argues in his fourth assignment of error that the trial court erred by not requiring expert testimony to establish appellant\u2019s legal malpractice. In an action for legal malpractice, expert testimony is required to establish professional standards of performance except where the breach of duty to a client is so obvious that it is within the ordinary knowledge and experience of laymen. <em>McInnis v. Hyatt Legal Clinics </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 112, 113, 10 OBR 437, 438, 461 N.E.2d 1295, 1296-1297; <em>Bloom v. Dieckmann </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 202, 203, 11 OBR 298, 298-299, 464 N.E.2d 187, 187-188.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In this case, the fact that appellant\u2019s conduct in representing appellee in the <em>Stroupe </em>case was a breach of duty that proximately caused appellee to incur damages became an unqualified admission by appellant\u2019s failure to respond to appellee\u2019s request for admissions. There being no factual issue, no expert testimony was necessary, and the trial court was able to conclude as a matter of law that appellant had engaged in legal malpractice. See <em>Hyatt, </em>10 Ohio St.3d at 113, 10 OBR at 438, 461 N.E.2d at 1296-1297. Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">In his fifth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred by finding that appellant\u2019s actions in representing appellee in the <em>Stroupe </em>case proximately caused \u201cappellee\u2019s dilemma.\u201d Appellant again argues that he had no duty to file an answer in the <em>Stroupe </em>case because he had filed a motion to dismiss in the municipal court that was not ruled on by the common pleas court prior to its entry of default judgment in favor of Stroupe in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In determining appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court was entitled to rely on the admissions which were deemed admitted due to appellant\u2019s failure to respond. See <em>T &amp; S Lumber, </em>19 Ohio App.3d at 244, 19 OBR at 396-397, 483 N.E.2d at 1219-1220. One of those admissions was that appellee suffered damages as a proximate result of appellant\u2019s failure to file an answer in the <em>Stroupe </em>case. Appellant\u2019s admissions in this case left <em>no </em>issue to be determined as to proximate cause, and the trial court properly concluded as a matter of law that appellee\u2019s damages resulted from appellant\u2019s neglect in representation. Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Appellant argues in his sixth assignment of error that the trial court erred in holding that appellee would have obtained a more favorable result in the <em>Stroupe </em>case. The trial court stated this conclusion as an \u201cuncontroverted material fact\u201d in the case, established by the admissions deemed admitted due to appellant\u2019s failure to respond. As we have discussed, the trial court was entitled to rely on those admissions for purposes of the motion for summary judgment and properly concluded that reasonable minds could only conclude that appellee would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>experienced a more favorable result in the <em>Stroupe </em>case had appellant not been negligent in representing his client. See <em>T &amp; S Lumber, </em>19 Ohio App.3d at 244, 19 OBR at 396-397, 483 N.E.2d at 1219-1220. Appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In his seventh assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to appellee. The trial court determined that appellee\u2019s damages included the $6,081.47 in attorney fees reasonably incurred in prosecuting the Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment in the <em>Stroupe </em>ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As we stated earlier, a client is entitled to compensation for damages proximately caused by his attorney\u2019s malpractice. <em>Huffer, </em>107 Ohio App.3d at 75, 667 N.E.2d at 1037. We will not reverse a trial court\u2019s damage award that is supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">It was an admission in this case that appellee would have received a more favorable judgment in the <em>Stroupe </em>case if appellant had filed an answer in that case. It then would not have been necessary for appellee to retain new counsel to file a Civ.R. 60(B) motion in that case. The court\u2019s award of the attorney fees incurred in pursuing that motion as an element of appellee\u2019s damages is therefore supported by the record. See <em>Huffer, </em>107 Ohio App.3d at 77, 667 N.E.2d at 1038-1039. Appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-9\">William W.
