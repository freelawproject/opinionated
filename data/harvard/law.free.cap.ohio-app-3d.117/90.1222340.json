Pursuant to Sixth District Loe.App.R. 12(C), this case is hereby transferred to the accelerated docket. Appellant has advanced two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">\u201cFirst Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it found the appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss not well taken as speedy trial time had run.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">\u201cSecond Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">\u201cThe mayor erred when he made a finding of guilty prior to hearing any evidence and by not allowing the defendant a bench trial on February 29, 1996, while in mayor\u2019s court, thus denying the defendant due process of law and allowing double jeopardy to attach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">The first assignment of error is found not well taken on the authority of <em>Brecksville v. Cook </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 53, 661 N.E.2d 706. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the transfer of a case pursuant to R.C. 1905.032 from the mayor\u2019s court to the municipal court is a removal within the meaning of R.C. 2945.72(F) and that the period of delay necessary to the removal is the time from arrest or summons to the date the mayor\u2019s court certifies the case to the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Applying that holding to the facts of this case, we hold that appellant was not denied a speedy trial. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error raises multiple issues, each of which may be disposed of summarily. He first complains that the mayor denied him a hearing and made a finding of guilty without receiving evidence. Appellant has presented no record of any kind from the mayor\u2019s court proceeding and we thus presume that the hearing was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">Appellant also contends that the finding of guilt in the Bowling Green Municipal Court constituted double jeopardy. Appellant\u2019s double jeopardy argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">A mayor\u2019s court has jurisdiction to hear \u201cany prosecution for the violation of an ordinance of the municipal corporation.\u201d R.C. 1905.01. However, a mayor\u2019s court is not a court of record. <em>Blue Ash v. Madden </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 312, 8 OBR 421, 456 N.E.2d 1277. Thus, an appeal from a mayor\u2019s court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>conviction to the municipal court or county court shall proceed as a trial <em>de novo. </em>R.C. 1905.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The United States Supreme Court has held that such a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system for adjudicating less serious criminal cases, in which the defendant may be tried in a lower tier court and, upon conviction, appeal to a court of general criminal jurisdiction where he is entitled to a trial <em>de novo, </em>does not violate the Constitution\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Ludwig v. Massachusetts </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 618, 96 S.Ct. 2781, 49 L.Ed.2d 732; <em>Colten v. Kentucky </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">On consideration whereof, the court finds the defendant was not prejudiced or prevented from having a fair trial, and the judgment of the Bowling Green Municipal Court is affirmed. It is ordered that appellant pay court costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-8\">Handwork, Glasser and Grey, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b126-9\">Lawrence Grey, J., retired, of the Fourth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
