First, they contend that the trial court erred by excluding certain testimony from Mrs. Walker\u2019s treating physician. Next, they claim that the jury\u2019s verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Finally, the Walkers argue that the trial court erred by improperly instructing the jury on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The present appeal stems from a December 23, 1993, low-speed, head-on automobile accident involving Mrs. Walker and appellee Michael D. Holland. Although her abdomen did not strike the steering wheel, Mrs. Walker, who was two months pregnant at the time, testified at trial that the impact pressed her forward against the seat belt and \u201cslammed\u201d her against the back seat. An ambulance transported Mrs. Walker to Kettering Medical Center, where she complained- of pelvic cramping and neck soreness.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">In light of Mrs. Walker\u2019s complaints, the medical center staff administered x-rays and an ultrasound. Following these tests, Mrs. Walker was diagnosed with an acute cervical strain in her neck. Additionally, the ultrasound revealed a small subchorionic bleed, indicating that Mrs. Walker\u2019s placenta was separated slightly from her uterus wall. Based upon the results of Mrs. Walker\u2019s examination, the medical center staff advised her to limit her activities and follow up with Dr. James Huey, her obstetrician.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">On December 27, 1993, Mrs. Walker contacted Dr. Huey\u2019s office and advised a nurse that she had \u201cpassed one blood clot.\u201d She asserted at trial that she also informed Dr. Huey\u2019s office about her continued cramping. Nothing in the doctor\u2019s records reflected a cramping complaint, however. Mrs. Walker also alleged at trial that she developed bruising around her abdominal area a day or two after the accident. No medical documentation existed to support this claim. After speaking with Mrs. Walker, a representative of Dr. Huey\u2019s office instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>her to \u201ctake it easy\u201d and to call back if \u201canything happened.\u201d The representative also told her she could increase her activity if she felt comfortable doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Mrs. Walker next contacted Dr. Huey\u2019s office on January 24, 1994, for her regular pregnancy checkup. On that visit, during which Mrs. Walker did not undergo an internal examination, the examining doctor detected a normal fetal heart tone. Mrs. Walker returned to Dr. Huey\u2019s office prior to her next regular checkup, however, after experiencing heavy bleeding. During that examination on February 16, 1994, Dr. Weprin failed to locate any fetal heartbeat. Consequently, Dr. Weprin conducted an ultrasound and discovered that the fetus had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Thereafter, the Walkers filed a complaint on January 24, 1995, alleging that Michael Holland negligently failed to control his vehicle and struck Mrs. Walker\u2019s car. The complaint also alleged that Michael Holland was acting as an agent of his mother, Dianna, at the time of the accident. Furthermore, the complaint alleged that Dianna Holland, who was named as a defendant, negligently entrusted her vehicle to her son. The complaint, which included a jury demand, sought a judgment for Mrs. Walker against the Hollands, jointly and severally, for $250,000, plus interest and costs. In a second cause of action, the complaint sought a judgment for Mr. Walker against the Hollands, jointly and severally, for $100,000, plus interest and costs. The Walkers based this cause of action upon Mr. Walker\u2019s loss of \u201cthe services, companionship, love, affection, comforts, consortium, joys, and miscarriage of his spouse, Karen S. Walker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">On March 23, 1995, Dianna Holland filed a motion for summary judgment on the Walkers\u2019 agency and negligent entrustment claims. In response, on June 6, 1995, the Walkers voluntarily dismissed Dianna Holland as a party without prejudice. The remaining issues proceeded to trial on January 29, 1996. After hearing the evidence, the trial court directed a verdict in the Walkers\u2019 favor on the issue of Michael Holland\u2019s negligence. The trial court then submitted the issues of causation and damages to the jury, which returned a verdict for Holland. Consequently, after reviewing the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court entered a judgment in Michael Holland\u2019s favor, and the Walkers filed a timely notice of appeal on February 27, 1996, advancing three assignments of error. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">In their first assignment of error, the Walkers contend that the trial court erred by excluding Dr. Huey\u2019s testimony concerning the expansion of Mrs. Walker\u2019s subchorionic bleed. At trial, Dr.\u2019 Huey had attempted to testify that a February 16, 1994 ultrasound showed that Mrs. Walker\u2019s subchorionic bleed had grown larger since her December 23, 1993 ultrasound. In the doctor\u2019s opinion, this bleed or \u201ctear\u201d stemmed from her automobile accident and, due to its increase in size, ultimately caused the miscarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>The trial court disallowed the doctor\u2019s testimony concerning his review of the February 16, 1994 ultrasound, however, as a sanction for a perceived discovery violation. Specifically, the court found that Dr. Huey\u2019s proposed trial testimony constituted a \u201cchange\u201d from his earlier expert opinion expressed in a deposition. As a result, the trial court explained that the Walkers should have notified opposing counsel and supplemented Dr. Huey\u2019s deposition testimony. After reviewing the record and relevant case law, we agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">As we explained above, the emergency room staff examined Mrs. Walker on December 23, 1993, and an ultrasound revealed a small subchorionie bleed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Stuart Weprin, a partner of Dr. Huey\u2019s, conducted a second ultrasound examination on February 16, 1994, after Mrs. Walker complained of heavy bleeding. The second ultrasound examination showed a dead fetus. Dr. Weprin subsequently drafted an ultrasound report detailing the results of his examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">In subsequent deposition testimony, Dr. Huey provided the following responses to questions from the appellee\u2019s counsel, Jane Lynch, concerning the February 16, 1994 ultrasound:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">\u201cQ. Is there any indication in this report of February 16, 1994, that the small chorionic separation found December 23rd of 1993 had expanded in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">\u201cA. Not on this. Doesn\u2019t \u2014 doesn\u2019t approach the subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-9\">\u201cQ. Would you think that\u2019s unusual?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-10\">\u201cA. That it didn\u2019t mention it? No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-11\">\u201cQ. So there\u2019s no way to tell from this ultrasound that the' subchorionie tear had done anything different between December 23rd of \u201993 and February 16th on \u201994?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-12\">\u201cA. I can\u2019t tell it from this report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-13\">\u201cQ. Can you tell it from any documentation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-14\">\u201cA. No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-15\">\u201cQ. It is possible to have a pregnancy to term with the findings of a small subchorionie tear such as what was found on Karen Walker\u2019s ultrasound of December 23rd of \u201993?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-5\">\u201cQ. And, we \u2014 you do not know anything different about the status of that subchorionic tear from that date to the date of the miscarriage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">\u201cQ. And was there any information about its increasing in any way after the ultrasound of February 16th of \u201994?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">\u201cA. Unh-uh. No, ma\u2019am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Later, Dr. Huey noted at trial that the emergency room staff diagnosed Mrs. Walker as having a small subchorionic bleed on December 23, 1993, after her automobile accident. Dr. Huey then confirmed that his partner, Dr. Stuart Weprin, examined Mrs. Walker on January 24, 1994. He explained that Dr. Weprin\u2019s examination, which did not include an ultrasound test, detected normal blood pressure and a fetal heart beat. Next, Dr. Huey testified that Mrs. Walker returned to his office on February 16, 1994, experiencing heavy bleeding. The doctor further explained that an ultrasound test revealed a dead fetus.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">At that point, Mrs. Walker\u2019s counsel attempted to question Dr. Huey concerning the February 16, 1994 ultrasound. Specifically, her attorney, Carmine Garofalo, asked: \u201cNow, doctor, I have asked you to go back and review that ultrasound in preparation for your testimony today, correct?\u201d After Dr. Huey responded affirmatively, defense counsel Jane Lynch objected, and the following sidebar conference took place on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-11\">\u201cLYNCH: I object to this line of questioning, your honor, because we took a discovery deposition of Dr. Huey quite some time ago. At that time he had not reviewed this. This is obviously new evidence he has reviewed and prepared for over the weekend. He had not seen the ultrasound when we took his deposition on the February ultrasound. Based on what he said during the discovery deposition and what he\u2019s done this weekend, obviously, doesn\u2019t give the defense any opportunity to not only find out what he did but also have Dr. DeVoe respond to it, so it\u2019s extremely prejudicial to find out what he did this weekend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-12\">\u201cGAROFALO: Judge, we\u2019ve got his deposition. There was never any comment made in that deposition. I wanted to take his deposition when she did, of course, it was August something, September \u2014 to find out what his opinions were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-13\">\u201cLYNCH: And I asked him specifically about that ultrasound; and he said there was absolutely nothing in that ultrasound record that indicated that there was any expansion of the subchorionic tear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-14\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-15\">\u201cGAROFALO: Judge, the only thing is experts do that all the time. They prepare for trial, and anything he\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Then you are under a duty to notify counsel an expert has changed his opinion. Tell me what he\u2019s going to say about the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">\u201cGAROFALO: That the subchorionic bleed has expanded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">\u201cLYNCH: That\u2019s exactly the opposite of what he said in the testimony, specifically on page 21 of his deposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">\u201cGAROFALO: Let\u2019s take a look at it. All she\u2019s doing is referring to a report, judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think you\u2019re sandbagging.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-9\">\u201cLYNCH: If I have any opportunity to respond, I have no idea \u2014 I asked him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-10\">\u201cGAROFALO: He hadn\u2019t looked at the actual report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-11\">\u201cLYNCH: He looked at the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: You are precluded from asking about his \u2014 the result of his review of this ultrasound.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-13\">\u201cGAROFALO: Judge, their expert could have looked at the ultrasound. It was in existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: If you had notified them, then they could have done that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-15\">\u201cLYNCH: When we asked Dr. Huey, this is what we got.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do not ask him about the review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-17\">In their brief to this court, the Walkers contend that the trial court erred by concluding that they had a duty to notify opposing counsel that their expert had changed his opinion. Furthermore, they contend that the trial court\u2019s ruling substantially prejudiced the presentation of their case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-18\">In support of their first assignment of error, the Walkers argue that Civ.R. 26(E), upon which the trial court apparently relied, does not apply in the present case. Specifically, the Walkers claim that Dr. Huey, as Karen Walker\u2019s treating physician, testified as a \u201cfact\u201d witness rather than an \u201cexpert\u201d witness. Consequently, they contend that the supplementation-of-discovery provisions found in Civ.R. 26 are inapplicable. Additionally, the Walkers rely upon <em>Beavercreek Local Schools v. Basic, Inc. </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 669, 680, 595 N.E.2d 360, 367, in which this court found \u201cnothing in [Civ.R. 26(E) ] that would impose a duty on a non-party witness to supplement or to correct deposition testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-19\">We find these arguments unpersuasive. Although we agree that Civ.R. 26(E) applies only to expert witnesses, we cannot agree that Dr. Huey failed to testify as an expert. At the outset, we note that the Walkers themselves identified Dr. Huey as an expert witness in a June 6, 1995 disclosure of expert witnesses filed with the trial court and served upon the appellee\u2019s counsel. More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>important, Dr. Huey\u2019s status as Mrs. Walker\u2019s treating physician does not render him incapable of acting as an expert witness. This court recently explained that a treating physician may be either a fact witness or an expert witness, depending upon the nature and scope of the physician\u2019s testimony. In <em>Hurst v. Poelstra </em>(Dec. 22, 1995), Miami App. No. 94-CA-61, unreported, 1995 WL 765968, we recognized that \u201cwhere a treating physician has been properly identified as a fact witness prior to trial, the treating physician may testify as a fact -witness, but may not testify as an expert as to the ultimate question unless identified as an expert witness.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Smith v. Stark Cty. Neurologists, Inc. </em>(Jan. 7, 1991), Stark App. No. CA-8152, unreported, 1991 WL 6273, the appellees attempted to circumvent Civ.R. 26(E) by characterizing three physicians as \u201coccurrence\u201d witnesses rather than \u201cexperts.\u201d The Fifth District Court of Appeals rejected the argument, however, stating: \u201cAll three doctors treated the child, and each did testify regarding his involvement in the little boy\u2019s care. Each gave opinions that cannot in any sense be considered lay opinions. Each gave opinions reaching beyond his own involvement in the case, encompassing the care given by other doctors, and addressing the ultimate issues of negligence and proximate cause. Although there may at times be a fine line between factual responses and expert opinion responses elicited from a witness, here there is no doubt as to the nature of these doctors\u2019 responses. Calling them occurrence witnesses does not make them occurrence witnesses. Appellee\u2019s argument that these witnesses did not testify as experts would be ludicrous if it did not so blatantly insult this court\u2019s intelligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Likewise, in <em>Gillespie v. Iler </em>(May 6, 1996), Van Wert App. No. 15-95-8, unreported, 1996 WL 255881, the Third District Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court\u2019s decision not allowing the appellant\u2019s witness, a treating physician, to testify as an expert at trial. In its ruling, the appellate court noted that \u201c[h]ere, the trial court did not allow [the appellant\u2019s] witness, Dr. Metry, to testify as an expert medical witness because [the appellant\u2019s] counsel did not timely notify the court or opposing counsel that Metry would be testifying as an expert. However, the trial court did allow Metry' to testify as a fact witness because he treated Bernice during her illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In light of the foregoing authorities, we reject the Walkers\u2019 argument that \u201c[a]s the plaintiffs treating physician, Dr. Huey was not technically an \u2018expert witness\u2019 although he was asked some expert opinions during his trial testimony.\u201d In our view, the crucial factor when determining Civ.R. 26(E)\u2019s applicability is the substance of Dr. Huey\u2019s testimony and not his status as a \u201ctreating physician.\u201d In the present case, the record reveals that Dr. Huey\u2019s testimony concerned, <em>inter alia, </em>the origin of Mrs. Walker\u2019s subchorionic bleed and its causal effect on her miscarriage. The Walkers concede, and we agree, that this testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>included \u201csome expert opinions.\u201d Accordingly, we find Civ.R. 26 applicable to Dr. Huey\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Furthermore, this court\u2019s ruling in <em>Beavercreek Local Schools v. Basic, Inc., supra, </em>upon which the Walkers rely, does not render Civ.R. 26(E) wholly inapplicable to Dr. Huey\u2019s deposition testimony and later trial testimony. In that case, we construed Civ.R. 26(E), which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">\u201cSupplementation of Responses. A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement his response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">\u201c(1) A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement his response with respect to any question directly addressed to (a) the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and (b) the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial and the subject matter on which he is expected to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-8\">\u201c(2) A party who knows or later learns that his response is incorrect is under a duty seasonably to correct the response.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">In <em>Beavercreek Local Schools v. Basic, Inc., supra, </em>the appellant alleged that the appellee\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Corn, provided incomplete deposition responses. Consequently, the appellant argued that the appellee had an obligation, under Civ.R. 26(E), to supplement Dr. Corn\u2019s answers. <em>Id., </em>71 Ohio App.3d at 679, 595 N.E.2d at 366-367. This court rejected the appellant\u2019s argument, however, holding that the appellee \u201cwas under no duty pursuant to Civ.R. 26(E) to supplement its expert witness\u2019 response to questions asked during the deposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680, 595 N.E.2d at 367. In support of our ruling, we recognized that \u201cthe duty seasonably to supplement responses to discovery is addressed to parties, not non-party witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, we noted our inability to find anything in Civ.R. 26(E) \u201cthat would impose a duty on a non-party witness to supplement or to correct deposition testimony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">At the same time, however, Civ.R. 26(E)(1)(b) expressly requires a party to supplement responses concerning (1) the identity of persons expected to testify as expert witnesses and (2) the subject matter of the experts\u2019 testimony. <em>Id. </em>Thus, under the rule, the Walkers did maintain a duty to inform the appellee of changes in the <em>subject matter </em>of Dr. Huey\u2019s testimony. Consequently, the central issue for our consideration is whether the subject matter of Dr. Huey\u2019s proposed trial testimony differed from the subject matter of his deposition testimony. If so, Civ.R. 26(E)(1)(b) compelled the Walkers to inform the appellee of the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>In their brief to this court, the Walkers contend that the subject matter of Dr. Huey\u2019s testimony did not change. Initially, they assert that the appellee\u2019s counsel never questioned Dr. Huey about the February 14, 1996 ultrasound itself. Instead, they claim that appellee\u2019s counsel questioned Dr. Huey only about the ultrasound report, which Dr. Stuart Weprin prepared. They stress that the report did not mention any expansion of Mrs. Walker\u2019s subchorionic bleed. Thus, the Walkers contend that Dr. Huey answered the deposition questions accurately.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Furthermore, given their assertion that the appellee\u2019s counsel never inquired about the ultrasound itself, the Walkers insist that they maintained no obligation to supplement discovery and disclose Dr. Huey\u2019s belief, based upon his pretrial review of the ultrasound, that Mrs. Walker\u2019s subchorionic bleed had expanded. Additionally, the Walkers argue that even if Dr. Huey had changed his opinion, a simple issue of credibility would arise for the trier of fact to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Conversely, appellee Holland contends that the trial court properly excluded Dr. Huey\u2019s proffered testimony concerning the expansion of Mrs. Walker\u2019s subchorionic bleed. In support of his argument, Holland claims that Dr. Huey, in his deposition testimony, expressly denied having any knowledge or opinion that the subchorionic \u201ctear\u201d or bleed had increased. Consequently, Holland asserts that the trial court properly prevented Dr. Huey from testifying differently at trial based upon his undisclosed pretrial review of the February 16, 1994 ultrasound.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">After reviewing Dr. Huey\u2019s deposition testimony, his proposed trial testimony, and relevant case law, we conclude that the trial court properly rejected the proffered trial testimony. Contrary to the Walkers\u2019 assertions, Dr. Huey\u2019s discovery deposition testimony did not concern only contents of an ultrasound report prepared by one of his colleagues. Admittedly, Dr. Huey did say he could not determine whether the subchorionic tear \u201chad done anything different\u201d between. December 23, 1993 and February 16, 1994, based upon Dr. Weprin\u2019s report. Additionally, he did state in his deposition that Dr. Weprin\u2019s report failed to mention any expansion of the subchorionic tear.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">More important, however, appellee\u2019s counsel also asked Dr. Huey the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">\u201cQ. It is possible to have a pregnancy to term with the findings of a small subchorionic tear such as what was found on Karen Walker\u2019s ultrasound of December 23 of \u201993?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-10\">\u201cA. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-11\">\u201cQ. <em>And we </em>\u2014 you <em>do not know anything different about the status of that subchorionic tear from that date to the date of the miscarriage?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-12\">\u201cA. <em>Right.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>\u201cQ. <em>And was there any information about it increasing in any way after the ultrasound of February 16th of \u20199b?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">\u201cA. <em>Unh-uh. No, ma\u2019am.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">\u201cQ. <em>So as far as we know, as we sit here today, that small subchorionic tear could have stayed exactly the same as it was from December 23rd of \u201993 forward?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">\u201cA. <em>That\u2019s a possibility.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">\u201cQ.

With respect to that tear, the subchorionic separation or tear, once the symptom of bleeding is gone, such as what Karen reported in December of \u201993, are there any other symptoms that one would be aware of that would indicate that the subchorionic tear is somehow threatening the pregnancy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-11\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-12\">\u201cA.

Uh-hum.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-19\">The foregoing questions and responses did not relate solely to the contents of Dr. Weprin\u2019s ultrasound report. In particular, Dr. Huey denied knowing <em>anything different </em>about the status of the subchorionic tear or bleed from December 23, 1993 until the February 1994 miscarriage. Additionally, Dr. Huey testified that there was <em>no information </em>about it increasing in size. Finally, Dr. Huey agreed that the subchorionic tear might have stayed <em>exactly the same size </em>and threatened Mrs. Walker\u2019s pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-20\">In <em>Waste Mgt. of Ohio, Inc. v. Mid-America Tire, Inc. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 529, 681 N.E.2d 492, we noted that the purpose of Civ.R. 26(E)(1)(b) is to prevent \u201ctrial by ambush.\u201d As a result, we reasoned that \u201c[i]f discovery is to serve its purpose, the parties must be entitled, upon the unveiling of a contention, to a reasonable opportunity to prepare to defend against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 681 N.E.2d at 495, citing <em>Shumaker v. Oliver B. Cannon &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>367, 371, 28 OBR 429, 432, 504 N.E.2d 44, 48. Consequently, \u201c[although Civ.R. 26(E)(1)(b) does not require a party to give an opposing party notice of every nuance of an expert\u2019s opinion, it does require supplementation of the subject matter on which an expert is expected to testify.\u201d <em>Waste Management, supra, </em>113 Ohio App.3d at 533, 681 N.E.2d at 494-495, citing <em>Tritt v. Judd\u2019s Moving &amp; Storage, Inc. </em>(1990), 62 Ohio App.3d 206, 211-212, 574 N.E.2d 1178, 1182-1183. Furthermore, in <em>Shumaker, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court explained that an objective of Civ.R. 26(E)(1)(b) \u201cis to provide opposing counsel with updated and complete discovery regarding the substance of expert testimony. This duty to supplement responses on the subject matter of expert testimony is necessary because preparation for effective cross-examination is especially compelling where expert testimony is to be introduced.\u201d <em>Shumaker, supra, </em>28 Ohio St.3d at 370, 28 OBR at 431, 504 N.E.2d at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Therefore, in the present case we must determine whether Dr. Huey\u2019s proposed trial testimony should be characterized as a nuance of his deposition testimony, or whether the trial testimony broached a new subject matter. In resolving this issue, we find particularly instructive the Tenth District Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Tritt.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, the appellants\u2019 expert, an accident reconstructionist, stated during a deposition that he had not performed any tests concerning appellant Tritt\u2019s truck. On cross-examination at trial, however, the same expert testified about an experiment he had performed on a taillight after his deposition but before the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In light of this \u201csurprise\u201d testimony, the appellee argued that it was justified in having its own expert testify at trial concerning the distance from which the truck\u2019s taillight would have been visible and the results of his own out-of-court experiment. The,Tenth District Court of Appeals rejected the appellee\u2019s argument, however, finding the appellee\u2019s self-described \u201crebuttal evidence\u201d improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">In so ruling, the <em>Tritt </em>court found the appellants\u2019 expert\u2019s trial testimony not violative of Civ.R. 26(E)(1)(b). <em>Id. </em>at 212, 574 N.E.2d at 1182. First, the court concluded that the appellee \u201cwas fully aware that [the appellants\u2019 expert] would testify in regard to the lack of illumination at the time and site of the accident, and the substance of that testimony did not change between the deposition and the trial.\u201d Furthermore, the court noted that \u201c[m]ost important is the fact that [the appellants\u2019 expert\u2019s] testimony concerning the taillight test he performed was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>introduced only as a result of cross-examination by appellee\u2019s counsel and was not mentioned during direct examination by appellants\u2019 counsel. Additionally, it was made clear on redirect that [the appellants\u2019 expert] did not rely on the result of the taillight test in forming an opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 574 N.E.2d at 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">In the present case, however, the appellee was not \u201cfully aware\u201d that Dr. Huey would testify concerning the ultrasound\u2019s depiction of an expanded subchorionic tear. To the contrary, given the deposition testimony cited above, appellee Holland had absolutely no reason to anticipate Dr. Huey\u2019s opinion, which the doctor formed after reviewing the ultrasound the weekend before trial. Furthermore, Dr. Huey\u2019s proposed trial testimony did not arise on cross-examination as in <em>Tritt. </em>Instead, the doctor attempted, on direct examination, to change substantively his earlier deposition testimony. Specifically, Dr. Huey attempted to testify that certain <em>evidence </em>\u2014 i.e., the February 16, 1994 ultrasound \u2014 showed an enlargement of Mrs. Walker\u2019s subchorionic tear.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">This proposed testimony cannot be characterized as a mere \u201cnuance\u201d of his earlier deposition testimony. As we explained above, in his deposition Dr. Huey did opine that the automobile accident caused Mrs. Walker\u2019s miscarriage. Additionally, Dr. Huey opined that the subchorionic tear or bleed stemmed from the accident and caused the miscarriage. Significantly, however, Dr. Huey also stated in his deposition (1) that he had no information concerning expansion of the tear and (2) that the small subchorionic tear could have stayed the same size and still threatened Mrs. Walker\u2019s pregnancy. Consequently, appellee Holland reasonably could have anticipated Dr. Huey\u2019s testifying at trial concerning the accident causing the small tear and, in turn, the small tear causing the miscarriage. However, in light of Dr. Huey\u2019s deposition testimony, we find no reason for the appellee to have anticipated that the subject matter of Dr. Huey\u2019s testimony would encompass some expansion of the subchorionic tear. Furthermore, unlike the expert in <em>Tritt </em>who did not rely upon the results of the post-deposition taillight test when forming his opinion, Dr. Huey undeniably relied upon the results of his postdeposition, pretrial ultrasound review when forming his opinion that the subchorionic tear had expanded. Under these circumstances, we believe that the appellants had an obligation to supplement discovery pursuant to Civ.R. 26(E)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">This court\u2019s rulings in two recent cases support the conclusion we reach today. In <em>Waste Management, supra, </em>the appellants claimed that the trial court should not have allowed the appellee\u2019s expert to offer an opinion at trial regarding the cause of a wheel explosion. The appellee\u2019s expert had provided a pretrial report in which he expressed the inability to \u201cdevelop a definite conclusion\u201d about the explosion\u2019s cause. Later, at trial, the expert viewed a high-quality reproduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>of a coroner\u2019s photograph and opined that the appellant\u2019s employees had caused the explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Concluding that the trial court should have excluded this causation testimony, we reasoned that the surprise expert opinion, \u201crevealed for the first time during trial, created the type of unfair surprise Civ.R. 26(E)(1)(b) is intended to prevent.\u201d Specifically, we determined that the difference between (1) having no opinion regarding causation and (2) stating that the appellant\u2019s employees caused the accident \u201cwas more than a \u2018nuance.\u2019 \u201d Consequently, this court determined that the appellants \u201ccould not have been expected to anticipate [the expert\u2019s] testimony about the cause of the explosion and, as a result, they did not have a fair opportunity to respond to his new opinion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Similarly, in <em>Wimmers v. Camacho </em>(July 27, 1993), Montgomery App. No. 13272, unreported, 1993 WL 295081, the appellant contended that the court erred by excluding certain expert testimony presented on her behalf at trial. In a pretrial deposition, the appellant\u2019s expert never expressed an opinion, \u201ceven though he was given ample opportunity t\u00f3 do so,\u201d about whether a defendant doctor had a duty to closely monitor his patient for twenty-four hours. At trial, the expert witness then attempted to testify that the defendant doctor breached a standard of care by failing to provide twenty-four-hour observation. Although another expert provided the same testimony, and the appellee was prepared to rebut that expert\u2019s testimony, we upheld the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the first expert\u2019s opinion. In this court\u2019s view, the expert\u2019s proposed trial testimony concerning twenty-four-hour monitoring could not be characterized as a \u201cnuance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Likewise in the present case, we cannot characterize Dr. Huey\u2019s proposed testimony concerning expansion of the subchorionic bleed as a \u201cnuance\u201d of his deposition testimony. In his discovery deposition, Dr. Huey explained that a subchorionic tear can expand and cause a miscarriage. However, he admitted having no information about the tear increasing and also admitted not knowing \u201canything different\u201d about the tear from the date of the first ultrasound test until the date of Mrs. Walker\u2019s miscarriage. Finally, Dr. Huey opined that Mrs. Walker\u2019s subchorionic tear could have \u201cstayed the same\u201d and still threatened her pregnancy. Later, at trial, Dr. Huey attempted to express his opinion that the tear had, in fact, expanded. He based this opinion upon his review, the weekend before trial, of the actual February 16,1994 ultrasound.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Under these circumstances, we perceive Dr. Huey\u2019s proffered trial testimony as more than a mere nuance of his deposition testimony. Although Dr. Huey stated in his deposition that the accident caused a small tear and the miscarriage, the doctor did not opine that Mrs. Walker\u2019s tear had, in fact, expanded. This new opinion should have been disclosed to enable the appellee\u2019s counsel to prepare effective cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>In opposition to this conclusion, the Walkers rely upon <em>Sowers v. Middletown Hosp. </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 572, 626 N.E.2d 968. In <em>Sowers, </em>the appellants contended that the trial court erred by allowing the \u201csurprise\u201d testimony of a defense expert witness. In her deposition, the expert could not form an opinion about whether a baby sustained neurological damage while developing or during labor and delivery. Subsequently, at trial, the expert expressed her opinion that the neurological injury did not occur during labor and delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Despite the apparent inconsistency, the Twelfth District Court of Appeals found the expert\u2019s testimony nonprejudicial for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">\u201cFirst, appellants had sufficient opportunity to impeach Dr. Ferriero on cross-examination. In fact, appellants questioned Dr. Ferriero in detail concerning her deposition testimony. Dr. Ferriero responded to appellants\u2019 questions with a reasonable explanation as to why she felt her deposition and trial testimonies were consistent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-7\">\u201cSecond, appellants could not have been surprised by the testimony on the timing issue as that issue was the central causation question at trial. Also, another defense expert witness who testified before Dr. Ferriero, Harlan Giles, M.D., testified that in his opinion Richard\u2019s neurological injury did not occur during labor and delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-8\">\u201cThird, there is simply no evidence that appellees deliberately attempted to mislead appellants regarding the substance of Dr. Ferriero\u2019s testimony. Appellees were obligated under Civ.R. 26(E)(1) to notify appellants of changes or additions in the subject matter of Dr. Ferriero\u2019s testimony, but not \u2018each and every nuance\u2019 of her testimony. [Citations omitted.] Through discovery and pretrial statements appellants were well aware that Dr. Ferriero would testify on causation issues. Accordingly, appellees did not violate their duty to supplement [their] discovery response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 626 N.E.2d at 980-981.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">After reviewing <em>Sowers </em>and this court\u2019s <em>Waste Management </em>and <em>Wimmers </em>decisions, we find the Walkers\u2019 reliance upon <em>Sowers </em>unpersuasive. Initially, we note that the factual scenarios in each of the three cases are nearly identical. In each case, an expert witness provided no opinion on an issue before trial and then attempted to express an opinion at trial. Confronted with these circumstances in <em>Waste Management </em>and <em>Wimmers, </em>we found a duty to supplement arising under Civ.R. 26(E)(1)(b). Conversely, in <em>Sowers, </em>the Twelfth District Court of Appeals found no duty to supplement discovery responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Upon careful reflection, however, we find <em>Sowers </em>unpersuasive and, at least in part, distinguishable. Declaring the expert\u2019s trial testimony nonprejudicial, the <em>Sowers </em>court first noted that the appellants had a sufficient opportunity to impeach the expert on cross-examination. The court also stressed that another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>defense expert provided trial testimony identical to the challenged testimony. Furthermore, the <em>Sowers </em>court reasoned that the appellants could not have been surprised by Dr. Ferriero\u2019s testimony because the \u201ctiming issue\u201d was \u201cthe central causation question at trial.\u201d Additionally, the court noted the absence of evidence suggesting that the appellees deliberately attempted to mislead the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">In the present case, however, Holland\u2019s counsel likely would have been unable to effectively cross-examine Dr. Huey without being told that he had reviewed the ultrasound itself and formed an opinion. As the Ohio Supreme Court noted in <em>Shumaker, </em>\u201cpreparation for effective cross-examination is especially compelling where expert testimony is to be introduced.\u201d <em>Shumaker, supra, </em>28 Ohio St.3d at 370, 28 OBR at 431, 504 N.E.2d at 47. Presumably, the <em>Sowers </em>court found the appellants sufficiently able to cross-examine the appellee\u2019s expert at least in part because another defense expert testified earlier and provided the same testimony. In the present case, however, no other expert testified that Mrs. Walker\u2019s subchorionic tear had, in fact, expanded. Furthermore, in <em>Wimmers, supra, </em>we upheld the exclusion of testimony from a party\u2019s expert witness even though a second expert offered the same testimony and the appellee was prepared to rebut that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The <em>Sowers </em>court also reasoned that the appellants could not have been surprised by an expert\u2019s testimony on \u201cthe timing issue\u201d because it was \u201cthe central causation question at trial.\u201d In the present case, however, the central causation questions were whether the accident caused the subchorionic tear and whether the tear caused the miscarriage. Dr. Huey offered his opinion on these subjects in pretrial deposition testimony. Significantly, however, he <em>did not </em>opine that Mrs. Walker\u2019s tear had expanded. In fact, when questioned on the subject, he professed to have no knowledge that the tear had increased, and he agreed that the small tear could have affected Mrs. Walker\u2019s pregnancy. Later, at trial, Dr. Huey did have knowledge that Mrs. Walker\u2019s subchorionic tear had increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">In our view, \u2022 the appellee likely would have been surprised by this proposed testimony. Furthermore, in both <em>Waste Management </em>and <em>Wimmers, </em>the experts involved offered no opinion on a critical issue before trial. The experts then attempted to express an opinion at trial. We found exclusion of this testimony proper notwithstanding the fact that it concerned a \u201ccentral\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\"> Indeed, it is well established that expert testimony may be excluded as a sanction for violating Civ.R. 26(E)(1)(b). <em>Waste Management, supra; Shumaker, supra, </em>at 370, 28 OBR at 431-432, 504 N.E.2d at 47. Furthermore, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that the admission or exclusion of evidence rests with the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Withers </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 53, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>55, 73 O.O.2d 280, 281, 337 N.E.2d 780, 781-782. Absent an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion and material prejudice to the affected party, reviewing courts should be slow to interfere. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">In the present case, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Dr. Huey\u2019s proposed trial testimony. The doctor\u2019s surprise opinion, which he formed the weekend before trial, could not have been anticipated. In his pretrial deposition, Dr. Huey denied having knowledge that the subchorionic tear had expanded. Dr. Huey then professed to have an opinion on the subject at trial. In our view, this change cannot be characterized as a \u201cnuance,\u201d and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting the testimony. See <em>Long v. Isakov </em>(1989), 58 Ohio App.3d 46, 51, 568 N.E.2d 707, 712 (recognizing that \u201c[t]he failure of a party to supplement discovery when its expert witness formulates or changes an opinion may be grounds for reversible error\u201d). Accordingly, we overrule the Walkers\u2019 first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In their second assignment of error, the Walkers claim that the jury\u2019s verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Specifically, the Walkers contend that the manifest weight of the evidence supports awarding them damages at least equal to Mrs. Walker\u2019s emergency room bills. In support of their argument, the Walkers insist that the record demonstrates some objective manifestations of injury suffered by Mrs. Walker. Furthermore, given her physical complaints following the accident, they contend that diagnostic medical treatment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\"> As we review the Walkers\u2019 argument, we remain mindful that factual determinations properly are made by the trier of fact. Additionally, determining the weight given to evidence and assessing the credibility of witnesses are tasks primarily performed by the trier of fact. Consequently, a lower court\u2019s judgment will not be reversed as against the manifest weight of the evidence if the judgment is supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case. <em>Studebaker v. Staudter </em>(Aug. 30, 1996), Montgomery App. No. 15508, unreported, 1996 WL 491795, citing <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">After reviewing the record, we find competent, credible evidence supporting a finding that Holland did not cause Mrs. Walker\u2019s physical ailments or her miscarriage. As appellee Holland stresses in his brief, the record contains testimony that Mrs. Walker had experienced, and received treatment for, neck and back problems since 1983. Mrs. Walker also testified that those problems \u201cflared up\u201d following a 1991 automobile accident and troubled her intermittently thereafter. In fact, the record reveals that Mrs. Walker received treatment from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Richard Teeters, a Dayton chiropractor, just ten days before her December 23, 1993 automobile accident with Holland.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Other than her complaints of \u201csoreness\u201d in her neck and \u201cpelvic cramping,\u201d Mrs. Walker identified no other physical symptoms immediately following her accident. Furthermore, the record contains testimony from Dr. Steven John DeVoe, who testified that cramping during a pregnancy is so common that \u201cyou cannot attach a lot of significance to it by itself.\u201d Additionally, as we noted above, Mrs. Walker had received treatment for neck problems just ten days before the accident. Mrs. Walker did allege that she later developed a bruise on her abdomen, but no medical records or doctor\u2019s testimony substantiated this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The record also contains testimony from Dr. Richard Teeters, who confirmed the hospital\u2019s diagnosis of an acute cervical strain. He also testified that Mrs. Walker sustained a \u201csevere acute sprain/strain to the cervical spine of the neck, the thoracic spine of the upper back, and her left shoulder.\u201d Dr. Teeters further testified that Mrs. Walker had \u201cligamentous instabilities\u201d and \u201csome myofascitis with some nerve root irritation.\u201d In Dr. Teeters\u2019s opinion, Mrs. Walker\u2019s accident with Holland caused these injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">After reviewing the entire record, however, we find competent, credible evidence supporting a finding that Holland did not cause Mrs. Walker\u2019s physical problems. Although the record contains evidence suggesting that Holland did cause some physical injury, the record also reveals evidence supporting a contrary conclusion. As we explained above, the jury\u2019s function was to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses. In performing its role, the jury remained free to believe or disbelieve the testimony from any witness on the issues of causation and damages. After reviewing the entire record, we cannot say that the finding that appellee Holland\u2019s negligence did not cause any physical injuries is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Likewise, we cannot say the jury\u2019s determination that Holland\u2019s negligence did not cause Mrs. Walker\u2019s miscarriage is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Mrs. Walker\u2019s own expert, Dr. Huey, admitted that he could not be sure whether the' subchorionic bleed occurred before or after the accident. He also noted that a subchorionic bleed can occur without any trauma. Additionally, Dr. Huey had opined in an April 5, 1994 report to the Walkers\u2019 attorneys that \u201cit is very difficult for me to speculate as to the probability of the loss of the pregnancy related to the accident. It would be very easy to argue from either side of the argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Furthermore, appellee Holland\u2019s expert, Dr. DeVoe, testified that a two-month-old fetus is well protected by pelvic structures. He also stated that miscarriages occur for a variety of reasons and that the cause of a particular miscarriage often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>is impossible to determine. Additionally, Dr. DeVoe explained that the risk of a miscarriage increases if conception occurs within three months of a prior miscarriage. In the present case, Mrs. Walker suffered a miscarriage in September 1993, just six to seven weeks before conceiving the child she miscarried allegedly as a result of Holland\u2019s collision with her car. Finally, Dr. DeVoe opined that the December 23, 1993 automobile accident at issue \u201chad nothing to do with the miscarriage eight weeks later.\u201d Although Mrs. Walker presented expert testimony reaching an opposite conclusion, the foregoing statements represent competent, credible evidence to support a finding that Holland\u2019s negligence did not cause Mrs. Walker\u2019s miscarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Nevertheless, the Walkers argue that even assuming Holland\u2019s negligence proximately caused no objective injuries, Mrs. Walker was entitled to compensation for the medical expenses she incurred immediately after the accident. In particular, the appellants contend that the emergency room examination and ultrasound test, Mrs. Walker received were appropriate under the circumstances. Consequently, the Walkers claim that the manifest weight of the evidence supports finding that Holland\u2019s negligence proximately caused this \u201ceconomic injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">We agree. Although the jury determined that Holland\u2019s negligent driving did not cause Mrs. Walker\u2019s miscarriage or any physical injuries, it cannot be disputed that Holland\u2019s negligence caused Mrs. Walker to undergo an emergency room examination and an ultrasound test. In light of Mrs. Walker\u2019s pregnancy and the substantial damage done to her vehicle in the head-on accident, we agree that she received appropriate medical treatment. Common sense would dictate, at a minimum, that a pregnant woman should undergo such testing. Furthermore, in the present case, Dr. Huey also testified that Mrs. Walker\u2019s treatment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">In his brief to this court, however, Holland cites <em>Reder v. Antenucci </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 139, 574 N.E.2d 1137, for the proposition that \u201cmedical expenses for diagnostic tests are not recoverable in the absence of causation and injury.\u201d In that case, the Trumbull County Court of Appeals reasoned that \u201c[w]ithout injury and causation, there could be no damages for medical expenses or otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 574 N.E.2d at 1139. In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Reder </em>court relied upon <em>Muncy v. Jones </em>(Jan. 19, 1984), Franklin App. No. 83AP-562, unreported, 1984 WL 4597.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">In <em>Muncy, </em>the court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">\u201cIn order for the medical bills to be the subject of compensatory damages, plaintiffs were required to establish a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s negligence and the expenses, and expert testimony was required to establish the necessity of the treatment which resulted in the billings. On the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>simply because plaintiffs\u2019 expert testified that the billings were necessitated by the accident, they are not automatically entitled to prevail on the question of necessity, even where their expert\u2019s testimony on that point is not directly controverted by defendant\u2019s evidence, so long as there appear in the record objectively discernible reasons upon which the jury could rely to reject the expert\u2019s opinion testimony. <em>State v. Brown </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 133, at 135 [5 OBR 266, at 267, 449 N.E.2d 449, at 450-451].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">In the present case, a fair reading of the record <em>does </em>establish a causal connection between Holland\u2019s negligence and Mrs. Walker\u2019s medical expenses. Furthermore, the Walkers <em>did </em>present expert testimony concerning the propriety of Mrs. Walker\u2019s treatment. This testimony was not contradicted by appellee Holland\u2019s expert witness. Thus, pursuant to <em>Muncy, </em>absent some \u201cobjectively discernible reasons\u201d upon which the jury could have relied to deny damages for the medical bills, the Walkers are entitled to compensation for the expenses. Based upon our review of the record, we find nothing in the record to support a conclusion that Holland\u2019s negligence did not proximately cause the medical expenses incurred by the Walkers. Accordingly, the jury\u2019s refusal to award Mrs. Walker damages for diagnostic medical tests performed immediately following the accident is against the manifest weight of the evidence. See <em>Minney v. Guthrie </em>(Jan. 12, 1989), Greene App. No. 88-CA-37, unreported, 1989 WL 2182 (noting that \u201c[b]oth experts agreed that it was reasonable for Minney to have sought emergency room treatment and follow-up neck therapy after the collision. At a minimum, the manifest weight of the evidence supports an award of damages for Minney\u2019s emergency room care immediately following the collision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Having reached this conclusion, we are compelled by <em>Hanna v. Wagner </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St.2d 64, 68 O.O.2d 37, 313 N.E.2d 842, to remand for a new trial. In <em>Hanna, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that in a jury case, an appellate court may not enter a final judgment based upon the weight of the evidence. Instead, the appellate court must remand the cause for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 66, 68 O.O.2d at 38, 313 N.E.2d at 843. <em>\u201cIt is </em>obvious that to do otherwise would be the denial of the fundamental right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>Horrisberger v. Mohlmaster </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 494, 501, 657 N.E.2d 534, 539 (quoting <em>Hanna </em>and holding that \u201c[w]hen an appellate court reverses on the manifest weight of the evidence in a case in which a jury was the trier of fact, the appellate court \u2018may not enter final judgment on the wuight of the evidence but must remand the cause for a new trial.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Accordingly, we will sustain the Walkers\u2019 second assignment of error in part, reverse the lower court\u2019s judgment in part, and remand this cause for a new trial on the limited issue of whether Holland\u2019s negligence proximately caused Mrs. Walker to sustain damages equaling her emergency room bills. We overrule the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Walkers\u2019 second assignment of error to the extent it challenges the jury\u2019s finding that Holland\u2019s negligence did not cause Mrs. Walker\u2019s miscarriage or any physical injuries. Those findings are not against the manifest weight of the evidence and should not be retried upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In their third assignment of error, the Walkers contend that the trial court erred by providing the jury with improper instructions concerning damages for a miscarriage. Specifically, the Walkers claim that the trial court improperly limited them to recovering damages for pain and suffering for the actual miscarriage itself. They contend that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions did not allow them to recover for future grief, pain, and suffering stemming from the miscarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The jury\u2019s verdict, and our holding above, however, render this assignment of error moot. As a prerequisite to receiving <em>any </em>damages for the miscarriage, Ohio law required the Walkers to demonstrate that appellee Holland\u2019s negligence proximately caused the miscarriage. Without establishing causation, Holland would not be liable for any pain and suffering damages related to the miscarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">In an uncontested portion of the jury instructions, the trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIf the plaintiff has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of any injury to the plaintiff, then your verdict should be in favor of the defendant and you need not proceed further, except to sign the appropriate verdict in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">As the appellee properly notes in his brief, \u201cSince the jury determined that the defendant was not liable to the plaintiffs and returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, the alleged failure to properly instruct the jury with respect to damages is necessarily rendered harmless.\u201d Furthermore, based upon our review of the record, we find adequate evidence to support a conclusion that Holland\u2019s negligence did not cause the miscarriage. Accordingly, we find any alleged error in the trial court\u2019s jury instructions harmless, and we overrule the Walkers\u2019 third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Having sustained the Walkers\u2019 second assignment of error as it relates to damages for medical expenses, however, we reverse the judgment of the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court in part and remand this cause for a new trial on that issue alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b829-11\">Wolff and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-16\">. At trial, Dr. Huey explained that he also had examined Mrs. Walker on December 21, 1993, just prior to the accident. Dr. Huey did not conduct an ultrasound during the preaccident examination, however, and he admitted at trial that he had no way of knowing what an ultrasound would have shown. Nevertheless, he opined that if Mrs. Walker\u2019s subchorionie bleed had existed prior to the accident, his examination probably would have revealed cramping, bleeding, or an irritable uterus. Dr. Huey also admitted on cross-examination, however, that he did not know \u201cone-hundred percent\u201d whether the subchorionie bleed existed before the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\">. The court\u2019s opinion in <em>Tritt </em>was written by Judge Whiteside, a well-respected member of the Ohio judiciary. Concurring in Judge Whiteside's opinion were Judge Young and Judge McCormac, the author of Ohio Civil Rules Practice, (2 Ed. 1992), a leading treatise on the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. Additionally, as a member of, and consultant to, the Rules Advisory Committee, Judge McCormac drafted and redrafted <em>several </em>of Ohio's Civil Rules and many of the accompanying staff notes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
