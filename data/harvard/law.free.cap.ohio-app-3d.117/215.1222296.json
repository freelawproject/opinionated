Rowe, from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Marion County, Probate Division, denying his Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate the judgment ordering the sale of his father\u2019s farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">This action arises out of a guardianship and the sale of the ward\u2019s property. In March 1990, Thomas Rowe (\u201cthe guardian\u201d) applied to the probate court to become the guardian of the person and estate of his brother, Ilger 0. Rowe. The appointment was granted on April 26, 1990, despite the submission of an investigative report which cautioned the court that there were concerns over the sincerity of Thomas Rowe in his desire to obtain financial control over Ilger\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">On August 24, 1995, the guardian filed a complaint for authorization to sell Ilger\u2019s farm for the amount of $188,812.20, allegedly the appraised value of the acreage. Appellant sent a response to the court objecting to the sale of the property, which the court filed as an answer to the complaint. At the pretrial conference held on October 12, 1995, appellant requested, and was granted, additional time to obtain an attorney to represent his interests at the hearing on the complaint. The next entry on the court\u2019s docket was filed on October 20, 1995. This \u201cdefault judgment\u201d entry asserted that all interested parties had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>served, and ordered the sale of Eger\u2019s property to pay unspecified \u201cdebts.\u201d Record of the sale to Dora Rowe and John Rowe, the sister-in-law and nephew of Eg\u00e9r, was filed on November 1, 1995, with no evidence in the record that any attempt was made to offer the farm to any other potential buyer. There is no evidence in the record of any action taken in the case between October 12, 1995 and October 20, 1995, when the sale was ordered. However, an \u201cAmended Confirmation Order,\u201d denoted a \u201cfinal appealable order\u201d of sale was issued by the court and filed on November 20, 1995. Although the clerk sent a copy of this order to appellant via certified mail and regular mail, it was returned as undeliverable both times. The court did not attempt further service, even though the order had been sent to the wrong address. Moreover, the address to which the order was sent was not the address where appellant had been previously served by the court, and it was not appellant\u2019s last known address. The order was never sent to appellant\u2019s last known address, which is clearly shown in the record and is clearly ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Thus, having missed filing a timely appeal, appellant filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion to vacate the judgment, on several grounds. After the trial court summarily overruled appellant\u2019s motion, he timely appealed to this court, asserting the following five assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">\u201cI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the sale of the farm without an evidentiary hearing because appellees filed no motion for default judgment, no seven-day notice of hearing, and no hearing [sic] if appellant made an appearance, after the filing of the complaint, as the guardian indicated on the order of sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">\u201cII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the sale of the farm without an evidentiary hearing because the guardian filed no motion for summary judgment [or] notice of hearing, and conducted no hearing pursuant to Civ.R. 56 after appellant filed his answer objecting to the sale of the farm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">\u201cin</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the sale of the farm by stating the motion was a substitute for an appeal when the final appealable order was never served on appellant and the appellant had grounds for the motion to set aside the sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u201cIV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the sale of the farm when appellant\u2019s due process rights were violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201cV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the sale of the farm without an evidentiary hearing because operative acts warranted a hearing and it was [an] abuse of discretion to deny the motion without such hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court, for various reasons, erred in denying his motion to set aside the sale of his father\u2019s farm. Based upon our discussion of the relevant Ohio law, below, we sustain appellant\u2019s assignments of error and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">In <em>Moldovan v. Cuyahoga Cty. Welfare Dept. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 293, 296, 25 OBR 343, 345-346, 496 N.E.2d 466, 468, the Ohio Supreme Court found that \u201cfailure to give reasonable notice of final appealable orders is a denial of the right to legal redress of injuries created by Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d More recently, in <em>Atkinson v. Grumman Ohio Corp. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 80, 81, 523 N.E.2d 851, 853, the Supreme Court, reversing the decision of the court of appeals, held that \u201creasonable notice of a final order is required to be given to parties by the deciding court to protect the parties\u2019 right to appeal.\u201d If reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard have not been afforded the litigants, they are denied due process of law. <em>Id. </em>at 85, 523 N.E.2d at 856, In <em>Atkinson, </em>the clerk had not served the appellant with notice of the final order until more than thirty days had elapsed after the filing of the judgment. Appellant\u2019s appeal was dismissed by the appeals court for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that it was not timely filed pursuant to App.R. 4(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Although the Supreme Court has not stated exactly what kind of notice constitutes reasonable notice, electing instead to leave that task to the legislature and administrative services, see <em>Moldovan, 25 </em>Ohio St.3d at 296, 25 OBR at 345-346, 496 N.E.2d 466, 468, we find that a cursory attempt at service, resulting in no notice given at all, clearly is not reasonable under the <em>Moldovan </em>and <em>Atkinson </em>decisions. There is no evidence in the record of this case that the court ever sent reasonable notice to appellant of the final judgment issued in this case. However, there is evidence in the record that the court knew appellant\u2019s proper address, to which the clerk had already sent some prior notices. See <em>Defini v. Broadview Hts. </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 209, 213, 601 N.E.2d 199, 201-202 (judgment properly vacated after appellant had not received proper notice of final appealable order; notation on docket sheet not sufficient to conclusively prove notice); <em>Welsh v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number><em>Tarentelli </em>(1992), 76 Ohio App.3d 831, 603 N.E.2d 399 (party may not be deprived of right to appeal without proper notice of appealable order from clerk of court). Therefore, as stated above, we find that appellant was denied certain constitutional rights in this case, and we sustain appellant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error. The first and second assignments of error are also sustained. Clearly, appellant made an appearance in this case, and Civ.R. 55(A) entitles him to seven days\u2019 notice by the clerk of court and a hearing before judgment may be entered against him. Issues argued under the fifth assignment of error, and some issues raised in the other assignments, <em>e.g., </em>those related to fraud of the guardian, are prematurely raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Having found error prejudicial to the appellant herein in the particulars assigned and argued, we reverse the judgment of the court of common pleas, probate division. The cause is remanded to that court with instructions to the court to vacate the judgment ordering the sale of the farm and to order the title to the farm returned to the estate of Ilger Rowe. As Ilger expired after this action was initiated, the executor of his estate may proceed as is deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-7\">Hadley and Thomas F. Bryant, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
