Smith, d.b.a. Woodbury Builders (\u201cSmith\u201d), contracted to build the Spearses\u2019 Centerville, Ohio residence in September 1990. Smith constructed the home\u2019s I-beam floor support system personally and utilized subcontractors to complete much of the remaining work. After the home\u2019s \u25a0completion, the Spearses noticed \u201csponginess,\u201d depressions, and slanting affecting portions of the floor. As a result of the floor sinking, the home\u2019s walls and floor separated in several places. Additionally, wallpaper split, drywall cracked, doorjambs shifted out of alignment, and the home\u2019s cabinets separated from the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">After discovering these defects, the Spearses filed a complaint against Smith, alleging a breach of contract and negligence. The complaint also included a cause of action against Payless Cashways, Inc., d.b.a. Furrow Building Materials, for negligently furnishing Smith with defective equipment and a claim against Georgia-Pacific for its defective design of the flooring system.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>A bankruptcy court subsequently adjudicated Smith bankrupt, however, and the Spearses amended their complaint and sought a declaratory judgment against Smith\u2019s insurer, Auto-Owners Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cAuto Owners\u201d). The amended complaint alleged that Smith\u2019s insurance policy covered \u201calterations and repairs and all other curative actions required as a result of Smith\u2019s construction of the property.\u201d Consequently, the Spearses sought a declaratory judgment that the Auto-Owners policy covered the damages to their home, which allegedly exceeded $42,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The Spearses later settled their claim against Georgia-Pacific and dismissed their claim against Payless Cashways, Inc. Thereafter, the appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on the issue of Auto-Owners\u2019 insurance coverage for Smith\u2019s work and the damage to the Spearses\u2019 home. In an April 5, 1996 judgment entry, the trial court found no ambiguity in Smith\u2019s Auto-Owners policy and found the damage to the Spearses\u2019 home excluded from coverage. Specifically, the trial court declared all damage to the Spearses\u2019 home excluded from coverage under the policy\u2019s \u201cwork product\u201d exclusion. Additionally, the trial court found immaterial a second policy provision stating an exception to a different exclusion. The Spearses subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal advancing one assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In their lone assignment of error, the Spearses contend that the trial court erred by granting the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the Spearses argue that two policy exclusions apply only to Smith\u2019s faulty construction of the floor support \u2022 system and not resulting damage to the subcontractors\u2019 work. The Spearses also contend that an exception to a third exclusion expressly covers the subcontractors\u2019 work. These arguments require us to construe provisions 2(j) and <em>2(1) </em>of the commercial general liability insurance contract Smith entered into with Auto-Owners. In relevant part, exclusion 2(j) excludes \u201cproperty damage\u201d to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">\u201c(5) That particular part of real property on which you or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on your behalf are performing operations, if the \u2018property damage\u2019 arises out of those operations; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">\u201c(6) That particular part of any property that must be restored, repaired, or replaced because \u2018your work\u2019 was incorrectly performed on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The Spearses claim the foregoing language excludes from coverage only Smith\u2019s faulty work on their home\u2019s flooring. In reaching this conclusion, the Spearses interpret \u201c[t]hat particular part\u201d in paragraphs 5 and 6 as referring only to the flooring support system Smith constructed. They reason that \u201c[n]either of these exclusions relates to claims made for property other than that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>upon which the negligent work was performed.\u201d In the Spearses\u2019 view, the policy excludes Smith\u2019s faulty work itself from coverage, but it does cover damages caused by his faulty work. Thus, they contend that Auto-Owners is responsible for damage to those portions of their home adversely affected by Smith\u2019s construction of the floor support system.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In support of their argument, the Spearses rely upon <em>Akers v. Beacon Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(Aug. 31, 1987), Marion App. No. 9-86-16, unreported, 1987 WL 16260. In <em>Akers, </em>the Third District Court of Appeals construed a similar exclusion, concluding that \u201cthe policy in question does not cover an accident of faulty workmanship but rather faulty workmanship which causes an accident.\u201d In other words, the Spearses stress that \u201c[i]t is not the negligent performance of the contract which gives rise to coverage, but rather damage resulting from the negligent performance.\u201d The Spearses also cite <em>Holub Iron &amp; Steel Co. v. Machinery Equip. &amp; Salvage Co. </em>(July 2, 1986), Summit App. No. 12304, unreported, 1986 WL 7762, in which the Ninth District Court of Appeals similarly reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u201cFor instance, if a contractor negligently installs a roof which must be removed and replaced, he must bear the cost of removing the faulty roof and installing a new one, but the insurance will pay for any damage allowed or caused to the underlying building or its contents. See <em>Simons v. Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co. </em>(E.D.Mo.1983), 569 F.Supp. 1429, affirmed (C.A.8, 1984), 734 F.2d 1318.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In light of <em>Akers </em>and <em>Holub, </em>the Spearses contend that the trial court erred by finding both Smith\u2019s faulty work and the resulting damage to the subcontractors\u2019 work excluded from coverage under the policy. In its April 5, 1996 decision and judgment entry, the trial court rejected the Spearses\u2019 argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201cThe Plaintiffs contend (in addition to their claim that the policy is ambiguous) that exclusion applies only to that particular part of the work which was performed negligently, in this case the floor support system. Therefore, they claim that the cost to repair the floor is excluded from the coverage, but the damage to the rest of the house caused by the lack of a proper support system is not excluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">\u201cThe Court cannot agree with Plaintiffs\u2019 logic. When the exclusion alludes to a particular part of the property the Court fails to discern how one can separate the walls from the floor. The floor is essential and related to every aspect [of] the walls and home. Therefore, any substandard construction of the floor will by association indicate that the walls and composition of the home are inferior. Therefore, the Court concludes that the Plaintiffs cannot isolate the floor from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the walls of the home and maintain that the faulty floor caused damage to the rest of the home, as if there were not a single unit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">After considering the parties\u2019 briefs, the record, and relevant legal authorities, we cannot agree with the trial court\u2019s judgment. At the outset, we note our disagreement with the trial court\u2019s application of exclusion 2(j)(5). As we explained above, that exclusion eliminates coverage for property damage to \u201c[tjhat particular part of real property on which you or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on your behalf <em>are performing operations, </em>if the property damage arises out of those operations.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Significantly, the phrase \u201care performing operations\u201d is written in the present tense.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Exclusion 2(j)(5), like the other exclusions in Smith\u2019s Auto-Owners policy, mirrors the standard form exclusions adopted by the Insurance Services Office (\u201cISO\u201d), an insurance industry organization that drafts and distributes form policies. One commentator has explained that the intent of ISO exclusion 2(j)(5), which Smith\u2019s policy includes verbatim, \u201cis to bar coverage for the work being done by a contractor when claims arise at the time the work is being performed. This bar exists irrespective of whether the claim is being made against the contractor performing the work or the upstream contractor supervising the work.\u201d Franco, Insurance Coverage for Faulty Workmanship Claims Under Commercial General Liability Policies (1995), 30 Tort &amp; Ins.L.J. 785, 796. Thus, in unambiguous terms, exclusion <em>2Q)(5) </em>bars <em>coverage </em>only for damage involving \u201cworks in progress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In the present case, however, the damage caused by Smith\u2019s defective work arose after Smith completed the project. Specifically, the damage at issue in the present appeal \u2014 the damage to those portions of the home built by subcontractors \u2014 did not surface until after the Spearses began residing in their new home. Under these circumstances, we deem exclusion 2(j)(5) inapplicable because \u201c[ejxclusion j(5) is written in the present tense, barring coverage for the \u2018particular part\u2019 of real property on which the insured is working at the time of the loss.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">We turn now to exclusion 2(j)(6), upon which the trial court also relied in its April 5, 1996 decision. As we noted above, exclusion 2(j)(6) excludes from coverage property damage to \u201c[t]hat particular part of any property that must be restored, repaired or replaced because \u2018your work\u2019 was incorrectly performed on it.\u201d The \u201cDefinitions\u201d section of Smith\u2019s policy defines \u201cyour work\u201d as \u201c[w]ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf\u2019 and \u201c[mjaterials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.\u201d A sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>following exclusion 2(j)(6), however, states that the exclusion does not apply \u201cto \u2018property damage\u2019 included in the \u2018products-completed operations hazard.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We find the \u201ccompleted operations\u201d exception to exclusion 2(j)(6) applicable in the present case. Smith\u2019s Auto-Owners policy defines'the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d as including \u201call \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage\u2019 occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work\u2019 except: (1) Products that are still in your physical possession; or (2) Work that has not yet been completed or abandoned.\u201d In our view, Smith\u2019s damage to the subcontractors\u2019 work fulfills this definition. The damage occurred at a home construction site away from any premises Smith owned or rented. Furthermore, the damage arose out of his work on the floor support system. Finally, the Spearses\u2019 home had been completed and no longer was in Smith\u2019s possession when the damage occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">As we noted above, Smith\u2019s Auto-Owners policy states that exclusion 2(j)(6) \u201cdoes not apply to \u2018property damage\u2019 included in the \u2018products-completed operations hazard.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, exclusion 2(j)(6) does not exclude from coverage the damage done to the subcontractors\u2019 work.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Having determined that neither exclusion 2(j)(5) nor exclusion 2(j)(6) excludes from coverage the damage Smith\u2019s faulty work caused to the subcontractors\u2019 work, we turn now to exclusion 2(1). Unlike exclusion 2(j)(6), exclusion 2(Z) \u201cis the exclusion that addresses coverage for property damage to completed work performed by or on behalf of the named insured.\u201d Franco, <em>supra, </em>at 798, quoting Casualty &amp; Surety, FC &amp; S Bulletins (National Underwriter), Sept. 1993, at Aa-15. Exclusion 2(Z) excludes from coverage \u201c \u2018[property damage\u2019 to \u2018your work\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it and included in the \u2018products-completed operations hazard.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\u201cThis exclusion is intended to apply only to work within the product-completed operations hazard. Exclusion Z has no bearing on works in progress.\u201d Franco, <em>supra, </em>at 799. On its face, then, exclusion 2(Z) in Smith\u2019s insurance policy arguably appears to exclude from coverage the damage to his subcontractors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>work. Significantly, however, the exclusion in Smith\u2019s policy also contains an exception. The exclusion \u201cdoes not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on [the insured\u2019s] behalf by a subcontractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In the present case, the work \u201cout of which the damage arose\u201d was Smith\u2019s. The \u201cdamaged work\u201d at issue, however, was performed by Smith\u2019s subcontractors. Therefore, the exception to exclusion <em>2(1) </em>applies. As a result, by its unambiguous terms exclusion <em>2(1) </em>does not eliminate coverage for the harm done to the subcontractors\u2019 work.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Having found no exclusion denying coverage for the damage Smith\u2019s faulty work caused to the remainder of the Spearses\u2019 home, we hold that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment for the appellees. For the foregoing reasons, we find the damage to the subcontractors\u2019 work covered by Smith\u2019s Auto-Owners insurance policy. Furthermore, having found the trial court\u2019s judgment incorrect for the reasons explained above, we need not address the Spearses\u2019 additional argument that certain affidavits created a genuine issue of material fact and precluded summary judgment. Likewise, we need not address their argument that the phase \u201cparticular part\u201d is ambiguous, rendering summary judgment inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In light of the foregoing analysis, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand this cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-9\">Fain and Frederick N. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">. Exclusion (Z) in Smith\u2019s Auto-Owners policy appears to contain a typographical error. The standard form ISO exclusion (Z) contains the language we cited above. Similarly, the various cases and reference materials this court consulted all recite exclusion (Z) verbatim as we have stated it above. Exclusion (Z) in Smith\u2019s policy, however, excludes from coverage \u201c '[property damage\u2019 to 'your work' arising out of it or any part of it <em>and including in </em>the 'products-completed operations hazard.' \u201d As written in Smith's policy, the phrase \u201cand including in\u201d makes little grammatical sense. Clearly, the phrase was intended to read \u201cand included in.\u201d Consequently, this court will interpret the phrase as it was intended to be written and in a way that provides it with meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
