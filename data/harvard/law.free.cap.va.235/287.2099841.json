The defendant previously had been found guilty by a jury of those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">Subsequently, the Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 474, 351 S.E.2d 42 (1986). We awarded the defendant this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">The foregoing charges arose from an incident occurring January 28, 1984. The defendant, age 24, and two accomplices, Jerry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Lee Strawderman, age 17, and Billy Mauck, age 15, planned to rob Garland McDonald, age 69, to obtain funds to purchase whiskey. The defendant and the victim previously had worked together at Weber\u2019s Nursery near Winchester. The victim lived alone in a house trailer near the nursery and the Big Red Service Station, \u201ca combination service station and grocery store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">About 8:20 p.m. on the day in question, defendant, Strawderman, and Mauck travelled to the victim\u2019s home in Mauck\u2019s automobile. Defendant, armed with a .22-caliber rifle, and Mauck entered the trailer upon the victim\u2019s invitation. After talking with the victim for several minutes, according to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, defendant fired three shots that struck the victim in the left chest, the right chest, and right hand and arm. Defendant testified that Mauck fired the shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">After the shooting, the three conspirators fled the scene in the automobile. After a few minutes, they returned to the trailer because defendant \u201cwanted to get rid of the body.\u201d According to Strawderman, they arrived back at the trailer \u201c[a]bout ten minutes\u201d after the shots were fired. Mauck testified that \u201cabout five minutes\u201d had elapsed before they returned to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In the meantime, the victim had walked from his home, leaving a trail of blood in snow, to the Big Red store, a distance of 492 feet. Robert West, manager of the store, saw the victim, a \u201cregular customer,\u201d as the victim entered the establishment at \u201capproximately 8:30, 8:40 p.m.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">According to West, the victim had his \u201carm raised slightly,\u201d there was blood on his arm, and he was carrying a knife. West said to the victim, \u201c \u2018What happened, Mac? What is the matter?\u2019 \u201d According to West, the victim \u201cgrimaced a little bit\u201d and \u201che obviously was hurt and in pain.\u201d The victim then \u201cveered away\u201d from a store counter and stood next to cigarette shelves. The victim did not respond to West \u201cat first.\u201d West repeated, \u201c \u2018What happened, were you in a fight, did somebody try to rob you? What is the matter Mac?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The victim then gave the response that West related to the jury, over defendant\u2019s objection, which generated this appeal. The victim said, \u201c \u2018The tall boy, the tall boy that used to work at Weber\u2019s.\u201d He then said, \u201c \u2018Tell Jerry\u2019 \u201d (the nursery manager) and \u201c \u2018Call the police.\u2019 \u201d According to the record, defendant\u2019s height was at least six feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Deborah Light, a clerk at the service station, also was present when the victim entered the store. She testified that \u201cabout\u201d 8:20 p.m. the victim \u201ccame in and told us ... he needed help.\u201d According to Light, the victim \u201chad trouble breathing\u201d and \u201che laid down\u201d and then \u201csat back up.\u201d At this time, she noticed \u201cblood from the front of his shirt.\u201d Over defendant\u2019s objection, she related to the jury what the victim said to West. According to Light, the victim \u201ckept telling us to call Jerry and he said, \u2018The tall boy at the nursery did it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On cross-examination, Light stated that the victim \u201cwas coherent\u201d and \u201cconscious\u201d when he entered the store. She said that he realized \u201che was frightening us\u201d by holding the knife and \u201che told us that he wasn\u2019t going to hurt us and he laid the knife down.\u201d Light answered affirmatively to questions whether the victim \u201cseemed rather calm\u201d and whether \u201che was able to deliberate, was able to understand what he was saying.\u201d West answered affirmatively to the question whether the victim appeared to be \u201crelatively calm\u201d at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">According to West, he called the police who arrived at the store \u201ca lot faster than I thought.\u201d The victim immediately was transported to the Winchester Hospital. Meanwhile, defendant and his accomplices fled the scene because they observed, from their position near the victim\u2019s home, the police and other emergency vehicles at the service station.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">A physician examined the victim in the emergency room of the hospital at \u201capproximately 8:30, 8:40 p.m.\u201d He described the victim as \u201can elderly man in extremis.\u201d He was \u201cin an almost deathlike state, or predeath-like state\u201d and was \u201cin shock.\u201d The physician examined the victim\u2019s wounds and concluded that, \u201cbecause he was in such profound shock,\u201d his heart or a \u201cgreat vessel\u201d had been penetrated by a bullet. All attempts to revive and resuscitate the victim failed and he was pronounced dead within an hour after he reached the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The trial court admitted the challenged testimony, in which the victim identified defendant as his assailant, on the ground it qualified as an exception to the hearsay rule because it was \u201ca spontaneous utterance.\u201d Upon review, the Court of Appeals decided that the trial court \u201cerred in finding that McDonald\u2019s statements were admissible under the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d 3 Va. App. at 480, 351 S.E.2d at 45. The Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Appeals held that the \u201cstatements were admissible under the dying declaration exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 351 S.E.2d at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Under this exception, dying declarations are admissible evidence in homicide cases if they were made when the declarant was \u201cunder a sense of impending death, and without any expectation or hope of recovery. Whether so made or not, is a preliminary question to be determined by the court on all the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Bull </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 613, 620 (1857). The fact that the declarant was conscious of his condition \u201cmay be established otherwise than by the statements of the decedent: as by the character and nature of the wound, his appearance and conduct, etc.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>43 Va. (2 Gratt.) 594, 608 (1845).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Therefore, the Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, stating that the trial court had reached the correct result for the wrong reason. 3 Va. App. at 481, 351 S.E.2d at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In the present appeal, the Attorney General argues \u201cthe statement of the deceased was properly admitted as an excited utterance and a dying declaration.\u201d Alternatively, the Attorney General contends that admission of the statement, \u201cif error at all, was clearly harmless,\u201d in view of the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The defendant, agreeing that the Court of Appeals correctly ruled out the statement on excited utterance grounds, contends it erred in deciding the statement was admissible as a dying declaration. During oral argument, counsel for defendant contended that neither exception applies to warrant admission of the statement and that the respective exceptions are \u201cmutually exclusive, they cannot coexist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">In addition, defendant argues it was unfair for the Court of Appeals to decide the statement was a dying declaration because the prosecutor never attempted to justify its admission on that ground and the trial court never addressed that issue, the statement having been proffered only as a spontaneous utterance. Because no foundation for the dying declaration exception was laid in the trial court, the defendant argues he was denied an opportunity to rebut any such foundation. Defendant says that had it been argued at trial that the statement of the victim was admissible as a dying declaration, evidence concerning his conditipn and evidence of statements he may have made concerning his hope of recovery \u201cwould have been crucially relevant to the trial court\u2019s determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>tion as to whether or not the statement was, indeed, a dying declaration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">We disagree with the Court of Appeals that the statement was not admissible as a \u201cspontaneous utterance.\u201d We agree with the Attorney General that the trial court correctly admitted the declaration under that exception to the hearsay rule. Thus, we do not reach for decision the question whether the statement was admissible as a dying declaration. Nor do we reach the issue whether the Court of Appeals misapplied the \u201cright result for the wrong reason\u201d rule of appellate procedure and usurped the trial court\u2019s function of deciding the threshold question under the dying declaration exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Evidence of an excited utterance is admissible to prove the truth of the matter asserted, as an exception to the hearsay rule, provided the extrajudicial statement is \u201cspontaneous and impulsive.\u201d <em>Upton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>172 Va. 654, 657, 2 S.E.2d 337, 339 (1939). The reliability of the statement, ordinarily guaranteed by oath and cross-examination, is furnished by its spontaneity. <em>Kuckenbecker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 619, 622, 101 S.E.2d 523, 526 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">A homicide victim\u2019s statement \u201cmade a short time after he has been mortally wounded which obviously [has] not been concocted or premeditated charging the defendant with the act\u201d is admissible as an excited utterance. <em>Huffman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>168 Va. 668, 681, 190 S.E. 265, 271 (1937). \u201cNeither time nor distance is conclusive.\u201d <em>Upton, </em>172 Va. at 657, 2 S.E.2d at 339. The test is whether the statement is the transaction speaking through the declarant or the declarant speaking about the transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 657-58, 2 S.E.2d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">There is no fixed rule by which the question whether the statement is admissible as an excited utterance can be decided. Resolution of the issue depends on the circumstances of each case and \u201crests within the sound judicial discretion and judgment of the trial court.\u201d <em>Huffman, </em>168 Va. at 681, 190 S.E. at 271. That discretion and judgment, of course, is subject to review. Nonetheless, in a doubtful case there \u201cis a presumption in favor of the action\u201d of the trial court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">In the present case, the trial judge correctly concluded that \u201cthe time frame is quite important, but it is not the only frame of reference in reaching decision on this\u201d issue. \u201cOne made unconscious by an assault might be conveyed to a distant hospital and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>might long remain in that condition, but if, in struggling back to consciousness, he were to name his assailant, that would be admissible in evidence, for it would be a statement both spontaneous and impulsive.\u201d <em>Upton, </em>172 Va. at 657, 2 S.E.2d at 339. <em>Compare Doe </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>227 Va. 466, 472, 318 S.E.2d 382, 386 (1984) (statement made 18 hours after event ruled inadmissible where declarant, although unconscious most of that time, \u201ccame and went\u201d negating assertion that declarant was in insensible coma during entire period).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Here, the trial judge properly concluded under the evidence that the statement was made \u201cwithin as little as five minutes\u201d after the shooting and \u201cquite probably not more or as much as ten minutes after he was shot.\u201d In addition, the trial judge accurately decided that the state of the victim\u2019s physical condition and emotional stability \u201cmust be considered along with the time frame.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The victim had been shot at close range twice in the chest. Trailing blood, he walked 492 feet seeking help. Within five to ten minutes, he was observed to be grimacing, obviously \u201churt and in pain.\u201d While he seemed to be \u201ccoherent,\u201d \u201cconscious,\u201d and \u201ccalm,\u201d he \u201cveered away\u201d from a counter as he moved through the store. He \u201chad trouble breathing\u201d and was bleeding from his chest and arm. Although he seemed to be \u201cable to deliberate\u201d and understand what was being said, he was in \u201cprofound shock\u201d and appeared \u201cin an almost death-like state\u201d when examined in the hospital within five or ten minutes after he made the statement. Moreover, the statement in issue was not responsive to any question from those in the store. He was asked what had happened and, instead of relating what had occurred, he blurted the identity of his assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Considering all the circumstances surrounding the statement, we hold that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting the declaration as an excited utterance. The victim had been mortally wounded, he was suffering from the trauma, he was in or approaching a state of shock, and his emotional stability was tenuous at most. The statement was not a mere narrative of a completed affair. Rather, it was part of the instinctive reaction to a horrifying event.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The statement is in marked contrast to those held inadmissible in <em>Goins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 285, 237 S.E.2d 136 (1977), and <em>Nicholaou </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>217 Va. 618, 231 S.E.2d 318 (1977), cases cited by the Court of Appeals. In <em>Goins, </em>the dec\u00eda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>rations of a deceased robbery victim were made more than 15 minutes after the event and after a police investigator had questioned the declarant about the crime. In <em>Nicholaou, </em>arising from a motor vehicle accident, the statements were made by an unknown witness to the defendant at least six or seven minutes after the event and while the investigating police officer was questioning the declarant about the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">For these reasons, the orders of the Court of Appeals will be</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
