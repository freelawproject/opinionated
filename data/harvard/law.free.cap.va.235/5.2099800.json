Lunsford received from the trial court a declaration that she was wrongfully denied a variance which would have permitted a subdivision of her land. Finding the trial court\u2019s action erroneous, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The record shows that Lunsford owns and resides upon Lot 12 in Alanton Subdivision in Virginia Beach. Alanton was platted in 1925, prior to adoption of the city\u2019s subdivision ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Bordering Linkhorn Bay, Lot 12 contains 2.39 acres. The lot was acquired in 1949 by Lunsford and her husband, since deceased, under a deed which permits subdivision of the lot into \u201cnot . . . more than two parts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Lot 12 is zoned R-l Residential District, requiring a minimum lot area of 40,000 square feet. Lunsford proposed to subdivide the parcel into two lots, with each containing more than the 40,000 square-foot minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Section 4.4(b) of the subdivision ordinance incorporates by reference the zoning ordinance of Virginia Beach which in turn requires that a lot in an R-l district have a width of 125 feet at the 50-foot front yard minimum setback line. Section 4.4(d) requires that each lot in a subdivision have \u201cdirect access to a public street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">Lot 12 is \u201cpie\u201d or \u201cwedge\u201d shaped and has only a width of 66 feet at the 50-foot front yard setback line. Furthermore, the lot has access to a public street only by way of a private road over which Lunsford has \u201ca perpetual right of way.\u201d Hence, Lot 12 is nonconforming with respect to both \u00a7\u00a7 4.4(b) and 4.4(d), and the two lots in Lunsford\u2019s proposed subdivision would also be nonconforming in the same respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">Pursuant to \u00a7 9.3 of the subdivision ordinance, Lunsford filed an application for a variance with the city planning commission on March 23, 1983. The commission conducted a hearing on the application on May 12, 1983, and recommended approval. City council heard the matter on June 20, 1983, and denied the application. On July 19, 1983, Lunsford filed the present declaratory judgment proceeding and, as previously noted, received a declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tion from the trial court that council\u2019s action was illegal. The individual members of council then initiated this appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Section 9.3 of the subdivision ordinance provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">The city council may authorize in specific cases such variances from the strict application of the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest . . . , provided that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-6\">No variance shall be authorized by the city council unless it finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">(a) Strict application of the ordinance would produce undue hardship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Section 9.3(d) provides in part that \u201c[pjersonal . . . hardship shall not be considered as [a ground] for the issuance of a variance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">The parties engage in prolonged debate on the question of Lunsford\u2019s burden of proof in establishing a hardship within the meaning of the subdivision ordinance. The City contends the burden should be the same as is imposed upon an applicant for a variance from the terms of a zoning ordinance, which burden is defined in Code \u00a7 15.1-495(b) as requiring a showing of \u201ca clearly demonstrable hardship approaching confiscation.\u201d <em>See Bd. of Zoning App. </em>v. <em>Nowak, </em>227 Va. 201, 204, 315 S.E.2d 221, 223 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">Lunsford contends on the other hand that because \u00a7 9.3 is silent on the subject of confiscation, speaking only of an \u201cundue hardship,\u201d a \u201cless stringent interpretation of subdivision variance provisions makes sense.\u201d Zoning and subdivision concepts \u201care not synonymous,\u201d Lunsford opines. Zoning regulations, Lunsford states, relate to land use while subdivision regulations merely seek to promote uniformity of development. Hence, Lunsford concludes, \u201csubdivision hardship ... is something <em>less </em>than confiscation.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>We find these arguments interesting but, in the view we take of the case, quite academic. We will assume, without deciding, that the term \u201cundue hardship\u201d means something less in a subdivision context than in a zoning context. Yet, we think that even under a lesser burden of proof, Lunsford has failed to establish an \u201cundue hardship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Lunsford concedes that \u201cfinancial loss, standing alone, cannot establish [a] hardship sufficient to justify the granting of a subdivision variance.\u201d She argues, however, that financial loss \u201cis a factor to be taken into consideration with the other reasons of hardship [she has assigned] and should not be ignored.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The \u201cother reasons of hardship\u201d Lunsford has assigned include the loss of \u201ccommon law property rights to subdivide,\u201d loss of \u201cthe original deed subdivision property rights,\u201d loss of \u201can otherwise reasonable use,\u201d and \u201cdifficulty in resale.\u201d Except for the \u201cdifficulty in resale\u201d ground, however, neither the record nor Lunsford\u2019s brief provides any factual or legal support for the \u201cother reasons of hardship.\u201d And the \u201cdifficulty in resale\u201d ground is supported only by Lunsford\u2019s self-serving testimony that prospective purchasers who wanted her \u201c$210,000 lot\u201d would not want her \u201c$72,000 house\u201d and those who wanted her \u201c$72,000 house\u201d would not want her \u201c$210,000 lot.\u201d She did not indicate that any effort had been made to market the house and lot together.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Lunsford is left, therefore, with nothing but financial loss as a ground of hardship. True, her loss might be significant; she testified that the \u201cdifference in value [without a variance] would be close to $100,000.\u201d But, as Lunsford has correctly conceded, financial loss, standing alone, is not sufficient to justify the granting of a variance. <em>See Natrella </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>231 Va. 451, 458, 345 S.E.2d 295, 300 (1986), and <em>Azalea Corp. </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>201 Va. 636, 641, 112 S.E.2d 862, 866 (1960). All Lunsford stands to suffer is a personal loss, and, under \u00a7 9.3(d) of the subdivision ordinance, that cannot \u201cbe considered as [a ground] for the issuance of a variance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">We will reverse the judgment of the trial court and dismiss Lunsford\u2019s petition for declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b29-11\"> In addition to appellant John A.
