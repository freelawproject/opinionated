Claiming damages for personal injuries, each plaintiff had invoked the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51-60 (1982) (FELA). In each appeal, the sole issue is whether the plaintiff was a statutory employee as defined in the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (1982) (LHWCA or the Act). If so, the parties agree that the remedy provided by the Act is exclusive, <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) (1982), and that we should affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The two plaintiffs are Nancy J. Schwalb and William C. Mc-Glone. Each was an employee of the defendant, The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company. Although the accidents resulting in the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries occurred at different times, the facts in the two cases, insofar as relevant to the issue common to the two appeals, are substantially identical. Each plaintiff was employed as a laborer to perform housekeeping and janitorial services in the offices, shops, bathrooms, and other places situated on the defendant\u2019s pier and adjacent property in Newport News. This property is equipped with facilities designed to transfer coal from railroad cars to ships moored at the pier. A \u201cdumper\u201d, activated by \u201ctrunnion rollers\u201d, upends railroad cars and dumps the coal into \u201choppers\u201d. The coal falls from the hoppers onto conveyor belts that carry it to a \u201cloading tower\u201d from which it is poured into the hold of a ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Coal spilled on the trunnion rollers can cause the dumpers to malfunction. Coal falling and accumulating beneath the conveyor belts eventually may damage the belts and interrupt the loading process. As part of the duties assigned by the defendant, the plaintiffs were required to clear away coal spilled in these areas. Because they were not members of a longshoremen\u2019s union, the plaintiffs were forbidden to load that coal onto the conveyor belts. The plaintiff McGlone was clearing away coal beneath a conveyor belt at the time he was injured. The plaintiff Schwalb was injured in a fall as she was walking along a \u201ccatwalk\u201d approaching the trunnion rollers.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The parties in both cases agree that the defendant railroad is a statutory employer as defined in the LHWCA, that is, an employer \u201cany of whose employees are employed in maritime em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>ployment, in whole or in part\u201d. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(4) (1982). The plaintiffs\u2019 contention is that the trial courts erred in ruling that they were statutory employees as defined in the Act. The plaintiffs rely upon our decision in <em>White </em>v. <em>N. and W. Ry. Co., </em>217 Va. 823, 232 S.E.2d 807, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 860 (1977). Reviewing a judgment based on such a ruling, we applied the Act as amended in 1972, Pub. L. No. 92-576, 86 Stat. 1251, to the facts in <em>White. </em>First enacted in 1927, Pub. L. No. 69-803, 44 Stat. (part 2) 1424, the LHWCA was the first successful congressional response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>244 U.S. 205 (1917). There, the Court had ruled that a state workers\u2019 compensation act could not constitutionally apply to a longshoreman injured in an accident that had occurred on a gangplank between a pier and a ship. Initially, Congress sought to authorize states to extend their workers\u2019 compensation statutes seaward of the <em>Jensen </em>line, but the Court held the state statutes to be unconstitutional delegations of congressional power. <em>Knickerbocker Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>253 U.S. 149 (1920); <em>Washington </em>v. <em>W.C. Dawson &amp; Co., </em>264 U.S. 219 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Although the federal Act filled a workers\u2019 compensation void, the LHWCA, as originally enacted, provided coverage only when \u201cdisability or death result [ed] from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States\u201d. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) (1927). Federal compensation coverage stopped at the <em>Jensen </em>line; the Act did not apply to a longshoreman injured at work on a pier, even though engaged in traditional longshoremen\u2019s functions. <em>Nacirema Operating Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>396 U.S. 212, 218-20 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The 1972 amendments to the LHWCA moved the <em>Jensen </em>line landward to include areas adjoining navigable waters and \u201ccustomarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel\u201d. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) (1982). Yet, Congress did not extend federal coverage to every worker injured in such areas, for it added an amendment defining a covered employee as \u201cany person engaged in maritime employment\u201d. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3) (1982). The effect of the two amendments was to create a two-pronged coverage test \u2014 the situs of the injury and the status of the injured worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In <em>White, </em>a railroad employee filed a claim under FELA. He had been injured on a situs covered by the LHWCA, and \u201cthe critical question presented . . . [was] whether plaintiff was a \u2018per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>son engaged in maritime employment\u2019 and thus an \u2018employee\u2019 within the meaning of the Act.\u201d 217 Va. at 827, 232 S.E.2d at 809. White was hired as an electrician to maintain and repair the electrical equipment used at a pier to dump coal from railroad cars, to move conveyor belts transporting the coal, and to load the coal into ships. Although White did not operate any of the equipment employed in the loading process, the railroad argued that \u201call of his activity was \u2018functionally related\u2019 to the loading of coal on ships\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 831, 232 S.E.2d at 812, and that he was, therefore, an employee engaged in maritime employment and, as such, was limited to the remedy provided by the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">In <em>White, </em>the railroad had borrowed the \u201cfunctional relationship\u201d formula from the opinion in <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation, </em>540 F.2d 629, 637-38 (3d Cir. 1976). Considering the history of the Act and construing the congressional intent underlying the 1972 amendments, we rejected that formula. We adopted, instead, the standard articulated in <em>Weyerhaeuser Co. </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>528 F.2d 957, 961 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 868 (1976):<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">[F]or an injured employee to be eligible for federal compensation under [the Act], his own work and employment, as distinguished from his employer\u2019s diversified operations, including maritime, must have a realistically significant relationship to \u2018traditional maritime activity involving navigation and commerce on navigable waters,\u2019 with the further condition that the injury producing the disability occurred on navigable waters or adjoining areas as defined in \u00a7 903.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Applying the <em>Gilmore </em>standard, we said that \u201cwe do not believe plaintiffs duties . . . had a realistically significant relationship to the loading of cargo on ships\u201d, that \u201cplaintiff was not a covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u2018employee\u2019 within the meaning of the Act\u201d, and that \u201cthe order dismissing plaintiffs FELA action will be reversed\u201d. 217 Va. at 832-33, 232 S.E.2d at 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In the appeals at bar, the defendant railroad relies on <em>Price </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>618 F.2d 1059 (4th Cir. 1980). There, the plaintiff in an FELA action was a painter employed by the defendant railroad. He sustained an injury while painting the support towers of a structure housing a conveyor belt system used in loading grain into the hold of a vessel. The <em>Price </em>court reasoned that, because \u201cthe failure to paint would eventually lead to severe rusting that would halt the entire [loading] process\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 1062 n.4, the plaintiff was engaged in maritime employment and, consequently, \u201cwas an \u2018employee\u2019 within the meaning of the LHWCA which provides an exclusive remedy\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">We cannot agree that Congress intended the 1972 amendments to have such pervasive and preclusive effects. Nor do we agree with the argument advanced by the railroad in these appeals that the Supreme Court implicitly has overruled our decision in <em>White. </em>On brief, the defendant says that \u201cthe U.S. Supreme Court has stated that one is engaged in maritime employment if he is \u2018engaged in the <em>overall </em>process of loading and unloading vessels\u2019 (emphasis supplied).\u201d For this proposition, the defendant cites <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co. </em>v. <em>Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249 (1977). The language the defendant quotes from that decision is an abbreviated excerpt lifted from a longer passage, the import of which we construe differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The injuries at issue in <em>Caputo </em>were sustained during the process of unloading a ship. Considering the reports of the congressional committees that initiated the 1972 amendments, the Court concluded that Congress intended</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">to cover those workers involved in the <em>essential elements </em>of unloading a vessel \u2014 taking cargo out of the hold, moving it away from the ship\u2019s side, and carrying it immediately to a storage or holding area. . . . [P]ersons who are on the situs but are not engaged in the overall process of loading and unloading vessels are not covered. Thus, employees such as truckdrivers, whose responsibility on the waterfront is essentially to pick up or deliver cargo unloaded from or destined for maritime transportation are not covered. Also excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>are employees who perform purely clerical tasks and are not engaged in the handling of cargo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 267 (emphasis added). As we construe this language, the Court reasoned that, although clerical employees working on a covered situs may have responsibilities related to the commercial process, unless they are \u201cengaged in the handling of cargo\u201d, they are not \u201cinvolved in the essential elements of [loading or] unloading a vessel\u201d and, therefore, are not statutory employees for purposes of the LHWCA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We recognize that the Act is remedial in purpose and, as the defendant says, that <em>\u201cCaputo </em>requires an expansive view of LHWCA\u201d. We note, however, that the Court speaks of covered workers as those \u201cinvolved in the essential elements of unloading a vessel\u201d, <em>id.; </em>as those \u201cdirectly involved in the loading or unloading functions\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 271 (quoting S. Rep. 1125, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1972) and H.R. Rep. 1441, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 11 (1972)); and as those who \u201cspend at least some of their time in indisputably longshoring operations\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 273. Two years following <em>Caputo, </em>the Court said that \u201cworkers doing tasks traditionally performed by longshoremen are within the purview of the 1972 Act.\u201d <em>P. C. Pfeiffer Co. </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>444 U.S. 69, 82 (1979). And the Supreme Court, recalling the language of <em>Caputo, </em>emphasized in its most recent analysis of the status test that the purpose of the maritime employment requirement was \u201cto cover those workers on the situs who are involved in the <em>essential elements </em>of loading and unloading\u201d. <em>Herb\u2019s Welding, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>470 U.S. 414, 423 (1985) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">We believe the \u201cessential elements\u201d standard is more nearly akin to the \u201csignificant relationship\u201d standard we adopted in <em>White </em>than the \u201coverall process\u201d construction invoked by the defendant. In this respect, we see no logical difference between workers \u201cwho perform purely clerical tasks\u201d, <em>Caputo, </em>432 U.S. at 267, and workers who perform purely maintenance tasks, such as painting, or workers who, like the plaintiffs in these appeals, perform purely housekeeping and janitorial tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Applying the rule in <em>White, </em>we hold that the plaintiffs were not statutory employees as defined in the LHWCA. We will re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>verse the judgments dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 FELA actions and remand the cases for trials on the merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Record No. 841743 \u2014 <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aiqu\">Record No. 850728 \u2014 <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\"> The Supreme Court disapproved application of a significant relationship standard to determine the status of the worker in <em>Director, OWCP </em>v. <em>Perini North River Associates, </em>459 U.S. 297, 302 n.8, 318-19 (1983). The Court did not, however, disapprove a significant relationship standard as a concept when applied, as in <em>Gilmore, </em>to post-1972 coverage landward of the <em>Jensen </em>line. As noted by the majority in <em>Herb\u2019s Welding, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>470 U.S. 414, 424 n.10 (1985) (quoting <em>Perini, </em>459 U.S. at 299, 324 n.34) the decision in <em>Perini </em>\u201cwas carefully limited to coverage of an employee \u2018injured while performing his job upon actual navigable waters\u2019 . . . [and] was, \u2018of course,\u2019 limited to workers covered prior to 1972\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-5\"> In the Schwalb appeal, the defendant argues that the plaintiff \u201cis estopped from denying LHWCA coverage\u201d because she accepted compensation paid under the Act. According to the defendant\u2019s brief, \u201c[s]he expresses no agreement to off-set compensation payments previously received against any recovery under FELA and, therefore, double recovery remains a possibility.\u201d But, in a memorandum of law filed in the trial court, we find that the plaintiff acknowledged that \u201cany recovery by plaintiff on her FELA claim will be reduced by the amount of LHWCA benefits she may have already received.\u201d A railroad worker who makes such a concession does not seek a double recovery and is not precluded from pursuing a remedy under FELA. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Norfolk and Western Ry. Co., </em>596 F.2d 1205, 1208 (4th Cir. 1979); <em>accord Caldwell </em>v. <em>Ogden Sea Transport, Inc., </em>618 F.2d 1037, 1049 (4th Cir. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
