Richards, </em>on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b502-12\">POFF, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3V\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">The dispositive issue framed in this appeal is whether the Peninsula Airport Commission (PAC) is a political subdivision within the meaning of Article X, Section 6(a), of the Virginia Constitution and former Code \u00a7 58-12(1) (now, Code \u00a7 58.1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>3606) and, as such, exempt from taxation by the County of York (the County).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">By Acts 1946, c. 22, the General Assembly provided that, if any two or more of the counties of Warwick, Elizabeth City, and York, the cities of Newport News and Hampton, and the town of Phoebus resolve \u201cthat there is need for an airport commission to be created for the purpose of establishing and operating one or more airports or landing fields for all such political subdivisions, an airport commission, to be known as \u2018The Peninsula Airport Commission\u2019, shall thereupon exist\u201d. Appropriate resolutions were adopted, and PAC began operations of an airport on land it acquired in the County and in the adjacent City of Newport News.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In 1984, the County\u2019s Commissioner of the Revenue assessed real estate taxes totalling $32,866.84 for the years 1981-1984 on the 406 acres of PAC\u2019s property situated in the County. PAC paid the taxes in full and then filed this action at law challenging the assessment and seeking reimbursement. The trial court ruled that PAC was a municipal corporation and that its land was exempt from taxation under the Virginia Constitution and former Code \u00a7 58-12(1). Accordingly, the court ordered the County to refund all taxes paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">On appeal, the County attacks the trial court\u2019s decision on three grounds. The County asserts that PAC is not a municipal corporation and that, even if it is, its property is not exempt from taxation. Finally, the County argues that, even if PAC qualifies for tax exemption, the exemption does not extend to that portion of the property PAC had leased to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Article X, Section 6(a), of the Virginia Constitution provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the following property and no other shall be exempt from taxation, State and local . . .:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">(1) Property owned directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Section 6(c) of Article X states that the General Assembly may \u201crestrict or condition . . . but not extend\u201d an exemption created by subsection 6(a). <em>See Richmond </em>v. <em>Day Nursery Ass\u2019n, </em>207 Va. 561, 562 n.1, 151 S.E.2d 370, 372 n.1 (1966); <em>Hollywood Cemetery Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>123 Va. 106, 110, 96 S.E. 207, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>208 (1918). Former Code \u00a7 58-12(1) tracked the language of subsection 6(a)(1). The County argues that the trial court erred in holding that PAC\u2019s property was tax exempt absent a ruling that it was a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d of the Commonwealth. While the trial court did not use that term, we do not find its order fatally flawed. The transcript shows that the court used the term \u201cmunicipal corporation\u201d interchangeably with the term \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d throughout the evidentiary hearing and without objection by counsel. And, indeed, we have said that municipal corporations are \u201cpolitical subdivisions of the State\u201d. <em>R. F. &amp; P. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>145 Va. 225, 238, 133 S.E. 800, 803-04 (1926); <em>see also Portsmouth </em>v. <em>Va. Ry. &amp; P., No. 1244, </em>141 Va. 54, 66, 126 S.E. 362, 365 (1925); <em>Portsmouth </em>v. <em>Va. Ry. &amp; P., No. 1243, </em>141 Va. 44, 47, 126 S.E. 366, 367 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\">Certain commissions, authorities, and other \u201cspecial district\u201d bodies are sometimes labeled \u201cquasi-municipal corporations\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">Such entities are not municipal corporations in the strict sense of the term, but where it appears that the legislature intended that they should be so construed, the designation \u2018municipal corporation\u2019 is often used in a broad or generic sense to include those \u2018quasi-municipal corporations\u2019 which are created to perform an essentially public service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><em>Hampton Rds. San. Dist. Comm. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>193 Va. 371, 374-75, 68 S.E.2d 497, 499 (1952) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We have been required to determine the character of several such entities for taxation and sovereign-immunity purposes. As this Court first explained in <em>Hampton Rds. San. Dist. Comm., </em>in categorizing a particular entity, the first inquiry is \u201chow many attributes of a municipal corporation does the entity in dispute possess?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, 68 S.E.2d at 500. We have identified six attributes pertinent to that inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">(1) Creation as a body corporate and politic and as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">(2) Creation to serve a public purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">(3) Power to have a common seal, to sue and be sued, to enter into contracts, to acquire, hold and dispose of its revenue, personal and real property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">(4) Possession of the power of eminent domain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>(5) Power to borrow money and issue bonds which are tax exempt, with interest on such bonds enjoying the same status under tax laws as the interest on bonds of other political subdivisions of the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-3\">(6) Management of the corporation vested in a board of directors or a commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Authority, </em>210 Va. 645, 647, 172 S.E.2d 831, 832 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The County\u2019s appeal focuses on the first of these attributes. As we have said and as counsel for the County acknowledged in oral argument, the County\u2019s position is that, if the legislative act that authorized the creation of PAC did not identify it expressly as a political subdivision, PAC cannot occupy the status of a municipal corporation despite the powers delegated to it or the public purpose it serves.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The County asks us to elevate form over substance. We decline to do so. The original act provided that PAC was to be an \u201cindependent body corporate\u201d. Acts 1946, c. 22, \u00a7 8. During the years relevant to this appeal, the enabling act, as amended, provided that \u201cneither the Commonwealth nor <em>any political subdivision thereof other than the commission </em>shall be liable\u201d on any PAC bonds or other obligations. <em>Id., </em>as amended, \u00a7 15 (emphasis added). We conclude from these two provisions that the General Assembly meant for PAC to occupy the status of a political subdivision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Looking behind labels to the relevant components of the organic act, as amended, we find that PAC possesses all the essential attributes of a municipal corporation. PAC serves a public purpose <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 21); PAC has the power \u201cto sue and be sued, to adopt a seal . . ., and to make and execute contracts\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 3(a)), and to acquire, hold, and dispose of its revenue and its personal and real property <em>(id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-b, 18-19); PAC has the power of eminent domain <em>(id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3(d), 4); PAC can \u201cborrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>money and issue bonds\u201d that are tax exempt <em>{id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3(m), 15-17, 21); and PAC\u2019s corporate management is vested in a commission <em>{id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\">The County contends that, notwithstanding PAC\u2019s attributes, it cannot be classified as a municipal corporation because it performs proprietary rather than governmental functions. The County relies upon <em>VEPCO </em>v. <em>Hampton Red. Authority, </em>217 Va. 30, 225 S.E.2d 364 (1976). There, we were asked to decide whether a local housing authority was a municipal corporation and, if so, whether it enjoyed sovereign immunity. Perceiving \u201cno valid reason for declaring that an entity occupies the status of a municipal corporation for tax refund purposes and not . . . for purposes of determining its immunity from tort liability\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 34, 225 S.E.2d at 368, we held that the housing authority was a municipal corporation for purposes of considering the sovereign-immunity question. We resolved that question against the housing authority on the ground that it was performing proprietary rather than governmental functions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The County urges us to apply that test to the issue in this case. We hold that such a test is irrelevant to a determination of the taxable status of a municipal corporation, because it is constitutionally tax exempt for <em>all purposes </em>unless otherwise provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The County next contends that the legislative intent of section 21, a provision added to the original act in 1964, was to condition or restrict the scope of PAC\u2019s constitutional tax exemption. In pertinent part, section 21 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">[A]s the operation and maintenance of any project which the authority is authorized to undertake will constitute the performance of an essential governmental function, the commission shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon any facilities acquired and constructed by it under the provisions of this act ... .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The County argues that this language \u201cobviously evidences an intention not to exempt the land\u201d from taxation. PAC, on the other hand, contends that \u201cfacilities\u201d includes \u201cany possessions or properties which serve to accomplish airport purposes\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">We agree with PAC\u2019s understanding of the language. An airport\u2019s facilities necessarily include those parcels of land required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>for the construction of runways and for the safe use of the runways. In addition to property contained within the area of the airport proper, the airport\u2019s facilities include outlying properties required by the federal government for the \u201capproach\u201d and \u201cclear\u201d zones as well as the \u201ctransitional\u201d zones surrounding the runways. Absent a commitment to acquire and maintain interests in these outlying properties, PAC could not have obtained the 90 percent federal funding it received in establishing the airport. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7 77.25 (1988) (establishing \u201cCivil airport imaginary surfaces\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 151.9 (requiring ownership or planned acquisition of runway clear zones by federal-aid recipients); <em>see also </em>Acts 1946, c. 22, \u00a7 3(1) (empowering PAC to \u201ccomply with [federal law] . . . and any rules and regulations made thereunder for the expenditure of federal monies in connection with airports, landing fields and air navigation facilities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">As we construe section 21, it was not intended to condition or restrict the scope of PAC\u2019s constitutional tax exemption, and we hold that PAC is a municipal corporation (a political subdivision) and that its tax exemption extends to all its property necessary to accomplish the public purposes for which it was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The parties stipulated at trial that PAC had leased a portion of the property it owned. Citing former Code \u00a7 58-14 (now, Code \u00a7 58.1-3603),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the County asserts that \u201c[e]ven if the property of PAC is otherwise lawfully exempt from taxation, the leased portion lost its exempt status when it was leased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The County\u2019s assessment of 406 acres of PAC\u2019s property fails to segregate, evaluate, and assess the 150-acre portion that was leased, and the County has not made a provisional assessment. At trial, after PAC had moved the court to enter judgment in its favor on the entire amount of taxes paid, the County offered to recall the Commissioner of the Revenue to estimate what assessment would be proper on the leased parcels. Agreeing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>PAC\u2019s argument that the Commissioner of the Revenue is required to follow strict statutory procedures in making assessments, the trial court entered judgment in favor of PAC and ordered the County to refund the entire amount of taxes paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\">We uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling. The County has not made a separate assessment of the leased parcels and recorded that assessment on the land books of the County as required by former Title 58, Chapter 15, of the Code (now, Title 58.1, Chapter 32).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Permitting the Commissioner of the Revenue to assess the property at trial would have denied PAC substantial safeguards guaranteed by former Title 58, Chapter 22, Article 2, of the Code (now, Title 58.1, Chapter 39, Article 5) respecting the correction of erroneous assessments. The County cannot ignore the procedures and safeguards mandated by statute without offending due process principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Finding that PAC is entitled to the exemption from taxation accorded by the Virginia Constitution and former Code \u00a7 58-12(1) and that the question concerning the taxable status of the leased parcels for the years 1981-1984 is not a justiciable controversy, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\"> We reject the County\u2019s contention that local activation of the Commission precludes a finding that it is a political subdivision. It is true that when participating localities retain \u201csubstantial local control\u201d over an entity they have created, local activation negates its status as a state agency or an \u201carm\u201d of the Commonwealth. <em>Prendergast </em>v. <em>Park Author</em>ity, 227 Va. 190, 194, 313 S.E.2d 399, 401 (1984). However, such an entity, although not an arm of the Commonwealth, still may be a municipal corporation (and, thus, a political subdivision) if it possesses enough of the essential attributes. <em>See VEPCO </em>v. <em>Hampton Red. Authority, </em>217 Va. 30, 32-34, 225 S.E.2d 364, 367-68 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> Former Code \u00a7 58-14 provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Whenever any building or land, or part thereof, mentioned in \u00a7 58-12, and not belonging to the State, shall be leased or shall otherwise be a source of revenue or profit, all of such buildings and land shall be liable to taxation as other land and buildings in the same county, city or town, except as is now or may hereafter be provided by law; provided, that when a part but not all of any such building or land shall be leased or otherwise be a source of revenue or profit, and the remainder of such building or land shall be used by any organization specified in \u00a7 58-12 for its purposes, only such portion thereof shall be liable to taxation as is so leased or is otherwise a source of profit or revenue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\"><em> </em>When former Code \u00a7 58-14 was recodified as Code \u00a7 58.1-3603, effective January 1, 1985, the General Assembly added the following subsection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">B.
