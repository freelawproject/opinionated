Finding that the court\u2019s holding was erroneous, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">At pertinent times, the insurer, Pennsylvania Casualty Company, was engaged in writing medical malpractice insurance in this Commonwealth. The insured, Chris Simopoulos, M.D., a gynecologist, and his professional corporation, Chris Simopoulos, M.D., Ltd., had offices in Falls Church, Norfolk, and Woodbridge in Prince William County. Robert Rousseau was an employee of a Woodbridge insurance agency, and for several years prior to 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>had placed Simopoulos\u2019 medical malpractice insurance with St. Paul Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\">In 1983, Rousseau\u2019s agency ceased placing medical malpractice insurance with St. Paul and switched to Pennsylvania Casualty because of the latter\u2019s \u201clesser premium\u201d rates. On November 18, 1983, Rousseau took an application from Simopoulos for a policy with Pennsylvania Casualty providing coverage for himself and his professional corporation. In Simopoulos\u2019 presence and reflecting his direct responses, Rousseau placed an \u201cx\u201d in the \u201cNo\u201d block after each of the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">16. Has your license to practice medicine or your permit to prescribe or dispense drugs ever been denied, revoked, suspended or in any way limited?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">17. Have your staff privileges at any institution ever been suspended or in any way restricted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">23. Have you ever been convicted of a crime (other than a motor vehicle citation)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Simopoulos signed the application, and Rousseau forwarded it to Pennsylvania Casualty. Effective January 1, 1984, Pennsylvania Casualty issued two policies, one a regular medical malpractice policy and the other an \u201cumbrella policy,\u201d insuring Simopoulos and his professional corporation for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In August 1984, during the term of the policies, Robin L. Roundtree asserted a medical malpractice claim against Simopoulos in Norfolk. Receiving notice of the claim, Pennsylvania Casualty employed Donnell R. Davis, a Norfolk attorney, to defend Simopoulos. On August 31, 1984, Davis wrote Pennsylvania Casualty stating that Simopoulos had been only recently arrested in Norfolk \u201cwhile preparing to perform an abortion on a policewoman who was not pregnant.\u201d Davis also indicated in his letter that several of the answers Simopoulos had given to questions in the 1983 application for insurance were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Pennsylvania Casualty then instituted this declaratory judgment proceeding against Simopoulos and his professional corporation as well as Roundtree and two other women, Sandra Stokes and Barbara Lynette Smith, who had asserted claims against Simopoulos. Also included as a defendant was Parviz (or Parvis) Modaber, M.D., a former associate of Simopoulos, who was alleged by Roundtree and Stokes to have caused their injuries. In the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>for judgment, Pennsylvania Casualty sought a declaration that the two policies in question were void <em>ab initio </em>because Simopoulos had \u201cknowingly and willfully misrepresented material facts\u201d in the application for insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\">Simopoulos could not be found and was never served with process. Modaber, Roundtree, Stokes, and Smith filed responsive pleadings alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Pennsylvania Casualty was es-topped from asserting the invalidity of the policies in question. Modaber also alleged in his responsive pleading that \u201cat all times relevant he was an agent, servant, or employee\u201d of Simopoulos.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">At trial, Pennsylvania Casualty introduced into evidence the following exhibits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">A copy of an order of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County showing that Simopoulos had been convicted on April 16, 1980, of performing an abortion outside a hospital during the second trimester of pregnancy;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">A copy of the opinion of this Court affirming Simopoulos\u2019 conviction. <em>Simopoulos </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 1059, 277 S.E.2d 194 (1981);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">A copy of the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States affirming the judgment of this Court. <em>Simopoulos </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>462 U.S. 506 (1983);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">A copy of an order of the Virginia State Board of Medicine entered May 23, 1980, revoking Simopoulos\u2019 license to practice medicine in this Commonwealth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">Copies of letters addressed to Simopoulos from the administrators of Commonwealth Hospital, Fairfax Hospital, and Potomac Hospital, revoking Simopoulos\u2019 membership on the staffs of the three hospitals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">A copy of the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirming a district court\u2019s judgment denying Simopoulos\u2019 \u00a7 1983 action in which he sought injunctive relief from any restriction upon, or suspension of, his right to practice medicine in Virginia or to continue as a staff member of Fairfax Hospital and Potomac Hospital. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>Simopoulos </em>v. <em>Virginia State Bd. of Medicine, </em>644 F.2d 321 (4th Cir. 1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The trial court found that Simopoulos had made material misrepresentations of fact in the application for insurance. This finding was based upon ample evidence, and it has not been questioned on appeal. Accordingly, we need not consider further the falsity or materiality of the answers Simopoulos gave in response to questions 16, 17, and 23 of the application. The trial court held, however, that Pennsylvania Casualty was estopped from relying on the misrepresentations to deny coverage because it issued the policies despite the fact several questions were left unanswered in the application for insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Among the questions left unanswered were three whose answers, in the view of Pennsylvania Casualty\u2019s chief underwriter, would have affected the risk. Question 15 sought information concerning surgical procedures the applicant performed; question 19 queried whether any claim or suit had previously been brought against the applicant; and question 24(b) asked for an explanation of the applicant\u2019s \u201cinformed consent practices/procedures.\u201d Also left unanswered were question 10, which asked for the hours per week the applicant engaged in private practice, and question 12, which inquired about the hours per week the applicant spent on \u201coutside interests/hobbies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Modaber is the only appellee to file a brief on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argues that the unanswered questions in the application for insurance put Pennsylvania Casualty to the duty of inquiring into the truth of the answers Simopoulos actually gave and, because the Company failed to inquire, it is estopped from relying upon the false answers in its attempt to avoid coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Citing <em>Employers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Great American, </em>214 Va. 410, 200 S.E.2d 560 (1973), Modaber contends it is not necessary to show that an insurer or its agent had actual knowledge of an applicant\u2019s fraud. It is enough under <em>Employers, </em>Modaber says, to show that the insurer has \u201cknowledge of facts sufficient to put a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>reasonably prudent person upon inquiry of the possibility of fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 200 S.E.2d at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Despite Modaber\u2019s protestations to the contrary, there is absolutely no evidence in the record to suggest that either Rousseau or Pennsylvania Casualty, at the time the policies were issued, had any knowledge of Simopoulos\u2019 criminal conviction, license revocation, or staff-privilege suspension. Application of the <em>Employers </em>rule depends upon <em>knowledge of facts </em>to put the insurer \u201cupon inquiry of the possibility of fraud,\u201d <em>id., </em>and the unanswered questions on the insurance application simply were insufficient for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The burden \u201crests upon the party relying on the doctrine of estoppel to prove each element by clear, precise and unequivocal evidence.\u201d <em>John Hancock Mutual </em>v. <em>Va. Nat. Bank, </em>212 Va. 31, 33, 181 S.E.2d 618, 620 (1971). This burden required Modaber to prove that Pennsylvania Casualty had knowledge, actual or imputed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of facts which would render its coverage void <em>ab initio, </em>yet issued the policies in question notwithstanding such knowledge. <em>North River Co. </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>155 Va. 588, 603, 155 S.E. 699, 703 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Estoppel is an equitable doctrine, and one cannot \u201cbase a claim for an estoppel upon . . . acts . . . which were induced by his own acts, and <em>a fortiori </em>on those induced by his own fraud or false representations.\u201d <em>Luck Const. Co. </em>v. <em>Russell Co., </em>115 Va. 335, 342, 79 S.E. 393, 395 (1913). Simopoulos put his fraudulent scheme into motion by his false answers to questions 16, 17, and 23 of the application for insurance and thus wrongfully procured the issuance of the policies. Because Simopolous had unclean hands, he had no standing in equity to interpose a plea of estoppel. Modaber, as well as Roundtree, Stokes, and Smith, stand \u201cin the same shoes as [Simopoulos],\u201d <em>Ampy </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>200 Va. 396, 399, 105 S.E.2d 839, 843 (1958), and are in no better position than Simopolous to sustain an estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">For the reasons assigned, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment here in favor of Pennsylvania Casualty declaring the two policies in question void <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-11\"> Simopoulos was sentenced to serve two years in the penitentiary for his conviction, but the sentence was suspended on condition that he serve thirty days in jail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\"> In August 1981, the State Board of Medicine ordered that Simopoulos\u2019 license to practice \u201cbe reinstated on PROBATION for two years\u201d on condition that he not perform \u201cany induced or elective abortions for a period of two years.\u201d His hospital staff privileges were also reinstated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-10\"> After the oral argument in this case, we were notified that settlement had been reached between Pennsylvania Casualty and Robin Roundtree, Sandra Stokes, and Barbara Lynette Smith, and the three women have been dismissed as parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b489-9\"> As Pennsylvania Casualty points out, \u201cimputed knowledge\u201d in this context means knowledge charged to the principal because received by the agent in the scope of employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
