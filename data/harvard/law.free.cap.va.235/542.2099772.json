Specifically, Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that a named insured\u2019s spouse who had left the marital home was a resident of the named insured\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\">The declaratory judgment proceeding was brought by Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) against GEICO and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking an adjudication of the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to certain automobile liability insurance policies. In a prior action, Lloyd L. Menscer was awarded a judgment of $50,000 against Teresa L. Nighohossian (Teresa) for personal injuries he sustained as a result of Teresa\u2019s negligent operation of an automobile owned by James R. Luther (James). Allstate, Menscer\u2019s insurance carrier, defended Menscer\u2019s personal injury action pursuant to the uninsured motorist clause in the policy Allstate had issued to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Allstate contended in the subsequent declaratory judgment proceeding that James\u2019 automobile was covered under a policy issued by GEICO to Wilhemina E. Luther (Wilhemina), James\u2019 wife. Allstate also contended that Teresa was insured under a policy State Farm had issued to Samson Nighohossian (Samson), Teresa\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In response, GEICO alleged that James was not a resident of the household of its insured, Wilhemina, at the time of the accident and, thus, James was not a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the policy that GEICO had issued to Wilhemina. Consequently, GEICO asserted, Teresa could not have been operating the automobile with the permission of a named insured as required by GEICO\u2019s policy. Similarly, State Farm claimed that Teresa was not a resident of the household of its named insured, Samson, when the accident occurred and, thus, was not covered under State Farm\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">. The trial court decided that James was a resident of Wilhemina\u2019s household when the accident occurred and, therefore, qualified as a named insured under GEICO\u2019s policy. The court further concluded that James had given Teresa permission to use his automobile. Accordingly, the court held that primary coverage for the accident rested with GEICO. The court also ruled that Teresa was a resident of Samson\u2019s household on the date of the accident and, therefore, was a named insured under the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Farm policy. Thus, the court decided that secondary or excess coverage for the accident rested with State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\">GEICO and Wilhemina have appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment. The sole question on appeal is whether the court erred in finding that James was a resident of Wilhemina\u2019s household when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The evidence is undisputed. Wilhemina was the only witness to testify at the trial of the present case, although Teresa\u2019s deposition was presented. James was present at the trial, but he did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The accident occurred on July 29, 1981. At that time, a liability insurance policy was in effect that had been issued by GEICO to Wilhemina, who resided on Foxdale Drive in the City of Norfolk. Two automobiles were listed in the policy: James\u2019 1967 AMC Ambassador and a 1972 Chrysler owned by Wilhemina.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Until April 10, 1981, James and Wilhemina resided together in their jointly-owned residence on Foxdale Drive. On that date, however, James left the marital home and never moved back. When he left, he removed virtually all his personal belongings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">James\u2019 and Wilhemina\u2019s separation was not sudden; marital problems had existed for a number of years. The basic problems were James\u2019 \u201cheavy drinking and [his] not coming home after work.\u201d On April 10, James again failed to come home after work. Wilhemina, however, \u201cknew where he was so [she] went there and asked him to either come home or don\u2019t come home.\u201d When James made no response, Wilhemina returned home and packed his belongings. James subsequently moved out of the house, taking his belongings with him. James never objected to his wife\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">James returned to the marital home only once between April 10 and the date of the accident. On that occasion, he and Wilhemina dined out with another couple. The occasion ended unpleasantly. While at dinner, Teresa \u201ccame over to the table and asked [James] to go outside and talk to her.\u201d James did, and when he returned, he immediately took Wilhemina home.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">James and Wilhemina never discussed a reconciliation. Their infrequent telephone conversations \u201cweren\u2019t usually pleasant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>James continued to allow his retirement check of approximately $500 to be deposited into his and Wilhemina\u2019s joint checking account until September or October 1981. From that account, Wilhemina paid the mortgage, \u201cbig bills [and other joint] expenses that [she] and [her] husband had incurred during [their] marriage.\u201d Wilhemina also used the account to maintain the household.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\">From April 10 to the date of the accident, Wilhemina entertained \u201csome hope,\u201d at least \u201cin [her] mind,\u201d of a reconciliation with James. After the accident, however, she decided that \u201cthe marriage was essentially lost.\u201d Wilhemina and James never reconciled after the April 10 separation and subsequently were divorced, based on a continuous, one-year separation from that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On July 24, 1981, Teresa took \u201ca few change[s] of clothes, toothbrush, make-up, and enough to survive on\u201d and moved into the house in which James resided. She remained there until \u201cabout three, four\u201d days after the accident, at which time she returned to live with Samson. At the time of the accident, a State Farm policy issued to Samson was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">GEICO was not notified that James had moved from the marital home until after the accident. Wilhemina took no steps to remove James\u2019 automobile from the GEICO policy until after the accident. She continued to pay GEICO the monthly premiums on her policy through May or June 1981. Wilhemina never demanded a refund of premiums paid to GEICO to insure James\u2019 automobile, and GEICO never refunded any premiums to Wilhemina for the period of coverage after April 10, 1981. On July 7, 1981, Wilhemina completed a GEICO questionnaire in which she listed James\u2019 automobile as a vehicle to be insured under her policy and indicated that James drove the 1967 AMC Ambassador 100 percent of the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Under the terms of GEICO\u2019s policy, James\u2019 1967 AMC Ambassador was an \u201cowned automobile\u201d at the time of the accident, because it was \u201ca private passenger . . . automobile described in [the] policy for which a specific premium charge indicates that coverage is afforded.\u201d With respect to an \u201cowned automobile,\u201d the policy provides that the following persons are insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">(1) the named insured and any resident of the same household,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>(2) any other person using such automobile with the permission of the named insured, provided his actual operation ... is within the scope of such permission ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-3\">The policy defines \u201cnamed insured\u201d to mean \u201cthe individual named in [the policy] and also includes his spouse, if a resident of the same household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Under the State Farm policy in effect at the time of the accident, James\u2019 car was a \u201cnon-owned automobile,\u201d because it was \u201can automobile ... not owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative, other than a temporary substitute automobile.\u201d Under the terms of State Farm\u2019s policy, \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d coverage is excess over any other valid and collectible insurance, including \u201cowned automobile\u201d coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">GEICO contends on appeal that James was not covered by the policy it had issued to Wilhemina because he was not a \u201cresident of the same household\u201d of Wilhemina at the time of the accident. We first defined the term \u201cresident of the same household\u201d in <em>State Farm Mutual </em>v. Smith, 206 Va. 280, 142 S.E.2d 562 (1965), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">The meaning of \u201cresident\u201d or \u201cresidence\u201d . . . depends upon the context in which it is used. Here, we must interpret the meaning of \u201cresident\u201d, when followed by \u201cof the same household\u201d. The word \u201chousehold\u201d, . . . connotes a settled status; a more settled or permanent status is indicated by \u201cresident of the same household\u201d than would be indicated by \u201cresident of the same house or apartment\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 285, 142 S.E.2d at 565-66 (footnotes omitted). In <em>State Farm, </em>we also quoted from <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Pulsifer, </em>41 F.Supp. 249, 251 (D. Me. 1941), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">Whether the term \u201chousehold\u201d or \u201cfamily\u201d is used, the term embraces a collection of persons as a single group, with one head, living together, a unit of permanent and domestic character, under one roof; a \u201ccollective body of persons living together within one curtilage, subsisting in common and directing their attention to a common object, the promotion of their mutual interests and social happiness\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"App\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>State Farm, </em>206 Va. at 285 n.6, 142 S.E.2d at 565-66 n.6. We recently reaffirmed this definition in <em>Allstate Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>231 Va. 358, 361-62, 344 S.E.2d 890, 892-93 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\">We also considered the term \u201cresident of the same household\u201d in <em>St. Paul Ins. </em>v. <em>Nationwide Ins., 209 </em>Va. 18, 161 S.E.2d 694 (1968), a case that is factually similar to the present case. There, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company had issued an automobile liability insurance policy to Tilden Elkins as the named insured. With respect to a non-owned automobile, the policy covered \u201cany relative\u201d of the \u201cPersons Insured\u201d and defined \u201crelative\u201d as \u201crelative of the Named Insured who is a <em>resident of the same </em>household.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 161 S.E.2d at 696-97 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">An automobile operated by Troy Elkins, Tilden\u2019s son, was involved in an accident in which a passenger was injured. Although the automobile was purchased by Troy, it was titled in the name of a friend, with whose permission Troy was driving. The passenger sued Troy.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">At the time of the accident, Troy was on leave from the Army. When Troy had been inducted into the Army, he was living with his parents. At the time of the accident, however, his parents were separated and later were divorced on the ground of the father\u2019s desertion. After Troy was discharged from the Army, he made his home with his mother until he was married.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In <em>St. Paul, </em>Nationwide contended that Troy was not covered by the policy it had issued to Troy\u2019s father because, at the time of the accident, Troy was not \u201ca resident of the same household\u201d of his father. <em>Id. </em>at 22, 161 S.E.2d at 697. We agreed with Nationwide\u2019s contention, stating that \u201cthe undisputed evidence is that at [the time of the accident] Troy\u2019s parents were separated and the former household had been broken up by the father\u2019s desertion.\u201d <em>Id., </em>161 S.E.2d at 697-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">We believe the undisputed evidence in the present case leads to the same conclusion. At the time of the accident, James had not resided in Wilhemina\u2019s household for approximately four months. James had removed virtually all his belongings from the marital home and, so far as the record discloses, had returned to the home on only one brief occasion. More important, nothing in the record suggests that James ever intended to reconcile and resume cohabitation with Wilhemina. \u201c[A] person\u2019s intent is impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>tant in determining whether he qualifies as a resident of a particular household.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>231 Va. at 363, 344 S.E.2d at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\">Based upon the undisputed evidence, the only reasonable inference to be drawn is that James was not a resident of Wilhemina\u2019s household at the time of the accident. Because reasonable minds could not differ upon the question, we hold that, as a matter of law, James was not a resident of Wilhemina\u2019s household when the accident occurred and, therefore, was not covered by GEICO\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and enter final judgment for GEICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\"> Also named as parties defendant were Wilhemina E. Luther, James R. Luther, Samson Nighohossian, Teresa L. Nighohossian, and Lloyd L.
