Because the claimant has lost the case on a motion for summary judgment, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Amanda T. Macaulay sought to recover accidental death benefits under a life insurance policy issued by Home Beneficial Life Insurance Company (the insurance company) to her late husband, Angus H. Macaulay (Macaulay). That policy allowed such a recovery if Macaulay\u2019s death occurred \u201cas the direct result of accidental bodily injury [sustained within 90 days of death] and independently of all other causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">On April 17, 1982, more than 90 days before he died, Macaulay fell down a flight of steps and was hospitalized, suffering from a frontal intracerebral hematoma. On March 14, 1983, he again entered a hospital after having a post-traumatic seizure. On May 21, 1983, Macaulay was injured in an automobile accident; he was treated and released from the hospital. Within 90 days of the automobile accident, on July 24, 1983, he was found unconscious in his home and was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>An autopsy, performed that day, indicated that the most likely cause of Macaulay\u2019s death was cardiac arrest, probably secondary to an arrythmia. Dr. Donald M. Switz, one of Macaulay\u2019s family physicians, in a death certificate filed that day, noted the cause of Macaulay\u2019s death as cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation and coronary artery disease. On October 24, 1983, Dr. Switz filed an amended certificate of death indicating the cause of death was cardiac arrest due to a seizure disorder, which was caused by cerebral trauma resulting from the April 17, 1982 fall and the May 21, 1983 automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Mrs. Macaulay contends that her answers to the requests for admissions created a jury issue as to her right of recovery by stating that \u201cMr. Macaulay\u2019s death is explainable as the <em>direct </em>result of the May 21, 1983, accident whether or not the cyst caused by his fall down the steps in 1982 had occurred.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This contention embraces only the first requirement for recovery under the policy, <em>viz., </em>that death occur \u201cas the direct result of accidental bodily injury\u201d occurring within 90 days of death, and it ignores the second requirement that the accidental death occur \u201cindependently of all other causes.\u201d There could be no recovery if Macaulay\u2019s death was an <em>indirect </em>result of his fall down the steps because it would not have occurred \u201cindependently\u201d of his fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Our holdings in <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>Life of Virginia, 217 </em>Va. 218, 227 S.E.2d 693 (1976), and <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>General Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp., </em>180 Va. 117, 121, 21 S.E.2d 772, 773 (1942), control the outcome of this case. In <em>Tanner, </em>the accidental death provisions of a life insurance policy authorized a recovery for accidental death if the death was \u201ca direct result of such bodily injuries independently and exclusively of all other causes.\u201d 217 Va. at 219, 227 S.E.2d at 694. This language is essentially the same as the language of the accidental death provision in Macaulay\u2019s policy. The insured in <em>Tanner </em>suffered a fatal heart attack after he subdued a physically disruptive patient under his charge at a training school and hospital. The insured\u2019s physician testified, and the trial court found, that if the insured had not had a preexisting condition of arteriosclerosis, his physical exertion would not have caused his death. We held that because the pre-existing arteriosclerosis actively contributed to the insured\u2019s death, his sudden physical exertion could not be considered a cause of death \u201cindependent and exclusive of all other causes,\u201d and we, thus, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>nied recovery under the terms of the insurance contract. <em>Id. </em>at 221, 227 S.E.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In Crowder, an insurance policy provided for disability benefits if the loss was caused \u201csolely from BODILY INJURIES [and] directly and independently of all other causes.\u201d 180 Va. at 119, 21 S.E.2d at 773. In that case, we held that a trial court correctly struck a plaintiffs claim for disability benefits when her expert witness testified that the accidental injury disability \u201cmerely accentuated or aggravated the pre-existing condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122, 21 S.E.2d at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In response to requests for admission, Amanda Macaulay indicated that Dr. Switz was the only expert who would testify as to the cause of Macaulay\u2019s death and that his two letters to the Chief Medical Examiner reflected his medical opinion as to the cause of Macaulay\u2019s death. Thus, Mrs. Macaulay\u2019s response constituted an unqualified admission that Dr. Switz\u2019s opinion would be the evidence she relied upon to prove her case. Both parties recognize that resolution of this dispute depends upon the testimony of medical experts as to the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In his letter to the Chief Medical Examiner dated November 8, 1983, Dr. Switz said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">My view of the sequence and causation for Angus is that he had trauma to the head following his fall and then developed a cyst in his right frontal lobe. He then spontaneously developed seizures in March 1983, which recurred in May 1983, at which time he had an auto accident. It seems reasonable to me that this auto accident, which may well have been associated with the hairline fracture of the right frontal lobe, exacerbated whatever underlying state was causing his epileptic seizures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In this case, the most that Dr. Switz could say was that the automobile accident \u201cexacerbated\u201d Macaulay\u2019s condition or, in the definition of Merriam-Webster, Inc., <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>790 (1961), caused the symptoms \u201cto become more severe.\u201d Accordingly, Macaulay\u2019s death did not result from the automobile accident \u201cindependently\u201d of all other causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Mrs. Macaulay also complains that when the trial court sustained the motion for summary judgment, it did not give her an opportunity to contest \u201ca genuine issue as to a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>fact\u2014whether the 1982 fall either proximately caused or substantially contributed to the death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">As we have pointed out, the only expert who was to testify for Mrs. Macaulay responded in a document attached to an answer to a request for admissions that the accident giving rise to the claim \u201cexacerbated\u201d the pre-existing condition. If death results from an accident that merely exacerbated a pre-existing condition, that pre-existing condition is at least a contributing cause of the death or, put another way, the death was not independent of all other causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">We have consistently held that cases should not be disposed of by summary judgment unless \u201cthere is no material fact genuinely in dispute.\u201d <em>See e.g., Shevel\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Southeastern Associates, Inc., </em>228 Va. 175, 181, 320 S.E.2d 339, 342 (1984). In our opinion, however, the admission of Mrs. Macaulay\u2019s expert witness makes it plain that there is no genuine dispute that Macaulay\u2019s pre-existing brain cyst resulting from his fall down the steps in April 1982 contributed to his death. Therefore, the trial court correctly sustained the insurance company\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we will affirm the action of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b677-7\">COMPTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AI1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Rule 3:18 provides, \u201cSummary judgment shall not be entered if any material fact is genuinely in dispute.\u201d Nevertheless, the majority, in affirming entry of summary judgment, has determined from the \u201cevidence\u201d that the plaintiff may not proceed to trial because of a purported \u201cadmission\u201d contained in pretrial documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">I disagree. In my view, there is a genuine dispute upon a material fact \u2014 the 1983 actual cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Responding to a request for admission, the plaintiff stated that the May 21, 1983 automobile accident was \u201cthe traumatic event which caused Mr. Macaulay\u2019s death, in the opinion of Dr. Switz.\u201d In addition, the plaintiff stated that \u201cMr. Macaulay\u2019s death is explainable as the direct result of the [automobile] accident whether or not the cyst caused by his fall down the stairs in 1982 had occurred.\u201d Thus, the plaintiff represented that her evidence would establish that \u201cthe\u201d traumatic event causing death was the auto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>accident and that death was explainable as \u201cthe\u201d direct result of that accident. Reasonably to be inferred from those representations is the conclusion that death occurred \u201cas the direct result of accidental bodily injury and independently of all other causes,\u201d within the meaning of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s position, there was no requirement for the plaintiff, at the pretrial stage of the case, affirmatively to negate any \u201cindirect\u201d or contributing cause of death, if any existed. An assertion of \u201cthe\u201d, and not \u201ca\u201d, direct cause was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Relying exclusively on another statement by Dr. Switz in the pretrial documents that the auto accident merely \u201cexacerbated\u201d the decedent\u2019s underlying condition, the majority has concluded there is no material fact genuinely in dispute. That information only indicates an inconsistency in the opinions of Switz and presents an evidentiary conflict. Questions of credibility of witnesses and conflicts in the evidence are within the province of the fact finder to be decided during a trial on the merits and not when ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and permit the case to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">CARRICO, C.J., joins in dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
