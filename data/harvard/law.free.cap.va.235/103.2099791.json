Angle, from the rank of lieutenant with the Franklin County Sheriffs Department to the position of corrections officer assigned to the Franklin County jail. Consequently, Angle filed a grievance pursuant to the county ordinance establishing a grievance policy and procedure. Angle\u2019s grievance ultimately was heard and decided substantially in Angle\u2019s favor by a three-member panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">When Overton received the panel\u2019s decision, he advised Angle that \u201c[a]fter considering the \u2018Recommendations\u2019 of the . . . Panel,\u201d he had decided that Angle would remain a corrections officer. Thereupon, Angle petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandamus to compel Overton to implement the panel\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">The trial court refused to implement the panel\u2019s decision, finding that it was merely a recommendation. The trial court concluded, therefore, that Overton was not bound by the panel\u2019s decision, but was free to exercise his discretion in deciding whether to implement it. The trial court opined that because Angle sought to compel Overton to perform a discretionary act, mandamus did not lie. Angle appeals from the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">The facts are undisputed. At the time Angle was demoted, he had been employed by the Sheriffs Department for 12 years, the last eight years with the rank of lieutenant. In February 1984, Angle participated with State Alcoholic Beverage Control officers in a raid on an illegal liquor operation in Franklin County. Following the raid, Angle was questioned about the incident by a newspaper reporter and responded to the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Prior to the incident, Overton had issued an order directing all personnel in his department not to give information to the media concerning the participation of the Sheriffs Department in the enforcement of state liquor laws. Instead, any such news releases were to be made by State Alcoholic Beverage Control officers. Because he violated Overton\u2019s order, Angle was demoted to the position of corrections officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The grievance panel found that Angle was aware of Overton\u2019s direct order respecting press releases concerning illegal liquor operations, but that he was not aware of the penalty for violating the order. The panel further found that Angle had violated the order, \u201c[e]ven though the violation . . . appeared to be inadvertant [sic].\u201d The panel noted that Angle did not have any record of disciplinary problems, and during his years of service with the Sheriffs Department, he had demonstrated \u201chigh standards, and professionalism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Having made these findings and upon consideration \u201cof all facts,\u201d the panel concluded that Angle should be disciplined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">This panel recommends that Gene Angle be given a two week suspension without pay effective immediately. In addition, when Mr. Angle returns to duty . . . , he will do so at his former rank of lieutenant but with an administrative decrease of one salary step ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">It is not the intention of this panel to award any back pay to Gene Angle for the time he has been working in the capacity of corrections officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">Mr. Angle will also be advised that a probationary period of one year will be enforced on his performance. Any violation of Sheriffs Department policy, violation of an order, or insubordination during this probationary period could result in more severe disciplinary action by the Sheriff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Franklin County\u2019s grievance procedure was established pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.1-7.1, which provides in pertinent part that \u201cthe governing body of every county . . . which has more than fifteen employees shall have a grievance procedure for its employees that affords an immediate and fair method for the resolution of disputes which may arise between [the] public employer and its employees . . . .\u201d Code \u00a7 15.1-7.2 mandates that a county \u201cshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>have a grievance procedure which fully and closely complies with the definition of a grievance and the minimum provisions of the state grievance procedure as described in \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1.\u201d <em>See Jones </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>234 Va. 621, 363 S.E.2d 921 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Both Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1(D)(4) and the corresponding provision of the County\u2019s grievance procedure, Section 7.1(e), provide that the panel\u2019s decision \u201cshall be final and binding.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[e]ither party may petition the circuit court having jurisdiction ... for an order requiring implementation of the decision of the panel.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1(F).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In its memorandum opinion, the trial court correctly stated that \u201c[t]he controlling issue ... is whether the [panel\u2019s decision is] a binding finding which the Sheriff is required to follow or merely a recommendation to be considered by the Sheriff.\u201d The trial court concluded that the panel\u2019s decision was merely a non-binding recommendation. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Focusing upon the panel\u2019s use of the term \u201crecommends,\u201d the trial court erroneously concluded that implementation of the panel\u2019s decision was within Overton\u2019s discretion. Our reading of the panel\u2019s decision, in light of the statutory mandate that it is <em>binding, </em>leads us to the conclusion that it commanded Overton to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The panel said that \u201cwhen,\u201d not \u201cif,\u201d Angle \u201creturns to duty . . . , he <em>will </em>do so at his former rank of lieutenant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The panel also stated that \u201cAngle <em>will </em>... be advised that a probationary period of one year <em>will </em>be enforced.\u201d (Emphasis added.) These provisions of the decision are couched in mandatory, not discretionary, language.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The panel was composed of non-lawyers. It is not reasonable, therefore, to expect the panel to employ language that would \u201cmeet the standards of the most efficient legal technician.\u201d <em>Narrows </em>v. <em>Clear-View Cable TV, </em>227 Va. 272, 281, 315 S.E.2d 835, 840, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 925 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Obviously, if Overton were free either to accept or to reject the panel\u2019s decision, the decision would not be binding and the griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>anee procedure mandated by the General Assembly would be rendered impotent. We reject such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case with directions that the trial court enter \u201can order requiring implementation of the decision of the panel.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-10\"> The issue of grievability is not before us in this appeal. If grievability becomes an issue, it must be resolved before a panel hearing is conducted. Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1 (E); Section 7.1(d), County Grievance Policy and Procedure. <em>See generally City of Danville </em>v. Franklin, 234 Va. 275, 361 S.E.2d 634 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-11\"> Because of this statutory proceeding, a mandamus proceeding is unnecessary. Nevertheless, under either procedure, the issue is the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
