Quarles as Superintendent of Schools for the City of Bristol. Quarles appealed the School Board\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court of the City of Bristol as provided by Code \u00a7 22.1-65.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his petition for appeal, Quarles alleged that he had been employed as superintendent of schools for the city since July 1, 1973, and that the \u201cSchool Board and the members thereof individually, wrongfully, summarily and without sufficient cause, arbitrarily and capriciously dismissed [him].\u201d In answer to Quarles\u2019 petition, the School Board and its individual members admitted the period of Quarles\u2019 employment as Superintendent of Schools, but denied all other allegations in his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">After the School Board had filed answers to interrogatories, Rule 4:8, and responses to requests for admissions, Rule 4:11, Quarles, pursuant to Rule 3:18, moved for summary judgment and \u201cfor his reinstatement as Superintendent.\u201d The motion requested that the court declare his removal from office \u201cvoid and without effect, the same being in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d The School Board opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The trial court ruled that Quarles had been removed from office \u201cwithout notice of charges justifying his dismissal and a hearing upon such charges,\u201d and that, therefore, the School Board had \u201cfailed to accord him procedural due process as required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The court opined that \u201cwhile [Quarles] has suffered no significant deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> upon evidence replete in the record . . . , [he] has been deprived of his liberty interests.\u201d Finding that \u201cno material fact is genuinely in dispute upon the issues raised by [Quarles\u2019] Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d the trial court granted the motion and \u201cenjoined and directed [the School Board] to reinstate\u201d Quarles as Superintendent on or before September 17, 1984, \u201cunless [the School Board] should sooner give [Quarles] notice of the charges justifying his dismissal, and . . . notice of a hearing on [the] charges which shall be held on or before October 2, 1984.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The School Board objected to the court\u2019s actions, indicated its intention to appeal, and requested suspension of the execution of the judgment upon giving an appropriate appeal bond. The requested suspension of execution of the judgment was denied by the trial court. The School Board appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The undisputed facts are derived from the pleadings and from the School Board\u2019s answers to interrogatories and responses to requests for admissions. Quarles was employed as Superintendent of Schools for the City of Bristol on July 1, 1973. He served in that office until he was removed by the School Board at its meeting held on December 12, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">On December 12, 1983, the School Board discussed Quarles\u2019 removal in an executive session, which, by definition, was not open to the public. Code \u00a7 2.1-341 (c). The School Board gave no notice to Quarles that his removal would be considered at the meeting, and Quarles was not present during the executive session.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">After the executive session, but before reconvening the public session, the School Board privately informed Quarles of its intention to remove him and of the reasons for his removal. The School Board also offered Quarles an opportunity to respond at that time; however, he made no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Immediately thereafter, in accordance with Code \u00a7 2.1-344(c), the School Board adopted a motion in the reconvened public session to remove Quarles as Superintendent of Schools. The motion read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>That the Superintendent be relieved of his duties and responsibilities to the Bristol Virginia School Board effective immediately, due to ineffective leadership of the Superintendent with the Board, lack of communication with personnel, and for the betterment of the school system and the community as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">In the executive session, the School Board arrived at six general reasons for Quarles\u2019 removal. These reasons, as stated in one of the School Board\u2019s answers to interrogatories, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">(a) [Quarles\u2019] unwillingness or inability to carry out the directives and policies of the School Board;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">(b) His failure to fairly and adequately communicate with the School Board, school personnel and the community, with respect to matters and occurrences affecting the proper operation of the School System;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">(c) His unwillingness or inability to supply proper educational leadership for the School Board, the School System and the community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">(d) His unwillingness or inability to handle personnel matters within the School System in a dignified, fair and impartial manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">(e) His failure to properly supervise the maintenance, use and repair of the physical plants of the School System; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">(f) The detrimental effect of the above on the efficient and effective operation of the School System, and on the morale of its employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Additional answers to interrogatories revealed that during the December 12, 1983 executive session, individual School Board members expressed other complaints, more specific in nature, about Quarles\u2019 performance. With the exception of the adopted motion, however, the School Board made no public statements concerning Quarles\u2019 removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Because the trial court ruled that Quarles was deprived of a liberty interest without procedural due process, we must determine (1) what must be shown to establish that a liberty interest has been implicated, and (2) whether the undisputed facts support the trial court\u2019s summary finding that Quarles was deprived of a liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564 (1972), the Supreme Court set forth two ways in which a liberty interest may be implicated. First, when a public employee is discharged by a public employer and contemporaneously therewith the employer makes false, public charges that reflect upon the employee\u2019s \u201c \u2018good name, reputation, honor, or integrity,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the employee\u2019s liberty interests are implicated, and he has a constitutional right to notice and an opportunity to refute the charges. <em>Id. </em>at 573. A public employee is not deprived of a liberty interest, however, when his employment is simply terminated and no defamatory charges are publicly disseminated. <em>Id. </em>at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Second, a liberty interest may be implicated if a public employer, in terminating a public employee, \u201cimpose [s] on him a stigma or other disability that foreclose [s] his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 573. The public employer may impose such a stigma by, for example, invoking regulations to bar the employee from other public employment. <em>Id. </em>at 574. Although the mere fact that an employee was not retained might make him somewhat less attractive to prospective employers, a record of nonretention does not establish the kind of foreclosure of employment opportunities amounting to a deprivation of liberty. <em>Id. </em>at 574 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">A party\u2019s compelled answers to interrogatories during the course of litigation that are not otherwise made public, \u201ccannot properly form the basis for a claim that [the public employee\u2019s] interest in his \u2018good name, reputation, honor, or integrity\u2019 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>thereby impaired.\u201d <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 348 (1976). Because such answers are \u201cmade in the course of a judicial proceeding which did not commence until after [the public employee] had suffered the injury for which he seeks redress, it surely cannot provide retroactive support for his claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\">In its memorandum opinion, the trial court stated that \u201cthe record in this case is replete with charges which could affect [Quarles] in his efforts to take advantage of other employment opportunities and which could damage his standing and associations in the community, thus bringing his liberty interests into the picture.\u201d Clearly, in order to find that the record is \u201creplete\u201d with charges that implicate Quarles\u2019 liberty interests, the trial court necessarily had to consider statements made by the School Board in its answers to Quarles\u2019 interrogatories. Quarles makes no claim that the specifics of discussions between School Board members in the executive session were publicized or made accessible to prospective employers. Indeed, Quarles concedes that the only information available to the public concerning his dismissal was the School Board\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Thus, the trial court properly could consider only the charges enumerated in the motion that the School Board adopted in the reconvened public session. As previously noted, that motion charged Quarles with \u201cineffective leadership\u201d and \u201clack of communication with personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Since the Supreme Court handed down <em>Roth </em>in 1972, the federal courts have had many opportunities to refine and apply the general guidelines set forth in that decision. The cases in which federal courts have found a liberty interest implicated usually involved specific charges of moral turpitude, criminal activity, or serious character defects. <em>See, e.g., Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Fischl, </em>782 F.2d 1148, 1150 (3d Cir. 1986) (dishonesty); <em>Burkhart </em>v. <em>Randles, </em>764 F.2d 1196, 1199-1201 (6th Cir. 1985) (involvement in scheme to bug supervisor\u2019s office); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Justice, </em>753 F.2d 1092, 1111-12 (D.C.

Cir. 1987) (\u201cunsatisfactory job performance\u201d); <em>Robb </em>v. <em>City of Philadelphia, </em>733 F.2d 286, 294 (3d Cir. 1984) (transfer and nonpromotion allegedly based on employee\u2019s union activity, statements to press, or refusal to withdraw private lawsuit against well-known person); <em>Debose </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Agr., </em>700 F.2d 1262, 1266 (9th Cir. 1983) (substandard performance); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bd. of Educ. of Urbana Sch.

Nor do we think the charges carry with them the sort of stigma that would foreclose \u201chis freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The School Board\u2019s charges of \u201cineffective leadership\u201d and \u201clack of communication with personnel\u201d do not involve moral turpitude or even an intrinsic character defect. Rather, these unelaborated charges relating to job performance suggest a situational difficulty that, as part of Quarles\u2019 biography, \u201cinvites inquiry, not prejudgment.\u201d <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>815 F.2d at 1518.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Quarles further contends that the judgment was rendered moot by the events that transpired after the judgment was entered. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">As previously noted, the court ordered the School Board either to reinstate Quarles as superintendent or to give him a hearing after proper notice within a specified time. Moreover, the trial court refused the School Board\u2019s request for a stay of execution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the judgment pending an appeal. Therefore, the School Board was compelled to comply with the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Because \u201cthe matter is of sufficient importance to justify\u201d a decision on appeal, <em>Cox </em>v. <em>City Council of Bristol, </em>144 Va. 286, 296, 132 S.E. 187, 190 (1926), we hold that the summary judgment has not been rendered moot. To hold otherwise would leave in place an erroneous adjudication that the School Board deprived Quarles of a constitutionally protected right. <em>Cf Roush </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>128 W.Va. 150, 154, 35 S.E.2d 850, 851 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for Quarles. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and dismiss Quarles\u2019 first Code \u00a7 22.1-65 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\"><em>THE SECOND APPEAL </em>(Record No. 850569)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Following entry of the summary judgment in the first case, the School Board gave Quarles notice of a hearing to consider his removal from office based upon 13 enumerated charges. After a four-day public hearing, the School Board voted unanimously to remove Quarles from office. The School Board found sufficient evidence to support all but one of the charges. The Board also voted to continue to pay Quarles full compensation and fringe benefits for the remaining I8\u00cd/2 months of his unexpired term of office.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 22.1-65, Quarles appealed the School Board\u2019s decision to the trial court. After a four-day trial, the court found that the evidence \u201cfails to show sufficient cause to terminate the employment of Quarles as Division Superintendent\u201d and ordered that he be reinstated to the office, effective March 27, 1985. The School Board immediately filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals and posted the required suspending bond. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-116.06(B), we certified the case to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">In this appeal, we must determine whether (1) under Code \u00a7 22.1-65 the trial court applied the correct standard of review in deciding Quarles\u2019 appeal of the School Board\u2019s decision, and (2) the trial court erred in failing to find that the School Board had sufficient cause to remove Quarles.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\">We first will determine the standard of review applicable to an appeal from a school board\u2019s decision under Code \u00a7 22.1-65. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\">A division superintendent may be . . . removed from office by . . . the school board of the division for sufficient cause. A division superintendent may appeal to the appropriate circuit court any decision of the . . . school board to . . . remove him from office and shall be entitled to a trial de novo on such appeal of whether there was sufficient cause therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Quarles contends that because Code \u00a7 22.1-65 provides for a trial <em>de novo, </em>the trial court correctly gave him \u201ca new trial from the beginning, with no considerations or presumptions regarding heretofore presented evidence or actions of the parties.\u201d In making this assertion, Quarles concedes that the trial court made a totally independent judgment of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The School Board contends, on the other hand, that Code \u00a7 22.1-65 does not authorize a trial court to substitute its judgment for that of a school board. The School Board asserts that the court must sustain a school board\u2019s decision \u201cunless [the court] finds that the Board acted in bad faith, arbitrarily, capriciously or in abuse of its discretion, or that there is no substantial evidence to sustain the Board\u2019s action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Both the Constitution of Virginia and the corresponding statute mandate that \u201c[t]he supervision of schools in each school division shall be vested in a school board.\u201d Va. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7 7; Code \u00a7 22.1-28; <em>see also School Board </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>218 Va. 950, 243 S.E.2d 468 (1978); <em>Howard </em>v. <em>School Board, </em>203 Va. 55, 122 S.E.2d 891 (1961); <em>Kellam </em>v. <em>School Board, </em>202 Va. 252, 117 S.E.2d 96 (1960); <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Day, </em>200 Va. 439, 106 S.E.2d 636 (1959). Consistent therewith, a school board appoints the division superintendent, Code \u00a7 22.1-60, and, in the exercise of its discretion, may remove him from office for \u201csufficient cause,\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">In <em>Spotsylvania School Board </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>215 Va. 603, 212 S.E.2d 264 (1975), we held that a school board\u2019s decision \u201cwill not be disturbed by the courts unless the board acted in bad faith, arbitrarily, capriciously, or in abuse of its discretion, or there is no substantial evidence to sustain its action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>212 S.E.2d at 267. We said this rule applies even when a court reviews a school board\u2019s decision in a trial <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 606-07, 212 S.E.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">When we decided <em>McConnell, </em>the General Assembly had not enacted a statute \u201cgoverning the scope of review by the courts of an appeal from a school board\u2019s decision\u201d regarding personnel matters. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 212 S.E.2d at 267. Although Code \u00a7 22.1-65 provides for a trial <em>de novo, </em>the statute also limits the trial <em>de novo </em>to the question whether a school board had \u201csufficient cause\u201d to remove a superintendent. We believe, therefore, that Code \u00a7 22.1-65, enacted in 1980, Acts 1980, c. 559, is not inconsistent with our holding in <em>McConnell. </em>Thus, we hold that the trial court applied the incorrect standard in Quarles\u2019 appeal from the decision of the school board.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Applying the correct standard of review, we next will determine from the evidence whether the School Board had sufficient cause to remove Quarles. The evidence is voluminous, and much of it is conflicting. We will, however, confine our review of the evidence to the three areas in which the underlying facts are essentially undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">\n<em>Improper Expenditures of School Funds.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Undisputed, documentary evidence established that between April 1982 and November 1983, Quarles, accompanied by his wife, attended eight professional meetings in distant places. Either all or part of his wife\u2019s travel expenses for these trips were paid from school funds. Additionally, Quarles admitted that this had been his practice since he had held the office of superintendent \u2014 approximately <em>\u00cdOV2 </em>years.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Although Quarles testified that he had \u201cassumjed]\u201d that the School Board was aware of this practice, the record does not support this assumption. To the contrary, the practice was not known until discovered by the present school board shortly before Quarles was removed from office.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">In its memorandum opinion, the trial court stated \u201cwithout equivocation, that absent express approval of an authoritative body (in this case the School Board) the use of public funds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>pay the expenses of spouses of public employees is not appropriate and cannot be condoned.\u201d The trial court, however, rejected the School Board\u2019s finding that this conduct constituted sufficient cause for Quarles\u2019 removal, stating that the court \u201c[does] not find dishonest intent in this case nor [does it] find that the interests of the Board have been adversely affected in a significant way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\">To constitute sufficient cause for Quarles\u2019 removal, the School Board v/as not required to prove that Quarles acted with \u201cdishonest intent.\u201d It was required to prove only that Quarles knowingly used public funds for a purpose not authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Code \u00a7 22.1-67 provides that a school board \u201cshall provide for the necessary traveling . . . expenses of the division superintendent,\u201d who shall keep \u201c[d]etailed records of all such expenses.\u201d The <em>Regulations of the Board of Education of the Commonwealth of Virginia, </em>Chapter I, \u201cDivision Superintendent of Schools,\u201d Section V (1980) (the Regulations), provide that \u201c[i]t shall be the duty of the division superintendent to . . . see that . . . all school funds are properly applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Unquestionably, Quarles knowingly paid his wife\u2019s expenses from school funds. Because he held the office of Superintendent of Schools, Quarles knew or should have known that paying his spouse\u2019s travel expenses was not authorized by law. Clearly, in using school funds for such a purpose, Quarles failed in his duty to see that these funds were \u201cproperly applied.\u201d We conclude, therefore, that the evidence supports the School Board\u2019s finding that Quarles improperly expended school funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\n<em>Neglect of School Buildings and Grounds.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Section VIII of the Regulations states that \u201c[i]t shall be the duty of the division superintendent to visit and inspect each school in his division. He . . . shall give particular attention to the conditions of the school buildings.\u201d The Bristol, Virginia School Board Policy Manual, Section 3-2.3(7), provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he Superintendent shall supervise the use and maintenance of all school buildings and grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">The evidence established that during Quarles\u2019 tenure as superintendent, the school buildings and grounds had been neglected and allowed to reach a serious state of disrepair and deterioration. Curtis Davis became a member of the School Board on July 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>1983, and was made chairman of the Buildings and Grounds Committee. During that month, he discovered these conditions, some of which presented a danger to the safety of students and others coming upon the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Davis was so shocked by the conditions of the school properties that he immediately took steps to correct the problems. The trial court commended Davis \u201cfor identifying the needs addressed and marshalling the support necessary to fund the repairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Quarles defended this charge of neglect by claiming that funds were not available for the needed repairs. The record shows, however, that almost all repairs made under the direction of Davis were accomplished by the use of previously budgeted maintenance funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\n<em>Failure to Carry Out School Board Directives.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The evidence established that, with respect to two matters, Quarles failed to carry out School Board directives. The first matter involved accreditation of Douglass Elementary School. The School Board adopted a plan to have it accredited. After a two-year study had been completed and reported to Quarles, he summarily ended any further work on accrediting the school. As a result, the school had not been accredited at the time of Quarles\u2019 removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The second matter involved implementation of a School Board resolution that ordered the installation of a comprehensive educational program for those students who chose not to participate in the Bible school program for fourth and fifth grades. Although Quarles acknowledged that he was responsible for the program\u2019s implementation, the evidence clearly shows that he never effectively implemented it.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">We conclude that the evidence presented to the trial court in the three areas previously discussed supports the School Board\u2019s finding of a sufficient cause to remove Quarles. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that the Board acted in bad faith, arbitrarily, capriciously, or in abuse of its discretion. Thus, the trial court was plainly wrong in failing to sustain the School Board\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>in the second appeal and enter final judgment for the School Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Record No. 841780 \u2014 <em>Reversed and dismissed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMW\">Record No. 850569 \u2014 <em>Reversed and final judgment.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\"> In addition to the School Board, the other appellants are the individual members of the Bristol Virginia School Board, namely: Louise Bowdoin, Curtis Davis, O. G. Broome, Jr., John Snodgrass, and Jimmy Fleenor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> Code \u00a7 22.1-65 reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">A division superintendent may be assessed a reasonable fine, suspended from office for a limited period or removed from office by either the Board of Education or the school board of the division for sufficient cause. A division superintendent may appeal to the appropriate circuit court any decision of the Board of Education or school board to assess a fine against him or to suspend or remove him from office and shall be entitled to a trial de novo on such appeal of whether there was sufficient cause therefor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b134-9\"> The record shows that the School Board agreed to fully compensate Quarles for the remainder of his unexpired term. Therefore, the parties conceded, and the trial court ruled, that Quarles had not been deprived of a property interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\"> The <em>Roth </em>Court mentioned charges of dishonesty and immorality as examples of charges implicating the first type of liberty interest. The Court cited cases involving charges of alcoholism <em>(Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Constantineau, </em>400 U.S. 433 (1971)); disloyalty <em>(Peters </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>349 U.S. 331 (1955) (Douglas, J., concurring); <em>Wieman </em>v. <em>Updegraff, </em>344 U.S. 183 (1952)); communism <em>(Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>341 U.S. 123 (1951)); and subversive activities <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Lovett, </em>328 U.S. 303 (1946)). The Court also included a reference to <em>Cafeteria Workers </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886 (1961), in which the Court held that requiring surrender of an identification badge necessary for access to a naval gun factory did not imply a charge of disloyalty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\"> The authorities cited by the <em>Roth </em>Court under the second type of liberty interest include <em>Truax </em>v. <em>Raich, </em>239 U.S. 33 (1915), a case in which the Court struck down a statute limiting the percentage of aliens that any employer could hire. The Court also cited two cases in which states had denied the petitioners admission to the bar, and which the Court reversed, <em>Willner </em>v. <em>Committee on Character, </em>373 U.S. 96 (1963); <em>Schware </em>v. <em>Board of Bar Examiners, </em>353 U.S. 232 (1957). The Court again referenced <em>Cafeteria Workers, 367 </em>U.S. at 898, in which the plaintiff had not been precluded from obtaining employment at any other government installation or anywhere in the private sector.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
