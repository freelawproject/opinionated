Any person under the age of 21 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-15\">2. Any convicted felon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-16\">3. Any person under indictment or information for a felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>4. Any person who at the time of application is charged with a crime involving violence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">5. Any person who has been found not guilty of a felony on the basis of insanity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">6. Any person who is a fugitive from justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">7. Any person who presently is an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana, a depressant, stimulant or narcotic drug; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">8. Any person who has been committed to a mental institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">(d) A violation of this section shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The Reverend George T. Stallings and three other residents of the City<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (collectively, Stallings) filed suit against the City\u2019s Chief of Police, seeking a declaratory judgment that the City was without authority to adopt the ordinance. After both parties requested summary judgment, the trial court ruled that the City had the authority to enact the ordinance. Stallings appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Stallings contends that the trial court misapplied Dillon\u2019s Rule of strict construction concerning the powers of local governing bodies. A proper application of Dillon\u2019s Rule, Stallings asserts, leads to the clear conclusion that the General Assembly has not authorized the City to enact Section 38-6. The Chief of Police counters with the contention that the General Assembly has granted broad police power to the City, and consequently, the City\u2019s power to enact Section 38-6 is implied in and incident to its police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">We first recognized Dillon\u2019s Rule in <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Red</em>mond,, 93 Va. 711, 25 S.E. 1001 (1896), a decision in which we quoted with approval from 1 Dillon on Mun. Corp. (3d ed.), sec. 89 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">[A] municipal corporation possesses and can exercise the following powers, and no others: First, those granted in express words; Second, those necessarily or fairly implied in or incident to the powers expressly granted; Third, those essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation, not simply convenient, but indispensable. Any fair, reasonable doubt concerning the existence of power is resolved by the courts against the corporation, and the power is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 714, 25 S.E. at 1002. <em>Accord County Board </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>229 Va. 341, 344, 329 S.E.2d 468, 470 (1985); <em>Tabler </em>v. <em>Fairfax County, </em>221 Va. 200, 202, 269 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arlington County Bd., </em>217 Va. 558, 573-74, 232 S.E.2d 30, 40 (1977); <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>County Board, </em>199 Va. 679, 684, 101 S.E.2d 641, 644-45 (1958); <em>Donable </em>v. <em>Harrisonburg, </em>104 Va. 533, 535, 52 S.E. 174, 175 (1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The General Assembly has vested the City with all the powers set forth in Code \u00a7 15.1-839.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 15.1-839 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">A municipal corporation shall have and may exercise all powers which it now has or which may hereafter be conferred upon or delegated to it under the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth and all other powers pertinent to the conduct of the affairs and functions of the municipal government, the exercise of which is not expressly prohibited by the Constitution and the general laws of the Commonwealth, and which are necessary or desirable to secure and promote the general welfare of the inhabitants of the municipality and the safety, health, peace, good order, comfort, convenience, morals, trade, commerce and industry of the municipality and the inhabitants thereof, and the enumeration of specific powers shall not be construed or held to be exclusive or as a limitation upon any general grant of power, but shall be construed and held to be in addition to any general grant of power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The City\u2019s enactment of Section 38-6 was not \u201cexpressly prohibited by the Constitution and the general laws of the Commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 15.1-839. The crucial question, therefore, is whether the City\u2019s power to enact Section 38-6 is implied in and incident to the grant of police power set forth in Code \u00a7 15.1-839. We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">In <em>Elsner Brothers </em>v. Hawkins, 113 Va. 47, 73 S.E. 479 (1912), we held that the City of Richmond had the authority to enact an ordinance making it unlawful for a licensed pawnbroker to receive, purchase, sell, loan, or hire any pistol, dirk, bowie knife, razor, sling shot, or any weapon of like kind. We said the City of Richmond\u2019s authority was derived from the \u201c[v]ery broad and comprehensive police powers\u201d that the General Assembly had delegated to that municipality. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 73 S.E. at 480. Under the City of Richmond\u2019s charter,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">the council has power to enact suitable ordinances to secure and promote the general welfare of the inhabitants of the city, such as they may deem proper for the safety, health, peace, good order, and morals of the community. In addition, they have the power to make such ordinances and regulations as may be deemed desirable and suitable to prevent vice and immorality, to preserve public peace and good order, to prevent and quell riots, disturbances, and disorderly assemblages</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 73 S.E. at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Similarly, in <em>King </em>v. <em>County of Arlington, </em>195 Va. 1084, 81 S.E.2d 587 (1954), we held that the County of Arlington was authorized to enact an ordinance making it unlawful for any person to keep any dog known to be vicious or which evidenced a disposition to attack humans. We reasoned that the ordinance was authorized by the general grant of police power contained in former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Code \u00a7 15-8(5). That section empowered the governing bodies of counties \u201c[t]o adopt such measures as they may deem expedient to secure and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of their respective counties, not inconsistent with the general laws of this State.\u201d In <em>King, </em>we concluded that \u201c[c]learly, ... the prohibition against keeping a [vicious] dog . . . is within this grant of police power.\u201d 195 Va. at 1087, 81 S.E.2d at 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">In the present case, the power conferred upon the City by Code \u00a7 15.1-839 is at least as broad as the general grant of police power relied upon in <em>Elsner Brothers </em>and <em>King. </em>Code \u00a7 15.1-839 grants to the City the authority to exercise all powers \u201cpertinent to the conduct of the affairs and functions of [its] government, the exercise of which is not expressly prohibited by the Constitution and the general laws of the Commonwealth, and which are necessary or desirable to secure and promote the general welfare of the inhabitants of the [City] and the safety, health, peace, [and] good order ... of the [City] and [its] inhabitants . . . .\u201d Indeed, this grant of power is virtually identical to the grant of power that validated the ordinance in <em>King.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We hold, therefore, that the City was authorized to enact Section 38-6 under the general grant of police powers contained in Code \u00a7 15.1-839. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-13\"> The other plaintiffs/appellants are Russell E. Simpson, Louise F. Simpson, and Joseph R. White.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"> Code \u00a7 15.1-838 provides that \u201c[a] municipal corporation shall have and may exercise any or all powers set forth in this chapter when such powers are specifically conferred upon the municipal corporation.\u201d Section 2.01 of the City\u2019s charter provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe powers set forth in sections 15.1-837 through 15.1-907 of the Code of Virginia as in force on January 1, 1977, and as hereafter amended, are hereby conferred on and vested in the City of Virginia Beach.\u201d Thus, the General Assembly has specifically conferred upon the City the grant of police power contained in Code \u00a7 15.1-839.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> While this appeal was pending, the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 15.1-29.15, which provides that \u201c[f]rom and after January 1, 1987, no county, city or town shall adopt any ordinance to govern the purchase, possession, transfer, ownership, carrying or transporting of firearms, ammunition, or components or combination thereof other than those expressly authorized by statute.\u201d Acts 1987, c. 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">During its 1988 session, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 15.1-29.15 to add the following provisions: \u201cNothing in this section shall affect the validity or invalidity of any ordinance adopted prior to January 1, 1987. Nothing in this section shall have any effect on any pending litigation.\u201d Acts 1988, c. 392.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
