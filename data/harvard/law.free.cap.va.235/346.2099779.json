The certified questions were stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">1. Does Virginia law permit recovery by an insured\u2019s estate under the UM provision of the insured\u2019s policy (paid for by the insured), where the insured was killed in a work-related motor vehicle accident and where the employer/vehicle owner and co-employee/vehicle operator both had insurance, but where the exclusive remedy clause of the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act bars recovery under those other policies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">2. In the event Virginia law permits recovery under the circumstances in question one above, should the workmen\u2019s compensation benefits received by the insured\u2019s wife and children be set-off against the insured\u2019s estate\u2019s UM recovery where the insured\u2019s policy contains a set-off provision?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Because we answer the first question in the negative, it is unnecessary to answer the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The facts were stipulated in the federal court. On May 18, 1984, Elmer W. Dodson, Jr., was employed by A.G. Van Metre, Jr., Inc. (Van Metre), as a construction site supervisor. While in the course of his employment, he was struck and killed by a truck owned by Van Metre and operated by Rogerio Cardoso, a fellow employee of Van Metre also acting in the course of his employment. Dodson was survived by his widow and five children.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Dodson\u2019s widow and children are statutory beneficiaries under the Virginia wrongful death statutes. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-50 through 56. The widow and one dependent child applied for benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. They received an award, and workers\u2019 compensation benefits are now being paid to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">At the time of his death, Dodson was the named insured in a policy of insurance issued by Aetna Casualty and Surety Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>pany (Aetna) covering two trucks owned by Dodson. The premium had been paid, and the policy was in effect. As required by Code \u00a7 38.1-381(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the policy contained an uninsured motorist (UM) endorsement, which provided: \u201cThe company will pay . . . all sums which the insured or his legal representative <em>shall be legally entitled to recover as damages </em>from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Dodson\u2019s widow qualified as administratrix of his estate and brought a wrongful death action in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County against Van Metre, Cardoso, and Steven Reece, another Van Metre employee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants in the circuit court filed a plea in bar, asserting that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act afforded the exclusive remedy, because Dodson\u2019s fatal injuries were sustained in the course of, and arose out of, his employment, and because Dodson, Cardoso and Reece were all engaged in their employment with Van Metre at the time of the accident. On July 23, 1987, the Circuit Court of Fairfax County sustained the plea in bar and dismissed the wrongful death action as to Van Metre, Cardoso, and Reece.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The administratrix also filed a declaratory judgment proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Aetna, contending that Dodson\u2019s estate was entitled to $300,000, the limit of Aetna\u2019s coverage under the UM endorsement, and that Aetna had denied coverage. Although Van Metre\u2019s truck was insured, she contended that the bar of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act denied her the benefit of Van Metre\u2019s insurance, bringing Cardoso within the statutory definition of an \u201cuninsured motorist.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Aetna raised several defenses by answer, and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Aetna contended that because Dodson\u2019s estate was not \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from the owner or operator of the \u201cuninsured motor vehicle,\u201d due to the workers\u2019 compensation bar, the administratrix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>failed to meet a condition precedent for coverage under the UM endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\">The district court ruled in favor of the administratrix, granting declaratory judgment establishing UM coverage, and granting the administratrix \u201cleave, in a separate proceeding, to establish fault and determine the full measure of damages with an off set for workman\u2019s compensation coverage.\u201d Aetna appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit the district court\u2019s ruling establishing UM coverage. The administratrix cross-appealed the ruling allowing Aetna to offset workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The court of appeals certified those questions to us as stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">In Virginia, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act affords the exclusive remedy for personal injury or accidental death sustained within its purview, against a covered employer or against fellow employees whose causative acts arise out of and in the course of employment by a covered employer. Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-40 and -103. Here, the administratrix, having applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, cannot and does not contest the applicability of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to the facts surrounding her decedent\u2019s accidental death. Rather, she contends that the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover as damages,\u201d appearing in Aetna\u2019s policy, is ambiguous, and should be construed against Aetna, which drafted the policy, upon <em>contra proferentem </em>principles. Therefore, she argues, even though workers\u2019 compensation would be an exclusive remedy, barring her right to proceed against Van Metre and its employees, nevertheless, Aetna should be unable to take advantage of the workers\u2019 compensation bar. She contends that a construction of the policy language in favor of the insured would \u201crespect the legislative intent behind the UM scheme by affording coverage to injured claimants in situations where adequate compensation would not otherwise exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We do not agree with the administratrix. Leaving aside the question whether <em>contra proferentem </em>principles apply to contracts whose language is prescribed by statute, we find nothing ambiguous in the language of Aetna\u2019s UM endorsement or in the statute upon which it is based. The phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover as damages\u201d interposes, as a condition precedent to the UM insurer\u2019s obligation, the requirement that the insured have a legally enforceable right to recover damages from an owner or oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ator of an uninsured motor vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not perceive a rational alternative which would render the phrase ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Because workers\u2019 compensation afforded the exclusive remedy against the decedent\u2019s employer and fellow employees for his accidental death, his statutory beneficiaries are not \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d damages against them. It follows that a condition precedent to Aetna\u2019s liability under its UM endorsement was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The parties have cited a number of cases in which other jurisdictions have considered similar questions, but most are inapposite because workers\u2019 compensation is not an exclusive remedy in those jurisdictions. An exception is <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America, </em>799 F.2d 955 (5th Cir. 1986), which was governed by the law of Mississippi. That law provided that workers\u2019 compensation was an injured employee\u2019s exclusive remedy for work-related injuries against his employer and his fellow employees. Further, Mississippi\u2019s UM law, virtually identical to Virginia\u2019s, was incorporated into the language of the insurance policy in question. The federal court, considering arguments similar to those advanced before us, in the absence of a ruling by the courts of Mississippi, relied on Professor Larson\u2019s treatise on workers\u2019 compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">Ordinarily, for the uninsured motorist clause to operate in the first place, the uninsured third person must be legally subject to liability. Thus, if the third person is specifically made immune to tort suit by the compensation act\u2019s exclusive remedy clause, the uninsured motorist provision does not come into play. In the familiar example of coemployee immunity, the issue thus becomes whether the accident was in the course of employment; if it was, the uninsured motorist carrier has no liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">799 F.2d at 959 (emphasis deleted) (quoting A. Larson, 2A Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 71.23(j) at 14-37 (1983) (1987 Supp. at 14-44)). We agree with that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>In the present case, the United States District Court distinguished <em>Perkins </em>on the ground that Perkins sought recovery under the UM provisions of his employer\u2019s policy, while here the administratrix seeks to recover under the decedent\u2019s own UM policy. The district court reasoned that because of this difference, \u201cthe policy underlying the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is less compelling.\u201d Because we view the certified question as resolved by the interpretation of the unambiguous phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover as damages,\u201d we do not reach considerations of legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\n<em>The first certified question is answered in the negative.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\"> Implementing the 1986 amendment to Va.

It was an action for contribution between two insurance carriers and turned solely upon the principles governing the equitable right of contribution enforceable at law between joint obligors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
