It was made October 11th, 1875; notice duly given that objections to it would be heard on the 21st of October, and it was reported to the city council for adoption October 26th, 1875.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">On the 22d day of November, 1875, the proportionate assessment was approved by the city council, with directions to the commissioners of assessments to assess the entire cost of the work on the ascertained assessment district, in the proportion adopted by them, unless the cost exceeded the benefits, and in that event, to assess a sum equal to the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">Under the seventh section of the supplement to the city charter, last cited, the commissioners made the final assess-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>anent on the 26th of November, 1875, and it was ratified by \u2022council December 1st, 1875.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">At the making of the final assessment, a matter of vital importance to the land-owners was, for the first time, to be passed upon; that is, whether the lands within the assessment \u2022district were benefited by the undertaking, to the full extent \u2022of its cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Of the making of this assessment, no notice was given. It is no sufficient answer to say that the charter does not require it; parties to be affected by such proceedings are entitled tol! notice, whether the statute directs it or not. <em>State, Wilkinson, pros., </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Trenton, </em>7 <em>Vroom </em>499.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">No opportunity having been afforded to the prosecutors to be heard, the assessment must be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
