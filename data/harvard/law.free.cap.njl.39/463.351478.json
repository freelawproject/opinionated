WILLIAM LOVELL.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b495-7\">1. A place of public resort, kept for the sale of pools upon horse-races, is a disorderly house.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b495-8\">2. Betting and holding stakes upon horse-races, to be run outside of this state, are misdemeanors within the Grimes Act, <em>{Rev., %% </em>56, 57,) and a place of public resort, kept for the carrying on of such practices, is a disorderly house.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-9\">On <em>certiorari</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-10\">The defendant was charged, by allegation in the Special Sessions of Hudson county, with keeping a disorderly house in that county, and upon his plea of not guilty, the court found facts similar to those found in the case against the same defendant just decided, and thereupon convicted him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-11\">Upon this conviction, the defendant sued out a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to the Supreme Court, and there insisted that the facts found do not show him guilty of the crime specified.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-12\">Argued at February Term, 1877, before Justices Sctjkder and Dixon.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-13\">For the state, <em>A.

Lotteries for money are, by statute, <em>(Crimes Act, Rev., </em>\u00a7 51,) common and public nuisances, and the sale of lottery tickets is a misdemeanor. <em>Crimes Ad, Rev., </em>\u00a7 52. Any place of public resort, kept, for the habitual setting up of lotteries or sale of lottery tickets, must, therefore, be a disorderly house. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Vroom 102. And of this character was the place of business of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">It was a disorderly house in another aspect. It was a public resort for persons to bet upon horse-races, and where the defendant held himself out as the stakeholder of the money wagered. The making of such bets and the holding of such stakes are misdemeanors. <em>Crimes Ad, Rev., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 56, 57. It was urged that these statutes apply only to races in this state; but there is no reason for such contention. Horse-racing was not the evil which the legislature designed, by these enactments, to forbid. Eor that, punishment liad been provided in Section 55. But it was the mischievous practice of gambling upon horse-races which the law-maker here intended to reach ; and the injurious effects of that practice are in no way affected by the locality of the race. If there had been a purpose so to restrict the nature of the act made criminal, it would have been expiessed as it is in the fifty-eighth section, prohibiting the making up of purses to be run for by horses at any place <em>in this state. </em>The absence of such a restriction indicates a design, which the courts will effectuate,, to make the remedy as broad as the mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
