T. Bene, for non-payment of the taxes assessed against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">Bene subsequently conveyed the lots to Ernest Peigne, and he conveyed them, before the <em>certiorari </em>was sued out, to Lifria Columbus.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">Where a <em>certiorari </em>is prosecuted in aid of an ejectment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>suit, the present owner should be made' a party to it, other-, wise he cannot be bound by the adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In this case, Columbus, who held the tax title when the-writ was sued out, has not been made a party, and therefore he cannot be concluded by any judgment which this court may render.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">I think, therefore, that no opinion should be expi\u2019essed upon the points involved in this controversy, until such proceedings are taken that Columbus may be heard.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
