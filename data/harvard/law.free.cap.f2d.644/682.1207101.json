Appellant, Trein\u2019s Exchange, agreed to partially settle the case by injunction, but subsequently challenged the authority of its attorneys to consent to an onerous \u201cnotice\u201d provision in the agreed injunction. Litigation on the issue of counsels\u2019 authority has continued for approximately two years, and the merits of the underlying infringement action have yet to be addressed. Although the district court concluded that the attorneys had the requisite authority to consent, it vacated, as a matter of equity, the contested provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-23\">The threshold question for determination is whether an order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees in a non-common fund case may be appealed prior to a judgment on the merits of the substantive claims. Our answer is in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-24\">In reaching our conclusion we are not unmindful of this Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Swanson v. American Consumers Industries, Inc., </em>517 F.2d 555, 561 (7th Cir. 1975), a common fund case, to the effect that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cdoes not affect the finality of the decision on the merits of the case\u201d, because it is a collateral order incident to the main litigation. Nor do we ignore Hidell v. <em>International Diversified Investments, </em>520 F.2d 529 (7th Cir. 1975), a non-common fund case, which not only stands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>for the proposition that the appealability of the award is unaffected by the fact that the amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees has not yet been determined, but also extends the so-called \u201ccommon fund doctrine\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by allowing a separate appeal from an order requiring reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees from an opposing party. <em>Ibid., </em>520 F.2d at 532 n. 4, 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">However, unlike the present case, <em>Swanson </em>and <em>Hidell, </em>along with <em>Terket v. Lund, </em>623 F.2d 29 (7th Cir. 1980), and <em>Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, </em>444 U.S. 472, 100 S.Ct. 745, 62 L.Ed.2d 676 (1980), all involved awards of attorneys\u2019 fees made contemporaneously with, or after, a judgment on the merits in the main case.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In addition, the Supreme Court cases discussed in <em>Swanson, </em>and, indeed, the recent <em>Boeing </em>case, as well as <em>Swanson </em>itself, dealt with common fund recoveries of attorneys\u2019 fees. Because common fund cases generally allocate costs of suit \u201cbetween solicitor and client\u201d. <em>Trustees v. Greenough, </em>105 U.S. 527, 531, 533-34, 26 L.Ed. 1157 (1881), or among the class benefited by the litigation, <em>see Boeing, supra, </em>100 S.Ct. at 748-49, such suits have traditionally been accorded a different appealability status.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In our opinion, both <em>Hidell </em>and <em>Swanson </em>should be limited to the particular facts and circumstances of those cases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and should not be utilized to widen the scope of \u201cinterlocutory\u201d appeals to include non-common fund cases in those instances where there has been no judgment rendered on the merits of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">As indicated, this is not a \u201ccommon fund\u201d case. The order here awarding attorneys\u2019 fees in an unspecified amount, was incidental to the main case, and there has been no final judgment rendered on the merits of that litigation. In similar situations, two other circuits have rejected bifurcated appeals, <em>see Richerson v. Jones, </em>551 F.2d 918, 922 (3rd Cir. 1977) and <em>Union Tank Car Co. v. Isbrandtsen, </em>416 F.2d 96, 97 (2nd Cir. 1969). We believe the reasoning in those cases to be sound. To hold otherwise would most probably create a proliferation of such appeals, because of the uncertainty in the minds of practicing attorneys as to whether or not those appeals would be necessary in order to effectively protect their clients\u2019 interests. <em>See Terket, supra, </em>623 F.2d at 32-33; <em>Swanson, supra, </em>517 F.2d at 561. Such a result would be completely inconsistent with the principles of judicial economy and expediency.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that in a non-common fund case this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from an order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees prior to the entry of a judgment on the merits of the substantive claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-9\">. <em>See Trustees v.
