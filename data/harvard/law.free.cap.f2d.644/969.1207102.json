First, did the district court abuse its discretion in refusing to consider a revised index and affidavit, submitted by the government \u2014 immediately prior to the hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cmotion for partial judgment\u201d \u2014 to explain the claimed exemptions? Second, did the district court err in ordering a government agency to produce forthwith all documents for which claims of exemption were not adequately supported by the initial index provided to justify the withholding? Because we conclude, in the circumstances here, that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting the revised index and erred in ordering immediate disclosure of the documents, we vacate the order of the district court and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">In October, 1978, plaintiff Coastal States Gas Corp. (Coastal) transmitted a FOIA request to defendant Department of Energy (DOE).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Coastal sought agency records pertaining to (1) the formulation, adoption, interpretation and territorial application by DOE of certain petroleum price and allocation regulations; (2) regulations concerning an exemption from the petroleum price charged for the \u201cfirst sale into U.S. Commerce\u201d of imports; and (3) enforcement activity by DOE against firms alleged to have violated regulations because of participation in a \u201cforeign transaction.\u201d Coastal candidly admitted that the records sought were directly related to questions raised by a Proposed Remedial Order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> issued by DOE to Coastal on September 6, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-18\">DOE did not comply with the ten day period provided in the statute for an agency response to a FOIA request, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A); instead, it answered Coastal with two letters granting itself extensions of time. Having exhausted its administrative remedies,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Coastal initiated a FOIA suit in the district court, in April 1979, pursuant to \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Coastal simul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>taneously filed a motion to compel preparation by DOE of a <em>Vaughn </em>index covering all documents that DOE asserted to be exempt from disclosure under FOIA. A <em>Vaughn </em>index is a procedural tool developed in <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>484 F.2d 820, 826-28 (D.C.Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 977, 94 S.Ct. 1564, 39 L.Ed.2d 873 (1974), to enable a district court to evaluate allegations of exemption advanced by a governmental agency, and to assure that claimed exemptions are justified under the Act. The contemplated indexing system would subdivide requested documents into manageable sections and cross-reference relevant portions to the various justifications for nondisclosure asserted by the government. An adequate <em>Vaughn </em>index would thus narrow the scope of the court\u2019s inquiry, contribute to informed court evaluation of disputed documents, aid appellate review, and enhance an opposing party\u2019s ability to argue effectively against nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Under the FOIA statute, which embodies a policy of expedited handling of requests for documents, a government agency has thirty days to answer a FOIA complaint and motion, rather than the sixty day period usually accorded the government. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(C). After a court conference, the parties entered into a stipulation, which was approved by an order dated May 9,1979, setting June 15,1979 as the production date for the non-exempt documents and June 22 as the filing date for the <em>Vaughn </em>index of withheld documents. The order approving the stipulation contained a provision carefully detailing the information which the government was required to set forth in the index so as to justify nondisclosure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At DOE\u2019s request the deadline for filing the <em>Vaughn </em>index was extended to July 2, 1979. Pursuant to the May 9 order, DOE collected and reviewed over 800 documents; 500 were immediately released and approximately 200, withheld in whole or in part, are in issue here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-13\">Following DOE\u2019s filing of the <em>Vaughn </em>index together with counsel\u2019s affidavit, which described the withheld documents, Coastal sought discovery from DOE concerning the method employed to prepare the index. DOE responded with a motion for a protective order to limit discovery to interrogatories. It also represented that it would file an affidavit with the court the next day, supplying additional information regarding the documents being withheld and theoretically mooting the need for discovery. In addition DOE stated that it intended to move for summary judgment by August 17, 1979. The district court denied DOE\u2019s application for a protective order, and explained that it would not rule on a summary judgment motion in a FOIA case if the plaintiff had not been afforded an opportunity to examine the scope and adequacy of the agency\u2019s document search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>and to discover what documents are in existence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">Although DOE never filed the motion for summary judgment as it had promised, discovery nonetheless ensued. Then, on December 7, 1979, Coastal filed a \u201cmotion for partial judgment,\u201d requesting production of all documents listed in the July 2, 1979 index<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and a compilation of a new, adequate <em>Vaughn </em>index covering any documents not ordered disclosed. Coastal failed to denominate with any particularity what type of proceeding was sought, but requested an expedited hearing. In doing so, it invoked the docket priority directive of \u00a7 552(a)(4)(D).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Oral argument was set for February 28, 1980. The day before the hearing, DOE filed with the court a revised 400-page <em>Vaughn </em>index and an accompanying affidavit \u2014 the revised index and affidavit that it had promised in its January 11, 1980 answering brief. Coastal immediately countered with a motion to strike the revised index and affidavit on the ground they were untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">The district court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the revised index, maintaining that to permit DOE \u201cto rely upon its latest eleventh-hour effort to delay these proceedings would make a mockery of the legislation.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The district judge reasoned that DOE\u2019s long-standing knowledge of the <em>Vaughn </em>index requirement, the acknowledged importance of such indices in the effective enforcement of the FOIA, and the congressional policy favoring expeditious handling of FOIA cases militated against allowing the agency to revise and correct its index until it \u201cgot it right.\u201d Next, the court found that DOE\u2019s initial July 2 index did not comply with the order of May 9 requiring a particularized justification for any refusal to release a document. The inadequacy of the document index, the district judge declared, created four problems: the court was incapable of determining whether the documents were in fact exempt; Coastal was unable to argue with desirable legal precision that specific records were not exempt;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>in camera </em>review, on the basis of such minimal information would be unfair to Coastal and extremely burdensome and unproductive for the court; and meaningful appellate review would be difficult.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the deficient index also provided the basis for the district court\u2019s rejection of <em>in camera </em>review as a viable alternative for determining possible exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">Nevertheless, the judge specifically rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the failure by DOE to comply with the May 9 Order merited the sanction of partial judgment as a matter of discovery law. Rather, in holding that partial judgment ordering production without consideration of the revised index was an appropriate remedy, the district court relied on what it characterized as \u201cthe provisions and policies of the FOIA,\u201d \u201cthe well-established purpose for requiring the filing of an adequate <em>Vaughn </em>index,\u201d and on the trial court\u2019s \u201cinherent power to control the proceedings before it.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After the district judge denied DOE\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the order, the agency sought a stay from this Court pending appeal. Finding that the \u201cpartial judgment\u201d granted by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>court achieved the plaintiff\u2019s very objective \u2014 to compel production of documents\u2014 and that compliance with the order would effectively moot DOE\u2019s claim that the documents are in fact exempt, a stay was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">First, we hold that this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1292(a)(1), on the ground that this appeal was from an interlocutory order granting injunctive relief.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because the order to produce in and of itself grants full relief to the FOIA requester, this is a quintessential case of an interlocutory order with \u201cserious, perhaps irreparable, consequence,\u201d and which can be \u201ceffectually challenged\u201d only by immediate appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">The procedural history of this matter has been related in some detail because it is critical to a proper disposition of the immediate controversy. As is now well-known, FOIA was enacted in furtherance of the belief that \u201can informed electorate is vital to the proper operation of a democracy.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Act\u2019s central provision instructs agencies, upon request, to release promptly responsive records in their possession,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> subject to nine specific exemptions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, the FOIA places the burden of proof on the agencies to establish and sustain their claims of exemption.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Unfortunately, requests under the Act have produced almost as much advice from courts about how the FOIA ought to operate as they have generated information from agencies about how the government actually operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">The Supreme Court, in adjudicating FOIA suits, has recently evolved a tripartite test to determine whether a district court has authority to order the production of documents pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). The judicial remedy is properly invoked if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-14\">(1) the requested documents are agency records</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-15\">(2) the records have been withheld by the agency and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-16\">(3) the withholding was improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-17\"><em>See Forsham v. Harris, </em>445 U.S. 169, 177, 100 S.Ct. 978, 983, 63 L.Ed.2d 293 (1980); <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Comm., </em>445 U.S. 136, 150, 100 S.Ct. 960, 968, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-18\">Because the regulations and interpretations promulgated by DOE and sought by Coastal are clearly agency records,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and because these documents, within the agency\u2019s control, are admittedly being withheld,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> our inquiry focuses on whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>withholding was improper. While the questions whether a document is an agency record and whether it is being withheld are largely substantive ones, discerning whether the withholding is improper raises substantive as well as procedural issues. As a substantive matter, if the agency cannot sustain its burden of proof, because the actual contents of the records do not fall within one of the specified exemptions, withholding is not in order. From a procedural standpoint, agency delay in providing the court with sufficient information to determine if an exemption is justified, could amount to a failure to carry the statutory burden of proof and could also constitute improper withholding, given the policies of full and expeditious disclosure that are embodied in the Act.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Coastal, apparently to guard against all contingencies, argues \u2014 in the alternative\u2014 that the district court\u2019s order can be rationalized as a default judgment, a summary judgment, a final judgment, or as an exercise of the court\u2019s inherent power to control its docket. The analysis advanced by Coastal, which is premised on the FOIA policy of prompt disclosure, implicitly intertwines procedure and substance. It contends that to interpret FOIA to require that \u201can agency can \u2018improperly withhold\u2019 agency records <em>only </em>if a district court affirmatively finds that records being withheld are <em>not </em>exempt\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> would emasculate the \u201cmake promptly available\u201d language of the Act.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Rather, to effectuate fully the goals of FOIA, Coastal maintains that an improper withholding occurs if an agency, solely on the basis of conclusory allegations of exemption, retains records for time periods far beyond those prescribed in the Act,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and beyond any reasonable conception of promptness. The argument equates the agency\u2019s dilatoriness in proving the validity of an exemption with the agency\u2019s inability to carry its burden of proof on the merits of an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">Originally, Coastal supported its \u201cpartial judgment motion\u201d with a default theory: that the persistent failure of DOE to comply with the May 9 court order to produce a <em>Vaughn </em>index of sufficient evidentiary detail justified a default judgment for Coastal.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The district court, however, explicitly declined to rest its holding on a default judgment theory. Without in any way excusing DOE\u2019s failure to submit revised and complete information to the court, the district judge stated that he believed that partial judgment as a matter of discovery law \u2014 premised solely on noncompliance with a discovery order \u2014 was an inappropriate sanction.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Because there is no precedent for the draconian sanction of default subsequent to an initial noncomplianee with a discovery order,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and because FOIA cases do not offer examples of dismissals based on a single failure to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>with an order to produce a <em>Vaughn </em>index,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> we are unable to say that the district judge erred in rejecting Coastal\u2019s default theory. In light of the district court\u2019s declination to enter a default judgment and Coastal\u2019s failure to specify what rule of civil procedure governed this action,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> it is necessary for us to analyze the record carefully in order to ascertain precisely what the court did do, and whether it was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">Although we in no way intend to condone DOE\u2019s lack of celerity in this proceeding, a comparison of the present case with <em>Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Dept. of Energy,</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>helps to illuminate some of the problems present here. Coastal believes we are entitled to rely on the rationale of this recent case in which the District of Columbia Circuit upheld a district court order requiring DOE to produce all documents for which its claims of exemption were not adequately supported by a <em>Vaughn </em>index. In doing so, the District of Columbia Court stated \u201c[a]t several points in the course of this opinion we will rely on a conclusion <em>not </em>that the documents are not exempt as a matter of law, but that the agency has failed to supply us with even the minimal information necessary to make a determination.\u201d 617 F.2d at 861. This premise, acceptable in the context of <em>Coastal I, </em>does not appear to be applicable when engrafted on the proceedings presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">In <em>Coastal I, </em>where the matter came before the district court on cross-motions for summary judgment, DOE was fully informed of its procedural posture.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> DOE had submitted a <em>Vaughn </em>index in July 1978 and had been ordered by the court half a year later to supplement the index, which it did. Thus, had the district court in the matter before us temporarily accepted the revised index, the time frame of the two proceedings would be quite similar. Most importantly, when the District of Columbia district court, in August 1979, ordered that the documents, with a few minor exceptions, be released, it carefully parsed the <em>Vaughn </em>index <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and made copious findings in support of its decision. In rejecting any of DOE\u2019s generalized claims of exemption, the district court there indicated either that the rationale of the particular exemption did not apply to the documents in issue or that the agency had failed to demonstrate the prerequisites to proper invocation of the exemption. Such analysis would be equally desirable in the present proceeding in which the same exemptions, five and seven, are in issue.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>For example, in assessing the merits of DOE\u2019s claims to Exemption 5, which is cast in terms of discovery law \u2014 protecting documents \u201cwhich would not be available to a private party in litigation with the agency\u201d \u2014the <em>Coastal I </em>court divided that exemption into its three recognized privileges.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> With respect to the attorney-client privilege, the District of Columbia district court found that DOE failed to establish a fundamental prerequisite to its assertion: confidentiality maintained at the time of, and subsequent to, the communication.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Yet in the present case, there appear to be communications between counsel for DOE and agency compliance personnel, requesting advice with respect to information confidentially disclosed by the agency\u2019s personnel to counsel, which arguably are exempt under this privilege.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> And DOE in some instances has made an attempt to establish that disclosure was limited and premised on confidentiality.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The district court here, however, did not consider such proffered justifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">In addressing the attorney work-product privilege, the district court in <em>Coastal I </em>held that few of the allegedly exempt documents were being properly withheld, because DOE had failed to demonstrate that the papers were prepared in anticipation of litigation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Here, in contrast, DOE had issued a Proposed Remedial Order to Coastal on September 6, 1978 and is presently engaged in administrative enforcement proceedings, as well as involved as an intervenor in private litigation between Coastal and NEPCo, a public utility which brought an action against a Coastal subsidiary. Nor has Coastal sought to conceal the fact that it wants the documents in conjunction with the ongoing proceedings.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> While this particular need does not diminish the validity of Coastal\u2019s claim,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> it is relevant to the legitimacy of DOE\u2019s claimed exemptions. Unlike <em>Coastal I, </em>the affidavit and index filed by DOE in the present case describe documents which contain legal analyses, strategies and mental impressions of DOE attorneys participating in the enforcement proceedings and the NEPCo litigation.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> These documents, therefore, would appear to fall, at least facially, under the attorney work-product rubric.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">Similarly, the existence of enforcement proceedings distinguishes the DOE\u2019s Exemption 7 claims made in this case from the unsubstantiated assertions in <em>Coastal I. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>The scope of Exemption 7, which protects investigatory files to prevent \u201charm to the government\u2019s case in court,\u201d <em>N. L. R. B. v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 224, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 2318, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978), was carefully narrowed by Congress in 1974.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> As amended, an agency claiming a \u00a7 552(b)(7)(A) exemption must establish that the documents were prepared in the course of an investigation and, more importantly, that disclosure would \u201cinterfere with enforcement proceedings.\u201d While DOE failed to establish this prerequisite in <em>Coastal I, </em>because the records pertained to collaborative attempts to achieve voluntary compliance, the ongoing adversary proceedings here provide the necessary foundation for invocation of Exemption 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">We do not seek to perform the district court\u2019s role at this point. Rather, we simply point out that in <em>Coastal I </em>the district court had gone through the <em>Vaughn </em>index, document by document, and created a detailed record which assessed the factual and legal legitimacy of each claimed exemption. The trial judge avoided both mass disclosure and generic, exemption-wide disclosure.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Thus, within the deliberative-process privilege<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> encompassed by Exemption 5, he carefully segregated documents described as drafts, proposals and recommendations, which came within the exemption\u2019s purview, from internal advice that was in fact agency policy and which clearly merited disclosure to prevent the formation of secret agency law. In such a context, the court of appeals could rely on a conclusion <em>\u201cnot </em>that the documents are not exempt as a matter of law, but that the agency has failed to supply us with even the minimal information necessary to make a determination\u201d without fear of harming privacy interests or the agency\u2019s internal operations for the district court effectively had canvassed the merits. Because the present case evidently contains many of the prerequisites which establish entitlement to the exemptions, we are reluctant, in the circumstances here, to sanction disclosure on the basis of a record evincing no factual scrutiny of the index.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">The record presents us with a knotty procedural problem, which, as we proceed to unravel it, offers two options. On the one hand we can view the proceeding as a partial summary judgment. A grant of sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>mary judgment, however, is proper only when no material fact is genuinely in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Moreover, all \u201cinferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in [the movant\u2019s] materials must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Given the movant\u2019s burden to show affirmatively the absence of any disputed factual issue,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> it is admittedly difficult for a FOIA plaintiff to establish a right to summary judgment with such clarity as to leave no room for controversy, precisely because the agencies necessarily control the information sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">The case at hand illustrates the dilemma a FOIA plaintiff faces in establishing the lack of a material factual issue for summary judgment purposes. Once DOE\u2019s revised index was rejected, the only evidence before the court was the initial index. In its \u201cmotion for partial judgment\u201d Coastal, perhaps handicapped by lack of access to information, made no attempt to demonstrate that the claimed exemptions were invalid. Even assuming that the initial index alone was insufficient to sustain the agency\u2019s final burden, we are impelled to conclude that the minimal information proffered by DOE created enough of a factual controversy to survive the summary judgment threshold.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">Similarly, other circuits have been reluctant to grant summary judgment when the record before them indicated facts still susceptible of dispute.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> As the First Circuit noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-6\">Even though the burden of establishing the applicability of an exemption is on the agency, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B), we think it risky to grant summary judgment when the only competent evidence before the court is the agency\u2019s admittedly flawed affidavit. . . . When the legal issue of the applicability of an exemption depends upon the factual nature of the contents of a document, we think it appropriate to obtain fairly complete information about the factual question before deciding the legal issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-11\"><em>Irons v. Bell, </em>596 F.2d 468, 471-72 n.6 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-12\">Thus, even if <em>Coastal I </em>is understood as endorsing the propriety of summary judgment when confronted by an inadequate <em>Vaughn </em>index, we hesitate to extend that case beyond its particular facts. There, as noted above, the district judge carefully surveyed the index and differentiated documents for which the agency clearly failed to establish the legal prerequisites for the claimed exemptions from documents which, on a generous reading, might conceivably fall within an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-13\">In the analogous context of discovery, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, when faced with a clearly inadequate initial <em>Vaughn </em>index, has recently refrained from approving a summary judgment ordering disclosure. <em>See Dellums v. Powell, </em>No. 80-1134, 642 F.2d 1351 (D.C.Cir.1980). In <em>Dellums, </em>the court had previously determined that certain presidential conversations were \u201csubstantially material\u201d to a pending civil case and had directed President Nixon to. present his objections to the production of transcripts of his taped conversations in a <em>Vaughn </em>index.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Although the appeals court agreed with the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>judge\u2019s holding that President Nixon\u2019s initial index was insufficient as a matter of law, it concluded that \u201cthe District Court should have afforded Mr. Nixon one more opportunity to submit a satisfactory index, rather than to ignore his objections and order the immediate release of all of the transcripts ...\u201d <em>Dellums </em>at 1359. Acknowledging that it had approved the rejection of a \u201cdepressingly similar\u201d <em>Vaughn </em>index in <em>Coastal I, </em>the court of appeals seemed to suggest that claims of privacy or recognized privilege should nevertheless be taken seriously if disputed factual issues still lurk at the summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">Further, the absence of any factual findings in the present case renders appellate review most difficult. We have no means of ascertaining whether the district court applied the correct legal standard with respect to the various exemptions claimed. Any distinctions and meritorious exemptions are submerged in a blanket ruling that DOE failed to sustain its burden in any instance. Although we realize that Rule 52(a) removes from the district judge any obligation to make findings of fact and conclusions of law in Rule 56 summary judgment dispositions,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> the matter before us is an interlocutory injunction, for which findings of fact and conclusions of law must be set forth.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> While we in no way seek to denigrate the district court\u2019s attempts to slice through a somewhat intractable situation, it would appear to be necessary to articulate some reason why the conclusory exemption claims in DOE\u2019s first index failed to survive even the summary judgment threshold. In the future this court, in the exercise of its supervisory powers, will require district courts to state explicitly the legal basis as well as the findings that are necessary to demonstrate that the documents are exempt or disclosable under the FOIA.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Articulating such conclusions is, in a sense, implicit in the statutory duty of <em>de novo </em>review.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> We recognize that district courts frequently may be perplexed in the course of fulfilling this duty by inadequate indices much like the present one, but appellate courts are equally disadvantaged when dealing with an unclarified record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">Also, if this were to be deemed a partial summary judgment, it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to refuse to consider the revised index and affidavit. Despite the last minute nature of these submissions, Rule 56(c) permits the adverse party to serve opposing affidavits at any time prior to the day of the hearing.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\">Coastal argues, on the other hand, that we should construe the district court proceeding as a plenary hearing and final judgment. This perspective, however, highlights the inadequacy of the notice to DOE. Because of the ambiguous nature of the motion for partial judgment, DOE had no warning that it had to present its entire evidentiary case at the hearing scheduled for February 28, 1980. Moreover, the record does not reveal that the agency was given a full opportunity to contest the motion. No evidence addressed to the legal validity of the exemptions was taken, nor were attempts made to resolve factual matters that were in dispute.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> There is also no basis on which DOE could have anticipated that it was obligated to rest its case on its initial index alone. Indeed, the mass of FOIA precedents indicates a willingness by the courts to permit revisions of unsatisfactory initial indices,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> to accept submissions of additional affidavits,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> to conduct <em>in camera </em>review<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> or to suggest <em>in camera </em>review on remand.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Even in <em>Coastal I, </em>the court considered a supplemented index in making its summary judgment ruling. While we in no way encourage agency dilatoriness, and in the future will adopt the suggestion of the Court in <em>Coastal I, </em>requiring agencies to supply sufficient information <em>the first time </em>in order to allow courts to make a reasoned determination respecting the legitimacy of exemptions,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> we are nonetheless unable to affirm the district court here, inasmuch as DOE could not have expected to be restricted to its initial index and, at the same time, faced with final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-14\">The district court was confronted with a panoply of alternatives. It could have considered the new affidavit and the revised index, engaged in <em>in camera </em>review, or set the case for trial. In foregoing all possibilities of reaching a judgment on the merits based on an assessment of the factual contents of the documents, yet failing to preface the holding that DOE had contravened the FOIA policy of full and expeditious disclosure with any procedural deadline, the district court was effectively abjuring the statutory duty of <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-15\">In a sense, the obverse of what occurred in <em>Founding Church of Scientology, Etc. v. Bell, </em>603 F.2d 945 (D.C.Cir.1979), took place here. In <em>Founding Church, </em>after lengthy district court proceedings which included production of a <em>Vaughn </em>index, eleven affidavits and oral argument, the district court, noting that the FBI had released portions of three-quarters of the 1,000 pages requested, apparently adopted a substantial compliance rationale and granted summary judgment for the government. 603 F.2d at 948. The appellate court, however, found the index inadequate and confusing, and stated that the district court had misinterpreted several substantive provisions of the FOIA. Remarking that \u201cDistrict Court decisions in FOIA cases must provide statements of law that are both accurate and sufficiently detailed to establish that the careful <em>de novo </em>review prescribed by Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>gress has in fact taken place,\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> the court concluded that the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d test adopted by the trial court was inappropriate for dealing with FOIA issues. Just as the district judge in <em>Founding Church </em>should have assured itself that nondisclosure of the remaining documents actually conformed to the requirements of a particular exemption, here the district court should have made some attempt to satisfy itself that the exemptions claimed by the agency were not supported by substantiated claims.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Arguably, in light of the FOIA policy of full access to information, nondisclosure based on inadequate court scrutiny' is perhaps more offensive than disclosure following minimal court review. But failure to discharge the duty of <em>de novo </em>review sacrifices legitimate interests in either case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">Because Coastal\u2019s ambiguous partial judgment motion provided DOE with insufficient warning that the case might be disposed of finally, it would be an abuse of discretion not to consider the available affidavit, the revised index, or a limited <em>in camera </em>review of representative documents before entering final judgment on the merits. FOIA was enacted against the backdrop of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and although some express alterations were made,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> systematic and fair proceedings were not abrogated. Therefore, even if the court had authority to impose the sanction it did, we hold it was necessary to do so in a procedurally orderly fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">We now address Coastal\u2019s fourth claim, namely that special circumstances justified the \u201cpartial judgment.\u201d Coastal argues that expedition is essential not only on account of FOIA\u2019s mandate but because without access to the documents, Coastal will be prejudiced in the DOE enforcement proceedings. The district judge appears to have been troubled by the potential inequities of the situation: preliminary discovery was progressing quickly before the agency hearing board, yet the same agency\u2019s dilato-riness in the FOIA action threatened to hamper Coastal\u2019s ability to argue its position most effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-12\">Case law, however, protects Coastal\u2019s right to obtain non-exempt documents before agency proceedings are closed and irreparable harm occurs. In <em>Renegotiation Board v. Bannercroft Clothing Co., </em>415 U.S. 1, 94 S.Ct. 1028, 39 L.Ed.2d 123 (1974), the Supreme Court accepted the proposition that a district court could exercise jurisdiction to enjoin agency action pending the resolution of a FOIA claim. Although the Court declined to decide under what circumstances such an exercise of jurisdiction would be proper, it asserted that Congress\u2019 express vesting of equitable jurisdiction in the district courts by \u00a7 552(a)(4) in no way limited the inherent powers of an equity court.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-13\">Significant for present purposes is that FOIA\u2019s central aim is to ensure an informed citizenry and to hold the governors accountable to the governed. Congress did not intend FOIA to function as a private discovery tool. <em>See N. L. R. B. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number><em>Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 242, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 2326, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978); <em>Renegotiation Board, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 22,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> 94 S.Ct. at 1039. Quite appropriately, then, the district court\u2019s denial of DOE\u2019s motion to stay the disclosure order was premised on harm to the public and harm to the \u201cletter and spirit of the FOIA\u201d \u25a0 \u2014 the Court specifically could \u201cnot find that Coastal would suffer substantial harm as a result of the granting of a stay.\u201d <footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Therefore, precisely because Coastal would not be penalized by failure to obtain immediate access to the documents, the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d here are an insufficient justification for granting the procedurally-truncated \u201cpartial judgment\u201d motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-4\">Coastal\u2019s special circumstances argument apparently encompasses its claim that the district judge\u2019s order should be affirmed as an exercise of the court\u2019s inherent power to control its docket. It contends that the power to move litigation expeditiously is simply the converse of the inherent power to stay; therefore, enjoining disclosure and striking the revised <em>Vaughn </em>index amounted to no more than a refusal to grant a stay. DOE, for its part, acknowledges the district court\u2019s right to control its docket, but maintains that the agency has not violated any court order so as to merit such abrupt and final treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">From a technical perspective, DOE may not have violated any court orders, but it has failed to fulfill certain representations it made to the court and has evinced an indifference to complying in a timely manner throughout this suit. Nevertheless, we do not believe that the court\u2019s inherent power to control the proceedings before it nor the grant of equity power accorded by \u00a7 552(a)(4), justify the order that was entered. DOE had no reason to expect that its revised index would not be accepted. It is even plausible that DOE was attempting to accommodate Coastal by anticipating the outcome of the motion, which in fact sought production of an \u201cadequate, new and verified <em>Vaughn </em>index\u201d as an alternative form of relief.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The court\u2019s inherent power is intended to further \u201cthe orderly administration of justice,\u201d not to frustrate reasonable expectations of the litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">Nor do we believe that Congress contemplated such results by vesting district courts with equitable powers under \u00a7 552(a)(4). Because FOIA directs that documents be disclosed to \u201cany person\u201d regardless of need or purpose, it would be inconsistent to read the grant of equity power to permit discrepant treatment of parties depending on their interests or circumstances.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Indeed, it has been suggested that the use of the statutory word \u201cenjoin\u201d triggers the court\u2019s discretionary power to <em>refuse </em>to enforce the Act as well as to enforce it, whenever equity considerations so -require.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> From this standpoint, a court\u2019s duty may reside in refusing to enjoin violations of FOIA based on \u201cmistakes made in good faith.\u201d <footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Without deciding whether DOE\u2019s delays resulted despite good faith efforts \u2014 bad faith has not been alleged \u2014 we simply note that the court\u2019s equitable powers in this case would be exercised most effectively by enjoining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>the agency enforcement action, should the circumstances demand it, and not by abruptly terminating the FOIA proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">The difficulty of reconciling a district court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>power of review with an agency\u2019s statutory burden of proving its right to exemptions has generated many of the problems underlying the present controversy. As explained in the legislative history, the district court\u2019s role is integral to effectuation of the disclosure policy of FOIA.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Yet the legislative history also indicates that the goal of citizen access to government information was not intended to overwhelm legitimate privacy interests.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The task facing district courts is to transform a potentially ineffective, inquisitorial proceeding against an agency that controls the information into a meaningful adversarial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\"><em>In camera </em>inspection, which provides a basis for an individualized determination whether a particular document is factually exempt, has a certain surface appeal as a technique for exercising <em>de novo </em>review and ensuring the validity of alleged exemptions. But the inability of the party making a request under FOIA to offer an alternative interpretation of the records, the difficulty of contesting such a ruling on appeal, the burden such a time-consuming procedure places on district courts, the paucity of information available to appellate courts on review, and the limited precedential value of decisions based on <em>in camera </em>scrutiny all underscore the inadequacies of such an arrangement.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Consequently, the <em>Vaughn </em>index, which requires factually-grounded and specifically-indexed justifications for withheld documents, was developed as a preferred device for creating a more balanced and effective relationship between the parties and the court. Ideally, FOIA plaintiffs would acquire the knowledge crucial for debating government claims of exemption, and district courts would obtain the information necessary for reaching a reasoned decision on disclosure. If the agency\u2019s index fails to characterize accurately the contents of withheld documents, however, the court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review is frustrated and the agency\u2019s burden of proof falls, in effect, on the FOIA plaintiff who, in contravention of the statutory scheme, must prove the document is not exempt.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">To prevent such a reversal of statutory roles, it would not be' unreasonable to require an agency, in order to survive summary judgment, to rest on its first <em>Vaughn </em>index. The statute specifically outlines a schedule embodying the congressional judgment regarding the time needed for an adequate agency response. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)-{C). Extensions are provided in order to accommodate requests for large numbers of documents entailing nationwide searches. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii). Thus, nonproduction of evidence on account of undue delay or production of a grossly inadequate index which fails to indicate any material factual dispute, would constitute an \u201cimproper withholding\u201d for purposes of the Act at the summary judgment stage. Similarly, the district judge would be justified in listing a case for early trial and in then finding an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>improper withholding if the agency fails to sustain its burden by producing an adequate, or supplemented, <em>Vaughn </em>index if so ordered. And if necessary, a district court would be permitted to enforce its <em>Vaughn </em>index production order and hold the agency to its statutory burden of proof by invoking appropriate sanctions.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Under such a format, improper withholding would subsume problems of both the prompt production and the factual adequacy of a <em>Vaughn </em>index.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> And a court would properly exercise its <em>de novo </em>review role in demanding that agencies satisfy both elements in order to carry their burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">Here, however, the district court refused to consider the revised index, although the Rules require that such documents and affidavits be considered before a summary judgment. Nor did the trial judge preface his disclosure order with any notice that a final judgment on the merits, in reliance solely on the initial index, was forthcoming. Because DOE was not apprised that it would be required to submit to a final adjudication on the basis of the first index, the judgment of the district court will be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">.

It was recognized at the time of the <em>Vaughn </em>decision that the index requirement would impose a substantial burden on an agency seeking to withhold documents. In the absence of any structural incentives that would otherwise spur government disclosure, the <em>Vaughn </em>decision was intended to \u201csharply stimulate what must be, in the final analysis, the simplest and most effective solution \u2014 for agencies voluntarily to disclose as much information as possible and to create internal procedures that will assure that disclosable information can be easily separated from that which is exempt.\u201d <em>Vaughn v.

We are, of course, not unaware that difficulties arise when \u201cimproper withholding\u201d comprehends both findings of non-exemption based on <em>actual </em>knowledge of the records involved as well as <em>inadequate </em>knowledge of the records caused by the agencies\u2019 inability or unwillingness to provide the requested information. Third parties\u2019 privacy interests as well as national security concerns may be jeopardized by the agency\u2019s failure to carry its statutorily-assigned burden. And courts in the future may find that exactly how they choose to exercise their <em>de novo </em>review role, and the desirability of <em>in camera </em>review, may turn on whether the agency\u2019s own interests, or third party or important public interests, are at stake. Thus, a court faced with inadequately supported Exemption 5 claims for internal agency memoran-da might order disclosure despite incomplete knowledge of the records involved, since only the agency\u2019s vested interests are in issue. Insofar as the agency may be concealing a body of secret agency law, or even its own mistakes, a court might not hesitate to penalize agency delay in providing sufficient information to carry its burden of proof by ordering disclosure. But if agency dilatoriness potentially were to have adverse effects on third parties or national security interests, then a court might resort to <em>in camera </em>review to assure that the documents were factually non-exempt before ordering disclosure. Because <em>de novo </em>court review was intended to prevent deference to agency judgment, secrecy, or inertia, the extent to which this supervisory review requires courts to ascertain affirmatively the contents of the records, as opposed to rule solely on the agency\u2019s failure to carry its burden of proof, may well be informed by <em>whose </em>interests are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-21\"><em>See e. g., Ray v.
