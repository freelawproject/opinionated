LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1062-26\">Dennis A. Smith claims he was entitled to disability insurance benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(d) for a disability period under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(i) of the Social Security Act (the Act).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Smith\u2019s claim for disability was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>denied by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in an opinion after a hearing at which Smith waived his right to counsel. The district court ruled that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. On this appeal, the issue is whether under the facts of this case it was reversible error for the district court to have failed to remand this claim to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (the Secretary) when it found that the ALJ inadequately considered claimant\u2019s pain. We conclude that the district judge was in error and will vacate the judgment with direction to the district court to remand this case to the ALJ for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Dennis A. Smith was a 53 year old male who alleged he was disabled as of November 11,1977 due to \u201cotological impairments, bundle block of the heart, cataracts in eye, [and] blindness in one eye.\u201d Claimant met the insured status requirements of the Act. The record shows that claimant completed the eighth grade and received training as a boiler operator in trade school. He was employed for fifteen years as head custodian in a school. In this capacity, he performed numerous maintenance tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">In various interviews for his disability benefits, claimant stated that in 1975, subsequent to a tonsillectomy, he developed a hearing problem. He asserted that he experienced a \u201chissing and pulsating tinnitus in his left ear.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, he alleged that he ceased to work in February of 1976 because the noise was \u201ctoo annoying to work under.\u201d Smith complained of \u201calmost constant deafening noise\u201d and he claimed that \u201call sounds [were] greatly magnified\u2014 the hum of a refrigerator motor [was] a roar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">In January of 1977, claimant was examined by Dr. Robert Peterson. At that time, Smith suffered from hazy vision and had trouble reading. Dr. Peterson stated that claimant had \u201clight reception\u201d in his left eye only and that, due to an incipent catar ract, vision in his right eye was deteriorating. However, though Dr. Peterson expected Smith\u2019s vision to deteriorate and recommended surgery, he nonetheless believed that vision in Smith\u2019s right eye was correctable to 20 over 30. On November 27, 1977, and November 19, 1978, Dr. Richard H. Demaree, a general practitioner, examined Smith and diagnosed severe tinnitus (ringing, buzzing, roaring sounds) in the left ear and a bundle block in the heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">In his last interview, in his Report of Continuing Disability, Smith commented that \u201cI anticipate my vision problem will be corrected by surgery on August 17th, but my main problem (the ringing and hissing in his ears) has not improved at all.\u201d In addition, he indicated that his main complaint was \u201cnot loss of equilibrium but almost constant deafening noise (hissing, ringing and magnified sounds.)\u201d Finally, claimant alleged this constant deafening noise made \u201cme unable to concentrate on anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-13\">On January 26, 1978, Dr. Jay Kern, a gastroenterologist, examined Smith and he found impaired vision and an inability to tolerate high noise levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-14\">On June 15, 1978, Dr. Julio T. Noquera, an otolaryngologist, examined the claimant. On the basis of diagnostic tests he concluded that Smith had a loss of hearing in both ears and diagnosed the ringing sound in Smith\u2019s ears as a hearing loss related to an inability to hear high frequencies. He noted, however, that Smith\u2019s capacity to hear speech was normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-15\">Mr. Bernard Orr, a vocational expert, stated in the record that \u201cif Smith\u2019s complaints were true, there were absolutely no jobs he could perform.\u201d However, he stated that if Smith retained the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>light work, he had the residual vocational capacity to perform jobs including bench assembler, ticket taker, cashier, and front \u2022desk clerk, since all of these jobs are performed in relatively quiet areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">On November 11, 1977, claimant applied for disability insurance benefits. The application was denied both initially and upon reconsideration. Smith requested a hearing before an ALJ and a hearing was scheduled for November 7,1978. No one appeared for or represented Mr. Smith at the administrative hearing. The circumstances under which he did not appear are unclear. It is established that Mr. Smith did request a hearing, but on November 2, 1978 he requested a postponement on a form provided by the Social Security Administration stating he was \u201cunder doctor\u2019s care \u2014 urinary problems plus not released from eye surgeon from surgery on Aug. 17, 1978.\u201d There is a letter in the file from Mr. Smith to the hearing examiner stating that following a telephone conversation with \u201cEdna Wood from your office I wish to advise you that I waive my right to attend a hearing.\u201d There is no indication in the record as to what was said in the conversation with Edna Wood, but it is clear that Mr. Smith was persuaded to alter his prior postponement request. Whether or not an attorney would have permitted such waiver or would have allowed Mr. Smith to be persuaded to withdraw his postponement request is conjectural.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">The ALJ considered the case <em>de novo </em>without any oral testimony, and on January 15, 1979, found that Smith retained the residual functional capacity to perform light and sedentary jobs existing in substantial numbers in the local and national economy, and ruled that he was not disabled within the meaning of the Act. On March 5, 1979, Smith died, seven weeks after the ALJ\u2019s decision. The ALJ\u2019s ruling became the Secretary\u2019s final decision on June 18, 1979. Thereafter, pursuant to \u00a7 205(g) of the Act, Natalie F. Smith, widow of Dennis G. Smith, appealed to the district court for review of the Secretary\u2019s final determination, seeking the disability benefits allegedly due her deceased husband under \u00a7 204(d) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(d). The district court found that the Secretary\u2019s ruling was supported by substantial evidence even though the AU had inadequately considered the claimant\u2019s pain, and as a consequence, affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">In a thoughtful opinion, the learned district judge noted all of the proper precepts as to the standard of review of the Secretary\u2019s finding. . Since so much has been written noting the restraints on and the standards for both district judges and courts of appeals in reviewing the Secretary\u2019s findings, these precepts need not be repeated here. <em>See generally Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, No. 80-2027 (3d Cir. February 20, 1981); <em>Smith v. Califano, </em>637 F.2d 968 (3d Cir. January 13, <em>1981); Livingston v. Califano, </em>614 F.2d 342 (1980); <em>Dobrowolsky v. Califano, </em>606 F.2d 403 (3d Cir. 1979); <em>Hargenrader v. Califano, </em>575 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">The district court recognized that pain by itself can be a disabling condition. <em>Baerga v. Richardson, </em>500 F.2d 309, 312 (3d Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 931, 95 S.Ct. 1133, 43 L.Ed.2d 403 (1975). Further, it found that the ALJ \u201cinadequately addressed Smith\u2019s subjective complaints of pain.\u201d Indeed, the court stated that \u201c[o]rdinarily, this would necessitate a remand but such an order would be futile in this case because the death of Smith has made further fact finding impossible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at App. 8. The district judge\u2019s statement that it would be futile to remand because of Smith\u2019s death is predicated on the assumption that it is impossible to present subjective evidence of pain when the original claimant is deceased. While, of course, ALJ\u2019s do not have the power to resurrect the dead, nevertheless they can receive evidence from third parties and particularly doctors, family members and health personnel when the complaints of a deceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>claimant and acts of the claimant corroborate the inference of subjective pain. In fact, in <em>Baerga, </em>this court observed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-5\">In addition to objective medical facts and expert medical opinions, the Hearing Examiner must consider the claimant\u2019s <em>subjective evidence of pain and disability, as corroborated by family and neighbors; </em>and all of these factors must be viewed against the applicant\u2019s age, educational background and work experience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">500 F.2d at 312 (Emphasis added) <em>(quoting Mode v. Celebrezzi, </em>359 F.2d 135, 136 (4th Cir. 1966)). When the plaintiff in personal injury cases is deceased, the trial court routinely receives evidence from family, doctors and neighbors as a basis for damage awards for the pain and suffering which a party endured prior to death. We see no reason why the widow of a claimant would have any less rights before an AU or have a less sympathetic fact finder than one encounters routinely in a trial court in personal injury cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">As Judge Adams recently noted in <em>Dobrowolsky v. Califano, </em>606 F.2d at 406-7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aeo-dedup-0\">This court has ... emphasized [on numerous occasions] that the special nature of proceedings for disability benefits dictates extra care on the part of the agency in developing an administrative record and in explicitly weighing all evidence. We have pointed out that \u201c[a] hearing on an application for benefits is not an adversary proceeding. The applicant is confronted with no adversary in the usual sense of that term. The Social Security Administration provides an applicant with assistance to prove his claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5A\">(footnotes omitted). Accordingly, \u201c[i]t is incumbent upon the examiner to make specific findings \u2014 the court may not speculate as to findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409. Similarly, a district judge may not speculate as to the findings which an AU would make when appropriate and relevant evidence is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">In fact, should the ALJ fail to make comprehensive findings, his holding must be reversed and remanded for further findings. <em>Hargenrader v. Califano, </em>575 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1978). In <em>Baerga v. Richardson, </em>500 F.2d at 312-13, this court observed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-11\">In our view an examiner\u2019s findings should be as comprehensive and analytical as feasible and, where appropriate should include a statement of subordinate factual foundations on which ultimate factual conclusions are based, so that a reviewing court may know the basis for the decision .... It is incumbent upon the examiner to make specific findings\u2014 the court may not speculate as to his findings. <em>Williams v. Celebrezze, </em>359 F.2d 950 (4th Cir. 1966). \u201cWe think it is not too much to require that an administrative decision that a claimant is not eligible ... be supported by explicit findings of all facts that are essential to the conclusion of ineligibility.\u201d <em>Choratch v. Finch, </em>438 F.2d 342, 343 (3rd Cir. 1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">The ALJ\u2019s duty, therefore, is critical in this context since</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-13\">consistent with the legislative purpose, courts have mandated that leniency be shown in establishing the claimant\u2019s disability, and that the Secretary\u2019s responsibility to rebut it be strictly construed. We declared in <em>Hess </em>that \u201c[ajlthough the burden is upon the claimant to prove his disability, due regard for the beneficent purposes of the legislation requires that a more tolerant standard be used in this administrative proceeding than is applicable in a typical suit in a- court record where the adversary system prevails.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"act-dedup-1\"><em>Dobrowolsky v. Califano, </em>606 F.2d at 407 (citing <em>Hess v. Secretary, </em>497 F.2d at 840). Particularly where the claimant is unrepresented by counsel, the ALJ has a duty to exercise \u201ca heightened level of care\u201d and \u201cassume a more active role.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-14\">In this case, the record clearly reveals Smith\u2019s subjective statements of pain. Moreover, the record indicates that Smith\u2019s doctor diagnosed his problem as \u201csevere vertigo tinnitus.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>that \u201cthe ALJ inadequately addressed Mr. Smith\u2019s subjective complaints of pain.\u201d The ALJ should seek to corroborate this evidence by considering the testimony of others such as Smith\u2019s family members, neighbors and personal physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">For the reasons stated above, therefore, we will vacate the district court\u2019s order of summary judgment and direct that the matter be remanded to the Secretary for a further hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">. The Act defines disability as an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which .. . can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). Furthermore, the Act states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-27\">[A] individual . .. shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>which exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 423(d)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1063-16\">. Gray\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Textbook of Medicine, Par. 84.62 (3rd Ed. 1978) describes severe vertigo tinnitus as \u201ca subjective sensation of ringing or buzzing in the affected ear.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">. A National Institute of Health survey, reported in <em>Health Sciences Center News, </em>Vol. 5, No. 8, Aug.

I do not join in that portion of part III that relies on <em>Hargenrader v. Cali-fano, </em>575 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1978). As more particularly set forth in my dissent, <em>id. </em>at 438-39, I have problems with that case. My concerns would have been alleviated had this court required only that the ALJ set forth his narrative or historical <em>findings </em>of fact (basic facts). Basic facts underlie determinations of ultimate facts, which are mixtures of fact and law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although judicial review of basic facts is limited to the substantial evidence standard, a review of ultimate facts entails an examination for legal error of the legal components of those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">I believe that both the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the district courts would have better understood our directions in <em>Hargenrader and Baerga v. Richardson, </em>500 F.2d 309, 312-13 (3d Cir. 1974), if the court had distinguished basic facts, for which detailed findings are necessary, from ultimate facts, for which a less detailed explication is sufficient.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1066-9\">. Basic facts are those narrative or historical facts elicited at trial from the testimony and evidence presented by witnesses. An ultimate fact is usually expressed in the language of a standard enunciated by case-law rule or by statute, e. g., an actor\u2019s conduct was negligent; the injury occurred in the course of employment; the rate is reasonable; the company has refused to bargain collectively. \u201cThe ultimate finding is a conclusion of law or at least a determination of a mixed question of law and fact\u201d. It is the province of the fact finder \u2014 the jury, the judge in non-jury cases, or the administrative agency \u2014 to \u201cfind\u201d the basic fact, or that part of an ultimate finding that rests on narrative or historical facts.... [Ojnce basic facts have been found, they are seldom dislodged. R. Aldisert, The Judicial Process 694 (1976) (quoting <em>Helvering v. Tex-Penn Oil Co., </em>300 U.S. 481, 491, 57 S.Ct. 481, 573, 81 L.Ed. 755 (1937)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
