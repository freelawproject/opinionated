HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">Plaintiffs commenced this shareholders\u2019 derivative action on February 2,1977, alleging numerous acts of corporate misconduct by defendants in connection with the management of Skyway Development Corporation [hereinafter Skyway], Plaintiffs have appealed from an order of the district court granting full summary judgment to certain defendants and partial summary judgment to others. Because we determine that we are without jurisdiction to consider the merits of this appeal, we dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, grounded jurisdictionally upon diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a) (1976), alleges eight causes of action essentially charging defendants with fraud, conspiracy, and violations of fiduciary duties. The relief plaintiffs requested includes, <em>inter alia, </em>an accounting, appointment of a receiver, rescission, specific performance, some $67 million in actual damages, and an unspecified amount of punitive damages. Skyway, a nominal defendant, has counterclaimed to the tune of $100 million alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that plaintiffs\u2019 action is a \u201cspurious lawsuit\u201d filed \u201cfor the purpose of destroying [the] corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-12\">The United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, on October 4, 1979 granted summary judgment, <em>see </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 56(d), as to certain issues and parties in the case. The grant of summary judgment focused in large measure upon a release agreement entered into in 1974 between various members of Skyway\u2019s board and plaintiffs. The scope of the grant was clear: three defendants were granted partial summary judgment and five others were granted full summary judgment. This action by the district court, then, clearly had the effect of disposing of \u201cone or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), involved. From the order of the district court granting partial and full summary judgments, plaintiffs have attempted to appeal. They neither moved the district court to enter final judgment as to issues or parties they seek to bring before this Court, <em>see </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 54(b), nor have they requested district court certification for interlocutory appeal, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-15\">A federal court\u2019s inquiry into its own jurisdiction to consider the merits of a case before it has been aptly characterized by commentators as \u201cthe first principle of federal jurisdiction.\u201d P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro &amp; H. Wechsler, Hart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 835 (2d ed. 1973). So critical is this \u201cfirst principle\u201d to our constitutional government that federal jurisdiction is said to be an \u201copen\u201d question at all stages, trial and appellate, of an action. In fact, \u201c[t]his question the court is bound to ask and answer for itself, even when not otherwise suggested ...,\u201d <em>Mansfield, Coldwater &amp; Lake Michigan Ry. v. Swan, </em>111 U.S. 379, 382, 4 S.Ct. 510, 511, 28 L.Ed. 462 (1884), and we have done precisely that. <em>See also City of Kenosha v. Bruno, </em>412 U.S. 507, 511, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 2225, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973); <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company v. Mottley, 211 </em>U.S. 149, 152, 29 S.Ct. 42, 43, 53 L.Ed.2d 126 (1908); <em>Cameron v. Hodges, </em>127 U.S. 322, 325-26, 8 S.Ct. 1154, 1155-1156, 32 L.Ed. 132 (1888); <em>Mansfield, supra, </em>111 U.S. at 382, 4 S.Ct. at 511; <em>Capron v. Van Noorden, </em>6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 126, 126, 2 L.Ed. 229 (1804); <em>Oswalt v. Scripto, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 191, 192 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>State of Alabama ex rel. Baxley v. Woody, </em>473 F.2d 10, 12-13 (5th Cir. 1973). In advance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>oral argument we raised <em>sua sponte </em>the existence of a final appealable order and through the Clerk requested the parties to brief the issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our attention is properly directed to the arguments advanced by appellants in light of the irrefragable principle of federal practice placing \u201cthe burden ... on the party claiming jurisdiction to demonstrate [it] exists.\u201d C. Wright, Handbook of the Law of the Federal Courts 17 (3d ed. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">Plaintiffs assert two bases of appellate jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 in tandem with Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a). In support of their first assertion, plaintiffs argue that there is no need for an \u201cexpress determination\u201d by the district court under Rule 54(b). Such a determination, they argue, is clerical in nature especially in light of the district court\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d to render his grant final. The very words of Rule 54(b) belie this bizarre assertion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-5\">When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties <em>only upon an express determination </em>that there is no just reason for delay and <em>upon an express direction </em>for the entry of judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (emphasis added). Notwithstanding plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to ascribe to the district court a given intent, the Rule says nothing of intent and conclusively mandates a different understanding of the posture of such a case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-13\">In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties <em>shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the </em>order. <em>or other form of decision is subject to revision </em>at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-14\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We feel obliged, before going further, to note the manifest irony of this argument. Rule 54(b) was promulgated, in part, to benefit litigants in plaintiffs\u2019 position. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Appealability in the Federal Courts, </em>75 Harv.L.Rev. 351, 358 (1961). At one point in our legal history, <em>any </em>dispositive action by a federal district court in a multiple-party, multiple-claim scenario was thought to commence the appeal notice period as to the disposition ordered. <em>Cf. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company v. Mackey, </em>351 U.S. 427, 76 S.Ct. 895, 100 L.Ed. 1297 (1956).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This burdened the claims of many a litigant beyond repair, for if he failed to notice appeal within the short time period, his appeal on that disposition was forever lost.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Were we to permit plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>tiffs\u2019 appeal today, we would be obliged to <em>require </em>subsequent appellants to file multiple notices in like cases in order to preserve their rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That all of this difficulty has been avoided by Rule 54(b) is without doubt. <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company v. Mackey, </em>supra; 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 1154.27[2 \u2014 2], [2.-3] (3d ed. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second assertion, based upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), is clearly without merit. <em>See Switzerland Cheese Association, Inc. v. E. Horne\u2019s Market, Inc., </em>385 U.S. 23, 87 S.Ct. 193, 17 L.Ed.2d 23 (1966). They claim that because the district court\u2019s grant has the effect of denying rescission of the release agreement, that court has refused to grant an injunction. The statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atk-dedup-1\">The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from: Interlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States ... or of the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions, except where a directed review may be had in the Supreme Court ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (1976). \u201cInjunction\u201d and \u201crescission\u201d are not synonymous. Plaintiffs can no more convert a prayer for rescission into one for injunction than they can convert a partial disposition into an appealable final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">. Letter from Gilbert F. Ganucheau to All Counsel of Record (March 4, 1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-7\">An initial review of the briefs in this case suggests some doubt that there is a final appealable judgment upon which jurisdiction of this court may be based. Counsel\u2019s attention is invited to 28 USC 1291 and Rule 54(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-8\">Counsel are directed to brief the question of jurisdiction of the appeal within ten (10) days of the receipt of this letter. A letter form of brief addressed to the Clerk will suffice.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">. Plaintiffs further attention is directed to cases in this Circuit requiring Rule 54(b) determinations to sustain appellate review of summary judgment grants. <em>Strozier v. Gen'l Motors Corp., </em>584 F.2d 755, 756 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Jones v. Menard, </em>559 F.2d 1282, 1284 n.1 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Melancon v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>476 F.2d 594, 595 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Scott v. Bd. of Supervisors, </em>336 F.2d 557, 558 (5th Cir. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1238-16\">. Although <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Mackey, </em>was decided under the 1946 language (effective 1948) of Rule 54(b), its logic is clearly applicable to the \u201cmultiple-claim\u201d facet of present Rule 54(b). <em>See Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen\u2019l Electr. Co., </em>446 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 1460, 1465-66, 64 L.Ed.2d 1 (1980); <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 743 n.3, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 1206 n.3, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1238-17\">. Moreover, \u201cit thus became prudent to take immediate appeals in all cases of doubtful ap-pealability and the volume of appellate proceedings was undesirably increased.\u201d <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company v. Mackey, </em>351 U.S. 427, 434, 76 S.Ct. 895, 899, 100 L.Ed. 1297 (1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1239-9\">. The final judgment rule, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1976), seeks to avoid rather than foster \u201cpiecemeal\u201d appeals. <em>Cobbledick v. United States, </em>309 U.S. 323, 325, 60 S.Ct. 540, 541, 84 L.Ed. 783 (1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
