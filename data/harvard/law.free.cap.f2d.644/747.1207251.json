The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concluded that the surety owed the plaintiff, Confederate Construction, $38,197.80 under the subcontract, and that the defendant was not entitled to a setoff of liquidated damages for alleged delays in completion of the subcontractor\u2019s work. The court further held that the surety was indebted to Confederate in the amount of $17,950 for certain earthwork performed by Confederate. Prejudgment interest was awarded on this sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-15\">The surety\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in awarding the plaintiffs compensation for the earthwork performed. This claim is without merit. The evidence credited by the trial court showed that the earthwork, which had to be completed before Confederate could proceed with its own work, was the responsibility of Dollar Construction, the general contractor. Although repeated demands were made by Confederate, Dollar failed to perform the earthwork. It was, therefore, necessary for Confederate to do the earthwork itself if it was to perform its subcontract. This work was accomplished with the knowledge of Dollar\u2019s superintendent, who did no.t protest, and the district court properly held that Confederate is entitled to compensation for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-16\">The appellant also argues that the district court erred in awarding prejudgment interest on the amount recovered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Confederate for the earthwork performed. Interest at the rate of six percent per an-num was awarded from May 12, 1976, the date when all payments under the contract were due, until the obligation is paid. After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this regard. The amount of Confederate\u2019s claim was capable of ascertainment with a reasonable degree of certainty. The president of Confederate testified in specific terms as to the amount of earthwork performed, and the cost per cubic yard of this work. He further testified, as noted above, that the earthwork was performed only after repeated demands to Dollar were unavailing. Under these circumstances, the prejudgment interest award was properly allowed under Arkansas law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and did not constitute an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>See Wilson v. Lester Hurst Nursery, Inc., </em>269 Ark. 19, 598 S.W.2d 407 (1980); <em>Lovell v. Marianna Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>267 Ark. 164, 589 S.W.2d 577 (1979); <em>Love v. H. F. Constr. Co., </em>261 Ark. 831, 552 S.W.2d 15 (1977). It should be noted that no objection was raised in the district court with respect to the prejudgment interest award.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">As to all issues raised on' appeal, the Court has concluded that the judgment of the district court is based on findings that are not clearly erroneous and that no error of law appears. The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-9\">.
