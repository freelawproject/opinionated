Although the public is generally aware of the sordid trafficking of drugs and aliens across our borders, this litigation alerts us to a nefarious practice hitherto unsuspected even by this rather calloused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>bench \u2014 rare bird smuggling. The appeal is therefore accurately designated as <em>rara avis. </em>While Canadian geese have been regularly crossing, exiting, reentering and departing our borders with impunity, and apparently without documentation, to enjoy more salubrious climes, those unwilling or unable to make the flight either because of inadequate wing spans, lack of fuel or fear of buck shot, have become prey to unscrupulous traffickers who put them in crates and ship them to American ports of entry with fraudulent documentation in violation of a host of federal statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The traffic has been egregious enough to warrant the empanelling of a special grand jury in 1979 in the Northern District of New York to conduct a broad investigation of these activities. Even the services of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were mustered to aid the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">A principal target of the grand jury investigation was Kenneth Clare, a Canadian, who was believed to be in the business of shipping exotic birds into the United States, misrepresenting on import documents the value, the species and even the number of birds in the containers, thus avoiding the payment of United States Customs duties, inspection and quarantine. When one learns that an adult swan stands some four and a half feet tall and is normally ill tempered, the reluctance of a border inspector to make a head count is understandable. In this case Clare even had the audacity to pass off as Canadians, birds whose country of origin was England! Another target of the investigation was a California attorney, Edward R. Fitzsimmons, whose hobbies in-eluded the collection of horses, llamas and exotic birds. It was believed that Fitzsim-mons and Clare worked together hand or claw in glove.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">In February 1975, Fitzsimmons allegedly purchased from Clare four trumpeter swans and two red-breasted geese.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The crated birds were brought from Canada through Massena, New York, a Port of Entry in the Northern District of New York. Their entry papers were spurious. The trumpeter swans (cygnus buccinator) were described in the shipping documents as mute swans which are a less valuable variety. The birds were then airlifted to San Francisco by the Flying Tiger Lines where they were picked up by Janet Leslie Cooper Byrnes, the appellant, who was employed as a secretary by Fitzsimmons. Byrnes was a <em>quondam </em>zoologist at the London Zoo and knowledgeable about ornithological matters. When called before the grand jury on February 7, 1979, Byrnes testified that she did pick up the birds in 1975 but further stated that after driving away from the airport for ten or fifteen minutes, she heard no noises from the crates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She stated that she stopped at a gas station, pried open the crates and discovered that all the birds were dead and in fact so stiff that she assumed they had been dead for some time. (D.O.A.). She promptly drove to a municipal dump where the birds were interred in unconsecrated ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">By reason of this testimony the appellant was indicted on May 8, 1980 on four counts of false declarations before a grand jury in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a three day jury trial before Hon. Neal McCurn, Northern District of New York, Byrnes was convicted on two counts on July 18,1980.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She was sentenced to be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for a period of six months and fined $5,000 on each count. Execution of the prison sentence was suspended and the defendant was placed on probation for a period of one year on each count, the sentences to be served concurrently. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the Government\u2019s proof to support the conviction. Ida Meffert, who had emigrated from Germany and had obvious difficulty with the English language, was one of four government witnesses brought from California to Syracuse, New York for this momentous trial. She testified that she was a collector of Australian parrots in Hayward, California and described these parrots as \u201ccitizens.\u201d The court interjected: \u201cA citizen bird?\u201d The witness answered: \u201cYeah, the whole birds is citizen.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> More pointedly Mrs. Meffert testified that in February 1975 the appellant delivered four live swans and two live red breasted geese to her pursuant to an arrangement with Fitzsimmons whereby Mrs. Meffert and her husband provided room and board for some of his exotic wildlife. Mrs. Mef-fert was subjected to a grueling cross examination by counsel for appellant that was apparently aimed at her ornithological qualifications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mrs. Meffert testified that after a few days one of the swans died and she preserved his leg in her freezer to establish his demise.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u201cMan comes and tills the field and lies beneath,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">And after many a summer dies the swan.\u201d <em>Tithonus, </em>Alfred Lord Tennyson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The principal argument on appeal is not that Byrnes had truthfully testified to the grand jury, but rather that her testimony was not \u201cmaterial\u201d within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(a). That statute is violated only when the false statements bear upon issues under investigation by the grand jury. Appellant argues that her testimony that the birds were dead upon arrival and buried rather than delivered to Mrs. Meffert, was totally irrelevant to the grand jury investigation. The District Court rejected this contention and we affirm its finding of materiality. The leading case in this circuit addressing the question of materiality of false declarations before a grand jury is <em>United States </em>v. <em>Berardi, </em>629 F.2d 723, cert. denied, - U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 534, 66 L.Ed.2d 293 (1980). See also <em>United States v. Mulligan, </em>573 F.2d 775 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 827, 99 S.Ct. 99, 58 L.Ed.2d 120 (1978). Both parties rely upon <em>Berardi, </em>as did the District Court in finding the materiality of Byrnes\u2019 declarations. All of the elements of materiality set forth in <em>Berardi </em>are met here. As we explained in that case, the Government has the burden of establishing that the perjury was committed in response to a question within the purview of the grand jury investigation. That nexus need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt. 629 F.2d at 727. It is normally satisfied by introducing into evidence the grand jury minutes or the testimony of the foreperson of that jury. This enables the district court to determine the scope of the grand jury investigation and the relationship of the questions which elicited the perjury. <em>Id. </em>Here Judge McCurn had the benefit of the minutes as well as the testimony of the deputy foreperson and the United States Attorney in charge of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Materiality is broadly construed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlQ\">\u201cMateriality is thus demonstrated if the question posed is such that a truthful answer could help the inquiry, or a false response hinder it, and these effects are weighed in terms of potentiality rather than probability. Thus, in applying this gauge to specific situations, it is only the question, at the time of its asking, which is considered. It is of no consequence that the information sought would be merely cumulative ... or that the matters inquired into were collateral to the principal objective of the grand jury----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-12\"><em>United States v. Berardi, supra, </em>629 F.2d at 728 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">Measured by this broad test it is clear that the appellant\u2019s perjury here was material. The grand jury investigation was prolonged and broad in scope. Appellant\u2019s argument that it was simply limited to the importation of wildlife and had nothing to do with matters subsequent to importation is not accurate. Fitzsimmons was a target of the investigation and appellant\u2019s testimony that he had not received the birds shielded Fitzsimmons from the conspiracy charge relating to his role in the transactions in which he and Clare were allegedly involved. Moreover, had the truth been told Ida Meffert would have been identified months before her role in the matter was actually discovered. Appellant\u2019s false testimony clearly impeded and hindered the investigative efforts of the grand jury. Her perjury was therefore material within the meaning of the statute. See <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>16 F.2d 951, 953 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 273 U.S. 763, 47 S.Ct. 477, 71 L.Ed. 880 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">Appellant\u2019s remaining arguments are even less meritorious. In his opening to the jury, while explaining the background of the case, the prosecutor stated that Kenneth Clare had pleaded guilty to falsifying shipping documents. Appellant immediately moved for a mistrial; Judge McCurn denied the motion, but admonished the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s remark, pointing out that \u201cthe guilt or innocence of any of these parties is not binding on the young lady.\u201d In the three day trial that followed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the Government never mentioned Clare in its case or on summation. In view of the strength of the Government\u2019s perjury case and appellant\u2019s concession of the sufficiency of evidence to support her perjury, it is apparent that even if any error was committed it was harmless and did not warrant the granting of a new trial. <em>United States v. Frascone, </em>299 F.2d 824, 828 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 910, 82 S.Ct. 1257, 8 L.Ed.2d 404 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Finally, appellant urges that the trial judge committed reversible error by not taking judicial notice of Migratory Bird Permit Regulations, 50 C.F.R. Part 21 (1979) which require the registration of trumpeter swans and the obtaining of permits for their possession and disposal. Mrs. Meffert admitted that she had never registered the swans but also stated that she was unaware that any such regulations were in existence. Appellant argues that since they were not registered Mrs. Meffert never possessed the trumpeter swans. The argument is totally unpersuasive. Count II, charging appellant with false testimony that the swans were mute rather than trumpeters, was withdrawn from the jury. Thus, the relevance of the registration was minimal. Furthermore, Mrs. Meffert admitted that the swans weren\u2019t registered. Therefore, the point was made and her conceded ignorance of the Migratory Bird regulations hardly establishes that she didn\u2019t possess the swans which she didn\u2019t consider birds in any event.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The existence of the regulations was irrelevant and whether or not Mrs. Meffert violated them would only confuse the issue before the jury. The trial judge has broad discretion in these matters and he committed no abuse of discretion in refusing to take judicial notice of the regulations or submitting them to the jury. See <em>United States v. Albergo, </em>539 F.2d 860, 863 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1000, 97 S.Ct. 529, 50 L.Ed.2d 611 (1976); <em>United States v. Bowe, </em>360 F.2d 1, 15 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 961, 87 S.Ct. 401, 17 L.Ed.2d 306 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed, justice has triumphed and this is my swan song.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-6\">.

No birds have been indicted and there is no indication in the record that they were even aware of, much less participated in, the criminal activity unearthed by the grand jury.

DiNapoli, </em>557 F.2d 962, 964 n.1 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 858, 98 S.Ct. 181, 54 L.Ed.2d 130 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b185-13\">.

Two of the four counts of the indictment, including appellant\u2019s testimony that the swans were mute rather than trumpeter (Count II) and that Fitzsimmons had no business relationship with Clare (Count IV) were dismissed by the trial court prior to submission to the jury. The remaining counts related to appellant\u2019s testimony that the swans and geese were dead (Count I) and that she disposed of the allegedly dead birds at a landfill (Count IV).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\">. There are various record references to \u201ccitizen\u201d birds which was confusing since those at issue here were aliens.
