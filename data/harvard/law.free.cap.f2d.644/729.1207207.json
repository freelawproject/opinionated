GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">This case presents the question whether animal biologies constitute drugs within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(g)(1) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-19\">In February 1979, two field officers from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) attempted to inspect the facilities of Grand Laboratories, Inc. (Grand) in Freeman, South Dakota. They were denied entrance. In August 1979, the FDA obtained a warrant from a United States magistrate to inspect Grand\u2019s facility. Before the warrant was enforced, Grand brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the FDA on the grounds that the FDA is without jurisdiction to regulate the manufacture and sale of animal biologies. After issuing a temporary restraining order, the District Court held a hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should issue against the FDA. On February 21, 1980, the District Court filed a memorandum opinion and issued a preliminary injunction. <em>Grand Laboratories, Inc. v. Harris, </em>488 F.Supp. 618 (D.S.D.1980). The Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-20\">Grand manufactures and distributes animal biologies wholly within the state of South Dakota. Animal biologies are products prepared from animal tissues or fluids or growth of microorganisms, used for the prevention or treatment of disease in animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Grand successfully argued in the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that Congress granted sole federal regulatory power over the manufacture and sale of animal biologies to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-158 (1976). That act provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to prepare, sell, barter, or exchange in any place under the jurisdiction of the United States, or to ship or deliver for shipment from one State or Territory or the District of Columbia, any worthless, contaminated, dangerous, or harmful virus, serum, toxin, or analogous product intended for use in the treatment of domestic animals, and no person, firm, or corporation shall prepare, sell, barter, exchange, or ship as aforesaid any virus, serum, toxin, or analogous product manufactured within the United States and intended for use in the treatment of domestic animals, unless and until the said virus, serum, toxin, or analogous product shall have been prepared, under and in compliance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture, at an establishment holding an unsuspended and unrevoked license issued by the Secretary of Agriculture as hereinafter authorized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Under the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913, the USDA has limited commerce clause jurisdiction. The agency does not have jurisdiction over animal biologies manufactured and distributed wholly within one state, even though a component used in the biologic may have passed through interstate commerce. <em>See Animal Health Institute v. USDA, </em>487 F.Supp. 376 (D.Colo.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The FDA contended in the District Court that animal biologies were drugs within the meaning of the FDCA. The FDCA defines the term \u201cdrug\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\">(g)(1) The term \u201cdrug\u201d means (A) articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopoeia, official Homoeo-pathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, or official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of them; and (B) articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-12\">(C) articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ar1-dedup-0\">(D) articles intended for use as a component of any article specified in clauses (A), (B), or (C) of this paragraph; but does not include devices or their components, parts, or accessories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(g)(1) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">The FDA argued in the District Court that because animal biologies were drugs within the meaning of the FDCA the agency retained jurisdiction over their intrastate manufacture. The FDA conceded that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 392(b) (1976) deprived it of jurisdiction over the interstate manufacture and distribution of animal biologies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See post </em>at 7-8. The District Court, however, disagreed with the FDA\u2019s premise that animal biologies were drugs within the meaning of the FDCA. The court based this finding on the statutory history of both the FDCA and the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-17\">The FDA has correctly pointed out that great weight should be given to an agency\u2019s construction of a statute. The definition of \u201cdrug\u201d, however, appears to have already been construed as not encompassing animal biologies. As mentioned above, the USDA procured the passage of the VSTA in 1913. At that time the Food and Drug Act of 1906 was administered by the USDA and the definition of \u201cdrug\u201d contained in that act was apparently not viewed as encompassing animal biologies. The basic definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>\u201cdrug\u201d was not materially changed in the meantime. And the circumstances surrounding the inclusion of the VSTA in section 392(b) indicates that Congress concurred with the IJSDA interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7P\"><em>Grand Laboratories, Inc., </em>488 F.Supp. at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">On appeal, the FDA contends the District Court erred in finding it to be without jurisdiction over the intrastate manufacture and distribution of animal biologies. We find animal biologies not to be drugs within the meaning of the FDCA and affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">\u201cThe starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.\u201d <em>Teamsters v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. 551, 558, 99 S.Ct. 791, 795, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979). In spite of the use of animal biologies at the time of the original enactment of the predecessor to the FDCA, the Pure Food Act of 1906, animal biologies were mentioned in neither the statute nor the legislative history of the FDCA, nor in the Pure Food Act of 1906. Despite this lack of any support, in the form of congressional intent, for the inclusion of animal biologies, the FDA maintains that animal biologies are \u201carticles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals,\u201d and therefore come within the literal definition of section 321(g)(1)(B) of title 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Neither we nor Grand nor the FDA disagree that a literal reading of the above section includes animal biologies. The \u201cessential question for our determination is whether Congress intended the definition of drug [as set forth in the FDCA] to have the broad coverage\u201d that the literal language would allow. <em>United States v. Bacto-Unidisk, </em>394 U.S. 784, 793, 89 S.Ct. 1410, 1415, 22 L.Ed.2d 726 (1969). Reviewing the legislative history of the FDCA and the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913 and the lack of prior enforcement activity by the FDA, we find that Congress did not intend to include animal biologies within the meaning of the definition of the term \u201cdrug\u201d in the FDCA. In so finding, we recognize the remedial nature of the FDCA and give due deference to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of the act. <em>Id., </em>394 U.S. at 798, 89 S.Ct. at 1418; <em>see Teamsters v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. at 566 n.20, 99 S.Ct. at 800; <em>National Nutritional Foods Association v. Mathews, </em>557 F.2d 325, 336 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">In reviewing the legislative history of the pertinent acts, we are mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s warning that \u201c[o]nly when a literal construction of a statute yields results so manifestly unreasonable that they could not fairly be attributed to congressional design will an exception to statutory language be judicially implied.\u201d <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>442 U.S. 544, 555, 99 S.Ct. 2470, 2477, 61 L.Ed.2d 68 (1979). In order to fully understand the complex interplay of the FDCA and the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913, it is necessary to review congressional action in the human as well as the animal biologies area, in relation to congressional regulation of traditional drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">Federal regulation of human biologies began in 1902 when Congress enacted a statute prohibiting the importation or interstate shipment of any virus, serum, toxin, antitoxin, or analogous products unless licensed by the Treasury Department and properly labelled. Act of July 1, 1902, ch. 1378, 32 Stat. 728. Four years later, Congress enacted the Pure Food Act of 1906, ch. 3915, 34 Stat. 768. The act contained a broad definition of the term \u201cdrug\u201d which was continued in the FDC Act of 1938. Neither the statutory history of the human biologies act of 1902 nor of the Pure Food Act of 1906 contain any cross-references to each other. The Pure Food Act appears to have been enacted with the intention of being independent of any of the provisions of the human biologies act enacted in 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">In 1913, Congress passed the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913. The FDA admits that the legislative history contains no dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>cussion of the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act\u2019s relationship to the Pure Food Act of 1906. In 1938, Congress strengthened the FDA\u2019s power to protect the public from dangerous drugs by enacting the FDC Act. Once again neither the statute itself nor its history contains any reference to animal biolog-ies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 902(c) of the FDCA, however, did provide that the act did not affect, modify, or supersede the 1902 act regulating human biologies, but this section was later subject to the congressional revision of the human biologies act in 1944. <em>See post </em>at 8. No reference was made at that time to animal biologies, but section 902(c) was later amended, in 1968, to include the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913 relating to animal biologies. The amendment exempted the 1913 (animal biologies) act from the jurisdiction and coverage of the FDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Section 902(c) is now codified, as amended, at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 392(b) (1976), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">(b) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as in any way affecting, modifying, repealing, or superseding the provisions of section 262 of Title 42 (relating to viruses, serums, toxins, and analogous products applicable to man); the virus, serum, toxin, and analogous products provisions, applicable to domestic animals, of the Act of Congress approved March 4, 1913; the Filled Cheese Act of June 6, 1896, the Filled Milk Act of March 4,1923; or the Import Milk Act of February 15, 1927.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">The first explicit congressional connection between the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913 and the FDCA occurred with the passage of the Animal Drug Amendments of 1968, Pub.L. No. 90-399, \u00a7 107, 82 Stat. 342 (codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 392(b) (1976)). This amendment expanded the \u201cnot affecting, modifying, repealing or superseding\u201d language to include the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Our review of the statutory history of the meaning of the term \u201cdrug\u201d in the FDCA and its forerunner, the Pure Food Act of 1906, reveals that for a period of over 55 years, Congress never considered animal biologies to be drugs under the FDA\u2019s jurisdiction. In fact, when the relationship between human biologies and the FDCA was first explicitly considered in 1944, Congress reacted by making clear that human biologies were to be subject to the FDCA. In the Virus, Serum, and Toxin Act of 1944, ch. 373, Title III, \u00a7 351, 58 Stat. 702, relating to human biologies, Congress intended that the FDCA also apply to human biologies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cSubsection (g) [of \u00a7 351, codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(g) (1976)] is an explicit statement, confirming the present legal situation, that products subject to this section are not exempted from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> H.R. Rep. No. 1364, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. -, <em>reprinted in </em>[1944] U.S.Code Cong.Serv. 1211, 1234; <em>see United States v. Calise, </em>217 F.Supp. 705, 708-09 (S.D.N.Y.1962) (human blood both a drug and a human biologic).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Later, in 1968, when Congress considered the relationship between the FDCA and animal biologies, the reaction was markedly different. The FDA admits that section 107 of the Animal Drug Amendments of 1968, codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 392(b) added the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913 \u201cto the exempting provisions of section 902(c) of the FDC Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 392(b).\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 20. As stated by the District Court, the \u201cintended effect of section 392(b) [1968 amendment] is maintenance of the status quo.\u201d <em>Grand Laboratories, Inc., </em>488 F.Supp. at 622. We agree. Animal biolog-ies are not to be considered drugs within the meaning of the FDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The FDA also argues that we should defer to its interpretation of the meaning of the term \u201cdrug\u201d in the FDCA, the statute which the FDA is responsible for administering. \u201cBut there are limits, grounded in the language, purpose, and history of the particular statute, on how far an agency may go in its interpretative role.\u201d <em>Teamsters </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>439 U.S. at 566, 99 S.Ct. at 794. Since 1938, the FDA has acknowledged in regulations that animal biologies subject to the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913 \u201cshall not be deemed subject\u201d to the drug provisions of the FDCA. 3 Fed.Reg. 1847 \u00a7 1.02 (1938); 21 Fed.Reg. 5577 \u00a7 130.2 (1956). Even the FDA\u2019s regulations dealing with enforcement actions do not explicitly include animal biologies within their scope. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.1(f) (1980) defines products to include \u201can article subject to the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration, including any food, drug, and device intended for human or animal use, any cosmetic and biologic intended for human use, * <em>*.\u201d </em>If the FDA considered all biologies, both animal and human, to be within its jurisdiction, there would have been no need to modify the term biologic by the phrase \u201cintended for human use.\u201d Not until 1979 did the FDA, through litigation, attempt to exert any jurisdictional authority over animal biologies.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The FDA argues that excluding animal biologies from inclusion in the FDCA would result in a \u201cloophole\u201d in the regulation of intrastate animal biologies. Congress, in passing the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913, did not fully exercise its power under the commerce clause, as construed in later Supreme Court decisions. <em>See, e. g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, </em>379 U.S. 241, 258-59, 85 S.Ct. 348, 358, 13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964); <em>NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., </em>301 U.S. 1, 36-41, 57 S.Ct. 615, 624, 81 L.Ed. 893 (1937). Animal biologies manufactured and distributed wholly in one state remain free from the strictures of federal regulation. The legislative issue over whether a modern-day \u201cloophole\u201d exists is unrelated to the judicial question of whether animal biologies were included in the meaning of the term \u201cdrug\u201d in the Pure Food Act of 1906 and later the FDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">In short, Congress has created any so-called \u201cloophole\u201d in the federal regulation of intrastate animal biologies. It is therefore for Congress,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and not the Judicial branch, to remedy the situation if it sees fit to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">The existence of the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913, coupled with the FDA\u2019s lack of enforcement activity during the past century, severely undercut all arguments for extending the FDCA to animal biologies. The statutory history leaves little doubt but that Congress believed it was filling a regulatory void when it enacted the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913. If Congress believed animal biologies were included within the term \u201cdrug\u201d in the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, there would have been no need for a separate animal biologies act. Even if additional regulatory powers were perceived to be needed in the area of animal biologies, Congress could have remedied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>matter by amending the 1906 act. Instead, Congress enacted a separate, independent statute to regulate animal biologies. <em>Cf. Teamsters v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. at 569-70, 99 S.Ct. at 801-802. Animal biologies were not thought to be regulated under the Pure Food Act of 1906 and the FDC Act of 1938 at the time of their enactment. Animal biologies have been accorded separate and different treatment under the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913 from\u2019 the treatment accorded more traditional medications under the FDCA. Animal biologies at this time do not constitute drugs within the meaning of the FDCA. If federal jurisdiction is deemed advisable, Congress can fill this alleged void at any time it seems fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-9\">.

Originally, responsibility for enforcement of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913, and the FDCA of 1938 were placed in divisions of the Department of Agriculture. These were, respectively, the Bureau of Chemistry, the Bureau of Animal Husbandry, and the Food and Drug Administration. Subsequently, the FDA became part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, now Health and Human Services. <em>See Grand Laboratories, Inc., </em>488 F.Supp. at 620-21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">. Jurisdiction to enforce the human biologies acts originally was placed in the Public Health Service, which in 1902 was a division of the Treasury Department.

In 1940, the FDA and its functions were transferred to the Federal Security Agency. Therefore, as contrasted with animal biologies, <em>see </em>note 3, <em>supra, </em>human biologies, both as a drug under the FDCA and as human biologies under the 1944 act, have been administered by the same department since the date of the enactment of the 1944 act. <em>See Grand Laboratories, Inc., </em>488 F.Supp. at 620-21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b809-15\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(g) provides: \u201cNothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as in any way affecting, modifying, repealing, or superseding the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\">.

Section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1040, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(g), now reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">(g)(1) The term \u201cdrug\u201d means ... (B) articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACP\">This case concerns animal biologies, admittedly used for the prevention or treatment of disease in animals. The particular product around which the dispute here centers is known as \u201cporcine mastitis-metritis-arthri-tis-infertility bacterin.\u201d This bacterin contains, among other ingredients, aluminum hydroxide, which, according to evidence introduced in the court below, was purchased by the plaintiff Grand Laboratories, Inc., from a chemical firm in New Jersey and then shipped to South Dakota for use in the manufacturing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">There is thus no doubt, and the Court raises none, that the product involved here is within the literal definition of \u201cdrug\u201d that Congress has adopted. As I read its opinion, the Court declines to apply the words of the statute as written for two main reasons: (1) the interpretation thus produced is unreasonable; and (2) Congress, by its actions in later years, primarily in 1913 and 1968, has showed that it really did not mean what it said in 1906. Because I cannot agree that the literal language of the statute should not be applied in the circumstances of this case, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">I start with the proposition, recently repeated by the Supreme Court, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-14\">When we find the terms of the statute unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete, except \u201cin \u2018rare and exceptional circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>TVA v.

The Supreme Court reversed holdings by two courts below that the antibiotic discs were not drugs. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-18\">.. . Congress fully intended that the Act\u2019s coverage be as broad as its literal language indicates ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>394 U.S. at 798, 89 S.Ct. at 1418. The Court also referred, <em>ibid., </em>to \u201cthe well-accepted principle that remedial legislation such as the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is to be given a liberal construction consistent with the Act\u2019s overriding purpose to protect the public health .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The significance of this holding for present purposes is enhanced when it is recalled that the effect of a contrary holding in <em>Bacto-Unidisk </em>would probably not have been to exempt the discs from regulation altogether, since, if they had not been held to be \u201cdrugs,\u201d they would almost certainly have been considered \u201cdevices,\u201d and thus subject to regulation, though to a lesser extent, under another provision of the statute. Here, by contrast, the Court\u2019s holding that animal biologies are not \u201cdrugs\u201d leaves those substances, in cases where they are not actually shipped in their finished form across state lines, entirely free of all federal regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The Court persuasively argues that the result advocated by the Food and Drug Administration here would be illogical, in that certain kinds of animal biologies, those shipped across state lines, would be regulated by the Department of Agriculture, whereas certain other kinds, those not shipped across state lines but composed in part of ingredients that had been so shipped, would be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The resulting regulatory scheme, to be sure, is not so symmetrical as it could be, and if one were casting a vote in Congress, the arguments for placing the regulation of all animal biologies in the Department of Agriculture, as opposed to the Food and Drug Administration, would be strong indeed. It seems to me, however, that judges should usually resist the temptation to superimpose their own ideas of reason and logic on the clear words of a congressional enactment. I cannot bring myself to believe that a literal construction of this statute would yield \u201cresults so manifestly unreasonable that they could not be attributed to congressional design .... \u201d <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>442 U.S. 544, 555, 99 S.Ct. 2470, 2477, 61 L.Ed.2d 68 (1979). It is no more reasonable, in my view, to conclude that Congress, despite the concededly unambiguous words of the 1906 statute, did not intend in that enactment to regulate animal biologies at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">It is true that the construction of the statute I am arguing for leaves some questions unanswered about the subsequent conduct of the Congress. If, for example, animal biologies had already been regulated by the Act of 1906, why did Congress, in the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913, now codified as 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-58, subject those products, when shipped interstate, to regulation by the Department of Agriculture? The question is a fair one, and I do not know the answer. I do suggest, however, that when Congress enacts two provisions with respect to a given subject that appear to be inconsistent or conflicting, it is our duty to harmonize the provisions and to give effect to both of them to the extent possible. Here, the 1913 Act can be given full effect as written, without superseding the jurisdiction previously conferred over products of the kind at issue in this case by the 1906 Act. The Court rightly directs our attention to the Animal Drug Amendments of 1968, \u00a7 107 of which, 82 Stat. 342, is now codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 392(b). This provision makes clear that the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not affect, modify, repeal, or supersede the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913. The Court reads these words as indicating a general intention on the part of Congress not to regulate animal biologies at all except as expressly provided in the 1913 Act. The words need not be so read. Their literal meaning is simply to leave the regulation of animal biologies shipped across state lines in the Department of Agriculture, where it had been since 1913. No reference is made to the Act of 1906, and no such reference should be implied, in view of the universally received doctrine that repeals by implication are not favored.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">It is perfectly true, as the Court observes, <em>ante, </em>pp. 734-735, that Congress can act to fill the void created by this case, if it is a void. It is equally true that Congress could overrule a holding by the courts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Food and Drug Administration has the power to regulate animal biologies sold intrastate. The real question is, who shall bear the risk that, for reasons of inertia or otherwise, Congress may not act at all? I would prefer that risk be borne by the private parties seeking to avoid all federal regulation, rather than by the public agency seeking to defend the public health. No doubt there are cases when the literal meaning of a statute is absurd, and we are not, in those instances, obliged to abandon our common sense. In most eases, however, the safer course is to apply the law as written, secure in the knowledge that if we do so we cannot justly be accused of usurpation, and that a power exists that can correct us. In short, I believe this is a case in which we should apply the aphorism of Mr. Justice Holmes that \u201cwe do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means.\u201d Holmes, Collected Legal Papers 207 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">I would reverse the judgment below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-9\">.

The Court also argues, <em>ante, </em>p. 734, that \u201c[s]ince 1938, the FDA has acknowledged in regulations that animal biologies subject to the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act of 1913 \u2018shall not be deemed subject\u2019 to the drug provisions of the FDCA.\u201d As 1 understand the cited regulation, however, it did not disclaim altogether any FDA jurisdiction over animal biologies, but simply provided that \u201ca new drug shall not be deemed subject to . .. the [FDC] Act, if it is subject to the [VSTA] .. .3 Fed.Reg. 1847, \u00a7 1.02 (1938). It is undisputed that the animal biologies at issue here are not subject to the VSTA. The clear implication of the Department of Agriculture\u2019s 1938 regulation, therefore, is that these biologies are subject to the FDCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
