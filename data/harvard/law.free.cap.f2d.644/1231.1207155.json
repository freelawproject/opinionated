(P-Burg) conducts- a surface mining operation in Clay County, Indiana. On August 16, 1979, two authorized representatives of the Department of Interior appeared at P-Burg\u2019s mine site to conduct an investigation pursuant to Section 502(e) of the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1977.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>their credentials to an officer of P-Burg and informed him of the purpose of their visit. The officer refused to admit the Department officials because they had no search warrant, and the officials left without making an inspection. The Secretary then brought the present action pursuant to Section 521(c) of the Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to enjoin P-Burg, its officers and its agents from denying the Department access to its operation. The district court, pursuant to Rule 65(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, consolidated the trial on the merits with the application for a preliminary injunction and on June 5, 1980, granted the requested relief. 495 F.Supp. 82. P-Burg appeals, contending that the district court erred in holding that (1) the Department was not constitutionally required to obtain a search warrant before conducting an investigation pursuant to the Act and (2) Congress is empowered under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution to regulate mining operations, such as P-Burg\u2019s, which produce coal solely for intrastate sale and consumption.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">We are wholly in accord with the reasoning and conclusions set forth in Judge Dillin\u2019s memorandum of decision, which we adopt as our own. For the reasons stated therein (495 F.Supp. at 83-88) the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1307-14\">. Section 502(e) (30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(e)) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-15\">\u201c(e) Within six months after August 3, 1977, the Secretary shall implement a Federal enforcement program which shall remain in effect in each State as surface coal mining operations are required to comply with the provisions of this chapter, until the State program has been approved pursuant to this chapter or until a Federal program has been implemented pursuant to this chapter. The enforcement program shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-16\">\u201c(1) include inspections of surface coal mine sites which may be made (but at least one inspection for every site every six months), without advance notice to the mine operator and for the purpose of ascertaining compliance with the standards of subsections (b) and (c) above.
