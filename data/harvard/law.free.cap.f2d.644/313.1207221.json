K. HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b390-18\">Sheldon S. Moss appeals from an order of the district court holding him in civil contempt and committing him to the custody of the U. S. Marshal for failing to comply with an order entered on a consent judgment of permanent injunction and other relief entered by the same court on January 22, 1979. We affirm the district court\u2019s contempt and commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-19\">The consent judgment in issue arose from a complaint brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in civil enforcement proceedings against Moss and others. The SEC alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Moss, individually and doing business as Correlated Equities Corporation, and others had violated the antifraud and registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>provisions of the federal securities laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moss, through counsel, consented to the entry of a preliminary injunction. On January 22, 1979, again through counsel, Moss consented to the entry of a permanent injunction. An order was entered by the district court upon the parties\u2019 consent and signature. The consent order required Moss to deposit $4.5 million in the court registry and prohibited him from disposing of his assets without prior court approval, except in limited circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The consent order further provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4_j\">Correlated Equities and Sheldon Moss .. . deposit and remit the above described monies by February 28, 1979, or file with the plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission a detailed schedule of the monthly receipt and disbursement of all monies, funds, and properties for each of them and all persons or corporations controlled directly or indirectly, by them by the 10th day of the month following the month covered by said schedule of receipts and disbursements until said sum is paid, the first schedule covering January and February, 1979, to be filed by March 10, 1979.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Moss filed monthly reports for January, February and March in compliance with the consent judgment. On April 30, 1979, the SEC petitioned the district court for an adjudication in civil contempt against Moss for failing to deposit the $4.5 million in the court registry. On June 26, 1979, a contempt hearing was held during which the district court questioned the parties extensively regarding the intent of the consent judgment. At this time Moss argued the consent judgment provided him with alternate means of compliance, to wit: the deposit of $4.5 million or the timely filing of reports on receipts and disbursements. The district court denied the SEC\u2019s petition for contempt but rejected Moss\u2019 argument. By order filed July 13, 1979, it found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmI\">a meeting of the minds of all the parties occurred on January 22, 1979, the date the agreement was signed and filed, and it is concluded that the intent of the parties was that the defendants Correlated Equities Corporation and Sheldon Moss pay into the Clerk of the Court $4,500,000.00 in negotiable U. S. Government Securities \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d from the date on which the consent decree and injunction was entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">The district court further found that the reasonable time for compliance had expired and it ordered Moss to deposit the money and file the required reports by August 1, 1979. This deadline was later amended to September 1, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">On August 21, 1979, in connection with a related matter, the reports for April, May and June of 1979 were delivered. These reports disclosed that Moss had sold a condominium apartment and some shares of bank stock without the court\u2019s approval. Nine days later the SEC filed another petition to hold Moss in civil contempt for selling these assets without court approval and for claiming excessive living expenses. At the contempt hearing Moss claimed he had sold these assets to support his family and to pay counsel fees. Following this hearing, but before the court issued its order, Moss filed an affidavit stating that he was unemployed and that he had virtually no assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">On September 20, 1979, the district court issued an order holding Moss in civil contempt and ordering his commitment until he purged himself by paying the $4.5 million. Moss filed another affidavit stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>his poverty. The district court stayed its commitment order pending this appeal. On May 8,1979, following the entry of a guilty plea to 16 counts of mail fraud, Moss was sentenced to 8 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">On appeal Moss argues there was no basis for holding him in civil contempt because he did not violate the consent order. Moss renews his argument that the January 22,1979, order provided for alternate means of compliance. We, too, find this argument unpersuasive. If Moss\u2019 position were to be accepted, he could forever avoid the payment of the $4.5 million by filing timely reports. Furthermore, it is clear that Moss violated that portion of the consent judgment which prohibited the sale of assets without court approval except in limited circumstances. Moss was only permitted to use his <em>personal </em>funds for the payment of living expenses and counsel fees. The sale of assets without court approval was restricted to sales for the purpose of funding repayment or repaying Television Marketing\u2019s indebtedness. The sale of assets for other purposes required prior court approval which Moss did not request or receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Moss also contends the district court improperly modified the consent judgment and order by inferring the parties meant to require payment within a reasonable time. The district court acted well within its powers in determining the parties\u2019 intent when they entered into the consent judgment. <em>U. S. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., </em>420 U.S. 223, 95 S.Ct. 926, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975). The district court\u2019s determination that there was a meeting of minds and that a reasonable time for compliance was intended was a permissible exercise of its \u201cinherent power to supervise and aid the implementation of settlement agreements in pending litigation.\u201d <em>Wood v. Virginia Hauling Co., </em>528 F.2d 423 (4th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Moss\u2019 final contention is that since he does not have the present financial ability to comply with the consent order, the commitment will serve no remedial purpose. The district court heard testimony and evaluated the evidence presented to show Moss\u2019 inability to comply with the consent order. It did not credit much of Moss\u2019 testimony, especially in light of the government\u2019s allegations that Moss was attempting to evade the judgment. We find no abuse of discretion by the district court. When Moss completes his present criminal sentence, he may then present whatever new evidence is available to demonstrate his inability to comply with the consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\">. The complaint alleged violations of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e(a) and (c), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a), and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">. The consent judgment provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201cthe defendants are permitted to use their <em>personal </em>funds for reasonable and necessary living, secretarial, utility, travel, counsel fees, accountants [sic] fees, rent expenses ...\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">Correlated Equities Corporation and Moss, individually, and d/b/a Television Marketing were further permitted to pledge, hypothecate, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any assets for the purpose of funding the repayment or repaying the indebtedness of Television Marketing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b392-9\">ERVIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A-v\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Although I agree with the majority that Moss violated the consent order, his inability to comply is, in my opinion, a complete defense. I, therefore, respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s affirmance of the district court\u2019s contempt order.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">The Supreme Court has long recognized, as this court fails to do today, that the purpose of civil contempt is coercive rather than punitive, and that one who simply cannot comply with an order cannot be held in contempt for failing to do so. <em>See McNeil v. Director, Patuxent Institution, </em>407 U.S. 245, 251, 92 S.Ct. 2083, 2087, 32 L.Ed.2d 719 (1972) (\u201cCivil contempt is coercive in nature, and consequently there is no justification for confining on a civil contempt theory a person who lacks the present ability to comply.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bryan, </em>339 U.S. 323, 330, 70 S.Ct. 724, 730, 94 L.Ed. 884 (1950) (\u201cOrdinarily, one charged with contempt of court for failure to comply with a court order makes a complete defense by proving that he is unable to comply.\u201d); <em>see also </em>D. Dobbs, <em>Remedies </em>103-05 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\"><em>Maggio v. Zeitz, </em>333 U.S. 56, 68 S.Ct. 401, 92 L.Ed. 476 (1948), is particularly instructive in this case, for in <em>Maggio </em>the Supreme Court refused to allow a contempt citation to stand when compliance with a court order was impossible. Maggio, as president and manager of a bankrupt corporation, had been held in contempt for failure to comply with a turnover order, despite evidence showing that he did not have possession of the goods and hence could not comply with the order. In vacating the Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Circuits affirmance of the district court\u2019s finding of contempt, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">The nature and derivation of the remedy make clear that it is appropriate only when the evidence satisfactorily establishes the existence of the property or its proceeds, and possession thereof by the defendant at the time of the proceeding. ... Conduct which has put property beyond the limited reach of the turnover proceeding may be a crime, or, if it violates an order of the referee, a criminal contempt, but no such acts, however reprehensible, warrant issuance of an order which creates a duty impossible of performance, so that punishment can follow. 333 U.S. at 64, 68 S.Ct. at 405.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Impressed by the Second Circuit\u2019s admission of Maggio\u2019s inability to comply,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court felt it unnecessary to inquire whether that finding was justified by the evidence in the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Moss\u2019 contempt citation remains in effect, and hence his imprisonment continues, until he purges himself by paying four and a half million dollars into the district court\u2019s registry; this is the total payment contemplated by the consent order. The record in this case reflects not only that the state of Moss\u2019 finances left him in no position to pay such a vast sum, but also that the district court was fully aware of that circumstance. Moss swore that he was unemployed, that his receiver controlled all of his assets, that he had little money and few personal belongings, and that he was dependent on his children for support. Financial records attached to Moss\u2019 affidavit showed that his liabilities far outweighed his assets at the time of the contempt adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">The district court was aware that Moss could not comply with an order to repay such a large sum of money, as evidenced by its comment at the first contempt hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARA\">[I]t\u2019s obvious that he doesn\u2019t have the money to pay these people back or it is apparent to me, and I am sure that some of the people who have invested in this, it is apparent to them that they are going to lose in this situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">Transcript at 34.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">The court\u2019s remark indicates that it knew it was, in effect, requiring Moss to do the impossible in order to purge himself of contempt. In addition, the court recognized that the law allows such inability to comply to be a defense to contempt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">Well, in a civil matter to order that amount of money paid back without more assurance than I had that it would be paid back put the court in a rather bad position. People not familiar with the law do not understand why the court cannot just in this civil case incarcerate someone eternally for failing to do that [to pay]. Well, you know as a lawyer that in a civil case, I can\u2019t do that. You know as I know, that if somebody ordered to pay that money comes in and shows that he or she is without funds and is without property, that you have to [sic] got to turn them loose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-15\">Transcript at 249-50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">The court, then, appears to have simply attached no significance to Moss\u2019 affidavit, even though nothing else in the record indicates that Moss did have the financial ability to comply with the order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In my opinion, the district court\u2019s action raises the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>specter of the debtor\u2019s prison this country long ago outlawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\">. The Second Circuit had said, \u201cAlthough we know that Maggio cannot comply with the order, we must keep a straight face and pretend that he can, and must thus affirm orders which first direct Maggio \u2018to do an impossibility, and then punish him for refusal to perform it.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>333 U.S. at 59, 68 S.Ct. at 403.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\">. The Court did point out, however, that Mag-gio tendered evidence of his earnings for the pertinent period, of his unemployment during part of that time due to failing health, and of his family obligations and manner of living during the intervening period. He also swore that he had no real or personal property which could be used to satisfy the trustee\u2019s demands and repeated his denial of possession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b393-18\">. Interestingly enough and despite its earlier recognition that \u201cit\u2019s obvious that [Moss] doesn\u2019t have the money to pay these people back or it is apparent to me,\u201d Transcript at 34, the district court nonetheless noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-19\">I am sure what this [affidavit] says is that he doesn\u2019t have any funds. Well, I\u2019m not going to be convinced at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-20\">Transcript at 252.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
