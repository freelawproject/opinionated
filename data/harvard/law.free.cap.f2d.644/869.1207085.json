Krupp GmbH (collectively, Krupp) appealed (Appeal No. 80-19) from a decision of the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) in Investigation No. 337-TA-52, <em>In re Certain Apparatus for the Continuous Production of Copper Rod, </em>206 USPQ 138 (1979). Southwire Company (Southwire) has cross-appealed (Appeal No. 80-21). Western Electric Company, Incorporated and Nassau Recycle Corporation (collectively, Bell) move for leave to intervene in Appeal No. 80-19. We deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b946-14\">On April 11, 1978, Southwire filed a complaint with the ITC under section 337<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Tariff Act of 1930, <em>as amended, </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337, (section 337), alleging that Krupp and Bell had engaged in unfair acts or unfair methods of competition by importing into and selling in this country certain apparatus used for the continuous production of copper rod. Krupp and Bell allegedly infringed five U.S. patents and misappropriated fourteen trade secrets owned by Southwire.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">Following an investigation, the ITC issued a COMMISSION MEMORANDUM OPINION and a COMMISSION DETERMINATION AND ORDER on November 23, 1979, 206 USPQ 138. The OPINION treated the five patents and fourteen trade secrets and the issues thereon seriatum. The ITC found Bell not guilty of any violation. However, it determined that Krupp violated section 337 with respect to one patent and two trade secrets and ordered Krupp to cease and desist from importing or selling articles incorporating the two trade secrets or articles suitable for use in infringing the patent. Of the remaining four patents, the ITC found three invalid and one valid but not infringed. Of the remaining twelve trade secrets, the ITC found nine not protectable because they had been publicly disclosed, two not misappropriated, and Southwire lacking a proprietary interest in the other.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-16\">On February 19, 1980, Krupp appealed (Appeal No. 80-19) from the ITC decision, alleging error in the determinations that Krupp violated section 337. On February 28,1980, Southwire filed a cross-appeal (Appeal No. 80-21) attacking the ITC\u2019s findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>respecting the patents and trade secrets for which no section 337 violation was found.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Additionally, two appeals by Bell (Nos. 80-14 and 80-26) were-filed and, on South-wire\u2019s motions, dismissed by this Court. Similarly, two additional appeals by Krupp (Nos. 80-15 and 80-23) were filed and, on Southwire\u2019s motions, dismissed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">To complete the appellate track record, two more appeals in this matter (Nos. 79-25 and 79-31) filed by Southwire have been decided on the merits by this Court, <em>Southwire Co. v. USITC, </em>67 CCPA -, 629 F.2d 1332, 207 USPQ 189 (1980); and one Southwire appeal (No. 80-30) was dismissed on Southwire\u2019s motion. <em>Southwire Co. v. USITC, </em>No. 80-30, September 11, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Concerning Appeal Nos. 80-19 and 80-21, the parties stipulated on March 21, 1980, that they would prepare and file a consolidated printed transcript of record by June 16, 1980. On December 3, 1980, after various other extensions of time, this Court permitted the printed transcript to be filed \u00bbno later than February 15, 1981; and informed all parties that oral argument was scheduled for June 1981 and that the filing of briefs would be governed by that hearing date. On February 13, 1981, the printed transcript was timely filed with the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">On February 17, 1981, Bell moved for leave to intervene in Appeal No. 80-19, the motion presently under consideration. Subsequently, Krupp supported Bell, the ITC did not oppose the motion, Southwire filed its opposition, and on March 9, 1981, Bell filed a reply to the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">Bell bases its Motion for Leave to Intervene on (1) its interest in the outcome of the appeal by virtue of an alleged \u201cpotentially reduced resale value\u201d of certain equipment due to the ITC\u2019s findings; (2) Bell\u2019s \u201cunique knowledge\u201d of various facts pertinent to the appeal; and (3) the lack of prejudice to any of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-22\">Southwire argues, among other things, that Bell\u2019s motion is untimely under Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (FRAP).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-23\">Bell replies that CCPA Rule 1.4(c) allows this Court to waive the time limits of FRAP 15(d) for \u201cgood cause\u201d and that good cause is shown by the following: (1) Bell\u2019s appeals in Nos. 80-14 and 80-26 were dismissed after the 30 day time limit of FRAP 15(d); (2) Bell, with \u201csome surprise,\u201d learned only recently of Southwire\u2019s purported present position concerning licensing of one particular patent involved in Appeal No. 80-19; and (3) Bell\u2019s interest and the public interest would be advanced by Bell\u2019s participation in No. 80-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-24\">The CCPA Rules do not specifically provide for intervention in appeals from final determinations of the ITC. However, CCPA Rule 1.4(a) does state that the \u201cFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure shall govern any practice or procedure not specifically covered by these rules.\u201d Thus intervention in this situation is governed by the applicable rules found in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-25\">FRAP 15 furnishes guidelines for review of orders of administrative agencies, boards, commissions and officers by federal courts of appeals. Specifically, FRAP 15(d) concerns intervention in the federal appellate review process and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-26\">Unless an applicable statute provides a different method of intervention, a person who desires to intervene in a proceeding under this rule shall serve upon all parties to the proceeding and file with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>the clerk of the court of appeals a motion for leave to intervene. The motion shall contain a concise statement of the interest of the moving party and the grounds upon which intervention is sought. A motion for leave to intervene or other notice of intervention authorized by an applicable statute shall be filed within 30 days of the date on which the petition for review is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Since no \u201capplicable statute\u201d exists to provide a different method of intervention, Rule 15(d) procedure is applicable to motions for leave to intervene in this Court\u2019s review of ITC final determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Appeal No. 80-19 was filed on February 19, 1980. Under FRAP 15(d), assuming no extensions of time were granted under CCPA Rules 1.4(c) and 5.2(d), infra, any motion for leave to intervene would have to have been filed within 30 days of that date, i. e., no later than March 20,1980. Without requests for or grants of extensions of time, Bell\u2019s motion was filed on February 17, 1981, some 334 days late.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">As noted by Bell, this Court may waive or modify any provision of its own rules or applicable FRAP rules on motion and for \u201cgood cause\u201d under CCPA Rule 1.4(c). Where the request concerns an extension of time, consideration of such a request must be made in light of CCPA Rule 5.2(d) which permits an untimely action to be taken where a motion has been filed <em>after </em>the expiration of a controlling specified time period (as is the case here) <em>only </em>\u201cwhere the failure to act was excusable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Reviewing the motion papers before us and considering the arguments presented, we conclude that \u201cgood cause\u201d has not been established here to waive the FRAP 15(d) 30 day time period. We also conclude that Bell\u2019s failure to act in a timely manner was not excusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">The untimeliness of the Motion for Leave to Intervene is amplified by the \u201celeventh hour\u201d filing approach taken by Bell. All parties to the appeals were informed by this Court on December 3,1980, that the printed consolidated transcript would have to be filed by February 15,1981, that the hearing date was set for June 1981 and that the filing of briefs would be governed by the June 1981 date. Thus the February 15, 1981 deadline was known well in advance by Bell. Still Bell filed its motion <em>after </em>that deadline, three days <em>after </em>the actual filing of the transcript, probably well into the brief preparation period, and very near to the brief filing period of Appeal Nos. 80-19 and 80-21.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">Accordingly, Bell\u2019s Motion for Leave to Intervene is <em>denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-10\">. Section 337 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-11\">Unfair practices in import trade</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyaG\">Unfair methods of competition declared unlawful</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-12\">(a) Unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the importation of articles into the United States, or in their sale by the owner, importer, consignee, or agent of either, the effect or tendency of which is to destroy or substantially injure an industry, efficiently and economically operated, in the United States, or to prevent the establishment of such an industry, or to restrain or monopolize trade and commerce in the United States, are declared unlawful, and when found by the Commission to exist shall be dealt with, in addition to any other provisions of law, as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b946-18\">.

We granted that motion on March 9, 1981. As previously noted, this Court has stated that Bell could participate in Appeal No. 80-21 as an appellee, n.4 supra, which Bell has chosen to do.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
