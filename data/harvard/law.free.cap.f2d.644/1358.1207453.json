We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>affirm the district court\u2019s holding, premised on <em>Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co., </em>418 U.S. 1, 94 S.Ct. 2757, 41 L.Ed.2d 535 (1974) <em>(Idaho Power), </em>that where any depreciation of equipment attributable to construction of taxpayer\u2019s facilities must be capitalized under I.R.C. \u00a7 263(a)(1), no part of such depreciation may be deducted from gross income under I.R.C. \u00a7 167(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-4\">The parties stipulated to the following relevant facts. Pacific Power &amp; Light Company (Pacific Power), a public utility incorporated in Maine, is engaged in the business of generating, transmitting, distributing, and selling electricity in Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, California, Montana, and Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">During the years in issue, 1962 through 1966, Pacific Power constructed for its own use new power transmission and distribution facilities to supply electrical energy in its service area. In constructing these capital assets, Pacific Power used its own transportation vehicles and power equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-6\">For general accounting purposes, Pacific Power depreciated the vehicles and equipment employed in constructing the new facilities by using the straight-line method. The useful lives and salvage values of the vehicles and equipment were determined by independent consultants. On its books, Pacific Power allocated the depreciation of its vehicles and equipment to the overall cost of such new facilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-7\">For federal income tax purposes, however, Pacific Power treated the depreciation of the transportation and power equipment differently. In computing its federal tax liability, Pacific Power used the double-declining balance depreciation method,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and determined the useful lives of the vehicles and equipment under the class-life system.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pacific Power, in its income tax returns for the taxable years 1962 through 1966, deducted from gross income the <em>total </em>accelerated depreciation attributable to the transportation and power equipment, which deduction included the depreciation attributable to the equipments\u2019 use in constructing Pacific Power\u2019s capital facilities. The Internal Revenue Service assessed tax deficiencies on the ground that the depreciation of the transportation and power equipment used to construct such new facilities should have been capitalized under I.R.C. \u00a7 263(a)(1). Pacific Power paid the assessment under protest and subsequently filed this action against the government to recover payment of tax assessments totaling $225,954.74. The United States District Court for the District of Oregon on May 25, 1979 entered final judgment dismissing Pacific Power\u2019s complaint and taxpayer appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-15\">In <em>Idaho Power, </em>which we believe controls the disposition of this case, the Court held that \u201cthe equipment depreciation allo-cable to taxpayer\u2019s construction of [its own] capital facilities is to be capitalized.\u201d 418 U.S. at 19, 94 S.Ct. at 2767. In reaching this conclusion the Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a5j-dedup-0\">the exhaustion of construction equipment does not represent the final disposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>the taxpayer\u2019s investment in that equipment; rather, the investment in the equipment is assimilated into the cost of the capital asset constructed. Construction-related depreciation on the equipment is not an expense to the taxpayer of its day-to-day business. It is, however, appropriately recognized as a part of the taxpayer\u2019s cost or investment in the capital asset.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">418 U.S. at 13-14, 94 S.Ct. at 2764-2765.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">In <em>Idaho Power, </em>the Court considered the interrelationship between I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 263,161, 261, arid 167, which also apply to this case. I.R.C. \u00a7\u25a0 263(a)(1) disallows deductions for \u201c[a]ny amount paid out\u201d by a taxpayer for construction or permanent improvement of its facilities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the Court pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANU\">The purpose of \u00a7 263 is to reflect the basic principle that a capital expenditure may not be deducted from current income. It serves to prevent a taxpayer from utilizing currently a deduction properly attributable, through amortization, to later tax years when the capital asset becomes income producing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1436-6\">418 U.S. at 16, 94 S.Ct. at 2766. Although I.R.C. \u00a7 167(a) allows a depreciation deduction for \u201cexhaustion, wear and tear\u201d of property used in the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business, the Court interpreted I.R.C. \u00a7 161<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u00a7 261<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to require that \u00a7 263(a) take precedence over \u00a7 167(a). Thus, \u201can expenditure incurred in acquiring capital assets must be capitalized even when the expenditure otherwise might be deemed deductible under [\u00a7 167(a)].\u201d 418 U.S. at 17, 94 S.Ct. at 2766.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-7\">Finally, the Court in <em>Idaho Power </em>voiced its concern for maintaining tax-parity. A taxpayer who pays an independent contractor to construct a capital facility would have to capitalize <em>all </em>of the construction-related depreciation costs charged to it by the contractor. The Court thus concluded that the same complete capitalization should result when a taxpayer builds its own capital facilities \u2014 i. e., that there should be no tax advantage for such self-construction. 418 U.S. at 14, 94 S.Ct. at 2765.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-13\">Before the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Idaho Power, </em>Pacific Power, in its federal income tax returns, claimed a depreciation deduction for the <em>full </em>amount of accelerated depreciation of its transportation and power equipment used to construct its own capital facilities. Thus, for federal tax purposes, Pacific Power did not capitalize any of such depreciation. Its <em>pre-Idaho Power </em>stance was therefore identical to the position explicitly rejected by the Court in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-14\">In the instant suit, Pacific Power assumes the following fail-back position. It asserts that to give effect to Congress\u2019s policy to encourage investment in depreciable assets by providing an accelerated depreciation deduction, a taxpayer using its own equipment to construct its own capital facilities should be permitted to deduct from gross income the difference between accelerated and straight-line depreciation. Pacific Power contends that in <em>Idaho Power </em>the Court did not consider what <em>measure </em>of depreciation should be used when capitalizing depreciation for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 263(a)(1). Accordingly, Pacific Power argues that the rule of <em>Idaho Power </em>is met by allocating to the construction costs of capital facilities a sum representing straight-line depreciation of the equipment used. Pacific Power uses this method for general accounting purposes and argues that it reflects the actual costs incurred in connection with construction of its capital facilities. In short, taxpayer argues that, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>further congressional policy, it should be entitled to deduct from gross income the difference between straight-line and double-declining balance depreciation. To adopt Pacific Power\u2019s position would result in bifurcating the depreciation of equipment used by taxpayers to construct their own capital facilities: straight-line depreciation would be capitalized and deducted over the life of the capital facility constructed, whereas the excess of double-declining balance over straight-line depreciation would be deducted as a current business expense under I.R.C. \u00a7 167(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">The government asserts that <em>Idaho Power, </em>where taxpayer computed depreciation under both the straight-line and declining balance methods, 418 U.S. at 5, 94 S.Ct. at 2760, controls the disposition of this case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">Although Pacific Power presents an ingenious argument, one best presented to Congress, we find the reasoning and reach of <em>Idaho Power </em>to be dispositive of taxpayer\u2019s contentions. As the Court stated in <em>Idaho Power:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-7\">To be sure, the 1954 Code provided for new and accelerated methods for depreciation, resulting in the greater depreciation deductions currently available. These changes, however, relate primarily to computation of depreciation. Congress certainly did not intend that provisions for accelerated depreciation should be construed as enlarging the class of depre-ciable assets to which \u00a7 167(a) has application or as lessening the reach of \u00a7 263(a). See Note 1973 Duke L.J. 1386.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"agc-dedup-0\">418 U.S. at 18-19, 94 S.Ct. at 2767.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-8\">We hold that where any equipment depreciation must be capitalized under I.R.C. \u00a7 263(a)(1), no part of such depreciation may, be deducted under I.R.C. \u00a7 167(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1434-14\">.
