Plaintiffs appeal both these rulings. We affirm.

Ruff, 292 </em>U.S. 25, 54 S.Ct. 608, 78 L.Ed. 1099 (1934), some courts permitted removal by a federal court appointed receiver only if such suits were based upon the receiver\u2019s personal wrongdoing. Other courts also allowed removal based on negligence in the operation of the debtor\u2019s business where the receiver\u2019s liability was entirely vicarious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-17\">Appellants contend that <em>Gay v. Ruff, supra, </em>prohibits removal here. Although the Supreme Court in <em>Gay v. Ruff </em>somewhat restricted the removability by federal receivers under \u00a7 33 of the Judicial Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it did not hold that receivers are not within the ambit of said statute. Ruff brought suit in state court against Gay, as receiver of a railway company. The cause of action alleged was wrongful death resulting from the negligent operation of a train by employees of the receiver. The defendant receiver contended that the case was removable because he was an officer of the federal court and a damage action resulting from the negligent operation of a train by his employees was a suit \u201cfor or on account of\u201d an \u201cact done in the performance of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>duties as such officer.\u201d The Court rejected his argument stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-5\">The receiver here sued, although an officer of the court operating the railroad pursuant to the order appointing him, is not an officer engaged in enforcing an order of a court. The operation of trains through his employees is a duty imposed upon the receiver; but he is not entrusted in his capacity as receiver with the service or execution of any process of the court. Nor is there reason to assume that he will in this ease rest his defense on his duty to cause the train to be operated. 292 U.S. at 39, 54 S.Ct. at 615.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">Thus, the result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gay v. Ruff </em>is that removal by a federal court appointed receiver is proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a) when the plaintiff is challenging the receiver\u2019s personal dereliction in the execution of the Court\u2019s orders or judgments but not when the receiver is negligent in performing duties not entrusted to him by the courts. <em>Id. </em>at 35 and 39, 54 S.Ct. at 613 and 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-7\">This distinction drawn by the Supreme Court is the result of construing \u00a7 1442 in light of the federal interest served in providing for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-8\">The general policy underlying federal removal legislation is to permit removal when there is a federal interest in allowing access to a federal forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-9\">This policy is translated into legislation with respect to court officers in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(3), wherein removal is permitted by an officer of the courts \u201cfor any Act under color of office or in the performance of his duties.\u201d Given that the above quoted phrase is included in the statute, and viewing it in light of the underlying general policy, it is reasonable to conclude that such provision restricts or clarifies the types of cases that are removable by a federal court officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-10\">Where, a here, a plaintiff is challenging a receiver\u2019s personal dereliction of court imposed duties and complaining of a receiver\u2019s conduct before the appointing federal court, the issues and defenses to be tried would involve an examination of the duties and obligations of the receiver as ordered by the appointing federal court. As such, the acts of the receiver in issue are directly under color of office or in the performance of court imposed duties. Since an examination of the receiver\u2019s acts directly involves an examination of the appointing federal court\u2019s orders, there is a strong federal interest in providing federal court access.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-12\">In contrast, where an action only involves state law and the receiver is only charged with vicarious wrongdoing, as in <em>Gay v. Ruff, supra, </em>the receiver\u2019s liability is not directly based upon his acts done under color of office or in the performance of his court ordered duties. Accordingly, the nexus between the federal court orders and the charge of wrongdoing is so attenuated that federal court access is not necessary to protect any federal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-13\">We therefore, hold that removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(3) was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-14\">A similar construction has been made with respect to \u00a7 1442(a)(1), which allows removal by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-15\">(1) Any officer of the United States or any agency thereof, or person acting under him, for any act under color of such office or on account of any right, title or authority claimed under any Act of Congress for the apprehension or punishment of criminals or the collection of the revenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-16\">The requirement of \u201cany act under color of such office\u201d has been construed as requiring a causal connection between the \u25a0charged conduct and the official authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-17\">In <em>Willingham v. Morgan, </em>395 U.S. 402, 89 S.Ct. 1813, 23 L.Ed.2d 396 (1969) the Supreme Court addressed the issue of re-movability under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1) in a tort action by a federal prisoner against the warden. Speaking for the Court, Justice Marshall stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-18\">In a civil suit of this nature, we think it was sufficient for petitioners to have shown that their relationship to respondent derived solely from their official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>duties. Past cases have interpreted the \u201ccolor of office\u201d test to require a showing of a \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the charged conduct and asserted official authority. <em>Maryland v. Soper (No. 1), supra </em>[270 U.S. 9], at 33 [46 S.Ct. 185 at 190-191, 70 L.Ed. 449].... In this case, once petitioners had shown that their only contact with respondent occurred inside the penitentiary, while they were performing their duties, we believe that they had demonstrated the required \u201ccausal connection.\u201d 395 U.S. at 409, 89 S.Ct. at 1817 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">Appellants next contend that not all of the defendants joined in the removal petition and therefore it was error to deny remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">The general procedural removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(a), provides that \u201ca defendant or defendants\u201d desiring to remove any action from the state court shall file a petition in the federal district court within which such action is pending. As a general rule, all defendants who may properly join in the removal petition must join. <em>Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>178 U.S. 245, 20 S.Ct. 854, 44 L.Ed. 1055 (1900); <em>Tri-Cities Newspapers v. Tri-Cities Printing Pressmen and Assistants\u2019 Local 349, </em>427 F.2d 325 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a) provides a right of removal independent of U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, for federal officers and, unlike the general \u00a7 1441 removal statute, is not keyed to the original jurisdiction of the federal district court. Section 1442(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-11\">(a) A civil action or criminal prosecution commenced in a State court against any of the following persons may be removed <em>by them </em>to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-12\">sfc $ sfc ifc $ s);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-13\">(3) Any officer of the courts of the United States, for any Act under color of office or in the performance of his duties ... (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-14\">Section 1441 sets out, <em>inter alia, </em>actions which are generally removable: actions over which the district courts have original jurisdiction by statute, federal question or diversity jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Courts have made a distinction in interpreting \u00a7\u00a7 1442 and 1441. While \u00a7 1441, as in \u00a7 1446(a), provides for removal \u201cby the defendant or the defendants,\u201d \u00a7 1442(a) uses the language, emphasized above, of removal \u201cby them,\u201d which refers to the federal officers listed in subsection (3), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1390-15\">In <em>Bradford v. Harding, </em>284 F.2d 307 (2d Cir. 1960), the Second Circuit clarified and discussed this distinction between \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1442:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>Whereas \u00a7 1441 provides for removal \u201cby the defendant or the defendants,\u201d \u00a7 1442 uses the more ambiguous \u201cby them.\u201d Moreover, it [\u00a7 1442,] rests upon far stronger considerations of policy.. . ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-5\">When an action of the sort specified in \u00a7 1442 is brought against a federal officer and others, even the most literal reading would permit the federal officer alone to remove. . . . For \u201cby them\u201d means \u201cby any of the following persons\u201d and the defendants who are not federal officers are not such persons. Moreover, the policy of the section would be frustrated if a plaintiff or a prosecutor, by joining non-federal defendants with no desire to remove, could retain the suit in a tribunal that might \u201cadminister not only the laws of the State, but equally Federal law, in such a manner as.to paralyze the operations of the government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-6\">These considerations of policy also require construction in favor of removal where, as here, some persons entitled to join in the removal petition did not. 284 F.2d at 309-310 (footnotes and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">Thus, \u00a7 1442 represents an exception to the general rule (under \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1446) that all defendants must join in the removal petition. Since the federal officer is the only one entitled to remove under \u00a7 1442, he alone can remove without other defendants joining in the petition, and the entire case is removed to the federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-8\">Therefore, we need not reach the issue of whether all of the defendants have joined in the removal petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-9\">Appellants also argue that the failure to post a removal bond by appellees requires this court to remand the case to the Nevada state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-11\">Each petition for removal of a civil action or proceeding, <em>except a petition in behalf of the United States, </em>shall be accompanied by a bond with good and sufficient surety conditioned that the defendant or defendants will pay all costs and disbursements incurred by reason of the removal proceedings should it be determined that the case was not removable or was improperly removed. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">In <em>Sulger v. Pochyla, </em>397 F.2d 173 (9th Cir. 1968), this circuit recognized that officers of the United States (two U. S. Army officers) were not required to post a bond in an action for removal. The Court did note, however, that <em>Sulger </em>involved a situation where \u201cthe United States ha[d] a great deal at stake, to wit, Army officers acting within the scope of their authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-14\">In <em>State of Utah v. Livsey, </em>312 F.Supp. 1397 (D.Utah 1970), the court held that federal reserve agents, sued for acts which occurred while they were performing their duties, were not required to post a bond:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aip\">Suits against federal officers who are sued in their official capacity are within the class of persons \u201cacting under the direction of\u201d a federal department or agency within [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2408, and they need not file a removal bond. 312 F.Supp. at 1399-1400 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-15\">Also, in <em>James River Apartments, Inc. v. Federal Housing Administration, </em>136 F.Supp. 24 (D.Md.1955) it was recognized that the Federal Housing Administration was not required to file a removal bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-16\">The question here is whether a removal petition submitted by a federal court appointed receiver is \u201ca petition in behalf of the United States\u201d so as to be immune from the statutory requirement of filing a bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-17\">Appellee Campini was appointed by the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. Further, all of the violations with which he is charged are orders of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-18\">New cases have discussed whether or not a receiver may be considered an officer of the United States for purposes of exemption from posting a removal bond. However, in <em>Gay v. Ruff, supra, </em>292 U.S. 25, 54 S.Ct. 608, 78 L.Ed. 1099 (1934), while discussing a federal court appointed receiver\u2019s rights regarding removal under the then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>applicable statute, \u00a7 33 of the Judicial Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Justice Brand\u00e9is stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-4\">Where \u00a7 33 is applicable, the conditions for removal are much more liberal. Removal may be had of the civil suit, at any time before trial or final hearing in the state court, regardless of the amount involved and without giving any bond, .. . 292 U.S. at 34, 54 S.Ct. at 612 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">While <em>Gay v. Ruff </em>held removal was improper, it was because the suit was not against the receiver for an act committed in the performance of his duties (see discussion, <em>supra). </em>Where as here the receiver was acting within the scope of his duties it would be proper to consider the petition as made in behalf of the United States and therefore exempt from the bond requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">Therefore, since the district court has removal jurisdiction over the defendant court appointed receiver pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(3), said receiver is exempt from posting a removal bond under \u00a7 1446(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">DISMISSAL FOR LACK OF PROSECUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">The district court granted dismissal for lack of prosecution, which appellants contend was error. The standard on review is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Von Poppenheim v. Portland Boxing &amp; Wrestling Comm., </em>442 F.2d 1047 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">Appellants contend that dismissal was error because it was appellees who caused the delay by petitioning for removal, moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim and failing to file an answer until after the court denied appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-11\">An examination of the record reveals the following: Plaintiffs brought this action in state court in Nevada on October 7, 1964. A removal petition was filed by the defendant receiver on October 16,1964. On October 29, 1964 plaintiffs filed a petition for remand and on December 9, 1964 defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Twelve years later, on December 17, 1976, both the petition for remand and motion to dismiss were denied. Plaintiffs thereafter unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of the denial of their remand petition. On February 9, 1978 defendant receiver filed a motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution, which was granted on September 18, 1-978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-13\">In ordering dismissal, the district court approved the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation in which it was found that there was no activity by counsel from at least December 10,1965 until their presence was requested by the magistrate at a status conference on January 9, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-14\">The record reveals that the district court delayed in ruling on appellants\u2019 remand petition for twelve years. However, during most of that time there was no activity at all by appellants that would indicate any interest in pursuing the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-15\">Although appellants should not be punished for a delay caused by the court, it was unreasonable, under the facts of this case, for appellants to do nothing for twelve years to further their case. Appellants were well aware of their remedy in mandamus as it was a procedure they had previously used. The record indicated that no inquiries at all were made by appellants respecting their remand petition other than a letter dated December 5, 1964 directed to a district judge, who was not sitting on the instant case, informing him of the pending remand motion and requesting that he consider the remand motion and sign an order. of remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-16\">Appellants contend that their failure to contact the court or to take any other action was no more detrimental to the situation than that of appellees, and, therefore, the delay by both counsel should be considered, citing <em>Finley v. Parvin-Dohrmann Co., Inc., </em>520 F.2d 386 (2nd Cir. 1975). In <em>Finley </em>the court affirmed a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution, relying in part on defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>failure to call the court\u2019s attention to a plaintiff\u2019s undue delay in bringing a case on for trial. The Second Circuit held that such failure by defendant \u201cmay be considered as a factor in informing the court\u2019s discretion. Of course, such action by a defendant is not a necessary condition to subsequent dismissal.\u201d 520 F.2d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\"><em>Finley </em>may not be totally supportive of appellants\u2019 instant position. The duty of the appellate court is to decide if the district judge abused his discretion. In <em>Finley </em>the appellate court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss. Furthermore, the Second Circuit said that dismissal is not contingent upon the action by defendant. Given these mitigating factors, <em>Finley </em>does not advance appellants\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">Although delay caused by a defendant may be considered by the court, the primary responsibility for furthering a case is upon the plaintiff and his attorney. <em>Bendix Aviation Corporation v. Glass, </em>32 F.R.D. 375 (E.D.Pa.1962), aff\u2019d per curiam 314 F.2d 944 (3rd Cir. 1963); <em>Tinnerman Products, Inc. v. George K. Garrett Co., Inc., </em>22 F.R.D. 56 (E.D.Pa.1958); S. <em>&amp; K. Airport Drive-In, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distrib. Corp., </em>58 F.R.D. 4 (E.D.Pa.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-7\">In the instant case, it is unclear how appellees\u2019 actions could be considered the cause of delay. Even if they did cause some delay, appellants have not explained how appellees\u2019 actions caused such a delay as to relieve appellants from their responsibility of furthering their suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-8\">In 1979, this Circuit outlined the considerations for ruling on a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-9\">A district court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution requires weighing conflicting policies: on the one hand, the court\u2019s need to manage its docket, the public interest in expeditious resolution of litigation, and the risk of prejudice to defendants from delay; on the other hand, the policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits.. .. Although prejudice to defendants may be presumed from \u201cunreasonable\u201d delay, .. . whether <em>actual </em>prejudice exists may be an important factor in deciding whether a given delay is \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>Citizens Utilities Company v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, </em>595 F.2d 1171, 1174 (9th Cir. 1979) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1393-12\">In applying these principles to the instant case, on one side we have the policy considerations of expeditiously resolving cases and possible prejudice to defendants, and on the other we have the interest in deciding cases on their merits. Appellees have shown actual prejudice in that all of their witnesses, except appellee Campini, are now deceased. Under these circumstances, it is dubious whether a trial on the merits could be fair to appellees. Basic common sense notions of fairness dictate that plaintiff not be rewarded for doing virtually nothing to prosecute their cause for such an extended period of time. As such, it cannot be said that the district court abused its discretion in balancing these policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1388-13\">. Judicial Code \u00a7 33, as amended in 1916 was essentially the same as \u00a7 1442 with respect to officers of the court.
