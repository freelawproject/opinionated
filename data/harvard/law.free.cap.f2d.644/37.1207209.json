The Commission opposes intervention, arguing that NCCB is not an \u201cinterested party\u201d within 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(e) (1976),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the provision of the Communications Act of 1934 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>governing intervention on appeal. It is the Commission\u2019s construction of \u00a7 402(e) that only those who support affirmance of the Commission\u2019s order are permitted to intervene. The Commission also argues that NCCB, because it urges a reversal or modification of the Commission\u2019s order, must file its own appeal pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b) (1976). The Commission has therefore moved to strike NCCB\u2019s Notices of Intent to Intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The Commission\u2019s construction of \u00a7 402(e) is without merit. NCCB, as a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d or \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the Commission\u2019s order, is entitled to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 402(b)(1) and (b)(6).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even though it chose not to appeal, it has sought intervention in the appeals brought in Nos. 80-2556, 80-2566 and 80-2567 in order to protect its interests. The Commission would have us define \u201cinterested person\u201d in \u00a7 402(e) in such a way as to limit intervention to non-aggrieved parties. We reject this interpretation. To accept the Commission\u2019s position would be to render superfluous the first sentence in \u00a7 402(e).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">We hold that one who has standing to file an appeal under \u00a7 402(b) may, instead, intervene pursuant to the first sentence in \u00a7 402(e) in an appeal of the same proceeding brought by another party.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the motions to strike must be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-17\">.
