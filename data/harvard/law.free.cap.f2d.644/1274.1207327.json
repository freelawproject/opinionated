REED, Jr., District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1351-12\">The essential nature of this case is an independent action to set aside a previous judgment as void. The original judgment entered in 1968 resulted from an action filed by the appellant as a result of injuries sustained by him as a seaman aboard a merchant vessel belonging to the United States. As a result of that judgment there were two unsuccessful previous appeals to this court and two unsuccessful petitions for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. In each instance, at every level of our judicial system, appellant\u2019s claims were found to be without merit. He now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his most recent suit filed in 1978. The claim made here is that the dismissal was unwarranted since the original judgment of 1968 should be set aside due to newly discovered evidence and because the United States was improperly defended by Erskine Wood, its insurance company\u2019s counsel. Appellant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-15\">The district court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction under the statutes pleaded by appellant. Federal district courts are dependent for their subject-matter jurisdiction upon statutory authority granted by Congress. <em>Palmore v. United States, </em>411 U.S. 389, 401, 93 S.Ct. 1670, 1678, 36 L.Ed.2d 342 (1973). In his complaint, appellant cites the following statutes as a basis for conferring subject-matter jurisdiction. None of them confers such jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1351-16\">(a) <em>50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1291 </em>confers admiralty jurisdiction over injuries to seamen employed by the War Shipping Administration. The present action is an independent action to set aside a prior judgment and is not an action for relief on account of injuries suffered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1351-17\">(b) <em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202 </em>create additional remedies in the form of declaratory judgment relief for federal litigants, but do not in and of themselves confer subject-matter jurisdiction on the courts. <em>Wells v. United States, </em>280 F.2d 275 (9th Cir. 1960).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1351-18\">(c) <em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 </em>when coupled with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, confer jurisdiction for actions claiming the deprivation of civil rights under the color of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>state law or by conspiracy. No such deprivation has been alleged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-4\">In addition, the Court notes that appellant does not claim that the federal government has denied him his civil rights and thus no jurisdiction exists under the rationale adopted in <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-5\">(d) <em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202, 205, 208,1001 and 1008 </em>define crimes under federal law and do not confer civil subject-matter jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">Perhaps, under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the district court might have obtained jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s claim for relief because of newly discovered evidence or the claim (if the complaint can be so read) that the prior judgment was obtained through extrinsic or intrinsic fraud. Such basis for jurisdiction was not pleaded by appellant and, in any event, is time barred by the statute of limitations contained in the rule. Under Rule 60(b) a court may, within one year of its judgment, reconsider a judgment in such circumstances. Appellant\u2019s claims are clearly made beyond the time frame contemplated by this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">In the alternative, it might be contended that appellant\u2019s action should be allowed under the statute of limitations \u201csaving clause\u201d at the end of Rule 60(b). That clause excepts, from the one-year limitation, an equitable action to set aside a judgment because of \u201cfraud upon the court.\u201d However, the factual underpinnings of the complaint do not allege a \u201cfraud upon the court\u201d as this phrase has been interpreted. \u201cFraud upon the court\u201d as a basis for equitable relief is construed narrowly in order to preserve the finality of judgments, an important legal and social interest. <em>See, Valerio v. Boise Cascade Corp., </em>80 F.R.D. 626, 640-642 (N.D.Cal.1978); <em>Toscano v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>441 F.2d 930, 934 (9th Cir. 1971). Fraud of this nature is the exception and confers equitable jurisdiction on a court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-8\">Where the unsuccessful party has been prevented from exhibiting fully his case, by fraud or deception practiced on him by his opponent, as by keeping him away from court, a false promise of a compromise; or where the defendant never had knowledge of the suit, being kept in ignorance by the acts of the plaintiff; or where the attorney fraudulently or without authority assumes to represent a party and connives at his defeat; or where the attorney corruptly sells out his client\u2019s interest to the other side. . . <em>United States v. Throckmorton, </em>98 U.S. 61, 65-66, 25 L.Ed. 93 (1878).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">The concern of the court in <em>Throckmorton </em>and its progeny was that because of this type of fraud, the injured party is prevented from fairly presenting his claim or defenses or from introducing relevant or material evidence. <em>Id, </em>at 66; <em>see also </em>7 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>Second Edition, \u00a7 60.37 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">The fraud alleged by appellant is not the type contemplated by the extraordinary remedy of an independent action to set aside a judgment. The record and the facts presented herein do not justify relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-12\">In this case, a claim for relief based upon \u201cfraud upon the court\u201d would have to be grounded in appellant\u2019s claim that the United States was not properly represented. Appellant admits that three attorneys of record for the Government in the original action (the United States Attorney for Oregon and his assistant; and an attorney for the admiralty and shipping section of the Department of Justice) were properly authorized to represent the Government, signed all pleadings for the Government and were served with all pleadings by appellant. He nevertheless argues that since Erskine B. Wood, the insurance company attorney, conducted the majority of the litigation, the case constituted a \u201cfraud upon the court\u201d. Mr. Wood was never specifically appointed by the Attorney General to represent the United States pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 515. Appellant asserts that attorneys appointed under that statute are subject to a higher standard of conduct than that imposed upon private attorneys and that his higher standard of conduct is essential when dealing with seamen\u2019s claims be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>cause they are wards of admiralty and as such an additional fiduciary duty attaches to the representatives of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">We find that appellant\u2019s allegations, even when viewed in a light most favorable to him, do not rise to the level of a fraud upon the court on the basis of which an independent action to set aside the original judgment might be founded. While it was true that Mr. Wood was not appointed in the context of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 515, his representation was lawful since it was provided for by 31 C.F.R. 5125, \u00a7 10, under the authority of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114. That regulation allows the United States to insure its vessels through private insurance companies, which in turn are permitted to litigate claims covered by the policies obtained by the government. Since the claims of the insurance company and those of the United States were coincidental, it cannot be said that Wood\u2019s representation was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">Furthermore, appellant\u2019s claims that an alleged fiduciary duty owed to seamen as wards of admiralty, coupled with the higher ethical standards imposed on Government attorneys, would have affected the outcome of his case are unfounded. Seamen as wards of admiralty are wards of the court, not the Executive Branch of the government. Furthermore, any such relationship that might be claimed to exist with the executive would be extinguished once the seamen brought suit against the United States [Bee, <em>Norris, The Law of Seamen. </em>Volume I, Chapter 24, page 593 <em>et seq., </em>Sections 501, 503, and 512].</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">Appellant\u2019s attempted distinction between representation of the United States by an attorney appointed under the statute and representation by the insurance company based upon a claimed higher standard of conduct imposed upon the former is also without merit. Attorneys so situated would be required to defend against the same claim. At all times the government was represented by its own attorneys appointed pursuant to the statute. Mr. Wood was \u201cof counsel\u201d to the government as noted by all pleadings and always under the supervision of the government\u2019s attorneys. His representation under the circumstances does not amount to a fraud on the court, i. e., \u201c. .. a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery can not perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication.\u201d <em>Keys v. Dunbar, </em>405 F.2d 955 (9th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied </em>396 U.S. 880, 90 S.Ct. 158, 24 L.Ed.2d 138 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">Appellant\u2019s allegation of newly discovered and previously intentionally concealed evidence, as a basis for avoiding the prior judgment, has already been considered by this court in one of appellant\u2019s prior appeals. Lut<em>trell v. United States, et al, A</em>ppeal No. 71-2640, Orders of 3/23/72 and 5/23/72. No reason exists to disturb these prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">Appellant, in reality, seeks to relitigate the same claims he presented in 1968, 1970 and 1971. Only extraordinary bases would justify the district court setting aside the prior judgments. Such bases do not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-11\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
