The Telephone Company opposed the government\u2019s petition, and Tuccio sought to intervene and stay enforcement, on the ground that the Telephone Company is a third-party recordkeeper within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 7609, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609 (1976). The district court, Jacob Mishler, then-Chief Judge, ruled that the Telephone Company is not a third-party recordkeeper within the meaning of that section, and accordingly denied Tuccio\u2019s motion to intervene and ordered compliance with the summons. 80-1 U.S.Tax Cas. 19460 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 1980). For the reasons below, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">The facts relevant to the present appeal are not in dispute. The IRS is conducting an investigation with respect to Tuccio\u2019s tax liabilities for the years 1976 and 1977. As part of that investigation, on May 1, 1979, IRS issued an administrative summons to the Telephone Company pursuant to \u00a7 7602, ordering its business office supervisor to appear on May 18, 1979, and to bring with him \u201c[a]ll records of billing and payments regarding all telephones in the name of Patsy (Pat) Tuccio and/or Shanda Tuccio . .. for the years 1976 &amp; 1977.\u201d The summons stated that \u201call records [are] to include unlisted or non-published telephone numbers.\u201d On May 2, IRS notified Tuccio of the summons, pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 7609. That section requires the IRS to give such notice when it serves a summons on a \u201cthird-party recordkeeper\u201d \u2014 a term defined to include persons who extend credit through devices such as credit cards, \u00a7 7609(a)(3)(C) \u2014 if the summons requires the production of records concerning transactions of a person other than the record-keeper; such other person is then allowed to stay compliance by the recordkeeper and to intervene in any enforcement proceedings. On May 9,1979, Tuccio instructed the Telephone Company, pursuant to \u00a7 7609, not to comply with the summons. The Telephone Company has followed Tuccio\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">The present proceeding to enforce the summons was instituted by the government in January 1980. The petition stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alk\">[t]he testimony, books, records, papers and other data demanded by the summons relate to the liabilities under investigation, and might shed light on the correctness of the taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax returns, his correct tax liability, or his liability for the 50% fraud penalty of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6653(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-13\">The Telephone Company opposed the petition on the ground that the Company extends credit by means of credit cards and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>other billing practices, and is thus a third-party recordkeeper within the meaning of. \u00a7 7609(aX3)(C), and that it had been duly notified by Tuccio not to permit examination of records concerning him. Tuccio shortly sought to intervene, contending that the records sought were not relevant to his tax liability for the years in question, since he had not claimed any deduction for telephone expenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">The threshold issue before the district court was whether the Telephone Company qualified as a third-party recordkeeper under \u00a7 7609(a)(3)(C). The government sought to repudiate the \u00a7 7609 notice it had given Tuccio, claiming that notice had been \u201cincorrectly given.\u201d It argued that the Telephone Company \u201cis in fact not a third-party recordkeeper,\u201d and that Tuccio therefore was not entitled to receive notice, to intervene, or to stay compliance. The district court agreed, holding that \u00a7 7609(a)(3)(C) contemplates only \u201ctrue credit transactions,\u201d and therefore includes \u201conly those who finance the taxpayer\u2019s transactions with others.\u201d 80-1 U.S.Tax Cas. 19460 at 84,255. Ruling that the Telephone Company\u2019s dealings with its customers are not true credit transactions, the district court denied Tuccio\u2019s motion to intervene and ordered enforcement of the summons. Both Tuccio and the Telephone Company have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">The IRS has long had broad power, pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 7602 and its predecessors, to issue administrative summonses to examine any books, papers, records or other data that may be relevant or material to an inquiry into compliance with the internal revenue laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It has not only the right to obtain records held by the taxpayer, but also the power to summon, question, and require production from \u201cany person\u201d who holds records \u201crelating to the business of the person liable for the tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7602.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 7602 has been construed to codify a broad testimonial obligation to provide most relevant, nonprivileged evidence. <em>See United States v. Euge, </em>444 U.S. 707, 100 S.Ct. 874, 63 L.Ed.2d 141 (1980) (section gives IRS authority to compel execution of handwriting exemplars). The. issuance of a summons pursuant to the section is permitted without any advance showing of probable cause, <em>United States v. Powell, </em>379 U.S. 48, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964), and is circumscribed principally by concepts of relevance and materiality. A summons believed to demand records not relevant or material to the particular inquiry may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>challenged on that ground by the holder of the records. <em>Reisman v. Caplin, </em>375 U.S. 440, 84 S.Ct. 508, 11 L.Ed.2d 459 (1964). Until 1976, however, a person whose tax liability was under investigation, but who was not the recordkeeper, had no power to prevent compliance with a summons that called for irrelevant or immaterial records, since he was not allowed to intervene in a compliance proceeding. See <em>Donaldson v. United States, </em>400 U.S. 517, 528-30, 91 S.Ct. 534, 541-42, 27 L.Ed.2d 580 (1971) (upholding discretionary denial of intervention under F.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2)). Indeed, the taxpayer often was not even aware of the summons in time to attempt to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">In 1976, Congress enacted \u00a7 7609 as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub.L.No. 94-455, 90 Stat. 1520 (1976), to provide certain checks on IRS\u2019s use of third-party summonses. While explicitly recognizing the importance of the third-party summons as an IRS investigative device, the congressional committees responsible for drafting \u00a7 7609 were concerned that \u201cthe use of this important investigative tool should not unreasonably infringe on the civil rights of taxpayers, including the right to privacy.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.94-658,- 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 307, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2897, 3203; S.Rep.No.94-938, 94th Cong. 2d Sess. 368, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3439, 3797. Recognizing that the third-party could raise questions as to relevance and other issues bearing on the privacy rights of the person to whom the records pertained, the legislators nonetheless concluded that those issues often would be less vigorously pursued by the third-party than by the person whose interests were at stake:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-14\">While the third-party witness also has this right of challenge, even under present law, the interest of the third-party witness in protecting the privacy of the records in question is frequently far less intense than that of the person to whom the records pertain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-15\">H.Rep.No.94-658, supra; S.Rep.No.94-938, <em>supra, </em>at 368-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-16\">The solution, embodied in \u00a7 7609, was to require IRS to give prompt notice to the person to whom the records pertain, and to allow that person to stay production of the records by the third-party and to intervene in any court proceeding for enforcement of the summons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The new procedure was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>designed to give the taxpayer new substantive rights, but only to provide an early opportunity for him, as the person with the greatest interest in protecting the existing substantive rights, to secure recognition of those rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> H.Rep.No.94-658, <em>supra, </em>at 309; S.Rep.No.94-938, <em>supra, </em>at 370. <em>See United States v. Chemical Bank, </em>593 F.2d 451, 458 (2d Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">As finally enacted, \u00a7 7609 contains a detailed definition of \u201cthird-party recordkeep-ers.\u201d \u00a7 7609(a)(3). The definition, set forth in full in the margin,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> lists six categories of persons, including any attorneys or accountants, certain brokers, banking institutions, and consumer reporting agencies, and, the category at issue in the present case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-6\">any person extending credit through the use of credit cards or similar devices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">\u00a7 7609(aX3)(C). The statute does not define the terms \u201ccredit cards\u201d and \u201csimilar devices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-15\">The Telephone Company argues that it fits well within the above category for several reasons: first, because it extends credit through the use of credit cards; second, because certain of its policies, including that of permitting customers to place a call from one billing number to a second number and to have the charges billed to a third number, constitute the extension of credit through a device similar to a credit card; and third, because its policy of billing customers for telephone charges one month in arrears is also an extension of credit through a device similar to a credit card. While we reject the third argument<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and are skeptical about the second,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we find merit in the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-16\">For more than four decades, customers of the Telephone Company have been able to procure a credit card that enables them to charge the cost of telephone calls to a credit account rather than, for example, paying cash from coin telephones or charging such calls to the party being called. A credit card call is placed simply by informing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>telephone operator that that is desired and by providing the number of the credit card account. Tuccio has had a Telephone Company credit card since 1971. While most Telephone Company credit cardholders are subscribers to regular telephone service and have their credit account numbers keyed to their telephone numbers, credit cards are issued also to nonsubscribers. In the latter cases, as well as other cases less obvious, the credit card account number is not reflective of the owner\u2019s telephone number. The Telephone Company reviews applications for credit cards with a view to the quality of the credit risk, especially when the applicant is not a subscriber to telephone service. In some cases deposits are required. Charges for calls made by means of the credit card are billed at the end of each month, and the total charges are then due and payable. There is no finance or interest charge on these accounts, but there is an extra charge over the normal point-to-point rates for a call charged to a credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The Telephone Company is not always the provider of the services for which payment is arranged through its credit card. The credit card may be used to make calls not only on the Telephone Company\u2019s own lines, but as well on lines of other companies within the Bell System, on lines of any other domestic company outside the Bell System, such as General Telephone and Electronics, and on lines of many overseas telephone companies. Thus the cardholder may deal with another telephone company whose charges will be collected from the Telephone Company, and the latter will then bill the holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">On the basis of these facts we conclude that the Telephone Company extends credit by means of credit cards, and is thus a \u201cthird-party recordkeeper\u201d within the plain meaning of \u00a7 7609(a)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">We find nothing in the legislative history of \u00a7 7609 to deflect us from this conclusion. The version of \u00a7 7609 originally introduced in the House of Representatives did not use the term \u201cthird-party recordkeeper.\u201d It provided that if a summons was served on \u201cany person,\u201d seeking records relating to the business or transaction of any other specified person, that other person was entitled to notice. H.R.10612, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 1211 (1976). The Senate sought to amend the bill in several respects, one of which narrowed the scope of the notice requirement by limiting \u201cany person\u201d to those in the business of making or keeping records of the business transactions or affairs of other persons. Thus, the Senate amendment provided that if a summons was served on</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-8\">any person whose business consists, in whole or in part, of making or keeping records of the business transactions or affairs of other persons,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACtL\">and the summons sought records of the business or transactions of any such other person, such other person was entitled to notice. H.R.10612 as amended by Senate, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 1205 (1976). The Senate Report stated that for purposes of these notice requirements \u201ca third party recordkeeper is generally to be a person engaged in making or keeping the records involving transactions of other persons.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> S.Rep.94-938, <em>supra, </em>at 369. The Report indicated, although the language did not then appear in the bill or the amendment, that third-party recordkeepers would include banks, brokerage houses, accountants and others. <em>Id. </em>In the conference to reconcile the differences between the House bill and the Senate amendment, it was decided to insert in the statute language to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aus-dedup-0\">clariffy] the definition of a third-party recordkeeper, limiting this category to attorneys, accountants, banks, trust companies, credit unions, savings and loan insti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>tutions, credit reporting agencies, issuers of credit cards, and brokers in stock or other securities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">House Conf.Rpt.No. 94-1515, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 486, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2897, 4118, 4190. While we agree with the government that this sequence resulted in a narrowing of the third-party class, nothing demonstrates an intention that the term \u201cperson extending credit through credit cards or similar devices\u201d be construed so narrowly as to exclude a person such as the Telephone Company, operating as described above.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">So far as we are aware, other judicial interpretations of this provision are consistent with our own. For example, in <em>United States v. New England Telephone Co., </em>No. 79-60-L (D.N.H. Feb. 29, 1980), the court held that the issuance of telephone company credit cards similar to those issued here qualified a telephone company as a third-party recordkeeper. In <em>United States v. Desert Palace Inc. d/b/a Caesars Palace, </em>1979-1 U.S.Tax Cas. \u00b69296 (D.Nev. Mar. 12, 1979), the court held that the credit cards issued by Caesars Palace to some customers brought that establishment within \u00a7 7609(aX3)(C). The reasoning and results of cases such as <em>United States v. Manchel, Lundy and Lessin, </em>477 F.Supp. 326 (E.D.Pa.1979); <em>United States v. Exxon Co., </em>450 F.Supp. 472 (D.Md.1978); and <em>United States v. Connecticut Motor Club, </em>79-1 U.S.Tax Cas. \u00b69141 (D.Conn. Dec. 13, 1978), are not to the contrary. In <em>Exxon, </em>IRS sought production of records relating to Exxon\u2019s lease of real property from the taxpayer. The court noted that although Exxon did indeed extend credit by means of credit cards issued to motorists, the summons was directed to Exxon other than in its capacity as an extender of credit, and hence \u00a7 7609 did not apply. The court noted that had the taxpayer been a credit cardholder whose credit records were sought, \u00a7 7609 would have been applicable. <em>Cf. United States v. Ohio Bell Telephone Company, </em>475 F.Supp. 697, 699 (N.D.Ohio 1978); <em>id. </em>at n.2. In <em>Manchel, Lundy and Lessin, </em>the IRS summons was directed to a law firm, and the taxpayer sought to invoke \u00a7 7609(aX3)(E), which includes \u201cany attorney.\u201d The firm, however, had not acted as attorney to the taxpayer; it had merely been his employer. The court held that the firm was not summoned in its capacity as an \u201cattorney\u201d within the contemplation of the definition of \u201cthird-party recordkeeper.\u201d <em>Accord: United States v. White Agency, </em>79-1 U.S.Tax Cas. \u00b69300 (W.D.Mich. March 20, 1979), <em>adopting </em>Magistrate\u2019s recommendation reported at 79-1 U.S.Tax Cas. 19265 (insurance agency that was also a licensed broker summoned only in its insurance agency capacity, not as a broker: <em>held, </em>not a third-party recordkeeper under \u00a7 7609(aX3)(D); <em>United States v. J. Joseph Gartland, Inc., </em>79 F.R.D. 148 (D.Md.1978) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>(\u00a7 7609 inapplicable where recordkeeper was merely a company that did business with taxpayer).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">New of the government\u2019s arguments, insofar as they are not dealt with above, merit extended discussion. The fact that one need not physically present a telephone credit card in order to charge \u00e1 telephone call does not necessarily distinguish it from credit cards whose issuers the government concedes are third-party recordkeepers. For example, with a Visa or American Express card, one can telephone any number of establishments and obtain goods or services on credit merely by reciting the account number on the card. Nor do we find any merit in the government\u2019s contention that a restricted interpretation of \u00a7 7609(a)(3)(C) is mandated by analogy to the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601-93 (1976), which defines a credit card as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afb\">any card, plate, coupon book or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor or services on credit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(k). First, we note that had Congress intended to import this definition into subsection (C) of the third-party recordkeeper definition, it would undoubtedly have done so explicitly: in subsections (A), (B), and (D) it cross-referenced to four other statutory provisions in defining banks, credit unions, consumer reporting agencies, and brokers. Second, even the TILA definition includes cards and \u201cother credit device[s],\u201d and hence does not appear to narrow the field. Finally, .there is no reason to believe that the thrust of \u00a7 7609 was the same as that of the Truth in Lending Act, since \u00a7 7609 was intended generally \u201cto protect the rights of taxpayers <em>vis a vis </em>the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d H.R. Rep.No. 94-658, <em>supra, </em>16. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No. 94-938, <em>supra, </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">In light of the credit card operations of the Telephone Company as described above, the fact that Tuccio is a credit cardholder, and the fact that the summons is broad enough to include records relating to Tuc-cio\u2019s credit card transactions, we conclude that \u00a7 7609 was applicable and that Tuccio should have been allowed to intervene in the compliance proceeding. We therefore vacate the judgment granting enforcement of the summons, and remand for consideration of Tuccio\u2019s relevancy arguments and for such other proceedings as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">. Tuccio\u2019s brief on appeal indicates that Tuccio did claim a deduction of $50 for telephone charges in 1977, but that as his return showed a negative income for the year, his tax liability would not be affected even if this deduction were completely disallowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">.

Anticipating that there might be circumstances in which notification might endanger the continued existence of the evidence sought, Congress provided in \u00a7 7609(g) that where there \u201cis reasonable cause to believe the giving of notice may lead to attempts to conceal, destroy, or alter records relevant to the examination,\u201d or to prevent a witness from testifying or producing records, the notice provisions of the statute do not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">. Section 7609(a)(3) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-12\">(3) Third-party recordkeeper defined. \u2014 For purposes of this subsection, the term \u201cthird-party recordkeeper\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-13\">(A) any mutual savings bank, cooperative bank, domestic building and loan association, or other savings institution chartered and supervised as a savings and loan or similar association under Federal or State law, any bank (as defined in section 581), or any credit union (within the meaning of section 501(c)(14)(A));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-14\">(B) any consumer reporting agency (as defined under section 603(d) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-17\">(C) any person extending credit through the use of credit cards or similar devices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-18\">(D) any broker (as defined in section 3(a)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-19\">(E) any attorney; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-20\">(F) any accountant.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1033-21\">. While we consider the practice of billing in arrears to be an extension of credit, in the sense that service is given for which it is agreed that payment will be made at a later date, it is not a practice that requires or uses credit cards or devices similar to credit cards. We view the phrase \u201cthrough the use of credit cards or similar devices\u201d as words of limitation rather than as mere exemplification. To hold that the Telephone Company is a third-party recordkeeper by virtue of its \u201carrears\u201d policy would, we believe, read this limiting phrase out of Congress\u2019s definition, and open the category to persons not even arguably within the contemplation of Congress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1033-22\">. These other practices present a closer question. They share some, but not all, of the characteristics of the credit card transactions and capabilities. Since we find the Telephone Company is a third-party recordkeeper because of its issuance of credit cards, we decline to reach the merits of this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">. We reject the government\u2019s argument that the Telephone Company is not within the intended scope of \u00a7 7609 because it keeps records of its own transactions with the taxpayer rather than the taxpayer\u2019s transactions with others. Even if the language of this report could limit the plain terms that were eventually inserted in the statute, we observe that telephone companies, much like banks, routinely keep records of their customers\u2019 dealings with others. Indeed, given the lack of claimed deductions for telephone expenses by Tuccio, it appears that IRS is interested in Tuccio\u2019s telephone contacts with other persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">. It is perhaps noteworthy that our reading of \u00a7 7609(a)(3)(C) comports with the original interpretation of that section adopted by IRS. In July 1978, IRS issued a Manual Supplement concerning <em>Changes in the Use of the Administrative Summons Resulting From the Tax Reform Act of 1976. </em>Section 3.02 of the Supplement contained the following discussion of the term \u201cthird-party recordkeeper\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-8\">The procedures in IRC Section 7609 apply generally to situations in which the record-keeper makes or keeps records of the business transactions or affairs of a person identified in the description of the records contained in the summons. All persons who extend \u201ccredit through the use of credit cards or similar devices\u201d fall within the scope of these procedures notwithstanding the fact that the principal business of that person may be something other than the issuing of credit cards. For example, <em>telephone companies </em>and others such as retail stores and oil companies <em>who extend credit through their own credit cards would be considered \"third-party recordkeepers.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFN\">Consistent with this interpretation, IRS served \u00a7 7609 notices on the present taxpayer and on others; and in at least one enforcement proceeding it described the New York Telephone Company as a third-party recordkeeper. <em>United States v. Knickerbocker Federal Savings and Loan Ass\u2019n, et al., </em>No. M-18-304 (S.D.N.Y.1979). In the present case, as noted above, IRS has recanted this interpretation. An IRS manual of course does not have the effect of law, especially where, as here, the issue concerns the applicability of federal law. <em>See Carpenter v. United States, </em>495 F.2d 175 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Adler v. Commissioner, </em>330 F.2d 91 (9th Cir. 1964). Nevertheless, we find the prelitigation interpretive statements of the agency charged with carrying out the law to be informative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
