After consideration of the briefs and arguments, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-21\">Appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to establish a knowing and purposeful use of the mails in the operation of his allegedly fraudulent home repair business. All of the victims who testified at trial had contacted appellant as a result of advertisements he had placed in two newspapers which were mailed to some 12,-000 subscribers in addition to carrier deliveries. The advertisements, some of which appellant should reasonably have known would be sent through the mails, were the primary means of soliciting customers and constituted an integral part of the fraudulent scheme. We believe that this use of the mails was sufficient to sustain a conviction under the statute, and the fact that the victims who testified had received their newspapers by carrier is immaterial. <em>United States v. Shepherd, </em>587 F.2d 943 (8th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>544 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-22\">We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Upon a review of the entire record, we are satisfied that the government presented sufficient evidence to establish each element of the offense, and that a reasonable jury could have been convinced of appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Blackshire, </em>538 F.2d 569, 571 (4th Cir. 1976). The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
