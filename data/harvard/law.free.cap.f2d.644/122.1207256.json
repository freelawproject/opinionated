The petitioner Rear-don was charged with the unlawful possession and possession with intent to sell marijuana. Hawkins was convicted of unlawful control and sale of cocaine. The convictions were affirmed in separate appeals by the Supreme Court of Connecticut in 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-24\">\n<em>The Reardon Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-25\">The record on appeal establishes that at both trials the State sought to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>substances were marijuana and cocaine, respectively, by presenting Dr. Charles Reading, one of three toxicologists employed in the laboratory of the State Department of Health. Dr. Reading holds a degree in forensic medicine from the University of Maryland. Following employment by the New Jersey state police as its principal chemist, he has been employed by the Connecticut Department of Health since 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The state laboratory is maintained, pursuant to statutes, by the health department and functions under the direction of Dr. Reading\u2019s immediate superior, the chief state toxicologist. The Connecticut statute requires the chief toxicologist to establish the standards for analysis of controlled drugs by qualified professional toxicologists and chemists operating under his direction and supervision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The laboratory staff, in addition to the chief toxicologist, included Dr. Reading and two other toxicologists who jointly supervise the work of twenty-four chemists. The chemists perform the actual testing procedures and submit hand written reports of the materials used, the scientific data compiled and the test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The laboratory operating procedures in effect at the time of Dr. Reading\u2019s testimony required a toxicologist to take custody of the suspected substance. The supervising toxicologist removed the material from a vault and delivered it to a particular chemist to conduct a series of three tests which were performed according to the direction and supervision of the toxicologist. During the testing the readings of the instrumentation involved were recorded by the analyst. The results of each testing procedure were delivered to the supervising toxicologist with the working papers, including observations and recorded scientific data. The supervising toxicologist then discussed these reports with the chemist. At the conclusion of these procedures the supervising toxicologist was called upon to make an independent evaluation and j'udgment of the nature of the tested material on the basis of the recorded scientific data. Dr. Reading testified that the chemist who performed the test of the Reardon material was a Miss Pernitis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Reading personally supervised the work done by this chemist, examined the data recorded and the results of her testing procedure. On the strength of this information Dr. Reading was asked to state his opinion that the material tested was marijuana. Over objection by Rear-don\u2019s counsel that the expert\u2019s opinion was based on hearsay, the court received Dr. Reading\u2019s opinion that the substance was marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Toward the close of direct examination, counsel moved for the production of any laboratory reports and notes relating to the examination of the controlled substances for use in cross-examination. The state\u2019s attorney informed the court that all laboratory information had been provided by voluntary disclosure. The trial court inquired if that was all the data available. The witness responded that the only other materials were \u201canalytical notes.\u201d To understand them would require bringing the laboratory supplies and materials into court. The trial record indicates the court was satisfied that the defendant had been provided all the materials available under the applicable criminal rules of discovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">In cross-examination, defense counsel searched all aspects of the direct examination of the State\u2019s expert. The witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>reiterated that the actual testing was done by the chemist Miss Pernitis while the witness was present in the laboratory and that the chemist\u2019s desk was approximately twelve feet away from the toxicologist\u2019s desk. He observed her \u2014 \u201cbut not specifically to each detail of the test.\u201d At the conclusion of the testing procedure the chemist handed the witness her handwritten notes which reported her observations and findings. The cross-examination of Dr. Reading is reported in some thirty pages of the trial transcript.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The record of the trial submitted in this appeal fails to disclose any request by the defense to have the State present the chemist Miss Pernitis to testify concerning the testing procedures performed. There is no indication that the defense sought to obtain samples of the accused substance for independent expert examination. All of the objections made by the defendant to Dr. Reading\u2019s testimony were advanced on the grounds of hearsay. The record on appeal fails to disclose any assertion by the defendant that the evidence presented to Dr. Reading violated his constitutional rights either to confront Miss Pernitis or compel her attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">The constitutional claim was made for the first time in Reardon\u2019s appeal to the Supreme Court of Connecticut.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State v. Reardon, </em>172 Conn. 593, 376 A.2d 65 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"AJs\">\n<em>The Hawkins Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-16\">The state proceedings against the petitioner Hawkins followed much the same pattern. Hawkins was convicted under the Connecticut criminal statutes for unlawful trafficking in cocaine. Dr. Reading was called as the state\u2019s witness to establish that the substance purchased from the defendant in a controlled sale on April 3,1974, was cocaine. The testing procedures employed were substantially similar, except that the known and unknown substances were first submitted to ultraviolet ray spectrophotometry, followed by thin layer chromatography and chemical analysis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The tests in the Hawkins case were performed by the staff chemist Esther Quintana under Dr. Reading\u2019s supervision. He provided her with the materials, the known and unknown substances to be tested for comparison and directed her in the tests to be performed. Dr. Reading personally examined the test results. Hawkins\u2019 counsel objected to Dr. Reading\u2019s opinion, asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>shortages in the chain of custody, the witness\u2019 qualifications and hearsay.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Azp\">\n<em>The Reardon Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The facts found by the Connecticut Supreme Court in rejecting Reardon\u2019s constitutional claim are reported in the court\u2019s opinion, set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">It was not error to admit the opinion of Dr. Reading, in any event, in view of the context of his testimony as a whole. Under the facts established in this case, the opinion of Dr. Reading, a state toxicologist, whose qualifications as an expert were not in issue, was admissible although based in part upon a test or tests conducted by an expert, a chemist, Miss Pernitis, upon which he could reasonably rely and where there was reasonable necessity for it in accordance with laboratory procedures adopted and undertaken pursuant to his supervision and direction; especially since, under the circumstances of this case, not only was his professional opinion founded in part upon routine tests and reports directed and supervised by him but also in part upon his firsthand personal knowledge and observation of the substance in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-10\"><em>State v. Reardon, supra, </em>172 Conn. at 598, 376 A.2d 65 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">The Connecticut court went on to decide Reardon\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim. It held\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ag-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The jury\u2019s consideration of Dr. Reading\u2019s testimony, which we have held was admissible and which bore strong indicia of reliability, and upon which the defendant had a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine, did not deprive the defendant of the right of confrontation guaranteed by our state or federal constitutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 599, 376 A.2d 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In Hawkins\u2019 appeal the court rejected the appellant\u2019s claim of error in the admission of the testimony of Dr. Reading as a state toxicologist.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">For the same reasons that we found no error in admitting similar evidence in the Reardon case (decided during the penden-cy of Hawkins\u2019 appeal), we find no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion in admitting Reading\u2019s testimony in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-11\"><em>State v. Hawkins, </em>173 Conn. 431, 378 A.2d 534 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">\n<em>The Ruling on the Petitioners\u2019 Applications for Writs of Habeas Corpus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Afo\">After stating the facts upon which the applications for writs of habeas corpus were granted, the district court, in its memorandum of decision<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The testimony of Dr. Reading, in effect, merely repeated the information given him by his chemists. As to some of the tests, he simply reiterated the chemists\u2019 analysis with no first-hand knowledge of the test results. By passing along a chemist\u2019s assurance that a particular test yielded a positive result, Dr. Reading was only narrating hearsay. As to other tests where he himself observed the results of the experiments, he still was required to assume that the substances tested were in fact the substances in question, that the tests had been performed correctly, and that the appropriate standards had been used. When he examined the slides created by his chemists and then based his conclusion on the slides, he nonetheless still passed along the chemist\u2019s hearsay declaration that the tests were in fact properly conducted on the appropriate substances. As to these facts, Dr. Reading had no independent knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">It is beyond dispute that the chemist\u2019s extrajudicial testimony constituted a central link in the prosecution of these petitioners. Petitioners\u2019 ability to cross-examine and confront Dr. Reading obviously does not satisfy their desire to confront the extrajudicial witnesses against them. Thus, it is clear that Dr. Reading\u2019s testimony was hearsay, and the only question is whether its admission offended the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The district court found that Dr. Reading\u2019s testimony was crucial to the State\u2019s case in that it was the only evidence presented on the illegal nature of the substances. The court observed that the prosecution did not attempt to explain why the chemists Pernitis and Quintana were not called to testify. The court went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">Since presumably the chemists in this case were available and were deliberately by-passed in favor of Dr. Reading, it is likely that the State was hoping to take strategic advantage of their absence.... Thus, unlike cases where a prosecutor has made a good faith effort to produce the declarant, here the State prosecutor appears to have taken an intentional step designed to shield the declarant from cross-examination and artificially to strengthen the State\u2019s case by reference to the doctorate degree of the supervising toxicologist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">While the district court declined to find a per se violation of the petitioners\u2019 right to confrontation, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">It is enough to say that where a crucial statement of an extra-judicial declarant is involved and where the State does not establish that it made good faith efforts to produce the declarant, that State, at the very least, must demonstrate that the statement bears substantial independent indicia of reliability before it can be admitted against the accused.... No such indicia are presented here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Relying primarily on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Oates, </em>560 F.2d 45 (2d Cir. 1977),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the district court ordered that the writ issue discharging the petitioners from custody unless they were afforded a new trial within sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">The factual determinations by the federal district court and those reported in the opinion of the Connecticut Supreme Court appear to be in conflict in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">Judge Blumenfeld treated the chemists as extra-judicial declarants. The Supreme Court of Connecticut regarded them to be collectors of trustworthy scientific data who performed testing procedures in keeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>with their prescribed duties. The Connecticut court found the scientific facts gathered by the chemists under the direction and supervision of the expert toxicologist were reliable and trustworthy. The district court found that no indicia of reliability could be assigned to the extra-judicial declarations of the chemists who performed the tests. The state court found the results of the thin layer chromatography and chemical tests were personally observed by Dr. Reading. The district court found that Dr. Reading\u2019s opinion, based on these results, was founded on assumptions that were unsupported in the evidence. The state court determined there was reasonable necessity for Dr. Reading\u2019s reliance on the findings of the chemist Pernitis. The federal court was persuaded that the witnesses were deliberately by-passed by the State to advance the interests of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The proceedings in the district court, by stipulation, were submitted on the transcript of Dr. Reading\u2019s testimony at the state trials of Reardon and Hawkins. The court noted and made passing reference to the petitioners\u2019 appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">This appeal presents again the inevitable tension that develops when a federal district court overturns a state criminal conviction, which has been affirmed on appeal, because of an asserted denial of fundamental constitutional protections in the enforcement of the state criminal law. It touches sensitive areas of federalism and invokes concepts of comity which should prevail within the state and federal systems. <em>E. g., Sumner v. </em>Mata, - U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981); <em>Forman v. Smith, </em>633 F.2d 634 (2d Cir. 1980). Here, as in <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>the constitutional claim was not raised at the trial; it was first considered and decided at the state appellate level. Both the state and federal courts considered and based their findings on transcripts of Dr. Reading\u2019s testimony at the petitioners\u2019 state trials. The findings of the Connecticut Supreme Court are stated in <em>State v. Reardon, supra, </em>172 Conn. 593, 376 A.2d 65 and <em>State v. Hawkins, supra, </em>173 Conn. at 431, 378 A.2d 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">During the pendency of this appeal the Supreme Court of the United States decided <em>Sumner v. Mata, supra, </em>on a record in similar context to that presented for our review where there was no specific reference to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-17\">Section 2254(d) applies to cases in which a state court of competent jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>tion has made \u201ca determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue.\u201d It makes no distinction between the factual determinations of a state trial court and those of a state appellate court. Nor does it specify any procedural requirements that must be satisfied for there to be a \u201chearing on the merits of a factual issue,\u201d other than the habeas applicant and state or its agent be parties to the state proceeding and that the state court determination be evidenced by \u201ca written finding, written opinion, or other reliable and adequate written indicia.\u201d Section 2254(d) by its terms thus applies to factual determinations made by state courts, whether the court be a trial court or an appellate court. Cf. <em>Swenson v. Stidham, </em>409 U.S. 224, 230, 93 S.Ct. 359, 363, 34 L.Ed.2d 431 (1972). This interest in federalism recognized by Congress in enacting \u00a7 2254(d) requires deference by federal courts to factual determinations of all state courts. This is true particularly in a case such as this where a federal court makes its determination based on the identical record that was considered by the state appellate court and where there was no reason for the state trial court to consider the issue because respondent failed to raise the issue at that level. See <em>Souza v. Howard, </em>488 F.2d 462 (CA1 1973). In fact, if the state appellate court here had declined to rule on the \u201cidentification\u201d issue because it had not been properly raised in the trial court, the federal court would have been altogether barred from considering it absent a showing of \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cprejudice.\u201d <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><em>Sumner v. Mata, supra, </em>101 S.Ct. at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>Mata v. Sumner, </em>611 F.2d 754 (9th Cir. 1980) reversed the denial of habeas corpus petition by the district court, but failed to apply the \u201cpresumption of correctness\u201d mandated by \u00a7 2254(d). Here, the district court, after noting the state convictions and the exhaustion of state remedies, apparently found facts substantially different from those reported in the opinion of the Connecticut Supreme Court, and also made no mention of \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The majority opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Sumner </em>considered and dealt with the problem.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">When it enacted the 1966 amendment to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, Congress specified that in the absence of the previously enumerated factors one through eight, the burden shall rest on the <em>habeas </em>petitioner, whose case by that time had run the entire gamut of a state judicial system, to establish \u201cby convincing evidence that the factual determination of the State court was erroneous.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Thus, Congress meant to insure that a state finding not be overturned merely on the basis of the usual \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard in such a situation. In order to ensure that this mandate of Congress is enforced, we now hold that a habeas court should include in its opinion granting the writ the reasoning which led it to conclude that any of the first seven factors were present, or the reasoning which led it to conclude that the state finding was \u201cnot fairly supported by the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIh\">100 S.Ct. at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">The Court referred to <em>Taylor v. Lombard, </em>606 F.2d 371 (2d Cir.) <em>cert. denied sub nom., Lombard </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>445 U.S. 946, 100 S.Ct. 1346, 63 L.Ed.2d 781 (1980), in which \u201cthe Federal Court of Appeals indicated in the course of its opinion full awareness of \u00a7 2254(d) and after an examination of the same documentary evidence on which the state court relied it expressly concluded that the state court finding to the contrary was not entitled to deference by reason of \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d 100 S.Ct. at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">But in this case, just as in <em>Sumner, </em>it does not appear that the court below relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>any of the exceptions provided in subsection 1-8 of \u00a7 2254(d), quoted supra. Moreover, as in <em>Sumner, </em>the constitutional point was first passed upon by an appellate state court, as we have already noted; the federal habeas court considered the constitutional issues solely on the factual record made in the state courts; the court granting the writ failed even to mention \u00a7 2254(d), and despite the petitioner\u2019s failure to raise the constitutional issue in the state trial court, the state appellate court considered the issue on the merits and the federal courts did, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Accordingly, we remand the case for further consideration in light of this opinion. Upon such reconsideration, the district court should enter a new judgment and the appeal therefrom, if any, should come to this panel, if practicable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">. Section 19-483, General Statutes, is quoted and discussed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Reardon, </em>172 Conn. 593, 376 A.2d 65 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">. Dr. Reading identified the three tests performed by Miss Pemitis as thin layer chromatography, microscopic examinations, and chemical examination, and described each procedure in detail to the jury. Thin layer chromatography is a technique which causes separation of the chemical components of a substance, and thus allows analysis and identification of each such chemical component. Chemical examination involves treating those components with a standard dye which causes a unique color reaction if certain chemicals are present. Microscopic examination allows highly detailed observation of the physical characteristics of a substance. Note 9, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-14\">.

Reardon\u2019s counsel and the court questioned the witness further and in great detail on each of the three procedures, including the need to have the microscope in court to review the observations made by this instrument. The court did not require the witness to produce all of the laboratory notes made by the chemical analyst. At one point counsel for the State stressed that the defense was at liberty to call any expert of its choice to testify on the subject. At the court\u2019s request, Dr. Reading drew a series of diagrams on the courtroom blackboard to clarify each step taken in thin layer chromatography and explained each step to the jury. He was examined by the defense concerning the various aspects of the testing procedures. He also answered extensive questions on his background and the extent of his knowledge of plant identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b200-18\">.

The state toxicological laboratory, pursuant to \u00a7 19-483 of the General Statutes, is under the direction of the state\u2019s chief toxicologist, who \u201cshall establish the standards for analytical, tests to be conducted with respect to controlled drugs ... by qualified professional toxicologists and chemists operating at his direction and shall have the general responsibility for supervising such analytical personnel in the performance of such tests.\u201d It is staffed by three toxicologists, including Dr. Reading, and twenty-four chemists, and receives approximately 20,000 cases each year. The chemists perform the actual analyses of material under the supervision of the toxicologists. In each case a toxicologist takes the material to be analyzed, gives it to the chemist involved, directs the work to be done, thereafter receives the analyst\u2019s report, discusses the results with the chemist and makes an \u201cindependent decision as to what has been accomplished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">Dr. Reading testified at length on direct and cross-examination as to the manner in which drug identifications were conducted in the state toxicological laboratory in this and other similar cases.2 A microscopic test, a thin-layer chromatography test and a chemical test were conducted. He readily admitted under cross-examination that he did not see the results of the microscopic test conducted by the chemist, Miss Pemitis, that this test was not absolute and that probably hundreds of other plants have cystolithic hairs. The thin-layer chromatography test separates the chemically active ingredients of the sample material upon a small, treated celluloid plate using a volatile solvent; a plate using the sample material is prepared simultaneously with a plate using a known marijuana sample as a standard, so that the two plates can be visually compared. The chemical test treats the separated ingredients with a developer which turns any THC present a distinctive pink color. Dr. Reading testified that the thin-layer test is a specific test indicative of marijuana containing THC, that he personally observed the developed plates and that this test alone is sufficient to establish the presence of marijuana while the microscopic test is not absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">There was testimony by Dr. Reading before the jury that he had personal knowledge upon which to rely in forming his opinion, including personal knowledge of the identity of the tested material, since he received it from the safe and gave it to the chemist for testing; personal knowledge of the procedures used to identify the material, since he directed the chemist as to what tests should be done; most importantly, he personally observed the results of the thin-layer chromatography and chemical tests, which he testified conclusively identified the presence of marijuana containing THC. He also testified, inter alia, that he had examined plantlike material for the presence of marijuana literally thousands of times, that he observed Miss Pemitis as she performed the tests although he did not see each detail, that her desk was approximately twelve feet from his and that she brought him the rough notes from which the final report was completed. He also testified that he personally supervised and examined tests which were completed by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">2 The defendant did not dispute Dr. Reading\u2019s qualifications as an expert witness; or the fact that the material seized under the search warrant was the same substance that was tested. See <em>State v. Johnson, </em>162 Conn. 215, 229-31, 292 A.2d 903.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b202-6\">. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">Dr. Reading, who has a doctorate degree in forensic medicine, testified that in his expert opinion the substances seized from Reardon and Hawkins were marijuana and cocaine, respectively. On direct and cross-examination he conceded that his testimony was based entirely on his observations of the results of tests which were conducted out of his immediate presence by laboratory chemists under his supervision and on oral or hand-written reports from these chemists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">As his trial testimony indicates, Dr. Reading, along with two other toxicologists, supervised the work of 24 laboratory chemists.2 Two of these chemists, Ms. Pemitis and Ms. Quintana, actually performed the tests on the substances taken from the petitioners. Reading\u2019s supervision of these chemists involved no more than directing the chemists to perform certain tests, reviewing their reports, and discussing their analyses with them. Dr. Reading admitted that he played no part in the actual performance of the tests nor did he observe the chemists performing each step of the testing process. He was simply present in the laboratory at the same time that the chemists were. The tests on petitioners\u2019 substances were just a few among the 15,000 other tests each year which Dr. Reading claims to \u201csupervise.\u201d As counsel for petitioner points out, this suggests that Dr. Reading \u201csupervises\u201d over 50 tests every day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">The nature of the tests required that the chemists, Ms. Pemitis and Ms. Quintana, mechanically record data in some cases and make subjective analyses in others. Thus, for example, thin layer chromatography was used to test both substances. In performing this test the chemists prepared a slide with an extract of a known standard and another slide with the substance to be tested. The slides were then placed in a solvent solution, removed and sprayed with a particular chemical spray. This process yielded distinct dots of various colors at different locations on the slide. By comparing the dots appearing on the slide containing the known substance with those on the slide containing the unknown, the chemists were able to determine if the unknown contained chemicals similar to those known to be in the standard. With respect to this test, the chemists mechanically performed the operations and brought the slides to Dr. Reading. Dr. Reading, by examining the slides, was able to confirm independently the chemists\u2019 conclusions as to the presence of the suspected drug.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-14\">By contrast, the microscopic test for marijuana required that the chemist alone draw the ultimate conclusion. After preparing a slide with an unknown substance, the chemist examined the material with a microscope, looking for characteristics of marijuana. The chemist herself determined whether or not the material resembled marijuana and reported only her conclusions to Dr. Reading. As Dr. Reading conceded, Ms. Pemitis actually performed the microscopic evaluation of Reardon\u2019s substance, and she merely told Dr. Reading that the results were positive. He never personally examined the substance under the microscope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-15\">Thus, with some tests the results were simply reported as positive, indicating the presence of narcotics. With others, the actual chemical results were shown to Dr. Reading to corroborate the chemist\u2019s own conclusions. In both trials Dr. Reading testified that he relied on all of the tests in reaching his own opinion.3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-16\">2 At Reardon\u2019s trial, Dr. Reading testified that he and his two fellow toxicologists supervised 24 chemists. At the time of Hawkins\u2019 trial, the laboratory had only 22 chemists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-17\">3 On direct examination, Dr. Reading indicated that the identity of the substances could have been determined from his person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>al examination of the results of a single test. However, on cross-examination he testified that he based his expert opinion on the summation of all the test results.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\">. It is worth noting, however, that in <em>United States v. Oates, supra, </em>the court\u2019s opinion, in construing Federal Rules of Evidence 803(6) took pains to \u201cstress, however, that we do not decide whether appellant\u2019s right to confrontation was violated here.\u201d The appeal in the federal conviction was decided on \u201cnarrow statutory grounds.\u201d 560 F.2d at 80.

On remand, the district court also may wish to consider the effect of the Connecticut statutes brought to our attention at oral argument which might have allowed discovery of the substances examined and which apparently now provide a procedure by which the report of the state laboratory may be admitted into evidence unless the defendant indicates that he intends to challenge the narcotic character of the alleged controlled substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
