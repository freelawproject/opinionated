Nickerson, J. Plaintiff\u2019s suit followed the death of her husband, Navy Lieutenant William Arthur Vasina, in the crash in March 1973 of a Navy airplane designed and manufactured by Grumman. A later Navy investigation concluded that the crash was caused by an in-flight separation of the port wing of the airplane. This wing had been damaged in action in Vietnam in 1967, and had been repaired by Navy field personnel at that time. Plaintiff alleged that Grumman was liable for Lieutenant Vasina\u2019s wrongful death, and for survival damages, based on theories of negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty. Grumman asserted that the wing separation was actually due to the Navy\u2019s failure to properly repair the 1967 damage. For reasons indicated below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">Grumman\u2019s first group of arguments on appeal <em>centers </em>around its claim that the Navy\u2019s negligence relieved Grumman of any liability for its own negligence. We note in passing that Grumman does make a desultory claim to us that it was not negligent at all. But that argument deserves little discussion. The trial judge found, 492 F.Supp. 943, 944 (E.D.N.Y.1980), that there was ample evidence indicating that Grumman\u2019s negligence contributed substantially to the crash. Our review of the record confirms this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">Grumman\u2019s weightier argument rests on its assertion that the Navy\u2019s faulty repair and maintenance of Lieutenant Vasina\u2019s airplane amounted to \u201cunforeseeable intervening and superseding negligence\u201d that served to \u201ccut off\u201d \u201cany possible liability on the part of Grumman.\u201d See W. Prosser, The Law of Torts 270-89 (4th ed. 1971). Grumman first argues that the Navy\u2019s alleged negligence relieved Grumman of liability as a matter of law. This argument is not persuasive. The case before us is not one where Grumman\u2019s liability could be relieved by a showing of any intervening Navy negligence, however slight or irrelevant. Rather, the Navy\u2019s negligence would have to be substantial, and decisive in the causal chain of events leading to the crash, in order to eliminate Grumman\u2019s liability. In other words, the question presented below was one of proximate cause, and that question is within the province of the jury. See W. Prosser, supra, at 289-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-18\">Grumman cites Restatement (2d) of Torts \u00a7 452(2), Illustration 9, as support for its position.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have found no New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>case that adopts that specific portion of the Restatement, see 1 New York Pattern Jury-Instructions 2:72 at 212-15 (1974 &amp; Cum. Supp.1980) (instruction on intervening causes). Moreover, since results such as that in Illustration 9 have been criticized as \u201cdifficult to explain\u201d by Prosser, see W. Prosser, supra, at 289, we feel no compulsion to suppose that the New York Court of Appeals would adopt \u00a7 452(2) if the issue were presented to it today. Finally, \u00a7 452(2) \u201ccovers the exceptional cases in which ... the duty, and hence the entire responsibility for the situation, has been shifted to a third person.\u201d See \u00a7 452, Comment d. But the jury in the present case was instructed respecting Grumman\u2019s \u201cduty\u201d to Lieutenant Vasina, and by its verdict found that that duty still existed at the time of the crash and had not been fully discharged by Grumman.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Grumman also argues that the trial judge committed reversible error in refusing to give to the jury an instruction requested by the defense on the subject of \u201cintervening\u201d and \u201csuperseding\u201d negligence. This argument does possess a surface appeal. There was clearly enough evidence adduced at trial to warrant a jury decision on Grumman\u2019s defense theory. But ultimately, Grumman\u2019s argument that the judge committed reversible error on this issue is unpersuasive. In evaluating the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, it is helpful to refer to the summations presented by counsel for both litigants immediately before the charge. Those summations identify as the central issue in the case whether the Navy\u2019s conduct or Grumman\u2019s conduct was the proximate cause of the crash. For example, Vasina\u2019s counsel asserted that \u201cif Grumman is partially responsible, it is liable.... [I]f the Navy was exclusively responsible, then Grumman can walk.\u201d In turn, Grumman\u2019s counsel contended at the start of his argument that \u201cthe sole reason why this accident happened is that it was the fault of the Navy and Navy personnel.\u201d Vasina had argued that Grumman\u2019s negligence in designing the airplane, in overseeing its maintenance and use by the Navy, and in failing to warn the Navy properly of dangers in the airplane once they were discovered, each made Grumman liable for the crash. Grumman replied that the Navy\u2019s negligence in repairing and maintaining the airplane poorly and in flying the airplane too long, despite Grumman\u2019s cautionary instructions and recommendations, relieved Grumman of all liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">In the context of these summations, the trial judge\u2019s instructions, though brief, were adequate to present to the jury the legal criteria relevant to Grumman\u2019s defense of superseding negligence. In describing the burden of proof on plaintiff, the judge defined \u201cproximate cause\u201d as follows: \u201cAn act or failure to act is the proximate cause of an injury if it was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury, that is, if it had such an effect on producing the injury that reasonable people would regard it as a cause of the injury.\u201d He then presented the litigants\u2019 conflicting contentions and explained the jury\u2019s duty in simple, concise language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">There may be more than one proximate cause of an accident. Grumman has contended that the negligence of the Navy was the sole proximate cause of the crash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">If you find that the Navy\u2019s negligence was the sole proximate cause, then plaintiff may not recover. However, if you find that both Grumman and the Navy, by separate and independent acts of negligence proximately caused or were sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>stantial factors in proximately causing the death of Lieutenant Vasina, then Grumman is responsible for the whole injury even though Grumman alone might not have been solely responsible for the death of Lieutenant Vasina and even though its acts are not equal in degree to the negligence of the Navy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">In other words, from the standpoint of proximate cause, it is no defense to Grumman merely that the negligence of the Navy contributed to the death of Lieutenant Vasina.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">These instructions were correct, because if the Navy\u2019s asserted intervening negligence had been \u201csuperseding,\u201d relieving Grumman of responsibility, then the Navy\u2019s negligence would indeed have been the \u201csole <em>proximate </em>cause\u201d of the crash. In other words, the issue of \u201cintervening\u201d and \u201csuperseding\u201d negligence was contained in the issue of proximate cause, and was adequately presented to the jury in the latter form.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Grumman argues that the trial judge should have given its requested instructions instead of those actually given. We are unpersuaded. Grumman\u2019s requested instructions were much longer and more complex, and might well have been unintelligible or needlessly confusing to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial judge endeavored, we think successfully, to instruct the jury in ordinary, easily understandable language. In pursuit of this goal, he acted within his discretion in rejecting Grumman\u2019s formulations in favor of his own, which we believe gave the jury sufficient guidance on the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Grumman also claims that the trial judge erred in submitting to the jury a claim for strict tort liability, premised upon a defect in the design of Lieutenant Vasina\u2019s airplane. The crash occurred within a federal enclave, the Boardman Bombing Range in Oregon. Grumman argues that the law applicable to this case is therefore determined by reference to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 457, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\">In the case of the death of any person by the neglect or wrongful act of another within a national park or other place subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, within the exterior boundaries of any State, such right of action shall exist as though the place were under the jurisdiction of the State within whose exterior boundaries such place may be; and in any action brought to recover on account of injuries sustained in any such place the rights of the parties shall be governed by the laws of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>within the exterior boundaries of which it may be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Grumman interprets this statute to mean that the law applicable to the present case is the law in force in Oregon at the time that the enclave was ceded to the United States. The trial judge found that this cession occurred in 1846. 492 F.Supp. at 945. Grumman argues that since Oregon did not permit tort recoveries based on strict liability until 1967, the law in force within the federal enclave in 1973, the year of the crash, did not permit strict-liability tort recoveries. Therefore, Grumman concludes, the trial judge committed reversible error when he submitted the strict-liability claim to the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">We agree with Grumman that the law applicable to this case is determined by reference to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 457. But we do not agree that \u00a7 457 requires that the law of federal enclaves regarding wrongful-death actions be frozen as of the date of cession. The natural reading of the statutory language is that the wrongful-death law of a federal enclave should be identical to that of the surrounding state, whatever that law might be and however it might change over time. The legislative history of \u00a7 457 supports such a reading. Senator Walsh of Montana, in explaining the provision to Senator Robinson of Arkansas, stated that the statute would operate \u201cso that if under the law of Arkansas a right of recovery could be had if the death occurred outside of the [enclave], the same right of action would exist if it occurred in the [enclave].\u201d 69 Cong.Rec. 1486 (1928). Thus, it was contemplated that the law of a federal enclave would be \u201cthe same\u201d in this respect as that of the surrounding state. This intention was recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Stewart &amp; Company v. Sadrakula, </em>309 U.S. 94, 100 &amp; n.9, 60 S.Ct. 431, 434, n.9, 84 L.Ed. 596 (1940):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">The Congress has recognized in certain instances the desirability of . .. similarity between the municipal laws of the state and those of the federal parcel. Since only the law in effect at the time of the transfer of jurisdiction continues in force, future statutes of the state are not a part of the body of laws in the ceded area. <em>Congressional action is necessary to keep it current. </em>Consequently as defects become apparent legislation is enacted covering certain phases. <em>This occurred as to rights of action for accidental death by negligence or wrongful act </em>[citing 45 Stat. 54,16 U.S.C. \u00a7 457 (1928)]. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">The same construction of \u00a7 457 is implicit in numerous opinions of lower courts. See, e. g., <em>Greene v. Vantage Steamship Corporation, </em>466 F.2d 159, 166 n.9 (4th Cir. 1972) (implicitly interpreting \u00a7 457 to apply current state law); <em>Mathis v. General Electric Corporation, </em>580 F.2d 192, 194 (5th Cir. 1978) (same); <em>Muniz v. United States, </em>280 F.Supp. 542, 546 (S.D.N.Y.1968) (same). Finally, under Grumman\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 457, federal enclaves would become pockets of outdated legislation. Cf. <em>Capetola v. Barclay-White Company, </em>48 F.Supp. 797, 800 (E.D.Pa.). (\u201cCeded property would .. . become a sanctuary for the obsolete restrictions of the common law and a grave yard for the burial of every humane legislation .... \u201d), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>139 F.2d 556 (3d Cir. 1943), <em>cert. denied, </em>321 U.S. 799, 64 S.Ct. 939, 88 L.Ed.1087 (1944). We do not think that such an intention can be plausibly ascribed to the Congress that enacted \u00a7 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">In support of its position, Grumman relies heavily on <em>Quadrini v. Sikorsky Aircraft Division, </em>425 F.Supp. 81 (D.Conn.1977). That case involved the crash of a military helicopter in a federal enclave in North Carolina. The district judge concluded that the substantive law applicable to plaintiff\u2019s tort claim was \u201cthe tort law of North Carolina as it existed on April 3, 1941, the time the enclave was ceded to the United States .. ..\u201d Id. at 88. We decline to make <em>Quadrini </em>the law of this circuit on this point. If the authors of \u00a7 457 had had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>only the narrow purpose ascribed to them in <em>Quadrini, </em>we think that they would have drawn the statute itself more narrowly. The plain language of the provision as drafted, and its later judicial construction, lead us to conclude that \u00a7 457 envisions the application of the current substantive law of the surrounding state in actions for death or personal injury occurring within a federal enclave. Because our holding agrees with that of the district judge below, we find no error in his decision to submit to the jury the strict-liability claim made by plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Finally, Grumman attacks the jury\u2019s damage award in a number of aspects. Grumman claims that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit evidence on the effect of taxes upon the computation of Lieutenant Vasina\u2019s lost future income, or to instruct the jury, as requested, regarding the non-taxability of an award for damages made to plaintiff. Grumman\u2019s argument on this point rests upon the recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company v. Liepelt, </em>444 U.S. 490, 100 S.Ct. 755, 62 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980), in which it was held error to refuse to allow evidence or give requested instructions on taxes in a case brought under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. Grumman contends that <em>Liepelt </em>represents the \u201cbetter view\u201d today, and \u201cthat the New York Court of Appeals, were it presented with this question today, might well be persuaded that instructions on these issues should be furnished to the jury.\u201d In support of its view, Grumman cites <em>Coleman v. New York City Transit Authority, </em>37 N.Y.2d 137, 145, 371 N.Y.S.2d 663, 332 N.E.2d 850 (1975) (Jasen, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We see no support in <em>Coleman </em>for Grumman\u2019s position. Judge Jasen\u2019s dissent in that case, in which he argued for jury instructions on taxes, hardly suggests that the New York Court of Appeals would embrace <em>Liepelt </em>today. On the contrary, the fact that all six of Judge Jasen\u2019s colleagues opposed him on this point leads us to believe that the majority opinion in <em>Coleman </em>still expresses the majority view of the New York Court of Appeals on this subject. Our review of New York case law on this point since <em>Coleman </em>confirms that belief. We have found no indication that the New York Court of Appeals, or any lower court, has expressed any doubts about the majority view in <em>Coleman. </em>We therefore conclude that Grumman\u2019s assignment of error here is without support in New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Grumman also argues that prejudgment interest should not have been awarded. Grumman\u2019s argument here is that Oregon law, which does not provide for prejudgment interest, should apply to the present case by virtue of 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 457. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>But Grumman explicitly accepted the application of New York law respecting damages, see note 4 supra. And as Grumman concedes in its brief on appeal, New York law \u201cspecifically provides for prejudgment interest.\u201d Grumman seems to want to pick and choose between the laws of Oregon and New York to suit its own advantage. We reject this \u201csmorgasbord\u201d approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Grumman\u2019s last claim is that the amount of the judgment in favor of plaintiff is \u201cgrossly excessive compensation for plaintiff\u2019s pecuniary loss.\u201d The amount in question is $1,095,150.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Grumman\u2019s argument is that by investing the award in \u201cmunicipal bonds yielding more than 10% per year,\u201d plaintiff will be able to receive as annual income an amount far greater than Lieutenant Vasina\u2019s income at the time of his death. Grumman therefore urges that the judgment be set aside, citing <em>Dullard v. Berkeley Associates Company, </em>606 F.2d 890, 895 (2d Cir. 1979). We think that <em>Dullard </em>is readily distinguishable from the present case and that Grumman\u2019s argument is without substantial merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Grumman\u2019s simplistic comparison of current bond yields with Lieutenant Vasina\u2019s 1973 income ignores the complexity of this (and almost every) damage-award calculation. At trial, only plaintiff presented expert testimony on plaintiff\u2019s pecuniary loss; Grumman contented itself with cross-examination of plaintiff\u2019s expert. Plaintiff\u2019s expert presented calculations \u2014 clearly accepted by the jury \u2014 that conclusively rebut Grumman\u2019s argument on appeal. Plaintiff\u2019s calculations of pecuniary loss included an estimate of Lieutenant Vasina\u2019s lost wages from the date of death to the time of trial; an estimate of his lost wages from the time of trial to the end of his military career, which estimate assumed predictable and reasonable future pay increases; an estimate of Lieutenant Vasina\u2019s lost future pension, which was guaranteed and of a readily predictable amount; and an estimate of the income he would have been able to earn in a second career begun after retirement from the Navy. All of these individual estimates were reasonable, and their total closely approximated the amount ultimately awarded by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Grumman\u2019s reliance on <em>Dullard </em>is unavailing. <em>Dullard\u2019s </em>calculations of future income did not allow for future pay increases, for a future pension, or for future second-career income. In the context of that case, where no expert testimony respecting such factors was offered, it was reasonable to ignore them and to make a direct comparison between bond yields and decedent\u2019s lost annual income. But in the present case, the damage award comprised a number of future income factors, each of which was calculated in a reasonable manner. The sum of these individual factors cannot be dismissed as unreasonable by reference to a <em>Dullard </em>-style comparison of 1980 bond yields and Lieutenant Vasina\u2019s 1973 income. We therefore conclude that the damage award was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Grumman presents a number of other claims of reversible error committed by the trial judge, but we find none of these sufficiently meritorious to warrant discussion. In sum, we think that none of the errors complained of by Grumman requires reversal of the judgment of the district court, which we therefore affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AWE\">.

The balance of the award, $89,120, was given to decedent\u2019s daughter \u201cfor loss of fatherly nurture, care and guidance.\u201d As to prejudgment interest on the award, that may not be considered in determining excessiveness, see <em>Dullard v. Berkeley Associates Company, </em>606 F.2d 890, 895 (2d Cir. 1979), citing <em>Zaninovich v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>26 A.D.2d 155, 160, 271 N.Y.S.2d 866 (1st Dep\u2019t 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b195-11\">KEARSE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aoi-dedup-0\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">With all due respect, I dissent from the majority\u2019s view that the trial court\u2019s instructions were sufficient to present to the jury the defense of intervening cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">The major defense presented by defendants Grumman Corporation and Grumman Aerospace Corporation (collectively \u201cGrumman\u201d) was that the duty of care with respect to the airplane that crashed, causing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the death of plaintiff's decedent, had shifted from Grumman to the Navy. The defense was based on the evidence that the airplane, sold by Grumman to the Navy in 1966, had suffered wing damage in 1967 as the result of a malfunction of a bomb ejector rack, not manufactured by Grumman, that had been added to the plane by the Navy; shortly thereafter the damaged wing was given a temporary repair of \u201cextremely poor quality\u201d by the Navy, and, notwithstanding naval procedures and Grumman\u2019s repair manual instructions to the contrary, the Navy proceeded to use the airplane without more permanent repairs for more than five years. Grumman contends that the Navy was negligent and that its negligence was an intervening and superseding cause of the crash in 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Grumman's theory is soundly based in New York law, under which \u201cliability turns upon whether the intervening act is a normal or foreseeable consequence of the situation created by the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Derdiarian v. Felix Contracting Corp., </em>51 N.Y.2d 308, 315, 434 N.Y.S.2d 166, 414 N.E.2d 666 (1980); <em>see Mull v. Ford Motor Co., </em>368 F.2d 713, 717 (2d Cir. 1966); <em>Ventricelli v. Kinney System Rent A Car, Inc., </em>45 N.Y.2d 950, 952, 411 N.Y.S.2d 555, 383 N.E.2d 1149 (1978); <em>Sheehan v. City of New York, </em>40 N.Y.2d 496, 503, 387 N.Y.S.2d 92, 354 N.E.2d 832 (1976). The jury thus should have been instructed to consider whether the Navy\u2019s negligence was foreseeable to Grumman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">If the intervening act is extraordinary under the circumstances, not foreseeable in the normal course of events, or independent of or far removed from the defendant\u2019s conduct, it may well be a superseding act which breaks the causal nexus (see e. g., <em>Martinez v. Lazaroff, </em>48 N.Y.2d 819, 820, 424 N.Y.S.2d 126, 399 N.E.2d 1148; <em>Ventricelli v. Kinney System Rent A Car, </em>45 N.Y.2d 950, 952, 411 N.Y.S.2d 555, 383 N.E.2d 1149 <em>supra; Rivera v. City of New York, </em>11 N.Y.2d 856, 227 N.Y.S.2d 676, 182 N.E.2d 284). Because questions concerning what is foreseeable and what is normal may be the subject of varying inferences, as is the question of negligence itself, these issues generally are for the fact finder to resolve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\"><em>Derdiarian v. Felix Contracting Corp., supra, </em>51 N.Y.2d at 315, 434 N.Y.S.2d 166, 414 N.E.2d 666. To allow the jury to consider the theory with comprehension, the charge should have been complete, accurate, and easily understandable to the lay person. <em>See, e. g., </em>1 New York Pattern Jury Instructions 1-2 (1974). The recommended New York charge with respect to intervening causes is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">If you find that defendant was negligent but that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by the act of a third person, defendant may be held liable for such injuries if you further find that a reasonably prudent person, situated as the defendant was prior to the happening of the incident, would have foreseen an act of the kind committed by the third person as a probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. If your finding is that a reasonably prudent person would not have foreseen an act of the kind committed by the third person as a probable consequence of defendant\u2019s negligence, then defendant is not responsible for plaintiff\u2019s injuries and your verdict must be for defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 212 (as modified in 1980 Supp.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">The majority recognizes that \u201c[tjhere was clearly enough evidence adduced at trial to warrant a jury decision on Grumman\u2019s de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>fense theory.\u201d (Majority Opinion at 115, <em>ante.) </em>It holds that because the parties\u2019 lawyers had argued intervening cause in their summations, the judge\u2019s charge on proximate cause was sufficient to instruct the jury to consider intervening or superseding cause. I do not agree. Needless to say, the judge began his charge by instructing the jury that it was their duty to follow the law as it was stated by <em>him. </em>The charge that followed did not once mention that the jury might consider whether the Navy\u2019s negligence had been so independent or unforeseeable in the normal course of events as to have broken the causal chain between Grumman and the fatal accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The portion of the charge relied on by the majority, to the extent that it is not directed toward the concept of <em>joint </em>causation (\u201cThere may be more than one proximate cause of an accident\u201d), was completely unenlightening on intervening cause or foreseeability. It stated only that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amy\">Grumman has contended that the negligence of the Navy was the sole proximate cause of the crash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">If you find that the Navy\u2019s negligence was the sole proximate cause, then plaintiff may not recover.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The charge gave no indication whatever of the basis on which the jury might find that Grumman\u2019s negligence was not a proximate cause of the <em>accident </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>the remoteness and unforeseeability of the Navy\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Indeed, the charge as a whole may have led the jury to believe that Grumman would be liable despite unforeseeability. The only instruction mentioning foreseeability was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">In determining whether the defendant was negligent, you must consider whether it was foreseeable that the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions created a risk of the kind of injury which occurred. A person is responsible for the consequences of his conduct if the risk of such an injury was reasonably foreseeable. It is not necessary that the defendant should have had notice of the particular condition from which the injury would occur, or the precise injury that would result, if the possibility of the kind of accident which occurred would have been clear to the ordinarily prudent person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">This does not mention the foreseeability of the Navy\u2019s negligence or of any act of the Navy; rather, each of the three sentences focuses on the foreseeability of the <em>kind of injury, </em>undoubtedly directing the jury\u2019s thoughts to the fatal crash, rather than to the negligent repairs that preceded it. If the jury deduced from this portion of the charge that it was to give any thought at all to the Navy\u2019s negligent repairs, it would be less likely to equate the Navy\u2019s negligence with the \u201ckind of injury\u201d than with the \u201ccondition\u201d that led to the injury. And as to the latter, the jury plainly was instructed that \u201c[i]t is <em>not </em>necessary that the defendant should have had notice of the particular condition from which the injury would occur .... \u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, to the extent that the jury may have thought that foreseeability bore on the question of the Navy\u2019s negligence in relationship to Grumman\u2019s negligence as a proximate cause, it is more likely to have believed that the Navy\u2019s negligence did <em>not </em>have to be foreseeable in order for Grumman to be found liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">In short, the charge was not a complete statement of the applicable law, and I cannot believe the lay jury had any notion that it was to consider whether the Navy\u2019s negligent repair was so \u201cfar removed from\u201d Grumman\u2019s conduct that it \u201c[broke] the causal nexus.\u201d <em>Derdiarian v. Felix Contracting Corp., supra, </em>51 N.Y.2d at 315, 434 N.Y.S.2d 166, 414 N.E.2d 666. The majority\u2019s ruling means that despite the presentation of ample evidence upon which a jury could find that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by a third person\u2019s act, independent of or far removed from the defendant\u2019s negligence, the trial court need never mention to the jury the principle that if an act of the sort that intervened was not foreseeable the defendant should not be found liable. The practical result is to read intervening or superseding cause out of the law of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>I would reverse and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">. Among the authorities relied on in the commentary on this recommended jury instruction is Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 452 (1965), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">(1) Except as stated in Subsection (2), the failure of a third person to act to prevent harm to another threatened by the actor\u2019s negligent conduct is not a superseding cause of such harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-13\">(2) Where, because of lapse of time or otherwise, the duty to prevent harm to another threatened by the actor\u2019s negligent conduct is found to have shifted from the actor to a third person, the failure of the third person to prevent such harm is a superseding cause.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-15\">. I have no quarrel with so much of part II of the majority\u2019s opinion as holds that it was proper to submit to the jury the theory of strict tort liability. Nonetheless, because we do not ' know the basis of the jury\u2019s verdict, the inadequacy of the instructions on the negligence claim requires a retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
