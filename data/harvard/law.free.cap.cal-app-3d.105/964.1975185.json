At the time of said injury, decedent\u2019s husband, petitioner Joseph Messina (husband) was partially dependent upon her for support and her children, petitioners Joseph Messina, Jr. (a minor at the time of injury) and Alfonso Messina, were totally dependent upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The only issue herein is the amount of the workers\u2019 compensation death benefit to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">As applies herein, Labor Code section 4702 specifies: \u201cthe death benefit in cases of total dependency. . . shall be the sum of forty thousand dollars ($40,000) <em>except in the case of a surviving widow and one or more dependent minor children, in which case the death benefit shall be forty-five thousand dollars </em>($45,000). . .. \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Since petitioners Joseph Messina, Jr., and Alfonso Messina were totally dependent upon decedent at the time of injury any death benefit is divided between them and decedent\u2019s husband, as only a partial dependent, receives no part thereof. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4703.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>Respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board, in a closely divided en banc opinion <em>(Messina </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1979) 44 Cal.Comp.Cases 10), has awarded the children a death benefit of $40,000. The children claim entitlement to the augmented death benefit of $45,000, which is awarded to \u201ca surviving widow and one or more dependent minor children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The claim to the augmented death benefit of $45,000 is grounded on the contentions such benefit (1) only requires one or more dependent minor children, and no surviving spouse is needed and (2) limitation of the augmented death benefit to where there is a widow and one or more dependent minor children is an unconstitutional denial of equal protection and the statute should be extended by judicial decision to encompass a \u201cwidower\u201d and one or more dependent minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">At the outset we reject the contention that the mere existence of \u201cone or more dependent minor children\u201d without a surviving spouse triggers entitlement to the augmented death benefits. In order to be entitled to the augmented death benefit there must be <em>both </em>\u201ca surviving widow <em>and </em>one or more dependent minor children.\u201d That is, if there is no surviving widow, the dependent minor children are not entitled to the augmented death benefit under Labor Code section 4702 as applicable herein. <em>(Beauchamp </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1969) 34 Cal.Comp.Cases 194.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) It is not necessary, however, that the surviving widow be even a partial dependent. <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. (Hudson) </em>(1950) 95 Cal.App.2d 671, 673-674 [213 P.2d 518].)</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">It is urged the limitation of the augmented death benefits to surviving widows is unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection and the court should remedy this defect by extending the augmented death benefit to surviving <em>widowers </em>and one or more dependent minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The limitation of augmented death benefits to widows is not only basically unfair under the facts and situation present in the instant case but is clearly unconstitutional under the equal protection clauses of both the United States and California Constitutions. <em>(Arp </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 395, 400-407 [138 Cal.Rptr. 293, 563 P.2d 849]; see also <em>Wengler </em>v. <em>Druggists Mutual Insurance Co. </em>(1980) 446 U.S. 142 [64 L.Ed.2d 107, 100 S.Ct. 1540].)</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">In <em>Arp </em>our Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the then in effect conclusive presumption of Labor Code section 3501, subdivision (a) that a wife was totally dependent upon her husband. The court invalidated this presumption of dependency and declined to extend the presumption of dependency to the husband upon a wife. The court thus left to widows and widowers alike to prove the extent of their dependency and be compensated in accordance with the facts and circumstances shown. <em>(Arp, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at pp. 409-410.) The Legislature has by Statutes 1979, chapter 749, page 2599 deleted this offending provision. Also by Statutes 1979, chapter 749, page 2599 the Legislature has remedied the problem with respect to Labor Code section 4702 by deleting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>\u201cwidow\u201d and in lieu thereof adding \u201cspouse.\u201d Accordingly, for injuries on or after January 1, 1980, Labor Code section 4702 has been expressly clarified to comply with equal protection requirements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">The issue here is then whether this court should judicially extend Labor Code section 4702 as in effect prior to January 1, 1980, to widows and widowers alike or merely, as the court did in <em>Arp, </em>entirely nullify the provision for an augmented death benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In <em>Arp, </em>19 Cal.3d 395, the court said at pages 407-408 that: \u201cAlthough courts do not lack power to remedy a constitutional defect by literally rewriting statutory language, it is a comparatively drastic alternative, to be invoked sparingly, and only <em>when the result achieved by such a course is more consistent with legislative intent than the result that would attend outright </em>invalidation.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">We conclude that, rather than outright invalidation, the statute should be extended to encompass a surviving widower and one or more dependent minor children as such action is more consistent with the legislative intent of the augmented death benefit and would avoid total elimination of the augmented death benefit. In support of this conclusion we regard the dissenting opinion of Commissioner Glow (in which Board Chairman Witt and Commissioner Gaines concurred) persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>Commissioner Glow\u2019s analysis pointed out: \u201cThe issue in this case is whether the dependent children are entitled to the augmented death benefit provided for in Labor Code Section 4702. This augmentation was provided in an amendment to that section [by Statutes 1947, chapter 1031, section 1, p. 2302.] An early indication of the statutory purpose was revealed in <em>[State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. (Hudson), supra, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 671] where the court held that the surviving widow did not need to be a dependent widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">\u201cThe argument was made in <em>Hudson </em>that \u2018surviving widow\u2019 as used in Section 4702 required a surviving <em>dependent </em>widow. In-extending the coverage of Section 4702 to include this fact situation, the court stated: \u2018The liability which fell upon the surviving widow not only to support the two children but to devote to them the care of a mother and guardian not only reduces the ability of the \u201csurviving widow\u201d to support herself but accordingly reduces her ability to supplement the $6,000 [(the death benefit at that time, with $7,500 being the augmented benefit)] and thereby lengthens the readjustment period. Hence the commission deemed that a necessity had arisen to award the children not the mother, the additional amount that may be awarded under section 4702.\u2019 [(Italics by court.) <em>(Hudson, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.2d at pp. 673-674.)]</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">\u201cIn this case, the burden for the care of the dependent children was previously on decedent and is now on the surviving widower. The court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Hudson, supra, </em>may be paraphrased to apply to the facts in this case. Here a liability fell upon the surviving widower not only to support two children [(one of whom was a minor at the time of injury)], but to devote to them the care of a father and guardian. This not only reduces the ability of the surviving widower to support himself, but accordingly reduces his ability to supplement the $40,000.00 and thereby lengthens the readjustment period. This is no less valid because we are talking about a surviving male (father) rather than a surviving woman (mother).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">\u201cThis situation is clearly distinguishable from that of <em>Arp </em>where it was unnecessary for the court to take any more affirmative action than declaring the statute unconstitutional. Here, the <em>only </em>way that the legislative intent of the statute can be given effect, consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>requirements of equal protection under the law, is by [construing] the statute to include <em>widowers </em>as well as \u2018widows.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">\u201cThe Supreme Court of this state in dicta seemed to accept this in the <em>Arp </em>case when they stated [(19 Cal.3d at p. 410)]: \u2018Moreover, under section 3501, subdivision (b), a conclusive presumption of dependency in favor of minor children remains in effect. As a result, even if the surviving <em>spouse </em>is financially self-sufficient and unable to show actual dependency, the full death benefit will be available to any minor children left dependent upon the surviving parent. (\u00a7 4702.) For example, a fully employed widow with a minor child, who would have received a $55,000 benefit by operation of the,widow\u2019s conclusive presumption of total dependency, may under our decision receive nothing herself; but the full $55,000 death benefit which formerly would have been exhausted by the widow, will be awarded to the children. [Citations.]\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Accordingly, we hold Labor Code section 4702 must be read to also provide the augmented death benefit to a surviving widower and one or more dependent minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Finally, we must consider the extent to which our opinion shall have retroactive application. <em>(Arp, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 411; <em>Reich, Adell, Crost &amp; Perry </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 225, 237 [160 Cal.Rptr. 218];) Pursuant to Labor Code sections 5803 and 5804 \u201cthe Board has continuing jurisdiction to reopen a case for \u2018good cause\u2019 upon a petition filed within five years of the date of injury and that \u2018a subsequent judicial interpretation of the compensation statutes contrary to a prior administrative interpretation is \u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen....\u2019\u201d <em>(General Insurance Co. of America </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 278, 285-286 [163 Cal.Rptr. 537].) Thus, unless limited in retroactive effect, our opinion herein can conceivably result in a flood of reopening of previously adjudicated cases. Many employers and carriers may have entered into stipulations or foregone litigation over other issues in order to avoid a constitutional challenge to Labor Code section 4702. Further, employers and carriers have calculated their liability on presumed final awards previously issued by the board. To allow the board to now reopen cases under Labor Code sections 5803 and 5804 would thus create unfairness and undue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>litigation. Accordingly, we limit our decision so as to preclude a reopening under Labor Code sections 5803 and 5804. Dependents with previously adjudicated awards cannot claim any unfairness for they too could have sought appellate review on the constitutionality of Labor Code section 4702; allowing previously adjudicated cases to be reopened under Labor Code sections 5803 and 5804 merely provides dependents with funds to which they had no expectancy. It is appropriate, however, to apply our decision as of the date it becomes final, to cases still pending before the board where the amount of the death benefit has yet to be decided and to cases where the constitutionality of Labor Code section 4702 is pending on reconsideration before the board or pending upon a petition for writ of review before the appellate courts. Employers and carriers cannot claim to have been caught unaware of the possibility of the result reached herein in light of the prior litigation before the board and the appellate courts in <em>Arp, </em>which dates back to 1975, and the matter herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The decision of the board is annulled and the matter remanded to the board for such further proceedings as are consistent with our opinion herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Jefferson (Bernard), P. J., and Hanson (Thaxton), J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-11\">By Statutes 1976, chapter 1017, section 6, page 4595, the death benefit was increased to $50,000 with $55,000 for a \u201csurviving widow and one or more dependent minor children.\u201d The parties agree that this increased death benefit does not apply here and that the amount of death benefit is set at the time of injury not the time of death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-12\">Labor Code section 4703 provides: \u201cSubject to the provisions of section 4704, this section shall determine the right to a death benefit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>\u201cIf there is any person wholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee, such person shall receive the entire death benefit, and any person partially dependent shall receive no part thereof. \u201cIf there is more than one person wholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee, the death benefit shall be divided equally among them. \u201cIf there is more than one person partially dependent for support upon a deceased employee, and no person wholly dependent for support, the amount allowed as a death benefit shall be divided among the persons so partially dependent in proportion to the relative extent of their dependency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b847-11\">The decision of the board in <em>Beauchamp </em>is, of course, not binding upon this court even though we denied a writ of review thereof. <em>(Thrifty Drug Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp.

However, while the ultimate interpretation of a statute is an exercise of the judicial power, the courts have accorded great respect to the board\u2019s statutory interpretations.
