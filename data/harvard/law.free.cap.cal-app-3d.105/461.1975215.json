Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.) and the Knox-Nisbet Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 54773 et seq.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Petitioner, an unincorporated association, filed a petition for writ of mandate to compel respondent Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) of Orange County to set aside its approval of a proposal to annex 3,979 acres of unincorporated territory in northeastern Orange County to the City of Yorba Linda and to enjoin the city from proceeding with the annexation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner alleged that LAFCO failed to conduct an initial study to determine whether the project may have a significant effect on the environment as required by CEQA and failed to give consideration to the factors set forth in the Knox-Nisbet Act before approving the proposal. The trial court granted respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that quo warranto was the only means by which the validity of the annexation could be tested inasmuch as the annexation had been completed before the mandate proceeding was instituted. Petitioner appeals from the ensuing judgment for respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The annexation proceedings were conducted and completed pursuant to the provisions of the Municipal Organization Act of 1977 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 35000 et seq.; hereafter MOA). The city initiated the proceedings on June 5, 1978, by adopting a resolution requesting LAFCO approval of the proposed annexation. The resolution and supporting documents, including a negative declaration, were transmitted to LAFCO. The proposal was set for public hearing before LAFCO for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>July 26, 1978, on which date the hearing was continued to August 9, 1978. Among those who testified at the hearing on August 9 were several individuals who identified themselves as members of petitioner. At the conclusion of the hearing, LAFCO approved the proposal. LAFCO\u2019s resolution recited that the commission had considered the relevant factors, including those1 specified by the Knox-Nisbet Act, and had reviewed and considered the negative declaration issued by the city. On August 21, 1978, the city council adopted a resolution ordering the annexation and transmitted a certified copy to LAFCO. On August 22, 1978, the executive officer of LAFCO prepared, executed and recorded a certificate of completion. Under the terms of MOA, an annexation is completed and becomes effective as of the date of recordation of the certificate of completion. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 35353, 35354.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Petitioner filed the instant mandate proceeding on September 7, 1978. Although no summons, order to show cause or alternative writ was ever issued, in January 1979 respondents answered and moved for dismissal of the action and for summary judgment on the following grounds: (1) An in rem proceeding pursuant to chapter 9, title 10, part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 860 et seq.; hereafter validating statute)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is the exclusive means by which the validity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>a completed annexation under MOA may be tested (Gov. Code, \u00a7 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, therefore, petitioner\u2019s failure to prepare, publish, serve and file proof of service of the summons in the form and within the period required by the validating statute (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 863) compelled dismissal; (2) assuming the nonexclusivity of the remedy provided by the validating statute, a quo warranto proceeding by the Attorney General was the only other means by which the validity of the completed annexation could have been tested; and (3) petitioner lacked standing to maintain the action because it was brought without the authority or consent of its members. Petitioner contended that inasmuch as its attack upon the annexation was grounded on LAFCO\u2019s alleged failure to comply with CEQA and the Knox-Nisbet Act and not for any violation of the provisions of MOA, compliance with the validating statute was not required. Petitioner further argued that quo warranto was not the exclusive remedy because annexation had not been completed when the mandate proceeding was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">At the hearing on the motions for dismissal and for summary judgment, it was established without contradiction that the annexation had been completed more than two weeks before petitioner filed its mandate petition. In the circumstances, the court ruled that quo warranto was the exclusive means by which the validity of the annexation could be tested and granted respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">On this appeal, petitioner contends that although the annexation proceedings were completed before the mandate petition was filed, neither quo warranto nor an action pursuant to the validating statute was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>exclusive remedy. Petitioner argues that inasmuch as the main attack upon LAFCO approval of the annexation proposal was grounded on CEQA violations, mandate was the procedure prescribed by CEQA to review LAFCO\u2019s action. Petitioner contends that Government Code section 35005 making the validating statute the procedure for testing the validity of a completed municipal annexation applies only where the attack is based on asserted violations of MOA and further, assuming the applicability of the validating statutes, that it would be improper to affirm the judgment for petitioner\u2019s failure to pursue that remedy because the trial court based its decision on the sole ground that quo warranto was the exclusive remedy and never passed on the question whether \u201cgood cause\u201d may have existed for petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of the validating statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">For reasons expressed below, we have concluded that the validity of a completed municipal annexation under MOA may be tested only by an in rem proceeding under the validating statute or by a quo warranto proceeding. Since the remedy sought to be invoked was neither, the court properly granted summary judgment in favor of respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Government Code section 35005 provides that any \u201caction to determine the validity of any city incorporation, municipal reorganization, or any city change of organization <em>completed </em>pursuant to [MOA] <em>shall </em>be brought\u201d pursuant to the provisions of the validating statute. (Italics supplied; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 860 et seq.) Code of Civil Procedure section 863 provides that if a validating action has not been brought by the public agency, any interested person may bring an action pursuant to the statute to determine the validity of the matter in question. The summons must be in a prescribed form and must be directed to all persons interested in the matter and to the public agency and must be published for the period and in the manner prescribed by the statute. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 863.) If the person bringing the action fails to complete the publication of the summons and to give such other notice as the court may require and to file proof thereof \u201cwithin 60 days from the filing of his complaint, the action shall be forthwith dismissed on the motion of the public agency unless good cause for such failure is shown by the interested person.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 863.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Apparently under the misapprehension that the annexation had not been completed,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> petitioner disregarded the mandate of Government Code section 35005. Instead of bringing an in rem action under the validating statute, it brought an in personam mandate proceeding. One of the grounds on which respondents sought dismissal and summary judgment was petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the validating statute within the period prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure section 863. Petitioner nevertheless made no attempt to show \u201cgood cause\u201d for failure to comply with the validating statute .or to seek relief from default for its failure to do so. On the record before it, therefore, if the validating statute governed, the trial court was required to dismiss the action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 863. <em>(Community Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 164, 174 [56 Cal.Rptr. 201].)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Petitioner contends, however, that it was not required to proceed under the validating statute because the attack upon LAFCO\u2019s approval of the annexation proposal was based on CEQA violations. The contention lacks merit. If the annexation had not been completed as petitioner mistakenly thought, the mandate procedure utilized by petitioner would have been proper. (See <em>Bozung </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 271-272 [118 Cal.Rptr. 249, 529 P.2d 1017].) But since the annexation was completed and effective before the action was filed, the only method of testing the validity of the annexation, whatever the basis for the challenge, was either an action in compliance with the validating statute or a quo warranto proceeding by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Important policy considerations underlie the MOA requirement that a completed annexation be tested by an in rem proceeding under the validating statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A uniform procedure for prompt resolution of the validity of a completed annexation by an in rem action is necessary in order to settle any questions respecting the city\u2019s jurisdiction over the annexed territory, including any uncertainties respecting the applicable land use regulations, or the city\u2019s responsibility to provide police, fire and other municipal services to the area. The procedure prescribed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the validating statute assures due process notice to all interested persons and settles the validity of the annexation once and for all by a single lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Petitioner argues that CEQA governs the nature of the action to be utilized because it is a special statute whose provisions prevail over the general validating statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the first place, while CEQA prescribes the scope of judicial review (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21168, 21168.5), it does not make mandamus the exclusive procedure by which the validity of a governmental action may be challenged for alleged violation of its provisions. Attacks upon governmental actions on CEQA grounds have been mounted and considered in actions for injunction (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>County of Kern </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 830 [115 Cal.Rptr. 67]; <em>Residents Ad Hoc Stadium Committee </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 274 [152 Cal.Rptr. 585]), and declaratory relief (e.g., <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 34 [122 Cal.Rptr. 464, 76 A.L.R.3d 1210]; <em>Residents Ad Hoc Stadium Committee </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.3d 274). In <em>Bozung </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 263, 271-272, the Supreme Court implicitly recognized quo warranto proceedings as a means of testing the validity of a municipal annexation on CEQA grounds. More importantly, it is the nature of the governmental action being challenged rather than the basis for the challenge that determines the procedure to be utilized. Although grounded on alleged violation of CEQA, petitioner\u2019s action is one seeking to invalidate a completed municipal annexation; it is not just an action to review and set aside LAFCO approval of a proposed annexation. Petitioner should have proceeded under the validating statute and its action was subject to dismissal for failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that the judgment may not be affirmed on the ground it failed to follow the procedure prescribed by the validating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>statute because that was not the ground on which the trial court based its decision is likewise without merit.  It is a settled principle of appellate review that a trial court\u2019s ruling or decision which is correct in law will not be disturbed on appeal merely because it was given for a wrong reason; if the decision is \u201c\u2018right upon any theory of the law applicable to the case, it must be sustained regardless of the considerations which may have moved the trial court to its conclusion.\u2019\u201d <em>(D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 19 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10], quoting <em>Davey </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1931) 116 Cal. 325, 329 [48 P. 117]; <em>Estate of Cooke </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 595, 605 [129 Cal.Rptr. 354].)  As we pointed out earlier, one of respondents\u2019 grounds for the motion to dismiss and for summary judgment was petitioner\u2019s failure to proceed under the validating statute. Although petitioner had the opportunity to do so, it did not seek to be relieved from its failure to comply with the validating statute or make any attempt to show good cause for noncompliance. Furthermore unlike <em>City of Ontario </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 335, 345 [85 Cal.Rptr. 149, 466 P.2d 693], the question whether the validating statute applies to the present case does not present \u201ca complex and debatable\u201d issue. Government Code section 35005 is' clear and explicit; it provides that an action to \u201cdetermine the validity of.. .any city change of organization <em>completed </em>pursuant to this part shall be brought pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 860) of Title 10 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The only means other than the validating statute by which the completed annexation could have been tested was the traditional quo warranto proceeding by the Attorney General in the name of the People of the State of California.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Before the enactment of MOA, quo warranto was the only means by which the validity of an annexation could be tested after it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>completed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>City of Palm Springs </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 38, 41 [331 P.2d 4]; <em>Amer. Distl. Co. </em>v. <em>City Council, Sausalito, </em>34 Cal.2d 660, 667 [212 P.2d 704, 18 A.L.R.2d 1247]; <em>City of Campbell </em>v. <em>Mosk </em>(1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 640, 646 [17 Cal.Rptr. 584]; <em>Hazelton </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1960) 183 Cal.App.2d 131, 135 [6 Cal.Rptr. 723].) Once the annexation has been completed, \u201cthe territory becomes incorporated within the city and a corporation de facto is created and \u2018none but the State can call its existence in question.\u2019 [Citation.] A private individual has no legal capacity to attack the fixing or extension of municipal limits. His sole remedy is in quo warranto.\u201d <em>(Hazelton </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.2d 131, 135.) The foregoing principle was unaffected by the enactment of CEQA. (See <em>Bozung </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 263, 271-272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Although MOA now affords an interested private individual a means of testing the validity of a completed annexation, this does not preclude a quo warranto proceeding. The availability of other statutory remedies ordinarily does not foreclose a proceeding in the nature of quo warranto by the Attorney General. (See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Hitchcock </em>(1900) 129 Cal. 325, 326-327 [61 P. 1076]; <em>Citizens Utilities Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 399, 405 [128 Cal.Rptr. 582].) The proceeding brought by petitioner was manifestly not one in quo warranto.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Petitioner having failed to pursue either of the two proper remedies to test the validity of the completed annexation, the court properly granted respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Gardner, P.

In addition, prior to completion of such publication, the agency shall, to the extent which the court finds reasonably practicable, give notice of the pendency of the proceeding by mail or other means ordered by the court.\u201d Code of Civil Procedure section 861.1 provides: \u201cThe summons shall be directed to \u2018all persons interested in the matter of [specifying the matter],\u2019 shall contain a notice to all persons interested in the matter to appear and answer the complaint not later than the date specified in the summons, which date shall be 10 or more days after the completion of publication of the summons. Except as otherwise specified in this section such summons shall be in the form prescribed in Section 412.20.\u201d Code of Civil Procedure section 862 provides: \u201cJurisdiction shall be complete after the date specified in the summons.

In any such action the summons shall be in the form prescribed in Section 861.1 except that in addition to being directed to \u2018all persons interested in the matter of [specifying the matter],\u2019 it shall also be directed to the public agency. If the interested person bringing such action fails to complete the publication and such other notice as may be prescribed by the court in accordance with Section 861 and to file proof thereof in the action within 60 days from the filing of his complaint, the action shall be forthwith dismissed on the motion of the public agency unless good cause for such failure is shown by the interested person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Government Code section 35005 provides: \u201cAn action to determine the validity of any city incorporation, municipal reorganization, or any city change of organization completed pursuant to this part shall be brought pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 860) of Title 10 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b405-6\">ln its points and authorities in opposition to the motion to dismiss and for summary judgment, petitioner argued that mandate was the proper remedy because the annexation had not been completed when the action was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\">An action under the validating statute is \u201cin the nature of a proceeding in rem.\u201d (Code Civ.

In the case at bench, there is no statute of limitations issue; respondents do not contend that petitioner\u2019s action was not timely filed. Nor is there any conflict between the two statutes respecting the procedural requirements of the validating statute. We find no inconsistency in the requirements of the two statutes. It should also be noted that <em>Walters </em>was not an action to test the validity of a completed city annexation. It is doubtful whether the <em>Walters </em>dictum should extend to such actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Code of Civil Procedure section 803 provides: \u201cAn action may be brought by the attorney-general, in the name of the people of this state, upon his own information, or upon a complaint of a private party, against any person who usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises any public office, civil or military, or any franchise, or against any corporation, either de jure or de facto, which usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises any franchise, within this state. And the attorney-general must bring the action, whenever he has reason to believe that any such office or franchise has been usurped, intruded into, or unlawfully held or exercised by any person, or when he is directed to do so by the governor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
