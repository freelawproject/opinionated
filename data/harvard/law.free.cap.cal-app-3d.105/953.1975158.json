J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aul\">Steven J. Kennedy, the owner of a contiguous lot, appeals from a judgment denying his petition for a writ of mandate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>require the City of Hayward (City) to set aside an order of its planning commission (Commission) approving a lot split application. The real parties in interest are First Ridgewood Company (First Ridgewood), the developer, and Betsy Bracy and Gail Jacobs, the owners of one of the parcels created by the lot split. We have concluded that the judgment must be reversed, as Kennedy was deprived of his due process rights to notice and a hearing pursuant to <em>Horn </em>v. <em>County of Ventura (1979) 24 </em>Cal.3d 605 [156 Cal.Rptr. 718, 596 P.2d 1134], and as the court below applied a traditional mandamus standard of review rather than the applicable administrative mandamus standard <em>(Horn, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The record reveals the following pertinent chronology: In 1972, First Ridgewood obtained approval from the City for a subdivision map of tract 3432.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lot 4, of the total of 17 lots comprising this tract, was left undeveloped but subject to future development by way of lot splits. Lot 4 is an undeveloped hillside lot consisting of 17 acres and comprising the north wall of a canyon. Hayward Area Recreation and Park District owns an easement through lot 4 used for horseback riding and hiking. Kennedy owns and resides on a parcel contiguous to lot 4 on the southern rim of the canyon.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">On March 1, 1977, First Ridgewood filed its application for a tentative parcel map dividing lot 4 into four separate lots<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to the City\u2019s real estate subdivision regulation (Mun. Code, art. 3, \u00a7 10). Approval of the map was a \u201cproject\u201d within the meaning of Public Resources Code .section 21065, a part of the California Environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>Quality Act (CEQA), set forth below,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a \u201cdiscretionary project\u201d within the meaning of California Administrative Code, title 14, section 15024, also set forth below.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">In CEQA, the Legislature sought to protect the environment by the establishment of administrative procedures drafted to \u201c[e]nsure that the long term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21001, subd. (d)). To achieve these objectives, CEQA and the state implementing guidelines establish a three-tiered structure of determinations. As a threshold matter, if a project is categorically exempt by administrative regulation (see Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21084, 21085) or if the local agency determines that \u201cit can be seen with certainty.. .that the activity in question may not have a significant effect on the environment\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 14, \u00a7 15060), no further agency evaluation is required. Moreover, neither the further requirements of CEQA nor the guidelines of the California Administrative Code, title 14, concerning the evaluation of projects and the preparation and review of environmental documents apply <em>(No Oil, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74 [118 Cal.Rptr. 34, 529 P.2d 66]).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Here, the environmental determination was made pursuant to California Administrative Code, title 14, section 15060, set forth below<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>(State Environmental Guidelines) and section 3.1, subdivision (a) of the City guidelines, also set forth below.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Between March 1, 1977, and June 24, 1977, M. Carash, the City\u2019s senior planner, visited the property and reviewed: 1) referral responses from the public works department and other agencies; 2) aerial photographs of the site; 3) the lot split map; 4) comparable development in the immediate area; 5) the 1972 EIR; and 6) the applicability of other City procedures to insure safety and appropriateness of the proposed lot split.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Applying the above quoted state and city guidelines, Carash determined that the proposed split of lot 4 \u201cwill not have a significant effect on the environment\u201d and, therefore, was not subject to CEQA. Under the applicable provisions of the City subdivision ordinance, set forth below,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Carash\u2019s determination could have become final without any action whatsoever by the Commission or a notice or hearing to anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>In the case of lot 4, however, in order to \u201cmaximize public awareness of the project,\u201d Carash sent the lot split application to the Commission for its consideration and approval. On June 1, 1977, although neither the City nor the Commission was required by law to provide notice of the pendency of the application, a copy of the application was provided to the Woodland Estates Homeowners Association (Association), of which Kennedy was automatically a member as a result of the covenants and conditions of the subdivision in which his home is located. The Association asked for details of the proposed development and a one-month continuance of the hearing to review the application. The City responded summarily that no continuance would be granted, since no further information had been submitted on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">The tentative parcel map was then approved by the Commission at a duly held regular meeting on June 30, 1977. Although general notice of the Commission meeting was given to various members of the general public, no specific notice of the lot split application was given. An Association representative was present. No notice of the Commission\u2019s meeting was given to Kennedy. No findings were made by the Commission. The time to appeal the Commission\u2019s decision expired on July 10, 1977; no appeal was filed. Immediately after the expiration of the appeal period, First Ridgewood, sold one of the lots to Bracy and Jacobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Kennedy learned of the lot split on Saturday, August 20, 1977. On Monday, August 22, Kennedy discovered that no EIR or negative declaration had been filed, and wrote a letter to the city attorney. On September 23, 1977, he filed his petition for a writ of mandate, alleging that by approving the lot split without an EIR or negative declaration,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>the City had not complied with CEQA and that by the Commission\u2019s action, he had been deprived of his due process rights to notice and a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">At the hearing, it was determined that the proceeding was one for traditional mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. Kennedy adduced expert evidence of subsidence and soil slippage and slide problems that would be exacerbated by the proposed lot split. Kennedy\u2019s expert Pilecki opined that the development of lot 4 could jeopardize the entire area, including existing homes on the south ridge of the canyon.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Another owner testified about two landslides that had damaged property on the south ridge and other subsidence and slide problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Carash indicated that the environmental considerations raised by Kennedy were not \u201csignificant.\u201d The City engineer, who reviewed the excavation, soils and grading aspects of the building permit issued to Bracy and Jacobs, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The court viewed the property and then applied the traditional mandamus test of Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 to conclude that: 1) there was no substantial evidence known or presented to Carash or the court that the proposed lot split would have a significant effect on the environment; 2) no notice of the Commission\u2019s meeting was given and none was required; and 3) the City did not abuse its discretion in approving the lot split.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Subsequently, our Supreme Court decided <em>Horn </em>v. <em>County of Ventura, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 605, which involved a similar lot split into four parcels. In <em>Horn, </em>as here, an adjoining property owner complained that the local agency\u2019s environmental review processes were constitutionally inadequate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\n                   Our Supreme Court agreed and held (at p. 612) that due process principles require reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before governmental deprivation of a significant property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>The court then further indicated at page 612 that only adjudicative governmental processes (as distinct from legislative ones) were subject to procedural due process principles. The court then pointed out at page 614 that since subdivision approvals, like variances and conditional use permits, involved the application of general standards to specific parcels of real property, affected relatively few and were determined by facts peculiar to the individual case, they were adjudicatory in nature.  The court held at page 614 that subdivision approvals were subject to the adequate findings requirement of <em>Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12], and were to be reviewed by the administrative mandamus standard of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">The court, at 24 Cal.3d page 615, rejected a contention that subdivision approvals are purely \u201cministerial\u201d acts, reasoning that they involve \u201cthe exercise of judgment, and the careful balancing of conflicting interests, the hallmark of the adjudicative process. The expressed opinions of the affected landowners might very well be persuasive to those public officials who make the decisions, and affect the outcome of the subdivision process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The court then further held, at page 615, that land use decisions which \u201csubstantially affect\u201d the property rights of owners of adjacent parcels <em>may </em>constitute \u201cdeprivations\u201d of property within the context of procedural due process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, whenever approval of a tentative subdivision map will constitute a substantial or significant deprivation of the property rights of other landowners, the affected persons are entitled to a reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard <em>before </em>the approval occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number><em>Horn, supra, </em>compels the conclusion that here, Kennedy, as an adjacent owner, was deprived of a significant property interest without due process. As indicated above, the City determined that the lot split was exempt from CEQA. Once this determination of threshold exemption is made, no further action by the local agency is required under CEQA as none of the CEQA requirements or procedures apply. Further, under the applicable provisions of the City\u2019s subdivision ordinance, the senior planner\u2019s environmental determination and his subsequent lot split approval could have become final without any action whatsoever by the planning commission. As a matter of grace, notice of the pending lot split was given to the Association prior to its final approval. The Commission then declined any further input from the Association or the public generally, and without further notice to Kennedy or other adjacent landowners, voted to approve the lot split. The City\u2019s procedures here also did not guarantee an affected landowner a meaningful predeprivation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of the inadequacy of the particular notice and hearing requirements in <em>Horn, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at pages 617-618, are particularly apt here and dispose of the City\u2019s argument that the notice, in fact, given to the Association, and the presence of the Association\u2019s representative at the Commission hearing sufficiently protected Kennedy\u2019s due process rights. The court, at page 617, emphasized that independent of CEQA proceedings, the directly affected owner is entitled to a hearing that focuses on his particular concerns and the general feasibility and desirability of the project.  The court continued as follows: \u201cThe general application of due process principles is flexible, depending on the nature of the competing interests involved. [Citations.]  The extent of administrative burden is one of the factors to be considered in determining the nature of an appropriate notice. [Citations.] However, where, as here, prior notice of a potentially adverse decision is constitutionally required, that notice must, at a minimum, be reasonably calculated to afford affected persons the realistic opportunity to protect their interests. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The court pointed to the inadequacy of the mail-request and central-posting methods of notice in issue, and continued at page 618: \u201cWhile such posting and mailing may well suffice to encourage the generalized public participation in the environmental decision making contemplated by CEQA, they are inadequate to meet due process standards where fundamental interests are substantially affected. Those persons significantly affected by a proposed subdivision cannot reasonably be expected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>to place themselves on a mailing list or \u2018haunt\u2019 county offices on the off-hand chance that a pending challenge to those interests will thereby be revealed. <em>Other forms of notice appear better calculated to apprise directly affected persons of a pending decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">\u201cWe deliberately refrain from describing a specific formula which details the nature, content, and timing of the requisite notice. Rather, we leave to the affected local governments these determinations. We do observe, however, that depending on (1) the magnitude of the project, and (2) the degree to which a particular landowner\u2019s interests may be affected, acceptable techniques might include notice by mail to the owners of record of property situate within a designated radius of the subject property, or by the posting of notice at or near the project site, or both. <em>Notice must, of course, occur sufficiently prior to a final decision to permit a \u2018meaningful\u2019 predeprivation hearing to affected </em>landowners.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Rouse, J., and Smith, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-6\">An environmental impact report (EIR) was prepared and considered prior to the City approval of the 1972 subdivision of tract 3432. The 1972 EIR stated in pertinent part: \u201cThe proposed development would provide single family residences on all parcels except No. 4, which would remain essentially in its present natural state.\u201d The EIR also noted that \u201cParcel 4, including about 17 acres, is heavily covered with trees and brush, and has the steepest slopes in the tract,\u201d and further noted that \u201cParcel 4 is steep and not intended for development.\u201d The 1972 EIR concluded as follows: \u201cImaginative planning, increased productivity due to irrigation, and the preservation of parcel 4 in its natural condition will provide a substantial net enhancement of wildlife values in this area.\u201d Neither an easement of the Hayward Area Recreation and Park District nor the area\u2019s soil subsidence problems were indicated in the 1972 EIR.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-9\">City subdivision regulations designate a subdivision into four parcels or less as a \u201clot split\u201d which, therefore, <em>exempts </em>the instant lot split from the Subdivision Map Act which governs \u201call subdivisions creating five or more parcels ...\u201d (Gov.
