Petitioner Thelma Boling brought the action to recover damages for the allegedly wrongful death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>of her son. Real party in interest Economy Medical Equipment Company, Inc., one of the defendants, moved respondent court for an order requiring a hospital to produce certain records pertaining to the decedent. Petitioner opposed the motion as to parts of the records, claiming the psychotherapist-patient privilege. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1010 et seq.) Respondent court rejected her claim of privilege, granted real party\u2019s motion, and filed a formal discovery order directing the hospital to produce all of its records pertaining to the decedent. Plaintiff thereupon petitioned this court for a writ of mandate annulling the order on the ground of the privilege claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Pretrial resort to a prerogative writ is proper in these circumstances. <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 330, 335-336 [107 Cal.Rptr. 309, 508 P.2d 309].) We therefore issued an alternative writ of mandate. Real party in interest has not made a return, but it had previously filed extensive opposition to the petition pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 56(b). It also appeared at oral argument of the cause. The record made below was fully presented with the petition. We may accordingly proceed with the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The record must be summarized in some detail because it presents statutory and procedural complications which both parties have ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The Action</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The pertinent procedural sequence commenced when petitioner (hereinafter plaintiff) filed an amended complaint in her action. The defendants named in it are Lois Denzer Lundquist (who is not a party to the present proceeding) and real party in interest. The amended complaint pleads five counts, in each of which plaintiff states a cause of action for the wrongful death of Mark Wayne Boling, her son, on November 28, 1978. In the first count, plaintiff charges Lundquist with liability by alleging that her son died as the result of injuries he received in an automobile accident proximately caused by Lundquist\u2019s negligence on August 7, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Each of the remaining four counts charges real party in interest (hereinafter defendant) with liability for the allegedly wrongful death. Plaintiff alleges in each that the decedent had rented a \u201cbed, mattress, sheets and blankets\u201d from defendant for use in his home while he was recovering from injuries he had received in the automobile accident on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>August 7, 1978; that defendant had \u201cnegligently and carelessly designed, manufactured, tested, inspected,... and installed\u201d the rented bed and bedding, with the result that they were \u201cdefective in that they were highly flammable\u201d; that the decedent, \u201cwhile. ..reclining upon the bed in his home\u201d on November 28, 1978, was thereby \u201ccaused to be entrapped in a fire in the said bed\u201d; and that its \u201chigh flammability\u201d directly and proximately resulted in his \u201cburning to death at said time and place.\u201d The four counts are otherwise worded to state causes of action against defendant on the respective theories of negligence, strict products liability, and breach of express and implied warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Plaintiff alleges in each of the five counts that she brings the action as the \u201cnatural mother\u201d and \u201csole surviving heir\u201d of the decedent, and that \u201cas a direct and proximate result\u201d of the wrongful conduct charged to the respective defendant she has been \u201cdeprived of the care, comfort, society, support, companionship and consortium of her son, Mark Wayne Boling, all to her general damage in an amount within the jurisdictional limits\u201d of respondent court. She does not allege that she is the executrix or administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Defendant\u2019s Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The full record made on the motion to compel production of hospital records supports the following recitals:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Mark Wayne Boling was admitted to El Camino Hospital on August 7, 1978, for treatment of injuries he had received in the automobile accident which had involved Lundquist on that date. He was discharged from the hospital on a subsequent date not shown. While he was subsequently recovering from his injuries at home, he used a hospital bed that had been rented from defendant. When he was in the bed on November 28, 1978, it caught fire and he was burned to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">After plaintiff had filed her amended complaint in the wrongful death action, defendant caused El Camino Hospital to be served with a subpoena duces tecum directing it to deliver all its records of the decedent\u2019s hospitalization to Robert A. Cook, a notary public, for inspection by defendant and copying. The hospital\u2019s custodian of records informed Cook by letter that certain \u201cinformation\u201d shown in the records would be \u201cwithheld\u201d because it was protected against disclosure by Welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>and Institutions Code section 5328 and the psychotherapist-patient privilege.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The motion to compel production of the records was made after the hospital\u2019s response to the subpoena had been communicated to defendant by notary public Cook. Defendant stated in its notice of the motion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">The motion was \u201cfor an order requiring plaintiff and El Camino Hospital to produce <em>all </em>medical records... pertaining to <em>all </em>treatment rendered to Mark Wayne Boling, plaintiff\u2019s decedent, at El Camino Hospital,... and to permit inspection and photocopying by the attorneys for defendant ] or a representative from Robert A. Cook, Notary Public. [\u00b6] This motion is based on the grounds that these documents, and all of them, constitute or contain evidence material and relevant to this action and that they are not privileged.... [\u00b6] [S]aid records are needed in connection with the defense of the pending matter herein and are necessary to the administration of justice.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The notice of motion was addressed on its face to \u201cplaintiff and to her attorneys of record and to El Camino Hospital,\u201d but the record does not show that the moving papers were served on the hospital. Plaintiff filed nothing in opposition to the motion, on which respondent court heard brief oral argument. No appearance was made on behalf of El Camino Hospital. Defendant\u2019s attorney argued that the hospital\u2019s so-called \u201cpsychiatric records\u201d were discoverable because they were not privileged. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney had not seen them, and he had no idea what they showed, but he in effect claimed the psychotherapist-patient privilege on the basis of the hospital\u2019s view that it applied. (See fn. 1 and the accompanying text, <em>ante.) </em>No one mentioned Welfare and Institutions Code section 5328, which the hospital had cited as an alternative basis for nondisclosure of the so-called \u201cpsychiatric records.\u201d (See <em>ibid.) </em>Respondent court accepted defendant\u2019s view that the records were not privileged, and granted the motion from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>On September 26, 1979, the court filed a formal discovery order entitled \u201cOrder For Disclosure Of Information And Records Pursuant To Welfare And Institutions Code \u00a7 5328(f).\u201d The order directs that \u201call original records of El Camino Hospital...relating to plaintiffs decedent, Mark Wayne Boling, be submitted... pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code \u00a7 5328(f) and that they may be in the administration of justice in this case copied by Robert A. Cook, Notary Public..., as representative for defendant.... \u201d Plaintiff challenges this order in the present proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">We have concluded that the discovery order cannot stand on the present record, and that a peremptory writ of mandate must be issued as prayed. Our reasons are stated under the captions enumerated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">(1) <em>The Psychotherapist-patient Privilege</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The parties pursue the positions expressed by their respective attorneys at the oral argument in respondent court, which was effectively limited to plaintiffs claim of the psychotherapist-patient privilege. It is undisputed that her deceased son was the \u201cpatient\u201d for purposes of the privilege. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 1011 [defining \u201cpatient\u201d].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff claims it, as to El Camino Hospital\u2019s \u201cpsychiatric records\u201d concerning him, pursuant to section 1014.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant stands on its view (and respondent court\u2019s) that the decedent\u2019s mental condition is relevant because it has been placed in issue by plaintiffs wrongful death action as such, and that the \u201cpsychiatric records\u201d are consequently not privileged by reason of the exception provided in section 1016, subdivision (d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Resolution of this aspect of the proceeding is complicated by the fact that neither party knows what is in the records involved: defendant\u2019s attorneys have not been entitled to see them, plaintiff\u2019s have not bothered to examine them. Accepting the hospital\u2019s word that \u201cinformation\u201d in them is subject to the psychotherapist-patient privilege (see fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>plaintiff necessarily assumes that the \u201cinformation\u201d includes a record of at least one \u201cconfidential communication between patient and psychotherapist\u201d which is protected by the privilege. (See fn. 3, <em>ante; </em>see also \u00a7 1012 [defining the protected communication].)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Respondent court explicitly assumed that fact at the oral argument on the discovery motion. The fact is fairly shown in the statement of the custodian of records to the notary public (see fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>and defendant did not dispute it. Once the existence of pertinent \u201ccommunications\u201d had been shown in that manner, defendant made no attempt to carry its burden of refuting their confidentiality. (See \u00a7 917.) For these reasons, and-Represent purposes, we conclude that El Camino Hospital\u2019s \u201cpsychiatric \u2019records\u201d concerning the decedent include documentation of \u201cconfidential communications\u201d which are subject to the psychotherapist-patient privilege by their nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We turn to defendant\u2019s argument that the privilege does not exist in the present action because of the pertinent exception provided in section 1016, subdivision (d). (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>The challenged order reflects respondent court\u2019s view that the privilege does not apply because, in the express terms of the statute, the \u201ccommunications\u201d involved are \u201crelevant to an issue concerning the mental or emotional condition of the patient\u201d which has been \u201ctendered\u201d by plaintiff in \u201can action brought under Section 376... of the Code of Civil Procedure for damages for the...death of the patient.\u201d (See <em>ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">This view rests on the premise that plaintiff\u2019s commencement of the action operated as an automatic waiver of the privilege. The Supreme Court has rejected the substance of the premise in decisions involving claims of the psychotherapist-patient privilege in actions brought by liv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ing patients. <em>(In re Lifschutz </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 415 [85 Cal.Rptr. 829, 467 P.2d 557, 44 \u00c1.L.R.3d 1]; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 330; <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 844 [143 Cal.Rptr. 695, 574 P.2d 766].) The <em>Lifschutz </em>court approached the problem by analyzing the medical and social values underlying the privilege. <em>(In re Lifschutz, supra, </em>at pp. 431-435.) The court then held as follows: \u201cIn light of these considerations, the \u2018automatic\u2019 waiver of privilege contemplated by section 1016 must be construed not as a complete waiver of the privilege but only as a limited waiver concomitant with the purposes of the exception. Under section 1016 disclosure can be compelled only with respect to <em>those mental conditions </em>the patient-litigant has \u2018disclose[d].. .by bringing an action in which <em>they </em>are in issue\u2019 [citation]; communications which are not directly relevant to those specific conditions do not fall within the terms of section 1016\u2019s exception and therefore remain privileged. Disclosure cannot be compelled with respect to other aspects of the patient-litigant\u2019s personality even though they may, in some sense, be \u2018relevant\u2019 to the substantive issues of litigation. The patient thus is not obligated to sacrifice all privacy to seek redress for a specific mental or emotional injury; <em>the scope of the inquiry permitted depends upon the nature of the injuries which the patient-litigant himself has brought before the court\u201d </em>(2 Cal.3d at p. 435 [final italics added; remaining italics in original; fn. omitted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Because the actions involved in <em>Lifschutz, Roberts, </em>and <em>Britt </em>had been brought by living patients who were literally \u201cpatient-litigants,\u201d these decisions essentially hold that the mere commencement of an action by such a person is not an \u201cautomatic waiver\u201d of the psychotherapist-patient privilege pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 1016. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>This case therefore presents the further question whether the decisions command the same result where the patient has died and the action is one defined in subdivision (d) of the statute. (See <em>ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">As defendant points out, the nature of plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death action suggests a substantial likelihood that she has \u201ctendered\u201d some issues to which the records in question are \u201crelevant,\u201d within the meaning of section 1016, subdivision (d), because they will inevitably involve the decedent\u2019s mental or emotional condition in his lifetime. Thus far, however, she has \u201ctendered\u201d them in the allegation of general damages she has made in her amended complaint alone. As framed there, they might entail her loss of the decedent\u2019s personal \u201csociety\u201d and \u201ccompan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ionship\u201d in one direction, or of his economic contribution to her \u201ccare\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d in another, or combinations and variations of both. (See 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Torts, \u00a7 891, pp. 3180-3181 [scope of damages recoverable for wrongful death].) The open-ended array of these possibilities, at the pleading stage of her action, similarly precludes \u201cautomatic,\u201d first-instance disregard of the medical and social values which the psychotherapist-patient privilege is uniquely designed to protect. (See <em>In re Lifschutz, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 415 at pp. 431-435; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 330 at pp. 339-340 and fn. 3; <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 844 at pp. 863-864.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The above-quoted reasoning of the <em>Lifschutz </em>court speaks to \u201csection 1016\u201d at large, without limitation to any of its subdivisions. (See <em>In re Lifschutz, supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d 415 at p. 435.) The recorded history of the pertinent privilege statutes indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent to effectuate good cause for the survival of the psychotherapist-patient privilege on the death of the patient, and for its subsequent exercise or waiver as the \u201cinterest\u201d of his \u201cestate\u201d might warrant. (See Cal. Law Revision Com. coms, to Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1013 and 993, 29B West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (1966 ed.) pp. 620, 597-598.) There is accordingly no reason that the mere commencement of an action for his wrongful death should operate as an \u201cautomatic waiver\u201d of the privilege. The commencement of plaintiff\u2019s action did not in itself have that effect, and the privilege may still be claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">According to the present record, however, it has not yet been claimed by anyone with standing to assert it. Section 1014 permits the psychotherapist-patient privilege to be claimed by the \u201cholder of the privilege\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (a)), or by a person claiming it with the holder\u2019s authorization (subd. (b)), or by the psychotherapist in certain limited circumstances (subd. (c)), but by no one else. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>Petitioner made it clear in respondent court that it was she who was claiming it. She was accordingly required to show that she is the \u201cholder of the privilege\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (a) of section 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">For purposes of the psychotherapist-patient privilege, the term \u201cholder of the privilege\u201d is defined in section 1013.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Subdivision (c) of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>section limits the meaning of the term to the \u201cpersonal representative of the patient\u201d in this case because the \u201cpatient\u201d (plaintiff\u2019s son) is dead. The term \u201cpersonal representative of the patient\u201d is not expressly defined in the psychotherapist-patient privilege statutes (see \u00a7\u00a7 1010-1028), nor elsewhere in the Evidence Code (see div. 2 [Definitions], commencing with \u00a7 100), but pertinent historical sources support the conclusion that the Legislature intended the term to mean the patient\u2019s \u201cexecutor,\u201d or \u201cadministrator,\u201d as those titles would conventionally be used in association with his <em>estate. </em>(See Cal. Law Revision Com. com. to Evid. Code, \u00a7 953, 29B West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (1966 ed.) pp. 543-544 [referring to the term \u201cpersonal representative\u201d in the indistinguishable context of the lawyer-client privilege].) Other sources uniformly construe the term in that sense. (See Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (Cont.Ed.Bar 1972) \u00a7 38.1, com., p. 654; Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7 798, par. (c), p. 743 [lawyer-client privilege]; see also 33 C.J.S., Executors and Administrators, \u00a7 3, pp. 878-879 [defining and discussing the term \u201cpersonal representative\u201d generally].)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Plaintiff did not show that she is the decedent\u2019s \u201cpersonal representative\u201d in that sense. The fact is neither alleged nor imported in her amended complaint. Her attorney casually referred to her as \u201cthe personal representative\u201d when he was arguing defendant\u2019s motion, but he did not establish that she is her son\u2019s executrix or administratrix. She thus failed to show that she was the \u201cholder of the privilege\u201d within the meaning of section 1013, subdivision (c), which meant that she did not validly claim it pursuant to section 1014, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">At that point, however, the records in question remained \u201csubject to a claim of privilege\u201d within the meaning of section 916, subdivision (a), and subject to discovery pursuant to subdivision (b) of that section <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Respondent court was not \u201cinstructed\u201d to \u201cpermit disclosure\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the records by any \u201cperson authorized\u201d to do so. Defendant (the \u201cproponent of the evidence\u201d) made no attempt to establish that there was \u201cno person authorized to claim the privilege in <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For these reasons in combination, subdivision (b) of section 916 did not apply to permit discovery of the records when plaintiff\u2019s claim of the privilege failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">El Camino Hospital is the \u201cperson from whom the information is sought\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (a)(1) of section 916, but it is not a \u201cperson authorized to claim the privilege\u201d within that meaning unless it is \u201cauthorized. . .by the holder of the privilege.\u201d (\u00a7 1014, subd. (b).) Subdivision (a)(1) does not apply because the latter fact was not shown. The hospital was also not a \u201cparty to the proceeding\u201d initiated by defendant\u2019s motion (see fn. 6, <em>ante) </em>because there was no proof that it had been given notice and it did not appear at the hearing. The failure of plaintiffs claim of the privilege consequently meant that there was then \u201cno party to the proceeding who is a person authorized to claim the privilege,\u201d and that subdivision (a)(2) did not apply. For failure of either of the conditions it specifies, subdivision (a) operated to reserve the yet-unwaived privilege and to bar the discovery order at that point. The order must therefore be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This result requires a discussion of possible further proceedings in respondent court because it has the limited effect of preserving the confidentiality of the hospital\u2019s \u201cpsychiatric records\u201d for the time being, and pursuant to section 916, subdivision (a), only. They may yet be discoverable by defendant if it is established that there is no person in existence who can claim the psychotherapist-patient privilege. (\u00a7 916, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>subd. (b)(2).) A valid claim of the privilege by plaintiff will preclude discovery, unless and until it is shown that the records are \u201crelevant to an issue concerning the mental or emotional condition of the patient\u201d which has been \u201ctendered\u201d in the action (\u00a7 1016, subd. (d)) and which has been <em>precisely defined </em>in its course. (See <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 20 Cal.3d 844 at pp. 863-864.) If plaintiff validly claims the privilege, she will also assume the burden of showing \u201cirrelevancy\u201d of the records\u2014by private ex parte disclosure to respondent court if necessary\u2014as a prerequisite of its continuing protection. (Cf. <em>In re Lifschutz, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 415 at pp. 436-437; see particularly fn. 23, <em>ibid.) </em>If there are further proceedings in any of these directions, both parties will be required to make a better record than the one produced here.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">(2) <em>Welfare and Institutions Code Section 5328, Subdivision (f)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">This statute provided at pertinent times as follows: \u201c5328. All information and records obtained in the course of providing services under Division 5 (commencing with Section 5000), Division 6 (commencing with Section 6000), or Division 7 (commencing with Section 7000), to either voluntary or involuntary recipients of services shall be confidential. Information and records may be disclosed only:.. . (f) To the courts, as necessary to the administration of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Defendant effectively acknowledged the statute, and undertook to invoke the subdivision (f) exception, by reciting in the notice of its discovery motion that the records in question were \u201cnecessary to the administration of justice.\u201d The challenged discovery order explicitly cites the statute and paraphrases the same recital, but neither the statute nor the exception was mentioned at the hearing on the motion. The order is thus based on the mere assumption that the exception automatically applied if respondent court ruled that the records were not protected by the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Our annulment of the discovery order eliminates the effect of the assumption because it voids the ruling. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>We are nevertheless again required to discuss possible further proceedings because the assumption was unfounded in this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 5328 is \u201ca general prohibition against disclosure..., subject to [certain] exceptions,\u201d and the prohibition operates independently of any of the privileges established by the Evidence Code. <em>(In re S.W. </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 719, 721 [145 Cal.Rptr. 143].) A ruling that information protected by it is not privileged may therefore mean that its disclosure \u201c[t]o the courts\u201d is \u201cnecessary to the administration of justice\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (f) of the statute, but this will only apply as between the parties reached by the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In the present case, the statute imposes the duty of nondisclosure on El Camino Hospital. Its duty will neither be discharged nor exonerated by a ruling to which it is a stranger. Notice to it, which was apparently not given here, is at least a desirable precaution in any discovery proceedings addressed to its records.

Subject to Section 912 and except as otherwise provided in this article, the patient, whether or not a party, has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent another from disclosing, a confidential communication between patient and psychotherapist if the privilege is claimed by: \u201c(a) The holder of the privilege; \u201c(b) A person who is authorized to claim the privilege by the holder of the privilege; or \u201c(c) The person who was the psychotherapist at the time of the confidential communication, but such person may not claim the privilege if there is no holder of the privilege in existence or if he is otherwise instructed by a person authorized to permit disclosure____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-13\">This section provides in full as follows: \u201c1016.

As used in this article [i.e., the article covering the psychotherapist-patient privilege], \u2018holder of the privilege\u2019 means: \u201c(a) The patient when he has no guardian or conservator. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u201c(b) A guardian or conservator of the patient when the patient has a guardian or conservator. \u201c(c) <em>The personal representative of the patient if the patient is dead </em>.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\">The section provides in full as follows: \u201c916.

For purposes of this section, defendant\u2019s motion initiated a \u201cproceeding\u201d in which respondent court was the \u201cpresiding officer.\u201d (See \u00a7\u00a7 901, 905.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b379-12\">Defendant has since filed in this court a declaration, by one of its attorneys, which refers to plaintiff as the \u201cpersonal representative\u201d of the decedent but charges that her \u201cstatus\u201d as such is \u201ca sham and a subterfuge\u201d designed to permit her to make a spurious claim of the psychotherapist-patient privilege. The declaration thus purports to tender issues of fact which are not properly raised in this court. (5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 167, p. 3931.) It also misapprehends the facts and the law relative to plaintiff's \u201cstatus\u201d as a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d for purposes of the privilege, and it entirely misses the point as to whether there is a \u201cperson authorized to claim the privilege in existence.\u201d (See \u00a7 916, subd.
