J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADR\">This appeal raises two issues: (1) whether a juvenile court may impose regular school attendance as a condition of probation following a wardship adjudication under section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) whether such condition may validly require summary detention in the event of noncompliance. We conclude that while school attendance is an appropriate condition of probation, its violation may not be summarily enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">On February 28, 1979, Gerald, then 16 years of age, was adjudicated a ward of the court pursuant to the provisions of section 602. The offense charged was petty theft (a bottle of whiskey). On March 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>1979, a dispositional hearing was held. The probation report considered by the court revealed prior contacts with authorities for curfew violation and public intoxication as well as an unspecified criminal charge pending in another jurisdiction; the report further disclosed a record of irregular school attendance and marked academic underachievement. The probation department recommended that Gerald be placed on formal probation for a period of six months in the custody of his mother, subject to alcohol abuse and family counseling and regular school attendance pursuant to a \u201cspecial school order\u201d imposing limited juvenile hall confinement in the event of one or more unexcused school absences. Following declaration of wardship, the juvenile court placed Gerald on probation subject to the recommended conditions, including the questioned order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In granting probation, the court stated that the special order would become self-executing without further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">At a subsequent hearing clarifying the manner in which the order would be enforced,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it was established that the probation department routinely monitored similar orders by periodically contacting the schools involved and obtaining a list of those affected juveniles with unexcused absences. In the event of such absence, the juvenile is advised to spend the following weekend in juvenile hall; if there has been a second absence, the juvenile is arrested and\u2014without benefit of prior notice to counsel (if any) or hearing\u2014taken directly to juvenile hall to spend the remainder of the week. The parents are routinely notified and responsible for providing any existing medical excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Gerald renews his challenge below based upon the statutory and constitutional grounds discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\n<em>Appealability and Mootness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Preliminarily, we consider the People\u2019s contention that the appeal is premature in the absence of attempted enforcement of the questioned order. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">It is well established that a dispositional order rendered in a section 602 delinquency proceeding constitutes an appealable judgment. (\u00a7 800; <em>In re Melvin S. </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 898, 900 [130 Cal.Rptr. 844]; cf. <em>In re Florance </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 25 [300 P.2d 825]; <em>In re Timothy N. </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 862 [121 Cal.Rptr. 880].) Nor does the fact that a noncustodial probation disposition is involved preclude appellate review. (See <em>In re Dana J. </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 768 [103 Cal.Rptr. 21].) And, it is equally well recognized that the validity of a condition of probation may be challenged by either a collateral or direct attack.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Bushman </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 767, 776-777 [83 Cal.Rptr. 375, 463 P.2d 727]; <em>In re Christopher W. </em>(1973) 29 Cal.App.3d <em>777, </em>783 [105 Cal.Rptr. 775].)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">We may properly assume that the order of probation herein has long since terminated, thus rendering the appeal arguably moot. Nevertheless, we elect to decide the questions presented in view of the established practice below and the likelihood of recurring litigation involving the same issues. (See <em>District Election etc. Committee </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 261, 265-266 [144 Cal.Rptr. 442] and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\n<em>Validity of School Attendance as a Probation Condition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Gerald first argues that the special order conflicts with the statutory scheme implementing a preliminary school board review of habitual truancy. (\u00a7\u00a7 601, subd. (b), 601.1; Ed. Code, \u00a7 48263.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The argument must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>While it is relatively clear that truants are no longer subject to the original jurisdiction of the juvenile court under the amended provisions of section 601 <em>(In re Ronald S. </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 866, 871 [138 Cal.Rptr. 387]), the basis of wardship jurisdiction herein was not Gerald\u2019s truancy but rather the determination of a <em>penal </em>violation under the provisions of section 602\u2014a wholly independent basis of jurisdiction. <em>(In re William S. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 944, 949 [89 Cal.Rptr. 685]; see <em>In re Ronald S., supra.) </em>Thus, the statutory directives of prior referral to the local school attendance review board are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Upon an adjudication of wardship under section 602, the court may place the juvenile in parental custody subject to the supervision of the probation officer (see \u00a7\u00a7 727, 730) and may impose \u201cany and all reasonable conditions that it may determine fitting and proper\u201d in the interests of justice and successful rehabilitation (\u00a7 730; cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.1). Such a condition is valid and enforceable unless it bears no reasonable relationship to the underlying offense or prohibits conduct neither itself criminal in nature nor related to future criminality. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lent </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 481 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545]; <em>In re Bushman, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 767, 777; <em>In re Christopher W., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d <em>777, </em>783-784.) In light of the minor\u2019s history of irregular school attendance, his disobedience of a previous court order to enroll in school and the fact that the theft occurred during normal school hours, we conclude that the section 602 probation order requiring school attendance was both \u201cfitting and proper\u201d and reasonably calculated to serve the ends of justice and to enhance the likelihood of \u201creformation and rehabilitation of the ward.\u201d (\u00a7 730; cf. \u00a7 731 [mandatory professional counseling]; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11373 and 11376 [compulsory attendance in educational programs by narcotics offender].) Nor does Gerald contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Gerald next argues that the special order violates the statutory provision prohibiting locked detention for noncriminal conduct. (\u00a7 207, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He argues that the net effect of the order is to convert a section 601 status offense into a section 602 criminal offense by impermissibly \u201cbootstrapping\u201d an unexcused school absence into a punishable violation. (Cf. <em>In re Mary D. </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 34, 37-38 [156 Cal.Rptr. 829]; <em>In re Ronald S., supra, </em>69 Cal.App.3d 866, 871, 874.) We find the argument unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The limitation on secured detention contained in section 207, subdivision (b) applies where the minor is \u201ctaken into custody <em>solely </em>upon the ground that he is a person described by Section 601 or adjudged to be such or made a ward of the juvenile court <em>solely </em>upon that ground,...\u201d (Italics added.) As noted, Gerald was made a ward of the court by virtue of his criminal conduct under section 602; his potential confinement to juvenile hall arises not from the fact of truancy alone, but as the result of a condition of probation stemming from such criminal conduct. And it is generally recognized that there is no legal impediment to the imposition of brief periods of juvenile hall detention <em>as a condition of probation </em>in section 602 proceedings. (See <em>In re John S. </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 285, 294 [147 Cal.Rptr. 771]; <em>In re Ricardo M. </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 744, 751 [125 Cal.Rptr. 291]; <em>In re Preston B. </em>(1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 607, 611 [78 Cal.Rptr. 436]; <em>In re Bacon </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 34, 63 [49 Cal.Rptr. 322].)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\n<em>Summary Enforcement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Gerald\u2019s principal challenge is directed to the provisions of the order calling for summary detention in juvenile hall on account of a reported absence from school. Relying upon an analogy to established principles applicable to revocation proceedings (see <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli (1973) 411 </em>U.S. <em>778 [36 </em>L.Ed.2d 656, 93 S.Ct. 1756]; <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 471 [33 L.Ed.2d 484, 92 S.Ct. 2593]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vickers </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 451 [105 Cal.Rptr. 305, 503 P.2d 1313]), Gerald claims that the self-executing order invoking automatic confinement without opportunity for hearing is in flagrant disregard of fundamental principles of due process. The analogy is misplaced since the potential confinement herein is based not upon probation <em>revocation </em>or modification proceedings but upon the summary <em>implementation </em>of a condition involving an otherwise appropriate subject matter of probation. Yet the <em>effect </em>of such implementation resulting in a term of involuntary confinement with almost mechanical certitude solely by reason of an uncharged, unproved and noncriminal act is of doubtful validity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 358 [158 Cal.Rptr. 722].) Had the order of probation been limited to compulsory school attendance without more, the prescribed statutory procedure in the event of noncompliance would have been a modification or revocation proceeding \u201csubject to. . .procedural requirements\u201d (\u00a7 775), including the filing of a supplemental petition and a noticed hearing to determine whether the previous order of disposition has proven ineffectual. (See \u00a7 777; <em>In re Glenn K. </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 342, 345-346 [141 Cal.Rptr. 486].) Moreover, if the juvenile court thereafter concluded that probation should be revoked, the court would have been expressly prohibited from ordering the minor\u2019s <em>commitment </em>to the county juvenile hall unless a less restrictive facility was unavailable. (See \u00a7 730;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>In re Debra A. </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 327 [121 Cal.Rptr. 757].) Thus, the special order would operate to completely circumvent the statutory procedural requirements by triggering <em>automatic </em>juvenile hall confinement merely upon a reported unexcused absence from school. Such summary disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>tion and resultant incarceration would indirectly nullify the legislative intent that juvenile hall detention be employed as a last resort (\u00a7 730) and in principle would tend to frustrate the parallel legislative scheme which accords prior noncustodial treatment to habitual truants. (\u00a7\u00a7 601, subd. (b), 601.1; Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 48263, 48265-48268.) We therefore conclude that the challenged order, insofar as it purports to authorize automatic confinement in the county juvenile hall simply upon a reported school absence without medical excuse, is invalid and must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We reverse and remand for such further proceedings as may be appropriate consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Newsom, J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-12\">Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to this code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The challenged order provides; \u201cSPECIAL SCHOOL ORDER; If you cut all or any part of a school day without a valid doctor\u2019s excuse, you will spend the following weekend in Juvenile Hall. Further, if you cut all or any part of a school day more than once during the week, you will spend the remainder of the week plus the weekend in Juvenile Hall.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\">We reject the People\u2019s contention that this part of the record is not properly before us. First, no objection to the clarification proceeding was made below, thus foreclosing such a claim , made for the first time on appeal. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 1000, 1007 [144 Cal.Rptr. 581].) Moreover, the evidentiary proceeding related solely to the clarification of an order clearly affecting the substantial rights of the minor. (Cf. <em>In re Corey </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 813 [41 Cal.Rptr. 379].) In any case, we may liberally construe the notice of appeal to include the March 26 determination where there is no prejudice to respondent, as here. (See <em>In re Edgar M. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 727, 740 [122 Cal.Rptr. 574, 537 P.2d 406]; <em>In re William C. </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 570 [138 Cal.Rptr. 843].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b99-10\">ParcnthelicalIy, we note that if the minor were required to delay his challenge until a subsequent attempted enforcement, under most circumstances\" his appeal would normally be limited to questions of jurisdictional defect alone.
