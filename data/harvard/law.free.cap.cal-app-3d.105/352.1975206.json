The portion of the order at issue provided the following: \u201cSaid obligation for spousal support shall continue through the month of September 1981, at which time spousal support shall forever terminate and the jurisdiction of this Court over the issue of spousal support shall terminate, unless prior to September 30, 1981, Petitioner [Gudrun] makes a showing of good cause to extend spousal support beyond that date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Henry cross-appeals from a portion of the order immediately preceding that appealed by Gudrun. It recites that: \u201cEffective July 1, 1978, Respondent [Henry] shall pay to Petitioner [Gudrun] as and for spousal support the sum of $200.00 per month, payable on the first day of each month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The evidence before the California superior court, June 23, 1978, may reasonably be condensed to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">At the time of its dissolution in New York, January 21, 1976, the marriage of the parties had endured 16 years, and Henry was ordered to pay spousal support of $542 per month to Gudrun, who was unemployed. The marriage had been childless, and Gudrun was then about 44 years old. At the time of the superior court hearing, June 23, 1978, Henry had been unemployed for about two months. His income from unemployment insurance and interest and dividends totaled around $575 per month. His previous income had been \u201ca <em>gross </em>of $2,297 per month.\u201d Gudrun had been unemployed throughout the marriage, but she had been able to acquire an advanced education during it. She held a master\u2019s degree in education which she had earned with a \u201c4.0\u201d average. She was also a \u201cPh.D candidate,\u201d a degree which would be awarded her when she \u201cfinished the dissertation,\u201d a project upon which she hadn\u2019t \u201cbeen able to work.. .for about a year or so.\u201d Her field was \u201cGerman literature.\u201d She had sought employment, but only \u201cin my field.\u201d During the previous year she had held a teaching fellowship the \u201cnet earnings [of which for a time] were $448\u201d monthly. And she had more recently been assigned a summer college course \u201cstarting the 19th, which is this week, and I got a call Friday before that they had to close some of its own classes because of Proposition 13.\u201d But on the whole her current income prospects appeared quite small, hardly in excess of a few thousand dollars a year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Each of the parties contends that the superior court abused its discretion in respect of that portion of the order from which her, or his, appeal is taken. And each of them relies upon the state Supreme Court\u2019s recent case of <em>In re Marriage of Morrison </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 437 [143 Cal.Rptr. 139, 573 P.2d 41].</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The superior court was here called upon to exercise its \u201ccareful and reasoned judgment\u201d in a most difficult and \u201cdelicate\u201d field, thus to \u201ceffect substantial justice\u201d to the parties of a wrecked marriage whose income was not reasonably calculated to support two households in the manner that it had supported one. (See <em>Morrison, </em>20 Cal.3d, at p. 450; <em>In re Marriage of Brantner </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 416, 422 [136 Cal.Rptr. 435].)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\"><em>Morrison </em>declared a state policy \u201cthat all supported spouses [of dissolved marriages] who were able to do so should seek employment.\u201d (20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Cal.3d, at p. 451.) \u201cLimiting the duration of support so that both parties can develop their own lives, free from obligations to each other, is a commendable [judicial] goal.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 452.)  And a spousal support order may, in a proper case, be fashioned so as to encourage such supportive self-reliance, and to discourage delay in preparation for or in seeking, or refusal of, available employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">But present or future limitation, or termination, of spousal support must in all cases be reasonable; it may not be arbitrary or based upon speculation as to the supported spouse\u2019s future employment qualifications or opportunities. Instead, the trial court will follow the rule that: \u201cA trial court should not terminate jurisdiction to extend a future support order after a lengthy marriage, unless the record clearly indicates that the supported spouse will be able to adequately meet his or her financial needs at the time selected for termination of jurisdiction.  In making its decision concerning the retention of jurisdiction, the court must rely only on the evidence in the record and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. It must not engage in speculation. If the record does not contain evidence of the supported spouse\u2019s ability to meet his or her future needs, the court should not \u2018burn its bridges\u2019 and fail to retain jurisdiction.\u201d (20 Cal.3d, at p. 453.) And in such a determination the court should consider \u201c\u2018\u201cpractically everything that has a legitimate bearing\u201d\u2019\u201d upon the need for present and prospective support, including the spouses\u2019 \u201c\u2018\u201cability to earn and actual earnings.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>pp. 454, 455.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Under these criteria we observe no abuse by the trial court, of judicial discretion. It had postponed to the future, \u201cprior to September 30, 1981,\u201d on what will reasonably be deemed the better evidence of that day, determination of the delicate question whether to continue, or terminate, spousal support. It will be presumed that the court will then again consider, and apply, the rationale and rule of <em>Morrison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Nor do we observe discretionary abuse, as contended by Gudrun, in the superior court\u2019s choice of future termination <em>unless </em>she shall prior to September 30, 1981, make \u201ca showing of good cause to extend spousal support beyond that date.\u201d On the record the court might have concluded it <em>probable </em>that Gudrun would be supportively self-sufficient at the designated time, and <em>reasonable </em>that she, with better access to relevant evidence, make a contrary showing. In such event the court will again be guided by <em>Morrison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>We accordingly find no merit in the appeal of Gudrun.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">A similar lack of merit is observed in the appeal of Henry, from the superior court\u2019s order modifying Gudrun\u2019s spousal support from $542 to $200 per month. Upon such a motion to modify spousal support the court has a wide discretion, and may consider \u201c\u2018practically everything which has a legitimate bearing upon the present and prospective matters relating to the lives of both parties.\u2019\u201d <em>(Hall </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 435, 442 [267 P.2d 249]; <em>In re Marriage of Siegel </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 88, 92 [102 Cal.Rptr. 613].) Under this test we find the modification order reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The superior court\u2019s order filed July 27, 1978, and entered August 14, 1978, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Racanelli, P. J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
