We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 initial complaint, filed in Trinity County on July 25, 1978, sought a declaration of nonliability or limited liability of plaintiffs-insurers to defendant corporation and Stott, its sole shareholder. Plaintiffs alleged they insured a building owned by defendants for a total of $350,000 and unscheduled personal property for $30,000; the building, located in Trinity County near Weaverville, was completely destroyed by fire on December 20, 1977, while the policies were in effect; defendants notified plaintiffs of the fire and claimed a $380,000 loss; Stott was responsible for the fire and had fraudulently concealed relevant information (income tax returns) after the loss; plaintiffs are liable, if at all, only for the actual cash value of the destroyed property, which they set as $130,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Personal service of plaintiffs\u2019 first complaint on Stott, as an individual and on behalf of the corporation, was accomplished on July 25, 1978. On August 23, 1978, defendants filed a complaint in Shasta County Superior Court, claiming (1) a loss of $430,000 under the policies issued by defendants through their Redding agent, Don Bertucci; (2) wrongful refusal to pay the claim; (3) negligence by Bertucci in failing to provide $50,000 worth of insurance; and (4) misrepresentation, unfair claim practices, and defamation by the insurers. Bertucci was named a defendant in the Shasta County suit, as were the plaintiffs in the Trinity County suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The day after the Shasta County suit was filed, defendants noticed a demurrer and motion to change venue for hearing on September 11, 1978, in Trinity County Superior Court. They argued the demurrer should be sustained because the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, another action was pending between the same parties for the same cause, and there was a defect or nonjoinder of parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">At the request of all parties, the hearing was continued to November 6. On October 13, plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint for declaratory relief, the substance of which was identical to the initial complaint. On November 2, the hearing was again continued by stipulation and set for December 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">After the hearing, the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on the grounds that the first amended complaint failed to state a cause of action and another action was pending. Judgment was entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>after the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to reconsider.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Plaintiffs contend the court erred in granting defendants\u2019 demurrer because the Shasta County action was not pending when they commenced the Trinity County suit, a declaratory relief action is appropriate in the circumstances of this case, they have an absolute right to seek judicial resolution of the dispute, and defendants should not be permitted to manipulate venue by filing a subsequent action elsewhere. Defendants contend a subsequently filed action may be \u201canother action pending\u201d and cause for demurrer under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> declaratory relief is inappropriate because the dispute involves no third party, only past wrongs are alleged by plaintiffs, and these issues can be determined in the \u201cmain action\u201d in Shasta County. They further contend that defendants, as \u201cnormal plaintiffs\u201d have the right to choose venue and we may set aside a refusal to grant declaratory relief only for patent abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">We begin with a consideration of the Shasta County action and its effect on the demurrer. The general rule is that a demurrer lies only for defects appearing on the face of a complaint. (See 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Pleading, \u00a7 797, pp. 2410-2412.) When a special demurrer is interposed alleging another action pending, however, the court may take judicial notice of the pending suit. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 798 at p. 2412.) In such a case, the defendant must show that the parties, cause of action, and issues are identical, and the same evidence would support the judgment in each case. (See 3 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 821, p. 2429; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (c).) In this case, of course, the parties are not identical, since Bertucci is not included in the Trinity suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The controlling rule in this case, however, is that the pendency of another action growing out of the same transaction (here, the insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>anee contracts and the fire) is a ground for abatement of the second action but never for abatement of the first. <em>(Kirman </em>v. <em>Borzage </em>(1949) 89 Cal.App.2d 898, 903 [150 P.2d 3]; <em>Hagan </em>v. <em>Fairfield </em>(1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 240, 246-247 [16 Cal.Rptr. 14].) The underlying theory of the plea of another action pending is that the <em>first </em>action will normally be an ample remedy, and the <em>second </em>action (here, the Shasta County suit) is therefore unnecessary and vexatious. (Our italics.) <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 960, 964 [133 Cal.Rptr. 539]; <em>Colvig </em>v. <em>RKO General, Inc. </em>(1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 56, 70 [42 Cal.Rptr. 473]; <em>Wulfjen </em>v. <em>Dolton </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 891 [151 P.2d 840].) The interpretation of the statute for which defendants argue could result in serial complaint filings and demurrers in different counties; there would be nothing to prevent plaintiffs from filing a third complaint in a third forum and pleading another action pending to the Shasta County court. The statute was not designed to encourage such absurdity.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Since there is no issue raised in the Shasta County suit which could not be raised and determined in the Trinity County suit (see <em>Childs </em>v. <em>Eltinge </em>(1973) 29 Cal.App.3d 843 [105 Cal.Rptr. 864]) and no necessary party who could not be joined in that suit (see <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1946) 75 Cal.App.2d 925 [172 P.2d 84]), neither the special demurrer nor the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction allows granting defendants\u2019 motion. (See <em>Childs </em>v. <em>Eltinge, supra.) </em> The latter rule provides that when two superior courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the subject matter and all parties involved in litigation, the first to assume jurisdiction has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter and all parties involved until such time as all necessarily related matters have been resolved. <em>(Halpin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 530, 545 [92 Cal.Rptr. 329].) Priority of jurisdiction resides in the tribunal where process is first served. <em>(Mungia </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 280, 283 [37 Cal.Rptr. 285].)  In this case, the proof of service attached to plaintiffs\u2019 initial complaint shows it was served on July 25, 1978, prior to defendants\u2019 August 23 filing of suit in Shasta County. We conclude the trial court erred in sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrer on the ground of another action pending.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We turn to the second ground upon which the court sustained the demurrer, the failure of plaintiffs to state a cause of action for declaratory relief. The trial court\u2019s order sustaining demurrer stated in part as follows: \u201cAuthorities cited at page 2343, 3 Witkin, California Procedure, sustain the proposition that \u2018there is no basis for declaratory relief where only past wrongs are involved.\u2019 While the cited cases may not represent a broad application of that rule, it would appear that the circumstances of this case as defined by the pleadings and declarations herein are uniquely appropriate for the application of the rule.\u201d The trial court thereafter ordered the demurrer \u201csustained on the grounds that the Amended Complaint fails to state a cause of action.\u201d From the above it appears that the trial court\u2019s ruling was based on the theory that the plaintiffs\u2019 action for declaratory relief rests only upon past wrongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">However, analysis of the authorities indicates the rule regarding past wrongs to be as follows: \u201cDeclaratory relief operates prospectively, serving to set controversies at rest. If there is a controversy which calls for a declaration of rights, it is no objection that past wrongs are also to be redressed; but there is no basis for declaratory relief where only past wrongs are involved....\u201d (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Pleading, \u00a7 722, pp. 2342-2343. )<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Hence analysis must be made of plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint in order to ascertain if a present controversy concerning the rights of the parties is alleged. The subject first amended complaint clearly alleges the existence of a present controversy as to the liability, if any, of the plaintiffs under the contracts of insurance in question. Thus the fundamental basis for declaratory relief is present in the pleadings, since we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>must take the allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint as true. <em>(Haggerty </em>v. <em>County of Kings </em>(1953) 117 Cal.App.2d 470, 478 [256 P.2d 393]; see 3 <em>Witkin, supra, </em>\u00a7 716, p. 2338.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Defendants\u2019 contention that the absence of a third party precludes suit by an insurance company for a declaration of rights and obligations under an insurance contract is without merit. It is true that an insurer has no absolute right to declaratory relief <em>(McGraw-Edison Company </em>v. <em>Preformed Line Products Company </em>(9th Cir. 1966) 362 F.2d 339) and that the court can deny such relief to any plaintiff in a proper case <em>(Zetterberg </em>v. <em>State Dept. of Public Health </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 657, 665 [118 Cal.Rptr. 100]), but it does not follow that every complaint for declaratory relief by an insurance company must be dismissed on demurrer. We see no reason to deny consideration of an otherwise cognizable declaratory relief complaint on the ground that the insurer is a \u201cnominal plaintiff\u201d or that it is more common for the insured to be the plaintiff. (See <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Spann </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 97, 100 [106 Cal.Rptr. 923].) The burden of proof of loss is the same in either case. (Ibid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">A controversy is no less actual or present because no third party is involved. The issue did not even arise in our consideration of <em>American Home Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Essy </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 19 [3 Cal.Rptr. 586], a case close on the facts to those pled in this one. The issue of Stott\u2019s alleged misconduct before and after the fire is not collateral, as suggested by defendants, and their reliance on <em>General of America Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lilly </em>(1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465 [65 Cal.Rptr. 750], is misplaced. That case was concerned with the propriety of a declaratory relief action filed after, not before, the filing of an action for personal injuries which had been commenced by the third party against the insurance company\u2019s insured. In upholding the trial court\u2019s grant of a demurrer the court stated, \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s complaint, however, falls short of the necessary allegations to entitle it, as a matter of right, to maintain the action in declaratory relief, where the issues raised by the complaint may be properly and finally adjudicated in the personal injury action. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.\u201d (258 Cal.App.2d at p. 472.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In the case at bench the action commenced by plaintiffs is the main action and all issues raised therein can be properly and finally adjudicated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Defendants further contend that a refusal to grant declaratory relief will be set aside only for patent abuse of discretion and the trial court has not committed any such abuse. However, the Supreme Court in <em>Columbia Pictures Corp. </em>v. <em>DeToth </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 753 [161 P.2d 217, 162 A.L.R. 747], stated at page 762: \u201cWhere, therefore, a case is properly before the trial <em>court, </em>under a complaint which is legally sufficient to set forth facts and circumstances showing that a declaratory adjudication is entirely appropriate, the trial court may not properly refuse to assume jurisdiction; and if it does enter a dismissal, it will be directed by an appellate tribunal to entertain the action. Declaratory relief must be granted when the facts justifying that course are sufficiently alleged.\u201d (See 3 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 720, pp. 2341-2342.) In light of the above, defendants\u2019 contentions regarding no patent abuse of discretion must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The judgment is reversed with directions to the superior court to overrule defendants\u2019 demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Puglia, P.
