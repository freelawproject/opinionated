The trial judge resolved that the evidence was insufficient in its probative force to establish plaintiff\u2019s allegations that defendants wrongfully copied plaintiff\u2019s unpatented ball point pen and fraudulently palmed off their product upon jobbers and the public as plaintiff\u2019s product. We are in accord with his conclusion. Since the only ground urged upon the appeal is that the trial judge erred in reaching this conclusion, the judgment will stand affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
