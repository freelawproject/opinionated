Brennan, Jr., J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"As5\">Defendant appeals from a summary judgment for $2,000 with interest and costs entered against him in the Bergen County Court upon plaintiffs\u2019 motion under <em>Rule </em>3:56.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Plaintiffs engaged defendant, a broker, to effect a sale of their business. Defendant secured one Geentiens as a buyer. Defendant\u2019s employee, John P. Kuehn, Jr., who handled the negotiations, prepared an instrument which was signed by Geentiens and by Kuehn for defendant, as plaintiffs\u2019 agent, reciting the terms of sale and providing that \u201cthis agreement is subject to formal legal contract drawn by attorneys\u201d and that Geentiens \u201chereby pays the sum of $2,000 check to said agent on account of purchase price, which sum the purchaser does hereby authorize B. J. Bergton to pay over to the owner of said business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Geentiens abandoned the transaction and plaintiffs after unsuccessful demands upon defendant for the $2,000 deposit brought this suit to recover it. Defendant counterclaimed for commissions. The counterclaim was not affected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>action under appeal and is pending in the County Court awaiting trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The test when considering a motion for summary judgment is for the court to be \u201cquite critical of the papers presented by the moving party, but not of the opposing papers.\u201d <em>Templeton v. Glen </em>Rock, 11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950); <em>Heuter v. Coastal Air </em>Lines, Inc., 12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>490 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). Our review of the pleadings and of the supporting and opposing affidavits upon the motion does not persuade us that they show palpably that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged by plaintiffs so that plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Defendant\u2019s answer admits that he is holding the $2,000 and that he refuses to pay it over to plaintiffs, although disclaiming any personal interest in the sum and offering to pay the same into court. He alleges by way of a separate defense that \u201csubsequent to the signing of the written agreement\u201d plaintiffs and Geentiens \u201corally modified\u201d the same and agreed that defendant should hold the $2,000 \u201cin escrow pending the drafting and signing of a formal contract between Geentiens and the Coopers,\u201d at which time he was to pay the money to the Coopers; that \u201cno such, formal contract had ever been drawn up or signed, and defendant is uncertain whether to pay the sum in dispute to the Coopers, or to Geentiens.\u201d His affidavit states that not only plaintiff, but Geentiens also, through an attorney, has demanded payment of the deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The affidavit of plaintiff Harry Cooper supporting the motion denies that \u201cthe terms of said agreement (were) in any wise orally modified.\u201d Opposing this is the affidavit of defendant\u2019s employee Kuehn stating that \u201cAt or shortly after the time when the aforesaid agreement of sale was signed, it was orally agreed between all the parties to the same that Gaston Geentiens should pay over the deposit of $2,000 to B. J. Bergton, for him to be held in escrow pending the passing of title and delivery of the Bill of Sale to Geentiens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>by the plaintiffs in the instant suit; at which time B. J. Bergton was to pay over the said sum to the plaintiffs herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Summary judgment under <em>Rule </em>3:56 should be allowed only in cases palpably free from doubt and clearly not against a defendant who, as here, disclaims any interest in the sum claimed other than one of self-protection against conflicting demands and offers to deposit the same with the court, basing his refusal to pay upon the alleged existence of an escrow of which he is the depositary and in which another not a party to the action claims an interest, <em>Sorensen v. East River Savings Institution, </em>119 <em>Misc. Rep. </em>297, 196 <em>N. Y. S. </em>361 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The allegations of the answer that the sale memorandum was \u201corally modified\u201d are inept and not accurately descriptive of the legal effect which results from the events sworn to by Kuehn in his affidavit. The later agreement, if made, is not viewed in law as an attempt to vary the terms of the written memorandum and the rule that a written contract will be deemed to contain the parties\u2019 entire agreement is inapplicable. Kuehn\u2019s statement reasonably permits the inference of the subsequent creation by parol of an escrow of the check, or of the fund. An escrow may be created by writing or by parol, or partly by both; upon the deposit in escrow a contract between the parties as fo the delivery bv the depositary of its subject matter is created; the depositary becomes the agent for both parties as to sucli delivery; and neither party can alone rescind. <em>Mecray v. </em>Goldman, 102 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>559 <em>(Ch. </em>1928), affirmed 105 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>583 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1929); <em>Fred v. Fred, </em>50 <em>A. </em>776 <em>(Ch. </em>1901) (not in state reports). Since the depositary is bound by the terms of the deposit and charged with the duties voluntarily assumed by him, the rule is that liability attaches to him if he improperly parts with Ms deposit. <em>Mantel v. Landau, </em>134 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>194 <em>(Ch. </em>1943), affirmed 135 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>456 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1944); 19 <em>Am. Jur., Escrow, sec. </em>18, <em>p. </em>436.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The defendant was not to be subjected to a summary judgment in the circumstances merely because the ineptly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>phrased answer implied a lack of legal merit in his defense in light of the parol evidence rule. The answer, read with Kuehn\u2019s affidavit, sufficiently supports his contention that an oral escrow outside the parol evidence rule was created after the signing of the memorandum, obliging defendant not to deliver the fund to plaintiffs except upon the happening of the named event, thus eliminating any basis for a finding upon the pleadings and affidavits that they show palpably that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged by plaintiffs. True, in the answer the event is designated as the signing of a \u201cformal contract\u201d and, in Kuehn\u2019s affidavit, as \u201cupon the passing of title and delivery of the Bill of Sale to Geentiens,\u201d but this inconsistency is as to a detail merely and does not affect the primary contention that an escrow was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Relief in interpleader along the newer and more liberal lines permitted by <em>Rule </em>3:22 is a peculiarly appropriate remedy available to a depositary in such a situation. See <em>Jersey Insurance Co. of N. Y. v. </em>Altieri, 5 <em>N. J. Super. </em>577 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1949). Defendant\u2019s claim for commissions asserted in his counterclaim is independent of the escrow fund, as evidenced by his offer to deposit the fund in court, and plaintiffs\u2019 liability therefor may be established apart from the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Defendant did not counterclaim in interpleader against plaintiffs, and join Geentiens as a defendant on the counterclaim as provided by <em>Rule 3</em>:22. He did, however, file an original complaint in interpleader, as he informed the trial court in his affidavit. However, the complaint was inadvertently filed in the County Court and his motion to transfer the cause to the Chancery Division, Superior Court, argued with the motion for summary judgment, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Defendant\u2019s failure to counterclaim in interpleader may reasonably be ascribed to the uncertainty which generally prevailed among members of the bar at the time whether the County Court had jurisdiction to grant relief upon such pleadings. The case of <em>Tumarkin v. </em>Friedman, 17 <em>N. J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>Super. </em>20 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), holding that there is no inhibition under the Constitution or the court rules to the jurisdiction of the County Court to grant relief in interpleader sought by answer and counterclaim filed to a complaint in a cause within the County Court\u2019s jurisdiction, was not decided until five months after the entry of the order on appeal. In any event, neither defendant\u2019s failure to pursue that procedure nor his abortive effort to proceed by original complaint is a reason to subject him to summary judgment. There was sufficient to withstand plaintiffs\u2019 motion in his offer to pay the fund into court when considered in the light of the conflicting demands upon him and his claim, fully supported by Kuehn\u2019s affidavit, of the creation of the escrow of the fund, the condition to delivery of which concededly did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We have, of course, reached our conclusion to reverse without reference to the extraneous matter not presented to the trial court which defendant inappropriately included in his appendix. <em>Gallanthen v. Postma, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>464 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). However, as there must be a trial upon plaintiffs\u2019 claim, considerations of the proper administration of justice sanction our notice here of the information in defendant\u2019s brief that after the entry of the judgment on appeal, Geentiens instituted an action in the Superior Court against plaintiffs and defendant for the return of the deposit and that defendant has filed a counterclaim in interpleader therein against Geentiens and a cross-claim in interpleader against the Coopers. Apart from questions of the County Court\u2019s jurisdiction, defendant\u2019s pending County Court inter-pleader suit seems to serve no useful purpose in the circumstances. Too, the attention of the parties is invited to the possibility of the consolidation of the instant suit with the Superior Court action to the end that, if practicable, the several controversies may be determined in one proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Reversed. Costs to abide the event. If defendant ultimately becomes entitled to costs on this appeal, the printing costs allowed for the printing of his appendix shall not exceed one-half of the amount thereof.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
