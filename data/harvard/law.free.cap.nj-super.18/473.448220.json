Brennan, Jr., J. <em>A. </em>D.</author>\n<p id=\"ATR\">Plaintiff, alleging that he is an honorably discharged veteran of World War I entitled to the protection afforded by the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act <em>(R. S. </em>38:16-1 <em>et seq.), </em>complains of the termination by defendant Eerber, Director of Motor Vehicles, of his agency for the registering of motor vehicles, issuing registration certificates and licensing of drivers, to which he was designated pursuant to <em>R. S. </em>39:3-3 <em>(L. </em>1921, <em>c. </em>208) by a predecessor in office of Ferber, and of Ferber\u2019s designation of defendant, Aniello, to replace him.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Ferber\u2019s action was taken by letter of December 7, 1950, advising plaintiff that his \"authority to act as agent is hereby revoked as of December 31, 1950.\u201d Plaintiff filed an amended complaint in the Law Division seeking a judgment restoring him as agent and setting aside Aniello\u2019s designation in his place. Upon motion of Ferber the action was dismissed, without prejudice, \"for the reason that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter.\u201d Ferber\u2019s motion was grounded upon the contention that \"plaintiff seeks review in his complaint of a decision or action of a state administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>tive agency\u201d reviewable not by complaint filed in the Law Division pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:81\u20142 but by appeal to the Appellate Division under <em>Rule </em>3:81\u20148. Plaintiff appeals from the order of dismissal which was entered November 14, 1951, and also \u201cfrom the final decision or action of Martin J. Ferber, administrative agent, dismissing the above plaintiff on December 31, 1950, in accordance with <em>Rule </em>3:81-8.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Whether plaintiff\u2019s challenge to Ferber\u2019s action was reviewable in the circumstances by complaint, under <em>Rule </em>3:81-2 or by appeal under <em>Rule </em>3:81-8 it is not necessary for us to decide. His claim to relief is rested solely upon his alleged veteran\u2019s status. The question whether the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act embraces agents designated under <em>R. S. </em>39:3-3 has been fully argued in the briefs and we shall therefore determine it. It is our opinion that an agent designated under <em>R. S. </em>39:3-3 is not a person \u201cholding any employment, position or office under the government of this state\u201d and \u201creceiving a salary from such state\u201d within the intendment of the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">It is settled that \u201cThe Legislature may by the manner in which it establishes or reconstructs a public office and by the character of authority which it gives in the supervision thereof indicate a purpose to exclude the employees from the application of the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act.\u201d <em>Barringer v. Miele, </em>6 <em>N. J. </em>139 (1951). The manner in which the Legislature established the office of Director of Motor Vehicles as regards the latter\u2019s agents of plaintiff\u2019s class and the character of the authority given to the Director\u2019s selection, supervision and termination of authority of such agents plainly evince a legislative purpose to exclude the agents from the application of the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">While motor vehicle inspectors are to be chosen \u201cwith special reference to their fitness for the work\u201d and are required \u201cto submit themselves to such an examination as the board of civil service commissioners may require,\u201d and their rights to tenure, pensions and retirement are recognized, <em>R. S. </em>39:2-7.1, and the compensation of inspectors and clerical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>assistants is expressly made subject to classification by Civil Service, <em>R. S. </em>39:2-6, and examiners of motor vehicles at inspection stations are appointed \u201csubject to existing laws.\u201d <em>R. S. </em>39:8-2, the agent designated under <em>R. S. </em>39:3-3 may act only \u201cuntil his authority is revoked\u201d by the Director, and his compensation is based upon registration certificates issued by him and for every license granted by him, and the Director has authority to limit the fee so paid to a maximum. The Legislature obviously intended to, and did, place in the hands of the Director large and unusual determinative powers, including the designation and removal, and the fixing of the number and the compensation of such agents. Plainly the agent is not within the class of persons in public service contemplated by the Legislature to be limited to persons holding \u201cemployment, position or office\u201d and \u201creceiving a salary from such state.\u201d See <em>Brickett v. Lagay, </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>1 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1946). The legislative intention was to give the Director full rein to control the tenure of his agents and to appoint and remove at his pleasure. <em>Cf. Ackley v. Norcross, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>569 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939). affirmed 124 <em>N. J. L. </em>133 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Nor is the result different by reason of the provisions of <em>L. </em>1945, c. 175 <em>(R. S. </em>38:23A-3) providing that rights, privileges and benefits granted \u201cin any law\u201d to veterans \u201cholding any appointive office, position or employment,\u201d shall include \u201call those engaged in the public service in any of its branches within this Stale\u201d without distinction \u201cby reason of the source of the public funds from which such person is paid.\u201d If that statute is effective to cover under the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act persons excluded therefrom under the holding in <em>Brickett v. Lagay, supra, </em>nonetheless it does not bring within the purview of the tenure act an agent, as here, not \u201creceiving a salary\u201d and whose authority is expressly made by <em>R. S. </em>39:3\u20143 terminable at the pleasure of the Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
