A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AdC\">The conviction of the appellants, Joseph and Julia Perillo, was based' in large part on hearsay evidence. They were tried on an indictment charging that they and one Salvado conspired to keep a bookmaking establishment at 7 Nicholson Street, Lodi. The State readily proved that bookmaking was carried on at the address mentioned but had difficulty in connecting the Perillos with the enterprise. To this end, the deputy attorney-general presented a witness, Brown, who testified that he had questioned a prisoner in the State Prison, named B\u00facaro. Over objection of the appellants, he was allowed to state that B\u00facaro had said that Joseph Perillo operated at 7 Nicholson Street \u201cthe biggest horse room in Lodi;\u201d that it was open every night, and .that about a hundred people would be there. Mr. Brown also testified that shortly after this interview, B\u00facaro sent him, through the mails, a list of alleged gambling resorts in Lodi. This list the court received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The excuse given for offering and receiving the Hearsay evidence was to neutralize parts of the testimony of Buca.ro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>who himself testified for the State. B\u00facaro testified that \u201cthe biggest horse room in Lodi\u201d was \u201cright next to Pudgy\u2019s Lunch at 11 Nicholson St.\u201d .Asked if Perillo did not operate <em>it, he replied, </em>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, sir.\u201d The deputy attorney-general claimed surprise and called Brown to the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">If a party is surprised by harmful, adverse testimony given by his own witness in conflict with a prior statement which the witness has made, he may attempt to neutralize such testimony by questioning the witness about such prior statement. <em>State v. Bassone, </em>109 <em>N. J. L. </em>176 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932); <em>Stappenbeck, v. Jagels Fuel Corp., </em>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>215 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1944). Or the contradictory statement may he proved by other witnesses. <em>State v. D\u2018Adame, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>386, 398 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1913). But the prior statement is admissible only to neutralize or blot out harmful testimony; it is not admissible to supplement the testimony. \u201cWhere the witness, as here, gives no testimony injurious to the party calling him but only fails to render the assistance which was expected, because of a failure of recollection, there is no basis for neutralizing under the rule. While a party should not he denied the right to defend his case by an unwilling or hostile witness, yet he should not he permitted to read before the jury an unsworn statement of such witness under the pretense of neutralizing his testimony. See cases in Note, 74 <em>A. L. B. </em>at 1064 <em>et seq.; Note, </em>117 <em>A. </em>L. <em>R. </em>326; <em>Note, </em>42 <em>L. R. A. (N. S.) </em>747; 58 <em>Am. Jur. </em>445, \u00a7 800 <em>et seq. </em>See also Wigmore on Evidence <em>3rd ed., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1018, 1043.\u201d <em>Ciardella v. Parker, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>537 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950). In the appeal before us. Bucaro\u2019s testimony that he did not know whether Perillo operated the gambling house, did not tend to establish Perillo\u2019s innocence. Whether Bucaro\u2019s failure of memory was real or pretended, is of no consequence. Since his testimony was utterly harmless, there was no legitimate reason to prove the statement which B\u00facaro had made at the Prison. The State relies on cases that are readily distinguishable. In <em>State v. D\u2019Adame, supra, </em>although the testimony which surprised the State was in negative form, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>in practical effect the same as if the witness had said that the defendant was not the man involved in the crime. For this reason, evidence of the contradictory statement was admissible. The situation in <em>State v. </em>Kysilka, 85 <em>N. J. L. </em>712 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1914), was substantially the same. In the latter ease, the court emphasized that \u201cEvidence of this character (the prior unsworn statement) is obviously extremely dangerous,\u201d and pointed out the possibility that it may do \u201ca much greater wrong than the one it was intended to cure.\u201d And where it appears that \u201cthe real purpose of offering the evidence is to get the benefit of heresay testimony as having probative force, or that the injury resulting from the surprise\u2019 is fanciful rather than real, he (the trial judge) should refuse to admit the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The admission of the evidence which we have been discussing was clearly erroneous and harmful to Joseph Perillo.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The verdict against Julia Perillo was contrary to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We need not consider the other reasons presented for reversal. Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
