Conclusion...............................................................1295</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-35\">I. <em>Introduction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-36\"><em>A. Preliminary matters. </em>These thirty consolidated securities fraud actions involve two subclasses of plaintiffs. One of the subclasses (the WMB Subclass) consists of purchasers of securities issued by Williams Companies, Inc. The other subclass (the WCG Subclass) consists of purchasers of common stock and notes issued by Williams Communications Group, Inc. The claims of the WMB Subclass have been settled. The remaining claims, as-</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-38\">serted by the WCG Subclass, are traceable to the rise and fall of Williams Communications Group, Inc., and arise under \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, promulgated thereunder. <em>See, generally, In re Williams Securities Litigation, </em>339 F.Supp.2d 1206 (N.D.Okla.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-39\">Investors who bought WCG<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stock during the class period bought into an industry meltdown of historic proportions. The defendants maintain, correctly, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>plaintiffs are not entitled to insurance against improvident investment choices. The plaintiffs, having convincingly demonstrated that the views expressed privately by members of senior management of WMB and WCG belied their rosy public statements about WCG\u2019s prospects, maintain, correctly, that they are entitled to present their claims to a jury if they can make a threshold showing of triable issues with respect to the contested elements of their securities fraud claims. The task now before the court is to determine whether plaintiffs have marshaled record evidence and expert testimony sufficient to survive (i) the defendants\u2019 Daubert challenges to the proposed testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses, and (ii) the defendants\u2019 related motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">The following motions are before the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-5\">Motion of Defendant Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young LLP for Summary Judgment, filed April 14, 2006 (doc. no. 1027);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-6\">Motion of The Williams Companies, Inc. and Keith E.

The summary judgment motions, briefs, exhibits and appendices consist of 93 filings, totaling more than 22,900 pages. The briefs which are before the court with respect to these motions demonstrate outstanding advocacy. They have met the court\u2019s highest expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">As will be seen, with respect to the Daubert motions, the court\u2019s attention has primarily been addressed to the defendants\u2019 challenges to the proposed expert testimony of Messrs. H. Sean Mathis and Andrew M. Mintzer and Dr. Blaine F. Nye.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">II. <em>Factual Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">For summary judgment purposes, the court views the facts and draws reasonable inferences from those facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Piercy v. Maketa, </em>480 F.3d 1192, 1197 (10th Cir.2007). The following facts are either undisputed or viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">Following the breakup of AT &amp; T in the early 1980\u2019s, WMB, an energy company, developed a strategy to run fiber-optic cables through some of its decommissioned pipelines, planning, under the original strategy, to provide services solely to other communications providers. After WMB secured adequate assurances of demand for its service, it authorized the initial $26 million build. WMB formed a subsidiary called Williams Telecommunications Company (\u201cWilTel I\u201d) in 1985, which eventually built a nationwide digital fiber-optic network, consisting of approximately 9,700 route miles. Bailey Aff., \u00b6 8-11; Ex. 1 at EY-WCG-00-000005, Caroline L. Marshall Declaration (\u201cCM Deck\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">In 1995, WMB sold the WilTel I network business to LDDS Communications (thereafter WorldCom, Inc.) for approximately $2.5 billion. The sale included the nationwide fiber-optic network, together with the associated relationships with consumers and business and carrier customers. WMB excluded from the sale an approximately 9,700 route-mile single fiber network, comprised of a single fiber-optic strand and associated equipment along the original nationwide network, as well as WilTel I\u2019s telecommunications equipment distribution business, and Vyvx Services, a provider of multimedia fiber transmission for the broadcast industry. WMB agreed with LDDS that it would not reenter the telecommunications business for three years.

The Broadband Media unit provided worldwide transmission of live and non-live media content through integrated fiber-optic, satellite and teleport services. The Solutions unit provided professional and maintenance services and distributed communications equipment from leading vendors for the voice and data communications needs of businesses of all sizes, as well as for governmental, educational and non-profit institutions. Through the Strategic Investments unit, WCG invested strategically in communications businesses which WCG believed would increase revenue opportunities for the Network and other business units.

The total estimated cost of the network assets to be covered by the lease agreement was $750 million. The lease term included an interim term, during which the covered network assets were to be constructed, and a base term. The interim and base terms were expected to total five years, and, if renewed, could total seven years. WCG had an option to purchase the covered network assets during the lease term. WMB provided a residual value guarantee equal to a maximum of 89.9% of the transaction. Ex. 12 at 143, JA.

Bank of America was the administrative agent. The credit facility consisted of $525 million seven-year senior multi-draw amortizing term loan facility and a $525 million six-year senior reducing revolving credit facility. WCG could borrow under the term loan facility during a one-year period beginning on the credit facility\u2019s commencement date and could borrow under the revolving credit facility throughout the six-year term. WCG\u2019s credit agreement included a minimum EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) covenant and a Total Leverage Ratio covenant. Under the credit facility, E &amp; Y, WMB and WCG\u2019s outside auditor, was required to provide to WCG\u2019s board of directors and Bank of America an annual debt covenant compliance report stating whether E &amp; Y had obtained any knowledge of a default during its annual audit.

In September 1999, previous non-capital borrowings from WMB were converted into a seven-year note bearing interest at an annual rate based upon WCG\u2019s credit rating. Although the intercompany note ranked equal with the credit facility note, WMB agreed that the intercompany note would be subordinated to the rights of the credit facility lenders in any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or dissolution of WCG and in the event of default under the credit facility. Ex. 1 at EY-WCG-00-000079, CM Deck</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">To raise funds for operations, including network construction, WCG conducted an initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in October, 1999. The IPO offered for sale 29,600,000 shares of Class A common stock. The underwriters for the IPO exercised their options and purchased 4,440,000 additional shares to cover over-allotments. In separate private placements, SBC Communications, Intel Corporation and Telefonos de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., respectively acquired 20,226,812, 9,225,093 and 4,612,546 shares of WCG\u2019s Class A common stock.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The financing effort also included the issuance of high yield notes in addition to the equity.

It also alleges that E &amp; Y\u2019s audit opinion falsely stated that the audit complied with generally accepted auditing principles. Specifically, the WCG Subclass contends that WCG\u2019s network assets and other fixed assets were materially impaired under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (FAS 121) in 2000 and that WCG failed to disclose these impairments in the financial statements. Additionally, the WCG Subclass alleges that WCG improperly recognized revenue on certain indefeasible right of use (\u201cIRU\u201d) fiber transactions. It also contends that WCG failed to disclose debt covenant violations. The WCG Subclass contends that E &amp; Y knew or recklessly disregarded facts showing that the assets were impaired, that WCG improperly recognized revenue with respect to the IRU transaction, and that WCG had violated its debt covenants. The WCG Subclass further alleges that E <em>&amp; </em>Y failed to disclose \u201cgoing concern\u201d doubts in the audit report even though E <em>&amp; </em>Y knew or recklessly disregarded facts showing that there was substantial doubt about WCG\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-10\">A. <em>Rule 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 Claims </em>\u2014 Basic <em>Elements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-11\">Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act forbids (1) the \u201cuse or employ[ment] ... of any ... deceptive device,\u201d (2) \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security,\u201d and (3) \u201cin contravention of\u2019 the SEC \u201crules and regulations.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b).

Those principles are discussed in broad terms at this point. Further, more specific, discussion and analysis will be found later in this memorandum opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) and <em>Kumho Tire Company, Ltd. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999) establish a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d function for trial judges under Rule 702, Fed.R.Evid. <em>See also, Goebel v. Denver and Rio Grande Western R. Co., </em>215 F.3d 1083 at 1087 (10th Cir.2000) <em>(Goe-bel </em>I). The gatekeeper function \u201crequires the judge to assess the reasoning and methodology underlying the expert\u2019s opinion, and determine whether it is scientifically valid and applicable to a particular set of facts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-9\">The question of <em>how </em>to perform its ga-tekeeping function is a discretionary matter for the trial court. The court may conduct a hearing, it may perform its ga-tekeeping obligation by ruling on a motion in limine or on an objection at trial, or even by ruling on a post-trial motion. <em>Id. </em>When faced with a Daubert objection to proposed expert testimony, the court must adequately demonstrate by specific findings on the record that it has performed its duty as gatekeeper. <em>Goebel I, </em>215 F.3d at 1088. The Court of Appeals has left no room for doubt on this point, <em>e.g., Dodge v. Cotter Corp., </em>328 F.3d 1212, 1227 (10th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1003, 124 S.Ct. 533, 157 L.Ed.2d 408 (2003) (\u201cAgain, we lack specific, detailed findings about [the expert\u2019s] reasoning or the reliability of his methodology in arriving at his conclusions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-10\">When the proposed testimony of an expert is challenged under <em>Daubert </em>and its progeny, Rule 104 of the Federal Rules of Evidence applies to the court\u2019s consideration and determination of the issues raised by the Daubert challenge. <em>Dau-bert, </em>at 592, n. 10, 113 S.Ct. 2786. Rule 104(a) casts upon the proponent of the testimony the burden of establishing the admissibility of the testimony by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. See also, Ralston v. Smith &amp; Nephew Richards, Inc., </em>275 F.3d 965, 970, n. 4 (10th Cir.2001) and the Advisory Committee notes to the 2000 Amendment to Rule 702 (\u201c[T]he admissibility of all expert testimony is governed by the principles of Rule 104(a). Under that Rule, the proponent has the burden of establishing that the pertinent admissibility requirements are met by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). It is in that light, and with that burden<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in mind, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>that the court considers the pending Dau-bert motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">Even though the court may delve deeply into the minutiae of the proposed expert\u2019s opinions while conducting the Daubert analysis, the court must always remain mindful that its focus \u201cmust be solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that they generate,\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 595, 113 S.Ct. 2786, except that a Daubert challenge may succeed if the court \u201cconclude[s] that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered,\u201d <em>General Elec.

The Court emphasized that even where the proposed expert testimony is not scientific, in the classical sense, the trial judge is nevertheless required to ascertain whether the expert \u201cemploys in the courtroom the same level of <em>intellectual rigor </em>that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.\u201d <em>Kumho, </em>526 U.S. at 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-12\">It is clear that, in our circuit, the Dau-bert gatekeeping function is undertaken by means of a two-step analysis. <em>Ralston, </em>275 F.3d 965 at 969. <em>First, </em>the court must determine whether the proposed expert is qualified. This requires an assessment of his \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training or education.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 702 and <em>Ralston </em>at 969. <em>Secondly, </em>if the proposed expert is determined to be sufficiently qualified, the court must determine whether his opinions are \u201creliable\u201d in the sense required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number><em>Daubert </em>and <em>Kumho. Ralston, </em>275 F.3d 965 at 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">B. <em>Qualifications.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">In <em>Gardner v. General Motors Corporation, </em>507 F.2d 525 (10th Cir.1974), our Court of Appeals noted that a proposed expert \u201cshould not be required to satisfy an overly narrow test of his own qualifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528. This self-evident admonition should be read in light of subsequent post-D&lt;m&amp;eri decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">The decision in <em>Ralston, </em>275 F.3d 965, provides a good starting point, because that decision turned entirely on the expert\u2019s qualifications. Plaintiff asserted that the warnings accompanying an implanted orthopedic nail were inadequate. <em>Id. </em>at 967-68. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the testimony of plaintiffs expert, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon who was also an associate professor of medicine at the University of Kansas Medical School. The expert\u2019s <em>general </em>credentials were clearly as good as could reasonably be expected, but she had done no research \u201cspecifically looking at this nail,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 969, and had not drafted a warning for a surgical device. <em>Id. </em>Her general credentials, though seemingly impressive as general credentials, were not good enough: \u201c[MJerely possessing a medical degree is not sufficient to permit a physician to testify concerning any medical-related issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 970. The board-certified orthopedic surgeon\u2019s \u201creliance upon general principles and concepts\u201d did not suffice. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, her proposed testimony about the adequacy of the warning was not within the \u201creasonable confines\u201d of her expertise. <em>Id. </em>If her proposed expert testimony had been within those \u201creasonable confines,\u201d her lack of specialization would have gone to the weight, not the admissibility, of her proposed expert testimony. <em>Id.See also, </em>as to specialization, <em>Broadcort Capital Corp. v. Summa Medical Corp., </em>972 F.2d 1183, 1194-95 (10th Cir.1992) (affirming trial court determination that an attorney with \u201csome education and training in the field\u201d was not qualified \u201cas an expert in the securities area\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">In this case, as is discussed in Part V(D) and (E), below, the Daubert challenge, and the resultant Daubert scrutiny, focuses on some unusually specific and discrete matters which plaintiffs\u2019 experts propose to address in their testimony- \u2014 -and on the interrelationships between the conclusions of those experts. Consequently, it should be borne in mind that \u201c[t]he issue with regard to expert testimony is not the qualifications of a witness in the abstract, but whether those qualifications provide a foundation for a witness to answer a specific question.\u201d <em>Berry v. City of Detroit, </em>25 F.3d 1342, 1351 (6th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1111, 115 S.Ct. 902, 130 L.Ed.2d 786 (1995). <em>See also, Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel Corp. v. Beelman River Terminals, Inc., </em>254 F.3d 706, 715 (8th Cir.2001) (\u201cTo begin with, we agree with the district court that Dr. Curtis ... easily qualifies as an expert under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. The real question is, what is he an expert about?\u201d) and <em>Westfed Holdings, Inc. v. United States, </em>55 Fed. Cl. 544, 571 (2003), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>407 F.3d 1352 (Fed.Cir.2005). Thus, on the issue of expert qualifications, <em>Ralston </em>and like cases establish that the qualifications of the proposed expert are to be assessed only after the specific matters he proposes to address have been identified. The controlling Tenth Circuit cases, exemplified by <em>Ralston, </em>establish that the expert\u2019s qualifications must be both (i) adequate in a general, qualitative sense <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training or education\u201d as required by Rule 702) and (ii) specific to the matters he proposes to address as an expert.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>C. <em>Reliability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">Under Rule 702, an expert with the necessary qualifications in the relevant field may give expert testimony if (i) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (ii) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (iii) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case. Rule 702, Fed.R.Evid. <em>See, generally, Goebel v. Denver and Rio Grande Western R. Co., </em>346 F.3d 987, 991 (10th Cir.2003) <em>(Goe-bel II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">The evaluation for reliability cannot be permitted to evolve into an assessment of the ultimate persuasiveness of the proffered expert testimony. Faced with a Daubert challenge, expert testimony must meet \u201cexacting standards of reliability,\u201d <em>Weisgram v. Marley Company, </em>528 U.S. 440, 455, 120 S.Ct. 1011, 145 L.Ed.2d 958 (2000), but those exacting standards are still applied within a well-defined framework, because <em>Daubert </em>scrutiny is neither a substitute for jury resolution of contested issues fairly presented by conflicting testimony from qualified experts nor a grant of uncabined discretion to district judges to reject expert testimony that rubs them the wrong way. \u201cVigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>at 596, 113 S.Ct. 2786.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">Thus, the court\u2019s \u201cfocus generally should not be upon the precise conclusions reached by the expert, but on the methodology employed in reaching those conclusions.\u201d <em>Bitler, </em>400 F.3d at 1233. As explained by Judge Becker for the Third Circuit, a challenge to proposed expert testimony \u201cdoes not mean that plaintiffs have to prove their case twice \u2014 they do not have to demonstrate to the judge by a preponderance of the evidence that the assessments of their experts are correct, they only have to demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that their opinions are reliable.\u201d <em>In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litigation, </em>35 F.3d 717, 744 (3rd Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied sub nom. General Elec. Co. v. Ingram, </em>513 U.S. 1190, 115 S.Ct. 1253, 131 L.Ed.2d 134 (1995). The reliability standard is \u201clower than the merits standard of correctness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the trial court\u2019s determination of \u201creliability,\u201d in the Dau-bert sense, is not a determination as to whether the expert\u2019s proposed testimony is substantively correct \u2014 determinations of that kind would stretch most judges beyond their competence in most cases.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">The reliability determination must be made regardless of the subject of the proposed expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>We conclude that <em>Daubert\u2019s </em>general principles apply to the expert matters described in Rule 702. The Rule, in respect to all such matters, \u201cestablishes a standard of evidentiary reliability.\u201d 509 U.S. at 590, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469.

And where such testimony\u2019s factual basis, data, principles, methods, or their application are called sufficiently into question, see Part III, <em>infra, </em>the trial judge must determine whether the testimony has \u201ca reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of [the relevant] discipline.\u201d 509 U.S. at 592, 113 S.Ct. 2786,125 L.Ed.2d 469.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\"><em>Kumho, </em>526 U.S. at 149,119 S.Ct. 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\"><em>Daubert, </em>of course, involved a proffer of expert testimony in a classical scientific discipline \u2014 epidemiology. Bearing that context in mind, it is nevertheless appropriate to review the non-exclusive list of five factors which were provided by the <em>Daubert </em>court to guide trial court determinations of reliability. The Court said that the trial judge should (1) assess whether the expert\u2019s technique or theory can be or has been tested \u2014 that is, whether the expert\u2019s theory can be challenged in some objective sense, or whether it is instead simply a subjective, conclusory approach that cannot reasonably be assessed for reliability, (2) determine whether the technique or theory has been subject to peer review and publication, (3) evaluate the known or potential rate of error of the technique or theory when applied, (4) ascertain the existence and maintenance of standards and controls and, (5) determine whether the technique or theory has been generally accepted in the scientific community. <em>See, </em>509 U.S. at 590-94, 113 S.Ct. 2786.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-7\"><em>Kumho </em>made it clear that the gatekeeper function applies even where the proposed expert testimony is outside the realm of science in the classical sense. <em>Kumho </em>involved a proffer of engineering testimony in a product liability case. The <em>Kumho </em>decision makes it clear that, although the ultimate task of the trial judge, as gatekeeper, remains the same, the factors which were included in the nonexclusive list in Daubert are to be used only to the extent that they are logically applicable. <em>See Kumho, </em>526 U.S. at 149, 119 S.Ct. 1167. Thus, for instance, it has been noted that the factors mentioned by the Court in Daubert do not neatly apply to expert testimony from a sociologist, <em>Tyus v. Urban Search Management, </em>102 F.3d 256 (7th Cir.1996), and that lack of peer review or publication is not dispositive where the expert\u2019s opinion is supported by \u201cwidely accepted scientific knowledge.\u201d <em>Kannankeril v. Terminix International, Inc., </em>128 F.3d 802, 809 (3rd Cir.1997). Moreover, as noted by the Advisory Committee in commenting on the 2000 amendments to Rule 702, courts both before and after <em>Daubert </em>have found other factors relevant in determining whether expert testimony is sufficiently reliable to be considered by the jury. Those additional factors which may be relevant depending on the circumstances include (1) whether the expert proposes to testify about matters growing naturally and directly out of his research, independent of the litigation, or whether he has developed his opinion expressly for the purpose of testifying, (2) whether the expert has unjustifiably extrapolated from an accepted premise to an unfounded conclusion, (3) whether the expert has adequately accounted for obvious alternative explanations, (4) whether the expert is being as careful as he would be in his regular professional work outside his paid litigation consulting, and (5) whether the field of expertise claimed by the expert is known to reach reliable results for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>type of opinion the expert would give. <em>See, </em>Advisory Committee notes to 2002 amendments, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">In sum, to make the Daubert assessment of reliability, the court \u2014 having found that the expert possesses the requisite expertise (if challenged), and having determined that the proposed expert testimony fits the issues in the case \u2014 must determine whether the expert\u2019s conclusions are the product of (i) application of that expertise using recognized and supportable methodologies, (ii) on the basis of adequate data which is (iii) rationally tied to the opinions which purport to be based on that data.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">\u201cUnder <em>Daubert, </em>any step that renders the analysis unreliable ... renders the expert\u2019s testimony inadmissible. This is true whether the step completely changes a reliable methodology or merely misapplies that methodology.\u201d <em>Goebel II, </em>346 F.3d at 992 (citations and internal quotations omitted); <em>Mitchell v. Gencorp Inc., </em>165 F.3d 778, 782 (10th Cir.1999). If the challenged expert testimony is crucial to the proponent\u2019s case, the result of a successful Daubert challenge may be entry of judgment as a matter of law. <em>Joiner, </em>522 U.S. at 142-43, 118 S.Ct. 512; <em>cf. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 2511 n. 8, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007); <em>Weisgram, </em>528 U.S. at 453, 120 S.Ct. 1011. <em>See, e.g., Truck Ins. Exchange v. MagneTek, Inc., </em>360 F.3d 1206, 1213 (10th Cir.2004); <em>Ralston, </em>275 F.3d at 974. Although the standard of appellate review is no more stringent where the trial court\u2019s exclusion of expert testimony is outcome-determinative, <em>Joiner, </em>522 U.S. at 142, 118 S.Ct. 512, it certainly would be \u2014 and is here \u2014 natural to proceed with great caution where the court\u2019s rulings may be dispositive with respect to all or major portions of the case before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-11\">D. <em>The Daubert challenges with respect to Messrs. Mathis and Mint-zer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel retained H. Sean Mathis and Andrew M. Mintzer as two of their experts in this case. Mr. Mathis is a Managing Director in Miller Mathis &amp; Co., an investment banking firm which was founded by Mr. Mathis and another principal. Mathis Rpt. at 2. Mr. Mintzer is a Certified Public Accountant. The qualifications of Messrs. Mathis and Mintzer are discussed in more detail in parts 3(a) and 4(a), below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-13\">The scope of Mr. Mathis\u2019s engagement as an expert in this case has been described in various ways, but it is clear that his work in this case relates entirely to an impairment analysis of WCG\u2019s dark fiber and spare conduit assets under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (FAS 121), a statement of accounting standards which was promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 1995. The joint efforts of Messrs. Mathis and Mintzer with respect to FAS 121 provided a major portion of the basis for Mr. Mintzer\u2019s opinion that the financial statements of WCG as of December 31, 2000 and for the first three quarters of 2001 were not presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>). Mintzer Rpt., \u00b6\u00b6 86-171, 269-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>280. As is discussed in more detail below, in situations to which it applies, FAS 121 generally governs accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets. (FAS 121 has been superseded, but is the only impairment-related Statement of Financial Accounting Standards which is relevant to this case.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">Mr. Mintzer\u2019s work as an expert in this case covers more ground than Mr. Mathis\u2019s work (and thus, Mr. Mintzer\u2019s work involves matters in addition to application of FAS 121), but Mr. Mintzer\u2019s work is, in several significant respects, dependent on Mr. Mathis\u2019s work, and Dr. Nye\u2019s work is, in turn, predicated in part on the work of Messrs. Mathis and Mintzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">As Mr. Mintzer wrote in his report, he was engaged in this case to render an opinion as to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-6\">a. Whether or not the financial statements of Williams Communications Group, Inc. (WCG) were prepared in accordance with applicable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-7\">b. Whether or not Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young LLP (E &amp; Y) adhered to applicable professional standards in the performance of its audits of the fiscal 2000 financial statements of WCG.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1276-8\">Mintzer Rpt. at 5 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-9\">As a prerequisite to analysis of the Dau-bert challenges to the expert testimony of Messrs. Mathis and Mintzer, it is necessary, as discussed in Part V(B) and (C), above, to identify the specific matters they propose to address in their expert testimony. That, in turn, requires at least a general familiarity with FAS 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">FAS 121 \u201cestablishes accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived assets, certain identifiable intangibles, and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of.\u201d FAS 121, p. 4.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As relevant to the issues in this case, and ignoring numerous details for the moment, FAS 121 essentially requires entities that report their financial condition on the basis of GAAP to review for, recognize, measure and report losses resulting from drops in the value of assets within the scope of the statement \u201cwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under FAS 121, and asset is said to be \u201cimpaired\u201d if application of FAS 121 indicates that the asset is not worth the value at which it is carried on the books of the company. <em>Id. </em>at 6. \u201cFAS 121 anticipates and requires that managers, like the defendants, exercise considerable business judgment in performing an impairment review.\u201d <em>In re: Serologicals Sec Litigation, </em>2003 WL 24033694 at *14 (N.D.Ga.

No. 1433(E &amp; Y) at 1. E &amp; Y also asserts that Mr. Mathis\u2019s methodology is fatally deficient because his FAS 121 analysis \u201cactually contradicts FAS 121\u201d and uses a method that \u201cis not allowed under FAS 121.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The defendants seek to exclude Mr. Mathis\u2019s proposed expert testimony <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-15\">The Daubert challenges as to Mr. Mint-zer are narrower. The defendants seek to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>exclude everything Mr. Mintzer has to say about FAS 121, but not everything he has to say on other subjects. E &amp; Y seeks to exclude Mr. Mintzer\u2019s opinions that WCG should have taken an impairment charge as of December 31, 2000 as to (i) the fiber network and (ii) the equipment inventory.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Doc. No. 1436(E <em>&amp; </em>Y) at 1. E &amp; Y argues that Mr. Mintzer lacks sufficient knowledge and experience with respect to application of FAS 121, that his reliance on the work of Mr. Mathis as to impairment of the fiber network is fatal to his own opinion as to impairment, and that Mr. Mint-zer\u2019s opinion that WCG should have taken an impairment charge with respect to unspecified equipment inventory as of December 31, 2000 is fatally nonspecific and unreliable. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">The WCG defendants seek to exclude Mr. Mintzer\u2019s opinions as to violation of debt covenants and as to whether FAS 121 Step 1 triggering events occurred in <em>2001. </em>Doc.

Mathis and Mintzer with respect to FAS 121 impairment analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-9\">Viewing the Daubert challenges to the proposed expert testimony of Messrs. Mathis and Mintzer with respect to application of FAS 121 in light of the complexity of the accounting issues as to which they opine, in light of the reliance Mr. Mintzer necessarily places on Mr. Mathis\u2019s work, and in light of the bases for the defendants\u2019 challenges to the opinions of the two experts, closer analysis of the division of labor between the two experts with respect to application of FAS 121 is required. The determination of the existence of an impairment loss under FAS 121 as of (or at any time after) December 31, 2000 plainly required (whether made contemporaneously or by Messrs. Mathis and Minter as retained experts) several separately identifiable analyses and judgments. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of the analyses and judgments which application of FAS 121 entailed and of the division of labor between Messrs. Mathis and Mintzer with respect to those tasks:</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-10\">\n<em>STEP 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-11\">FAS 121, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5</p>\n<p id=\"AZn\">Determine whether impairment indicators exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>Identify triggers of impairment analysis.

Mathis and Mintzer. As has been noted, Mr. Mintzer is a Certified Public Accountant. Mr. Mathis is not. E &amp; Y asserts, in essence, that in evaluating Mr. Mintzer\u2019s work as a retained expert in this case, the court should apply the standards that would have governed Mr. Mintzer\u2019s work (both substantively and with respect to methodology) if he were performing the audit of the financial statements of WMB and WCG in the first instance. Thus, in support of its criticism of Mr. Mintzer\u2019s reliance on Mr. Mathis\u2019s performance of Steps 2 and 3 of the FAS 121 impairment analysis, E <em>&amp; </em>Y argues that Auditing Standard 336 precluded Mr. Mintzer from adopting or otherwise relying on Mr. Mathis\u2019s work. Doc. No. 1436(E &amp; Y) at 11; Doc. No. 1525(E <em>&amp; </em>Y) at 7. In response, plaintiffs argue that \u201cMintzer, of course, was not conducting an audit. He was evaluating and opining on the methodologies employed by WCG and its auditors related to WCG\u2019s 2000 audit. Thus, GAAS[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] does not define the standard to which he is held and AU 336 is not relevant to this case. The applicable standard for his opinion is Fed.R.Evid. 703.\u201d Doc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>No. 1499 (Plaintiffs) at 6. Plaintiffs assert, instead, that the relevant professional standard is the Statement on Standards for Consulting Services, published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). <em>Id. </em>at 7 (citing \u201cSSCS \u00a7 100.06\u201d). In reply, E &amp; Y argues that \u201cPlaintiffs also are wrong that SSCS \u00a7 100.06 applies because Mintzer was hired only as a \u2018consultant.\u2019 Perhaps what Mintzer is doing <em>for plaintiffs </em>qualifies as \u2018consulting,\u2019 but what he is purporting to do <em>for the jury </em>is step into the shoes of an auditor and accountant performing a FAS 121 analysis.\u201d Doc. No. 1525 at 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">The court rejects E &amp; Y\u2019s contention that the GAAP and GAAS standards that governed its audit work apply, of their own force, to Mr. Mintzer\u2019s work as a retained expert. His work as a retained expert (and hence the court\u2019s evaluation of his work under <em>Daubert) </em>certainly must be informed by the relevant GAAP and GAAS standards. But <em>Daubert </em>and Rules 702 and 703, as well as the relevant standards governing the public accounting profession, lead the court to the conclusion that Mr. Mintzer\u2019s work is not to be judged by wholesale application of the standards that would have governed his work (both methods and substantive principles) had he performed the WMB and WCG audits himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">As a beginning point, the court will examine how the public accounting profession characterizes and defines Mr. Mint-zer\u2019s engagement as a retained expert in this case. The AICPA\u2019s standards and related interpretive materials provide valuable guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">The AICPA distinguishes between what it calls \u201cattest services\u201d and other types of service. \u201cFor years, attest services generally were limited to expressing a positive opinion on historical financial statements on the basis of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS).\u201d AICPA Professional Standards: <em>Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements, </em>as amended (AICPA, 2001). Attest services now include services other than traditional audits, <em>id., </em>but the common characteristic of all attest engagements is that the practitioner is attesting to, or providing assurance on, subject matter that is the responsibility of another party. Jane M. Mancino and Charles E. Landes, <em>A New Look at the Attestation Standards, </em>Journal of Accountancy, vol. 192, no. 1 (AICPA July 2001).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See also, In re Computer Learning Centers, Inc., </em>285 B.R. 191, 215 (Bkrtcy.E.D.Va.2002). Attest services are the gold standard; expert opinions in litigation are more like base metal: \u201cAn expert opinion is not an attest opinion as the term is used in reference to a set or specified elements of financial statements. On rare occasions, though, an expert opinion may relate to an examination of a financial presentation or to a judgment on whether financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\u201d Peter B. Frank and Michael Wagner, <em>Providing Litigation Services, </em>Consulting Services Practice Aid 93-1, at \u00b6 70/110.03 (AICPA 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">Frank and Wagner go on to comment that: \u201cIn general, litigation services engagements are considered to be a form of consulting services as defined by the AIC-PA. Therefore, the Statements on Standards for Consulting Services (SSCS) must be followed in a litigation services engagement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70/130.18. As a consulting service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1280-11\">[Litigation work] excludes three general categories of services subject to AICPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>Technical Standards. These standards are Statements on Auditing Standards (SASs), Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAEs), or Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARSs). The excluded services may be performed in conjunction with consulting services, but only the consulting services are subject to the SSCS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">Peter B. Frank, Michael Wagner and Roman L. Weil, <em>Litigation Services Handbook: The Role of the Accountant as Expert Witness, </em>at 3 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.1993 supp.) (hereinafter: <em>Handbook).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">Because of the sharp differentiation between attest services and consulting engagements (of which litigation services are one variety), the AICPA cautions that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyY\">When the practitioner determines that an attest service is to be provided as part of a consulting service engagement, the practitioner should inform the client of the relevant differences between the two types of services and obtain concurrence that the attest service is to be performed in accordance with the appropriate professional requirements. The practitioner should take such actions <em>because the professional requirements for an attest service differ from those for a consulting service engagement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">AICPA Professional Standards: <em>Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements, </em>as amended, \u00a7 101, \u00b6 110 (AICPA, 2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">In the case at bar, plaintiffs do not claim that Mr. Mintzer performed an audit conforming to GAAS. He was not required by <em>Daubert </em>(or Rules 702 and 703) to do that. This court agrees with the court in <em>United States v. Forbes, </em>2006 WL 2792883 (D.Conn. Sept. 28, 2006) that an accountant may testify with respect to GAAS or GAAP violations on the basis of work done in compliance with the AICPA\u2019s standards for consulting work. In <em>Forbes, </em>the court rejected the defendant\u2019s assertion that the expert\u2019s proposed testimony was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiQ\">deficient because he did not follow generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) in formulating his opinions. [The expert] did not need to perform an audit in accordance with GAAS or attest to the accuracy under generally accepted auditing [sic] principles (GAAP) of CUC\u2019s and Cendant\u2019s financial statements in order to give his expert opinion that those financial statements violated GAAP.... He also did not need to use GAAS to identify the fraudulent accounting practices or to explain how they violated GAAP and inflated those earnings. [The expert\u2019s] work on this case is governed by the consulting standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (\u201cAICPA\u201d), and his testimony complied with those standards. Contrary to Forbes\u2019s contention, this does not mean that [the expert] did not employ the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in his field.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\"><em>Id. </em>at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-12\">As has been noted, E &amp; Y\u2019s primary complaint as to Mr. Mintzer\u2019s asserted failure to comply with GAAS in his work as an expert in this case is that Mr. Mintzer\u2019s use of, and reliance on, the FAS 121 Step 2 and Step 3 conclusions of Mr. Mathis violated Auditing Standard 336. Pointing out that Messrs. Mathis and Mintzer have never even spoken with each other (Mathis deposition at 89), E &amp; Y argues, in effect, that the asserted AU 336 violation, without more, requires rejection of Mr. Mintzer\u2019s proposed expert testimony. Doc. No. 1436(E <em>&amp; </em>Y) at 11; Doc. No. 1525(E &amp; Y) at 7.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although the relationship between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>Mr. Mathis\u2019s work and that of Mr. Mintzer deserves, and will get, more detailed treatment later in this memorandum, the court, relying on the legal and accounting authorities set forth above, rejects E &amp; Y\u2019s <em>per se </em>argument as to the impermissibility of Mr. Mintzer\u2019s reliance on Mr. Mathis\u2019s work.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">3. <em>Daubert analysis </em>\u2014 proposed <em>expert testimony ofH.

See the discussion in Part V(B) and (C), above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">The FAS 121 Step 2 and Step 3 analysis undertaken by Mr. Mathis represents the entirety of his expert work in this case, and forms an indispensable component of a significant portion of the expert work of Mr. Mintzer. Mathis Rpt. at 2-4; Mintzer Rpt., \u00b6\u00b6 150-52, p. 52-53.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">Without repeating all of the task descriptions summarized in the chart in Part V(D)(1), above, Mr. Mathis\u2019s FAS 121 Step 2 and Step 3 analysis plainly required, on the basis of an understanding of the then-relatively new (but rapidly expanding)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> fiber optic data transmission business (augmented by an understanding of competing data transmission technologies): judgments as to classification and grouping<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> of fiber optic assets and related equipment assets (with related judgments as to the present and future physical and commercial interrelationship between lit and dark fiber assets), judgments (on a retrospective as well as prospective basis) as to the extent and effect of increases in industry-wide capacity, judgments as to future retention of core fiber and associated assets (with related judgments as to the impact of existing and foreseeable technology improvements<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> on capacity), judgments as to present and future domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>and international demand for internet, data, voice and video data transmission services and for rights of use of dark fiber, judgments as to the effect of market and technology factors on prices for data transmission services (and rights of use), as well as the costs of providing those services, judgments as to the remaining physical and technological useful life of the dark fiber assets, and judgments as to appropriate discount rates, as affected by both micro- and macro economic factors.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">The qualifications that Mr. Mathis brought to this undertaking are summarized as follows: Mr. Mathis is a Managing Director in Miller Mathis &amp; Co., an investment banking firm. He was graduated from Allegheny College with a Bachelor of Arts degree and from the Wharton Graduate School of Business with a Master of Business Administration degree. To put it mildly, he has substantial experience in the business world. His career history is summarized in Appendix B to his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">Mr. Mathis asserts, and there is no reason to doubt, that he has substantial experience in discounted cash flow analysis. This is significant because, depending on the circumstances, a discounted cash flow analysis is a permissible valuation technique under FAS 121, Step 3. FAS 121, \u00b6 7. In this respect, it is noteworthy that plaintiffs define Mr. Mathis\u2019s task in this case narrowly and then assert that he was qualified to perform that narrowly-defined task.' Although plaintiffs acknowledge that they \u201cretained Mathis to evaluate Step 2 and Step 3 of the impairment analysis,\u201d Doc. No. 1498 (Plaintiffs) at 4, they favor a more limited description of what he actually did: they say that he was called upon to \u201copine on financial valuations based on cash flow analyses, an area well-within his expertise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. He has performed numerous \u201cvaluations based on discounted cash flow analyses,\u201d for which reason \u201che is entirely qualified to perform a discounted cash flow analysis in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">Bearing in mind that Mr. Mathis, and Mr. Mathis alone, is on the hook for FAS 121 Steps 2 and 3 in this case, it is clear that his engagement to perform the Step 2 and 3 analyses necessarily entailed judgments (whether they are characterized as accounting judgments, business judgments, or financial judgments, or some combination of the three) substantially more complex and industry-specific than is suggested by the description of his task as, essentially, a discounted cash flow analysis. The FAS 121 Step 2 and Step 3 analyses in this case required numerous quantitative (see the chart in Part V(D)(1), above) inputs which, by their nature, could only be the product of qualitative judgments resulting from the application of industry-specific knowledge, augmented by professional experience in selecting and evaluating the relevant data and then pushing the masses of data through the FAS 121 analytical process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-12\">Viewing the matter in this light, it is evident that Mr. Mathis\u2019s qualifications for his specific tasks in this case must be viewed both in light of his considerable business experience and in light of the credentials and experience that he does not possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-13\">Mr. Mathis is neither a certified public accountant nor \u201can accountant\u201d nor an \u201cauditor.\u201d Mathis Dep. 38, 45. That, in itself, is dispositive of nothing, but it is relevant. He has never performed a FAS 121 analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 46. This case is \u201cthe only time\u201d he has ever been asked to render an opinion as to impairment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>assets under FAS 121. <em>Id. </em>at 53. By his own description, he is \u201cnot a telecom expert.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60. He did not avail himself of the assistance of his firm\u2019s telecom expert. <em>Id. </em>Though he sat, \u201cfrom the late \u201990s to the early 2000s\u201d on the board of a wireless paging company (Arch Communications), he recalls no specific experience \u201cworking for or on behalf of a company that has a fiber network.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">The disjunctive language of Rule 702 makes it clear that experience can substitute for formal credentials. <em>E.g., LifeWise Master Funding v. Telebank, </em>374 F.3d 917, 928 (10th Cir.2004). But regardless of the mix of formal credentials and experience that is proffered as establishing the requisite \u201cqualifications\u201d under the rule, those qualifications must be <em>specific </em>as well as <em>general. </em>See the discussion in Part V(B), above. In this case, as a practical matter, the requirement of <em>specific </em>qualifications means that, for the FAS 121 Step 2 and Step 3 work for which Mr. Mathis undertook sole responsibility in plaintiffs\u2019 lineup of experts, Mr. Mathis necessarily had to have industry-specific qualifications: \u201cThe real question is, what is he an expert about?\u201d <em>Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel Corp. </em>254 F.3d at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">The court concludes with no difficulty that, had Mr. Mathis been a member of a team of specialists collaborating on an FAS 121 analysis of WCG\u2019s dark fiber and related assets, he would have had much to offer with respect to those aspects of FAS 121 Step 3 that would have included a discounted cash flow analysis (if that valuation method were selected). It is equally clear, however, that the numerous financial, accounting and business judgments (correctly referred to by E &amp; Y and the WCG defendants as \u201cindustry-dependent judgments,\u201d Doc. No. 1523 [E &amp; Y and WCG] at 8) that are antecedent to a Step 3 discounted cash flow analysis are no more \u201cwithin the reasonable confines of [Mr. Mathis\u2019s] subject area\u201d than were the board-certified orthopedic surgeon\u2019s criticisms of the warnings accompanying the orthopedic nail in <em>Ralston. Ralston, </em>275 F.3d at 970 (quoting <em>Compton v. Subaru of America, Inc., </em>82 F.3d 1513, 1520 (10th Cir.1996)). It should be noted, moreover, that the opinions expounded by Mr. Mathis as to FAS 121 Steps 2 and 3 are not undergirded by the work of Mr. Mintzer: \u201cFor purposes of evaluating Step 2 and Step 3 of the FAS 121 impairment calculation, I am relying on another expert retained by Plaintiffs with specialized knowledge and skills in the field of business valuation, Mr. Sean Mathis of the firm Miller Mathis. I am relying on Mr. Mathis in a similar fashion that an auditor relies on a specialist in the conduct of an audit.\u201d Mintzer Rpt., \u00b6 150, p. 52.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Although this is more relevant to an analysis of Mr. Mintzer\u2019s work than to that of Mr. Mathis, it is also worthy of note that Mr. Mathis\u2019s qualifications cannot be bolstered by any claim that he was selected by Mr. Mintzer. Mr. Mintzer did not select Mr. Mathis, and had never worked with or even heard of him before they both were hired by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in this case. Mintzer deposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>tion at 283. Mr. Mintzer undertook no investigation of Mr. Mathis other than to look for publicly available \u201cnegative citations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">The short of the matter is that Mr. Mathis, though clearly possessing the <em>general </em>qualifications required to perform a discounted cash flow analysis, does not possess the industry-specific expertise necessary to make the numerous judgments which had to be made in order to generate the inputs for a discounted cash flow analysis as applied to the dark fiber and related assets of WCG as of December 31, 2000. His expert opinions as to the outcome of a FAS 121 Step 2 and Step 3 analysis as applied to those assets in this case, are, accordingly, inadmissible under Rule 702 and <em>Daubert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">b. <em>Reliability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">The defendants attack the reliability of Mr. Mathis\u2019s proposed expert testimony on several bases. Defendants assert that, in performing his FAS 121 analysis, Mr. Mathis improperly disregarded WCG\u2019s business plans. They also assert that Mr. Mathis\u2019s approach to asset grouping was fatally flawed in several respects. Because the court has determined that Mr. Mathis lacks the qualifications necessary to give the expert testimony he proposes to give, it would be sufficient to leave it at that, and forego analysis of any of the challenges to the reliability of that testimony. The court has determined, however, that it is appropriate to address two aspects of the challenge to the reliability of Mr. Mathis\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\"><em>Methodology: Disregard for management\u2019s budgets and projections. </em>In considering a Daubert motion, it is usually important for the court to determine whether the methodology employed by an expert \u201cis generally accepted in the relevant [professional] community,\u201d <em>Kumho, </em>526 U.S. at 151, 119 S.Ct. 1167, because a retained expert\u2019s adherence to an established and recognized methodology (if there is one) is important under Daubert and its progeny. <em>See, e.g., 103 Investors I, L.P. v. Square D Co., </em>470 F.3d 985 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-13\">Paragraph 142 of FAS 121 states that \u201cinformation necessary to perform the re-coverability test is generally available from budgets and projections used by management in the decision-making process.\u201d As will be seen, Mr. Mathis acknowledged that, in performing his FAS 121 analysis, he disregarded WCG\u2019s business plan. As a matter of methodology under paragraph 142, management\u2019s business plans clearly ought not to be rejected out of hand: those business plans may ultimately, for some reason, be disregarded, but the auditor who takes it upon himself to reject them plainly should have a reasoned basis for doing so. Likewise, in this litigation context, the expert is one step removed from making professional auditing judgments in the first instance \u2014 his task is to provide expert testimony in aid of a determination of whether the others who came before him made judgments which were fraudulent or otherwise actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-14\">As to whether he took management\u2019s business plans into account in reaching his judgments under FAS 121, Mr. Mathis testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-15\">Q. Did you try to conduct your analysis to be consistent with WCG\u2019s business plan as of 12-31-2000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-16\">A. FAS 121 does not mention business plan[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>] anywhere. We wanted our analysis to be consistent with 121, and business plan is not mentioned, so business plan to us was irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>Q. The company\u2019s business plan at 12-31-2000 was irrelevant to your analysis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-4\">A. In terms of doing the FAS 121 analysis, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-5\">Q. So you have no opinion whatsoever as to whether your analysis was consistent with the company\u2019s business plan as of 12-31-2000; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-6\">MR. VINIK: I object to the form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-7\">A. Our analysis is independent of any business plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">Mathis deposition at 102-03-</p>\n<p id=\"AQTO\">Mr. Mathis reinforced this point when he testified that \u201cwe did not conduct our analysis with regard to their business plan, as consistent with FAS 121.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104. Otherwise stated: \u201cWe did' not, consistent with FAS 121, consider the company\u2019s business plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105. \u2022 Later in his deposition, when pressed on a related point, Mr. Mathis reminded counsel, somewhat petulantly, that: \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t use company information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">In response to defendants\u2019 arguments on this point, plaintiffs argue, first (and correctly) that: \u201cNothing in Paragraph 142 requires that budgets and projections used by management should be taken at face value, or that they 'should be the sole source of information relied on in an impairment analysis.\u201d Doc. No. 1498 at 9. Plaintiffs also point out that Mr. Mathis testified as follows: \u201cSo would we look at management\u2019s projections? The answer is we looked at some of management\u2019s projections.\u201d Mathis deposition at 113. The problem is that plaintiffs point to nothing in Mr. Mathis\u2019s report or testimony reflecting consideration, analysis and reasoned rejection of management\u2019s budgets and projections relevant to an FAS 121 impairment analysis. A fair reading of his testimony reliably indicates that Mr. Mathis made an <em>a priori </em>decision not to take management\u2019s business plan into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">Under Rule 702, it behooves the retained expert to use \u201creliable principles and methods.\u201d Alteration of an established methodology is a \u201cstep that renders the analysis unreliable [and] renders the expert\u2019s testimony inadmissible.\u201d <em>Goebel II, </em>346 F.3d at 992. <em>See also, Mitchell v. Gencorp Inc., </em>165 F.3d at 782. In the case at bar, the parties and the court have, in FAS 121, guidance as to methodology of a quality and definitiveness that could only be aspired to in most of the areas in which expert witnesses ply their trade. Where, as here, the document that is the lodestar of the expert\u2019s endeavor spells out the method to be employed, the expert must either use that methodology or demonstrate that he has a reasoned basis for choosing to ignore it.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Mr. Mathis has done neither. In this very noticeable respect, his work was not \u201crooted in the principles and methodology of accountancy.\u201d <em>Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n v. Lipson, </em>46 F.Supp.2d 758, 764 (N.D.Ill.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number><em>Accounting for alternative explanations re: asset grouping: treatment of the network as a single asset. </em>One of the factors to be considered by the court is \u201c[w]hether the expert has adequately accounted for obvious alternative explanations.\u201d Rule 702, Fed.R.Evid., Adv. Committee note to 2000 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">Asset grouping is central to the validity of Mr. Mathis\u2019s FAS 121 impairment analysis. The dispute as to network asset grouping for purposes of FAS 121 impairment analysis is, essentially, a dispute as to whether a year-end 2000 impairment analysis, if one had been performed, should have treated the entire fiber optic network as the relevant asset, or whether the dark fiber assets should have been separated out for impairment analysis, as was done by Mr. Mathis. Treatment of the fiber network as a unified asset for year-end 2000 impairment analysis is an \u201cobvious alternative explanation\u201d vis-a-vis the approach taken by Mr. Mathis. Mr. Mathis was invited \u2014 and declined \u2014 to express an opinion criticizing WCG\u2019s failure to perform an impairment analysis on the network as a whole as of year-end 2000. He disclaimed an opinion as to whether it would have been inappropriate to perform an analysis on the basis of that asset grouping. Mathis deposition at 43-45. He expressed his opinion that he thought the group of assets he selected \u201cwas the correct group of assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44. Thus, although it may well be that the reason Mr. Mathis performed an impairment analysis of only the dark fiber assets is that he \u201cwas asked [by plaintiffs counsel] to do an impairment analysis of the dark fiber assets,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20, he did assert that his conclusion as to grouping of assets was an expression of <em>his </em>analytical conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 44. For that reason, it is especially noteworthy that Mr. Mathis expressly disclaims an opinion that it would have been <em>inappropriate </em>under FAS 121 to have performed an analysis of WCG\u2019s network as a whole as of year end 2000. <em>Id. </em>at 43-45.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, this is not an issue that was handed off by Mr. Mathis to Mr. Mint-zer \u2014 Mr. Mintzer\u2019s proposed expert testimony does not close this gap. It is clear from Mr. Mintzer\u2019s report (\u00b6\u00b6 147, et seq.) that, in expressing <em>his </em>opinion that WCG improperly failed to record an impairment charge at year end 2000, he relies entirely on Mr. Mathis as to FAS 121 Step 2 and Step 3. Otherwise stated, Mr. Mintzer\u2019s proposed expert testimony provides no independent analysis or expression of opinion on the issue of grouping of assets under FAS 121 for purposes of the year-end 2000 financial statements. Thus, on the issue of whether it would have been inappropriate for WCG to have treated the fiber network as a single asset for FAS 121 purposes as of year end 2000, Mr. Mintzer clearly does not pick up where Mr. Mathis left off \u2014 and, as has been noted, Mr. Mathis stops short of opining that it would have been inappropriate under FAS 121 to have performed an analysis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>WCG\u2019s network as a whole as of year end 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">It bears repeating that Messrs. Mathis and Mintzer, as retained experts, are not doing \u201cfirst instance\u201d auditing in this case. Especially where professional judgment is involved (and, as has been seen, the performance of an FAS 121 impairment analysis is a process that is shot through with judgment calls<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>), an expert\u2019s opinion as to how <em>he </em>would have performed a task is of limited relevance at best unless he has given a reasoned explanation of why the most obvious alternative (in this case, treatment of the fiber network as a unified asset) is inappropriate and should consequently be rejected. Mr. Mathis\u2019s selected approach to asset grouping does not, in and of itself, undermine an antipodal approach. In this context, the expert who goes no further than to select and defend his preferred approach leaves the job, at best, half done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of establishing that the proposed expert testimony of Mr. Mathis is the product of reliable principles and methods, reliably applied to the facts of this case. It will be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\">4. <em>Daubert analysis </em>\u2014 proposed <em>expert testimony of Andrew M.

No. 1437 at 4-6 and Doc. No. 1436 at 8-9. The WCG defendants attack Mr. Mintzer\u2019s expertise only as to his opinion that WCG was in violation of the EBIT-DA-related provisions of its debt covenants. E &amp; Y attacks Mr. Mintzer\u2019s qualifications only as to his opinion on network impairment. Because the court\u2019s exclusion of Mr. Mathis\u2019s opinion testimony on that subject is fatal to the admissibility of Mr. Mintzer\u2019s opinion testimony on the same subject, the court need not address E &amp; Y\u2019s attack on Mr. Mintzer\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">As to Mr. Mintzer\u2019s qualification to give expert testimony with respect to debt covenant violations, the WCG defendants argue that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-8\">EBITDA is a non-GAAP term which is defined on a case-by-case basis by contracting parties. Here, the Credit Agreement provides the controlling definition of EBITDA. Thus, Mintzer\u2019s fundamental opinion \u2014 that certain revenues were improperly included in the calculation of EBITDA \u2014 depends not on his analysis of the requirements of GAAP, but on a legal interpretation of the Credit Agreement, i.e. the intent of the contract between WCG and its Bank Group. Mintzer, a CPA, can offer no expertise, special or otherwise, regarding the intent of the parties to a contract. Nor can he seek to opine on the interpretation of a unique, contractual non-GAAP term, substituting his intent for that of the parties themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">Doc. No. 1437 at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">The WCG defendants conclude by asserting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-11\">Mintzer\u2019s opinion relating to debt covenants is not founded upon any expertise in accounting, generally, or GAAP, specifically, but rather his personal lay interpretation of the parties\u2019 intent regarding a contractually negotiated EBITDA definition. It is not, therefore, proper expert testimony and should be excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-14\">The court disagrees. Although EBIT-DA was a term which was contractually defined between WCG and its lenders, the beginning point for calculation of EBITDA was GAAP net income. <em>See, </em>Exh. 5916 and EY-WCG-00-001534-1537. The adjustments to GAAP net income, to calculate EBITDA, consist of items which can be expected to be well-understood by a Certified Public Accountant with Mr. Mint-zer\u2019s experience. Judgment is involved (especially with respect to the adjustment for \u201cnon-cash extraordinary or non-recurring charges\u201d), but the requisite judgment is accounting judgment, not legal judgment. The fact that the EBITDA calculation required the auditor to read, understand and apply contractual terms did not take the EBITDA calculation outside of the realm in which CPA\u2019s with Mr. Mint-zer\u2019s experience commonly work. Auditors read and apply contractual documents all the time. In a complex business organization like WCG, the calculation of EBIT-DA could certainly be a complex task, but it was, at base, an accounting task, as is amply demonstrated by the relevant portion of Mr. Mintzer\u2019s report (\u00b6\u00b6 172-223). The court concludes that Mr. Mintzer was well-qualified to render his opinion as to debt covenant violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-15\">b. <em>Reliability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-16\"><em>Paragraphs 86-171 and 269-280: Impairment. </em>Mr. Mintzer\u2019s opinions as to impairment under FAS 121 are wholly dependent on the excluded expert testimony of Mr. Mathis as to FAS 121 Steps 2 and 3. \u201cUnder <em>Daubert, </em>any step that renders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>the analysis unreliable renders the expert\u2019s testimony inadmissible.\u201d <em>Goebel II, </em>346 F.3d at 992. <em>See also, J.B.

Mintzer Rpt., \u00b6277; Mintzer deposition at 302-03. That alone suffices to preclude testimony from Mr. Mintzer as to equipment impairment, because the expert must tie the relevant principles \u201creliably to the facts of the case.\u201d Rule 702, Fed.R.Evid.; <em>Goebel II, </em>346 F.3d at 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\"><em>Paragraphs 172-223: Debt covenant violations. </em>Aside from the WCG defendants\u2019 unsuccessful challenge to Mr. Mint-zer\u2019s qualifications to opine as to debt covenant violations, there is no Daubert challenge to Mr. Mintzer\u2019s proposed opinion testimony with respect to violations of debt covenants. That testimony will accordingly not be excluded under <em>Daubert </em>and Rule 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">\u2022 <em>Paragraphs 295-301: March, June and September, 2001 financial statements, </em>Mr. Mintzer opines that, aside from the FAS 121 triggering events that were evident at year end 2000, additional triggering events.were evident in 2001. Mintzer Rpt., \u00b6 296. He proceeds to describe those events, then concludes that: \u201cThe financial statements of WCG included in its Forms 10Q at March 31, 2001, June 30, 2001 and September 30, 2001 were not prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of the GAAP violations discussed above; specifically WCG\u2019s failure to disclose the network impairment charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-8\">The WCG defendants point out that Mr. Mintzer has not performed an FAS 121 Step 1 trigger analysis for any date after year end 2000. (It is also clear from Mr. Mathis\u2019s report that his FAS 121 analysis stops at year end 2000. Mathis Rpt. at 2-4.) Consequently, the WCG defendants argue, in essence, that Mr. Mintzer\u2019s comments about triggering events in 2001 are apropos of nothing and should be excluded because they are irrelevant and confusing. Doc. No. 1437 at 7. In response, plaintiffs assert (claiming that Mr. Mintzer \u201cclarified\u201d the matter in his deposition testimony) that all Mr. Mintzer really meant to do in paragraphs 295-301 was to provide additional evidence \u201cto support and amplify his opinion that an impairment was necessary at YE 2000.\u201d Doc. No. 1499 at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-9\">Aside from the fact that this temporizing explanation squarely contradicts the opinion proffered in paragraph 301 of Mr. Mintzer\u2019s report <em>(viz. </em>that WCG\u2019s March, June and September, 2001 financial statements were not prepared in accordance with GAAP \u201cas a result of the GAAP violations discussed above\u201d), the opinions set forth in paragraphs 295-301, as explained and clarified, must be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">First, taking plaintiffs at their word that the expert testimony embodied in paragraphs 295-301 is merely intended to generally support, or amplify, Mr. Mintzer\u2019s proposed testimony that an impairment charge should have been taken at year end 2000, the court has determined that Mr. Mintzer\u2019s opinion about impairment at year end 2000 must be excluded. Paragraphs 295-301 are, on that basis, irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>Second, testimony about additional triggering events in 2001, as set forth in paragraphs 295-301, is inadmissible because there is no showing, or even a claim, that plaintiffs\u2019 experts have performed an FAS 121 analysis for any date after year end 2000. Gratuitous testimony about asserted FAS 121 triggering events in 2001 would be confusing and prejudicial, especially when considered in light of the fact that criticism of the defendants\u2019 failure to report network impairment as of year end 2000 (even if otherwise admissible) cannot be supported on the basis of facts which were unavailable to the defendants at the time the relevant auditing judgments were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\"><em>Paragraph 302: WMB\u2019s year end 2000 and March, 2001 financial statements. </em>Paragraph 302 of Mr. Mintzer\u2019s report states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-6\">During fiscal year 2000 and the first quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, WCG was a subsidiary of [WMB], The financial results of WCG were included in the consolidated financial statements of [WMB].

As a result of the unrecorded impairment charges described previously, [WMB\u2019s] financial statements for the periods ended December 31, 2000 and March 31, 2001 are materially misstated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">The \u201cunrecorded impairment charges\u201d referred to in this paragraph are the year end 2000 impairment charges as to which plaintiffs\u2019 proposed expert testimony has been excluded. Consequently, if for no reason other than that, the opinion testimony embodied in paragraph 302 must be excluded. Aside from that, Mr. Mintzer provides no materiality analysis to support his opinion that WMB\u2019s statements were materially misstated.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This violates the expert report requirements of Rule 26(a)(2)(B), Fed.R.Civ.P., which requires that the report of a retained expert disclose \u201cthe basis and reasons\u201d for all of his opinions, as well as. \u201cthe data or other information considered\u201d by the expert and precludes a showing by plaintiffs, consonant with their burden under Rule 104(a), Fed.R.Evid. <em>(see, Ralston, </em>275 F.3d at 970, n. 4), that this proposed opinion testimony passes muster under Rule 702 and <em>Dau-bert </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-10\"><em>Paragraphs 303-305: WMB\u2019s failure to record a contingent liability. </em>In the final numbered paragraphs of his report, paragraphs 303-305, Mr. Mintzer opines that WMB should have recorded a charge on its June and September, 2001 financial statements<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> for its 'contingent liability as a guarantor of more than $1 billion in WCG debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-11\">Paragraphs 303-305, which are presented by Mr. Mintzer under their own heading, represent a discrete piece of analysis and opinion by Mr. Mintzer. His contention as to WMB\u2019s obligation to take a charge related to its contingent liability on WCG\u2019s debt is a conclusion which is, both as an accounting matter and as a legal matter, distinct from his opinions about WCG\u2019s financial statements and about WMB\u2019s failure to take impairment ch\u00e1rges relating to WCG\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-12\">In its Daubert motion, WMB provides arguments, at least facially well supported, as to why this opinion should be excluded.

This portion of Dr. Nye\u2019s report is relevant and essentially accurate. It contains little information not documented elsewhdre in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">A major premise underlying Dr. Nye\u2019s opinions in this case is the assumption that senior management of WMB and WCG, as well as E &amp; Y, misrepresented WCG\u2019s financial condition and prospects, specifically including assumptions (i) that WCG should have taken a charge in excess of $750 million, not later than year-end 2000, for impairment of long-lived assets and inventory (ie., the asset impairment addressed by the excluded testimony of Messrs. Mathis and Mintzer), (ii) that the asset impairment should have been publicly disclosed \u201cno later than in early 2001,\u201d and (iii) that if the impairment had been recognized and disclosed on a timely basis, investors would likely have understood that WCG would not be able to generate revenue sufficient to pay its debts.

Dr. Nye also assumed \u201cthat as of that day, [July 23, 2000, the day before the class period began] that WCG either knew or should have known that it had zero expected value for its equity, zero projected value for its equity.\u201d Nye deposition at 272. <em>See also, id. </em>at p. 168 (on July 24, 2000, \u201cthe value of the equity was zero.

Thus, in Scenario 1 (his preferred damage scenario), Dr. Nye concluded that on day one of the class period, July 24, 2000, when the stock closed at $28.50 per share, that price consisted of $27.94 (98%) by way of fraud-related price inflation and 56 cents of actual value.

The WCG defendants challenge Dr. Nye\u2019s opinions with respect to materiality.

However, all defendants challenge Dr. Nye\u2019s methodologies with respect to loss causation and the closely related issues as to identification of compensable losses. For present purposes, it is not necessary to address the defendants\u2019 challenges other than those relating to loss causation and identification of compensable losses.

He described his first scenario as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-9\"><em>Scenario 1: </em>Inflation in the prices of WCG stock and WCG Notes is measured as the difference between the price paid and the true value of each security as measured by the settle-out price for the relevant security after announcement of WCG\u2019s bankruptcy filing on April 23,[<footnotemark>37</footnotemark>] 2002, adjusted for intervening market and industry movements. I have been asked to commence damage calculations at several potential starting dates, <em>i.e., </em>July 24, 2000, November 16, 2000, February 5, 2001, March 13, 2001, and April 24, 2001. Damages are calculated as price inflation at purchase less price inflation at sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1293-10\">Nye Rpt., \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-11\">The class period in this case begins on July 24, 2000, the day WMB issued a press release announcing the spin off of WCG and extolling the benefits of the spin off strategy. The class period ends on April 22, 2002, the day of the bankruptcy filing. Under all three scenarios, damages are available to class members who purchased WCG common stock or notes at any time during the class period.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Scenario 1, which benefits all class members without regard to whether or when they sold their WCG securities,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> posits that there was \u201cleakage\u201d of the \u201crelevant truth\u201d during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>the class period and that \u201cthe leakage of WCG\u2019s true financial condition and prospects during the Class Period revealed the risks that had been concealed by the prior misrepresentations.... \u201d Nye Rpt., \u00b6\u00b6 109, 110. Plaintiffs assert that corrective information \u201cslowly leaked into the market during the Class Period, through various sources of information\u201d (Doc. No. 1376 at 7; Doc. No. 1378 at 1), gradually removing the fraud premium from the price of a share of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">As has been noted, Dr. Nye concludes in Scenario 1 that fraud accounted for ninety-eight percent of the value of a common share of WCG on July 24, 2000 ($27.94 of the $28.50 closing price). Otherwise stated, during the 21-month class period in which the per-share price of WCG stock declined from $28.50 to six cents, the \u201ctrue\u201d value of the stock, exclusive of the fraud premium, was <em>\u201c56 cents </em>going down to 6 cents.\u201d Nye deposition at 278 (emphasis added). Dr. Nye\u2019s starting point to arrive at that conclusion was the per-share closing price (just under six cents) on the trading day following WCG\u2019s bankruptcy filing \u2014 April 23, 2002. To determine the \u201ctrue value\u201d of WCG\u2019s common stock, Dr. Nye took WCG\u2019s six-cent closing price on April 23, 2002 \u201cand incorporated the movements of the market and industry on each day[<footnotemark>40</footnotemark>] from April 23, 2002, back to each starting date, such that WCG\u2019s common stock\u2019s expected value on those dates would have been $0.56 [July 24, 2000], $0.33 [Nov. 16, 2000], $0.28 [Feb. 5, 2001], $0.19 [March 13, 2001], and $0.17 [April 24, 2001], respectively\u201d in the absence of the fraud-related inflation of the per-share price. Nye Rpt., \u00b6 108. This, in Scenario 1, is described by Dr. Nye as the \u201cpredicted price .of WCG stock <em>absent the alleged fraud.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, short of the very end of the class period, Dr. Nye attributes virtually all of the market value of WCG common stock to fraud. Under Scenario 1, the amount of the damage per share is the amount of the calculated fraud-related inflation per share.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">For purposes of evaluating the defendants\u2019 Daubert challenge to Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 1, it is important to bear in mind the price trends for WCG stock and for telecommunications stocks generally during the class period. The following graph shows the changes in the per-share price of WCG\u2019s common stock before and during the class period:<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">During the same period, the trajectory of the share prices for the companies represented in the Nasdaq teleeommunica-tions index was remarkably similar:</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-10\">It bears repeating that Dr. Nye attributes 56 cents of the decline in WCG\u2019s stock from $28.50 to six cents during the class period to industry-wide difficulties and other non-fraud effects,</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>(ii) <em>Corrective disclosures </em>\u2014 Scenario <em>1.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIv\"><em>Dr. Nye\u2019s positions as to timing of corrective disclosures. </em>As is discussed below, the applicable law requires a securities fraud plaintiff in a \u201cfraud on the market\u201d case to identify compensable losses by separating the compensable fraud-related losses from losses attributable to general economic conditions, broad market trends, industry-specific stresses, management incompetence, bad luck and other non-fraud factors. As compared to Scenario 2, which posits that there were no corrective disclosures until the first of four major disclosures that occurred over the eleven week period preceding WCG\u2019s bankruptcy filing in April, 2002, Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 1 proceeds on the basis that corrective disclosures, which had the effect of draining the fraud premium out of the stock price, \u201cgradually came out over the Class Period\u201d (approximately 21 months). Nye deposition, p. 264. <em>See also, id. </em>at p. 53 (\u201cThroughout that period different things came out to the market and the inflation went down.\u201d). As will be discussed in Parts (E)(3)(a) and (b), below, because Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 1 is premised on leakage of the truth throughout the class period (thus enabling class members who sold throughout the class period to recover under Scenario 1, unlike Scenario 2), the viability of Scenario 1 depends on whether Dr. Nye has identified corrective disclosures (or, as discussed below, \u201cmaterialization of the risk\u201d) occurring during the relatively long interval which was within the class period but before the final denouement of WCG in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-3\">As has been noted, Scenario 1, asserting (or presupposing) gradual leakage of the relevant truth throughout the class period, is Dr. Nye\u2019s (and plaintiffs\u2019) preferred damage scenario. The development of Scenario 2, in contrast, was plainly driven by concerns as to whether corrective disclosures, cognizable under <em>Dura </em>and its progeny, occurred before the final few months preceding the bankruptcy filing in April, 2002.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Dr. Nye\u2019s report is in some respects at odds with his deposition testimony with respect to the timing of corrective disclosures. Dr. Nye\u2019s deposition testimony favors the gradual leakage theory more than his report does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">Building on the work of Messrs. Mathis and Mintzer (postulating the creation of the fraud premium by failure to disclose asset impairment), Dr. Nye\u2019s focus, in all of his scenarios, is on the subsequent draining of that premium from the value of WCG\u2019s securities. Dr. Nye\u2019s report concisely summarized his (and plaintiffs\u2019) inflation/deflation prototype as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-7\">Thus, the misrepresentations and omissions in defendants\u2019 disclosures to investors regarding its true financial condition could and did have an effect on WCG stock price and served to inflate the price of WCG stock throughout the Class Period. The corrective disclosures <em>later in the Class period </em>caused the WCG stock price to decline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">Nye Rpt., \u00b6 26 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\">Later in his report, although stating that \u201cthe truth about WCG\u2019s financial performance and prospects had begun to leak into the market during the Class Period,\u201d Dr. Nye cites January 29, 2002 as the date of the first \u201cspecific partial corrective disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">Given the ambiguities in Dr. Nye\u2019s report, as to the timing of corrective disclosures, it is not surprising that at his deposition, Dr. Nye was pressed as to the dates of the corrective disclosures that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>have removed the fraud-related inflation from the per-share price of WCG\u2019s common stock. He asserted that corrective disclosures occurred <em>each day </em>during the class period. Nye deposition, p. 51 (\u201cQ: And on what days were there corrective disclosures under Scenario 1? A: Scenario 1, every day. In other words, the whole thing is a manipulated period.\u201d); p. 279 (\u201cQ: [W]hat are the dates of corrective disclosure for Scenario 1 and where can I find them in your report? A: As far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019ve answered it. Q: What are the days? A: All of them.\u201d). When pressed to describe some association between misstatements and corrective disclosures, Dr. Nye responded by broadening the concept of corrective disclosure to encompass essentially anything negative about the prospects of the company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-5\">Q. Is.it your view, sir, that it\u2019s one big scheme and it\u2019s \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to separate \u2014 separate out the various parts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-6\">Mr. Graziano: Objection, vague.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-7\">A. I think that there is one big overlying theme, and that\u2019s they never had a projected way to make any money on this business. As that comes out to all these details, that\u2019s what happens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-8\">Q. (By Mr. Busch) But you haven\u2019t attempted to determine which corrective disclosure goes with which particular misrepresentation, have you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-9\">A. The representation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-10\">Q. You\u2019ve listed lots\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-11\">A. <em>I haven\u2019t sorted anything out in the components. That was all basically revelation of the initial problem.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-12\">Q. So you haven\u2019t attempted to tie particular misrepresentations to particular corrective disclosures; is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-13\">A. Well, the initial misrepresentation is they can make money and pay off their debt. All these disclosures are linked directly to that. They\u2019re just basically eventually telling the market they can\u2019t pay their bills. They\u2019re not going to make any money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 135-36 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-17\">Dr. Nye\u2019s approach to corrective disclosures raises the question of whether the \u201cleakage\u201d into the market, destroying the value of a share of WCG stock, consisted of actual corrective disclosures which drained off a fraud premium, or was, instead, leakage of the gradual realization of the increasingly grim prospects for the telecommunications sector as a whole. Responding to defendants\u2019 contentions as to the merits of the leakage theory, the plaintiffs argued, citing paragraphs 28-104 of his report, that \u201cDr. Nye identifies numerous examples of corrective information that leaked into the market during the Class Period.\u201d Doc. No. 1376 at 7. Plaintiffs also asserted that Dr. Nye\u2019s massive (more than 1300-page) compendium of news articles, reports and SEC filings would reveal \u201cnumerous instances of leakage of corrective information concerning WCG\u2019s true financial condition, providing the basis for Dr. Nye\u2019s opinion that the market ultimately learned the truth about WCG that was previously concealed by defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. The compendium was Exhibit 13 to Dr. Nye\u2019s report, but, due to its size, it was not filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-18\">The seventy-six paragraphs of Dr. Nye\u2019s report cited by plaintiffs as identifying corrective disclosures (which, by definition, would have to consist of negative information) reflect, with almost no exceptions before late 2001, a continuous litany of upbeat announcements by WCG management. For that reason, the court, being concerned about a possible divergence of views as to what would constitute a corrective disclosure, directed plaintiffs to file Dr. Nye\u2019s compendium, as they had offered (Doc. No. 1376, p. 8) to do. The order directed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-19\">The filing of the copy of Exhibit 13 [the compendium] shall be accompanied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>the filing of a statement over the signature of counsel for plaintiffs, citing the pages of Exhibit 13 (by Bates number) which plaintiffs assert represent or reflect \u201ccorrective information that leaked into the market during the Class Period\u201d <em>(see, </em>Doc. No. 1376 at 7), but before January 29, 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">Doc. No. 1650, filed March 14, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">Plaintiffs filed the compendium and the statement required by the court. Doc. Nos. 1652-54 (March 21, 2007). The items designated by plaintiffs within the compendium consist predominantly of news that was generally applicable to the telecommunications industry as a whole, or, if specific to WCG, consist mostly of comments about industry-wide conditions affecting WCG. The pre-January, 2002 compendium items designated by plaintiffs which were most pointedly negative<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> were not cited by Dr. Nye in his report, likely because, although negative, they were not discernibly corrective.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">The earliest impairment-related disclosure cited by Dr. Nye in his report is the November 1, 2001 disclosure of a $150 million write down of inventory. Nye Rpt., \u00b6 83. On October 31, WCG stock closed at $1.67. Before November 1, it had lost 94 percent of the value it had at the beginning of the class period. By November 19, the per-share closing price had risen to $3.00. In terms of corrective disclosures with associated movements in the per-share price of WCG\u2019s common stock, the record is as uninformative now as it was after Dr. Nye gave his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">Using a starting date of July 24, 2000, the first day of the class period, Dr. Nye calculates that, under Scenario 1, $1.96 billion would be recoverable with respect to WCG stock and $940 million would be recoverable with respect to WCG notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-10\">b. <em>Scenario 2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">Dr. Nye described his second scenario as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-12\"><em>Scenario 2: </em>Damages incurred by purchasers of WCG stock and WCG Notes are calculated based on the percentage inflation in the security as measured by the Company-specific percentage returns <em>(ie., </em>net of market and industry effects) in the security\u2019s value upon the disclosures of information allegedly withheld from the market, on January 29, 2002, February 4, 2002, February 25, 2002 and April 23, 2002. Selling damages are limited to those shares purchased in the Class Period and held through one or more of these dates. The same five starting dates are used for this scenario as for Scenario 1, <em>ie., </em>July 24, 2000, November 16, 2000, February 5, 2001, March 13, 2001, and April 24, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-13\">Nye Rpt., \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-14\">The Scenario 2 starting dates and corrective disclosure dates are illustrated as follows (not to scale):</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">The four corrective disclosure dates are key to Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario <em>2, </em>because, in Scenario 2, Dr. Nye is \u201cmeasuring share price inflation by the effect of specific disclosures on January 29, 2002, February 4, 2002, February 25, 2002 and April 23, 2002.\u201d Nye Rpt., \u00b6 116. The operation of Scenario 2 in and after January, 2002 is graphically illustrated below. The data for the graph are from Exhibit 3B to Dr. Nye\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-13\">As can be seen, Dr. Nye\u2019s data show that WCG stock comes into 2002 at a price above $2.00 per share, consisting almost entirely of the postulated fraud premium. At the beginning of January, 2002, the fraud-related inflation is 90.8 percent of the per-share price. Exh. 3B, p. 8. As the graph shows, that inflation percentage remains constant until January 29, the date of the first of the four corrective disclosures. The inflation percentage drops slightly on January 29, and slightly more on February 4, followed by a substantial drop on February 25, finally plummeting to zero on April 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">Under this second scenario, damages are recoverable only by security holders who bought during the class period and held the security at least until January 29, 2002. Security holders who sold on or before January 28 would get no recovery. Nye deposition at 113, 275. The price decline that occurred before January 29, 2002 is \u201cnot a claimable loss.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>114. Dr. Nye acknowledged that he could give no \u201ceconomic or logical reason\u201d why a shareholder who sold on January 29 would have a claim and a shareholder who sold on January 28 would not have a claim, <em>id. </em>at 115, explaining that Scenario 2 \u201cwas produced to meet some sort of legal definition of damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124. Dr. Nye acknowledged that, in the causation section of his report, he has \u201cnot tied those four things [the disclosures on the four corrective disclosure dates] specifically to alleged] misrepresentations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">Dr. Nye used a \u201cconstant percentage inflation\u201d approach in Scenario 2. Nye Rpt., \u00b6 111. His use of this approach is noteworthy when viewed in light of the fact that, in Scenario 2, the corrective disclosures occur in a relatively compressed time period at the end of a relatively long class period \u2014 a class period in which the stock lost almost all of its value before the first corrective disclosure date. The most prominent effect of Dr. Nye\u2019s use of the constant percentage inflation method in Scenario 2 is that the declines in per-share value, beginning on the first corrective disclosure date, are cast back, on a percentage basis, to the beginning of the class period. The result, as is discussed further in Part V(E)(3)(c), below, is that a small loss in share value (on or after January 29) in dollar terms translates into a large dollar recovery per share for shares bought early in the class period \u2014 a recovery in dollars per share that is attributable mostly to share price declines that occurred <em>before </em>the first corrective disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">c. <em>Alternative Scenario 2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">Correctly anticipating some of the defendants\u2019 challenges, Dr. Nye proffers, but does not endorse, a constant dollar alternative to the constant percentage approach of his second scenario, as applied to common stock (but not as applied to the notes).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> This alternative version of Scenario 2 quantifies damages on the basis of the dollar decline (rather than the percentage decline) in per-share prices associated with each of the four dates in early 2002 on which plaintiffs assert that corrective disclosures occurred, described by plaintiffs as \u201cthe four specific corrective disclosure events at the end of the Class Period.\u201d Doc. No. 1378 at 10. Dr. Nye explains this alternative version of Scenario 2 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-11\">I expect defendants to argue that a constant dollar (as opposed to constant percentage) approach should be used to calculate damages in this case, as I have observed in many other cases. I do not endorse the use of the constant dollar methodology given the fact pattern in this case. However, at the request of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, I have calculated damages incurred by purchasers of WCG common stock based on the dollar amount of inflation in the security as measured by the company-specific dollar declines in the security\u2019s value upon the disclosures of information allegedly withheld from the market, on January 29, 2002, February 4, 2002, February 25, 2002 and April 23, 2002. The same five starting dates are used for this scenario as for Scenarios 1 and 2, <em>i.e., </em>July 24, 2000, November 16, 2000, February 5, 2001, March 13, 2001, and April 24, 2001. Selling damages are to be calculated based on the same eligibility requirements for selling damages in Scenario 2. (Note that the constant dollar methodology does not cause any selling damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>during a period of like inflation, as the inflation at purchase and inflation at sale are the same on each day within each period between disclosures.) Also, because the drop in the prices of WCG Notes used to calculate price inflation in the WCG Notes as a percentage of face value is equivalent to the dollar amount, per $100 of face value, there is no alternative calculation under Scenario 2 for the WCG Notes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">Nye Rpt., \u00b6 7. n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">The constant dollar approach of Alternative Scenario 2 yields results that differ materially from the results which would obtain under Scenario 2, as is shown by a comparison of the graph in Part V(E)(l)(b), above (illustrating the operation of Scenario 2), with the following graph, which illustrates the operation of Alternative Scenario 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">Data from Ex. 3B Alt. to Nye Rpt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\">As is discussed below, with respect to the matters which the court finds to be dispositive in this memorandum, there are no differences between Scenario 2 and Alternative Scenario 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">2. <em>Qtialifications.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-13\">The defendants do not challenge Dr. Nye\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-14\">3. <em>Reliability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">To be admissible, expert testimony must be both relevant and reliable. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 589,113 S.Ct. 2786. Relevance depends in part on whether the proposed expert testimony fits the issues in the case. <em>Id. </em>at 591, 113 S.Ct. 2786; <em>Bitter, </em>400 F.3d at 1234. In many cases, such as medical malpractice actions, the substantive legal framework in which expert testimony is offered is painted with a relatively broad brush. Determination of the admissibility of expert testimony in those cases seldom requires extensive consideration and application of substantive legal principles. This case is different. In this case, determination of the admissibility of Dr. Nye\u2019s proposed testimony as to loss causation and damages is governed as much by substantive legal principles as it is by principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>economics and finance.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In the case at bar, the two sets of principles are tightly intertwined. For that reason, the court\u2019s resolution of the Daubert challenges to Dr. Nye\u2019s proposed expert testimony begins with an analysis of the relevant substantive legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">a. <em>The loss causation requirement. </em>(i) <em>Loss causation </em>\u2014 basic <em>rules.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\"><em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005), came to the Supreme Court as a pleading case \u2014 the issue being what a securities fraud plaintiff who would proceed on a fraud on the market theory must allege with respect to loss causation in order to survive a motion to dismiss. In deciding the pleading issue, the Court explicitly, and unsurprisingly, expounded on what a securities fraud plaintiff must <em>prove </em>with respect to loss causation. For that reason, even with a pinched reading, the decision in <em>Dura </em>provides definitive guidance beyond the pleading stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">In <em>Dura, </em>the Court of Appeals had held that the complaint adequately alleged securities fraud where it averred simply that the plaintiff paid a fraudulently inflated price for the security. The Supreme Court unanimously held that the Court of Appeals was \u201cwrong, both in respect to what a plaintiff must prove and in respect to what the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint here must allege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 125 S.Ct. 1627. The Court began its analysis by noting that, in a case alleging fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of publicly traded securities, plaintiff must show, among other things: (i) transaction causation, (ii) economic loss and (iii) loss causation. <em>Id. </em>at 341-42, 125 S.Ct. 1627. Of significance in the case at bar is the court\u2019s statement that, normally, in fraud on the market cases, \u201can inflated purchase price will not itself constitute <em>or proximately cause </em>the relevant economic loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (emphasis added). The Court elaborated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-10\">For one thing, as a matter of pure logic, at the moment the transaction takes place, the plaintiff has suffered no loss; the inflated purchase payment is offset by ownership of a share that <em>at that instant </em>possesses equivalent value. Moreover, the logical link between the inflated share purchase price and any later economic loss is not invariably strong. Shares are normally purchased with an eye toward a later sale. But if, say, the purchaser sells the shares quickly before the relevant truth begins to leak out, the misrepresentation will not have led to any loss. If the purchaser sells later after the truth makes its way into the marketplace, an initially inflated purchase price <em>might </em>mean a later loss. But that is far from inevitably so. When the purchaser subsequently resells such shares, even at a lower price, that lower price may reflect, not the earlier misrepresentation, but changed economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or other events, which taken separately or together account for some or all of that lower price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 342-43, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-12\">Having articulated the substantive requirement of proof, the Court then addressed how a securities fraud plaintiff must deal with this requirement at the pleading stage. As a pleading matter, the Court\u2019s formulation was not demanding: the Court said simply that \u201c[it] should not prove burdensome for a plaintiff who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>suffered an economic loss to provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347, 125 S.Ct. 1627. This relaxed approach to pleading loss causation does not, of course, undermine the Court\u2019s conclusion that loss causation, the \u201ccausal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627, is to be established, in a fraud on the market case, by showing that the disclosure of \u201cthe relevant truth\u201d resulted in a loss attributable to \u201cthe earlier misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342-43, 125 S.Ct. 1627.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">The lower courts have applied <em>Dura </em>with varying degrees of stringency \u2014 variations that appear to be largely attributable to the fact that <em>Dura </em>has been applied in a variety of procedural contexts, including motions to dismiss, class certification, settlement approval, Daubert motions, summary judgment and trial. In resolving the Daubert challenges to Dr. Nye\u2019s proposed expert testimony, this court applies the law of loss causation, as articulated in <em>Dura </em>and in the lower courts, to Dr. Nye\u2019s three scenarios. In so doing, the court focuses principally on: (i) the extent to which Dr. Nye\u2019s methodology complies with loss causation doctrine as established in <em>Dura </em>and relevant lower court decisions, (ii) the adequacy of the factual basis for Dr. Nye\u2019s application of the methodology underlying his three scenarios, and (iii) the adequacy of his identification of loss-causing corrective disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">As a prerequisite to that analysis, further examination of the lower courts\u2019 treatment of loss causation is necessary. As has been seen, <em>Dura, </em>settling a conflict among the circuits, established that loss causation, as defined by the Court, must be shown \u2014 pleaded and proven \u2014 by a securities fraud plaintiff. Cases from lower courts are equally informative in establishing how that can, and cannot, be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">Securities fraud claims begin with material misstatements or omissions. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 125 S.Ct. 1627. The actionable conduct may be a misleadingly favorable representation, or it may be a statement that is deceptive because it suggests that nothing is amiss when something is indeed materially amiss, or it may consist simply of silence, accompanied by scienter, as to a material matter. In the case at bar, the alleged fraud consisted predominantly of the defendants\u2019 alleged failure to disclose that major assets (the fiber network and related equipment) were worth far less than was shown in WCGs\u2019s financial statements, a determination which would have required the reporting of a very large impairment loss as a charge against income under FAS 121. That, in brief, is the <em>inflation </em>side of the securities fraud equation in this case. The cases relevant to analysis of Dr. Nye\u2019s work deal with the other side of the equation: loss causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">Three months before the Supreme Court handed down its decision in <em>Dura, </em>the Second Circuit addressed loss causation in <em>Lentell v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc., </em>396 F.3d 161 (2nd Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 421, 163 L.Ed.2d 321 (2005), an illuminating decision that is entirely congruent with <em>Dura.</em><footnotemark><em>49</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court in <em>Lentell </em>concluded, albeit as a pleading matter, that a plaintiff had not adequately alleged loss causation where \u201c[tjhere is no allegation that the market reacted negatively to corrective disclosure regarding the falsity of\u2019 the defendant\u2019s misstatements \u201cand no allegation that [the defendant] misstated or omitted risks that did lead to the loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> <em>See also, In re Acterna Corp.

In a case (such as the case at bar) that presupposes an efficient market, as fraud-on-the-market cases must do, <em>see, Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988), the showing of causation which must be made in order to avoid \u201ctransform[ing] a private securities action into a partial downside insurance policy,\u201d <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 347-48, 125 S.Ct. 1627, is a showing that the fraud premium was removed from the price of the stock by way of the efficient market\u2019s reaction to a corrective disclosure that was responsive to the misstatement or omission that created the fraud premium in the first instance. Or, as it was concisely put by Judge Scheindlin (who has probably written at least as much as any other judge on loss causation issues): loss causation requires \u201ca false or misleading statement, which caused an artificial inflation of the stock, followed by a dissipation of that inflation after corrective disclosures were made.\u201d <em>In re GeoPharma Securities Litigation, </em>399 F.Supp.2d 432, 453 (S.D.N.Y.2005). Thus, if \u201cthe logical link between the inflated share purchase price and any later economic loss,\u201d <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627, is to be shown, the showing is ordinarily made by demonstrating \u201cthat the plaintiff suffered an economic loss <em>fairly attributable to the public airing of the alleged fraud, i.e., </em>a significant price decline immediately following the announcement that reveals the fraud to the public.\u201d <em>D.E. &amp; J. Ltd. P\u2019shp. v. Conaway, </em>284 F.Supp.2d 719, 748-49 (E.D.Mich.2003) (emphasis added), <em>affd, </em>133 Fed.Appx. 994 (6th Cir.2005) (unpublished). For that reason, if \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 expert does detailed] event studies supporting a finding that [the stock] reacted to the <em>entire bundle </em>of negative information ... this reaction suggests only market efficiency, not loss causation, for there is no evidence linking the <em>culpable </em>disclosure to the stock-price movement.\u201d <em>Oscar Private Equity Investments v. Allegiance Telecom, Inc., </em>487 F.3d 261, 270 (5th Cir.2007) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\">As has been seen, during the class period, the price of WCG\u2019s common stock fell amidst an \u201centire bundle of negative information\u201d that largely obliterated the value of publicly traded securities throughout the telecommunications sector. \u201cOf course, if the loss was caused by an intervening event, like a general fall in the price of Internet stocks, the chain of causation will not have been established.\u201d <em>Emergent Capital Inv. Mgmt., LLC v. Stonepath Group, Inc., </em>343 F.3d 189, 197 (2nd Cir.2003). So where there is both an industry-wide debacle <em>(e.g., </em>\u201ca marketwide phenomenon causing comparable losses to other investors,\u201d <em>Lentell, </em>396 F.3d at 174) accompanied by an abundant flow of bad news, unrelated to the fraud, about both the industry and the company in question, the non-fraud \u201ccontributing forces must be isolated and removed. This is often done, as it was here, with the help of an expert witness.\u201d <em>Robbins v. Koger Properties, Inc., </em>116 F.3d 1441, 1447, n. 5 (11th Cir.1997) (rendering judgment as a matter of law for defendant accounting firm).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">(ii) <em>Loss causation </em>\u2014 limits <em>of the doctrine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-9\">It has been observed, and this court readily concludes, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number><em>Dura </em>did not set forth any requirements as to who may serve as the source of the [corrective] information, nor is there any requirement that the disclosure take a particular form or be of a particular quality. Thus, it is the inherent veracity of the information that is of paramount concern in <em>Dura. </em>It is the exposure of the falsity of the fraudulent representation that is the critical component of loss causation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\"><em>In re Winstar Communications, </em>2006 WL 473885 at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2006). <em>See also, In re eSpeed, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>2006 WL 880045 at * 18 (S.D.N.Y. April 3, 2006) (There is \u201cno requirement that corrective disclosures emanate from the company itself, so long as the truth is disclosed in some fashion.\u201d). Nor, as a matter of common sense, is there any requirement that \u201can alleged corrective disclosure must be the linguistic mirror image of the alleged fraud.\u201d <em>In re Bristol-Myers Squibb Securities Litigation, </em>2005 WL 2007004 at *20 (D.N.J. Aug. 17, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">Moreover, to establish loss causation (which may, for some analytical purposes, be distinguished from quantifying recoverable damages), \u201cthe plaintiff need not show that the defendant\u2019s act was the sole and exclusive cause of the injury he has suffered; he need only show that it was substantial, <em>i.e., </em>a significant contributing cause.\u201d <em>Robbins, </em>116 F.3d 1441, 1447. Even so, \u201ca plaintiff will be allowed to recover only damages actually caused by the misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1447, n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"AeEy\">(iii) <em>Loss causation </em>\u2014 materialization <em>of the risk.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">The Court in <em>Dura </em>pointedly noted that the complaint in that case did not assert that the \u201cshare price fell significantly after the truth became known,\u201d 544 U.S. at 347, 125 S.Ct. 1627. Although this statement can fairly be read as indicating that a reasonably recognizable corrective disclosure is required in a fraud on the market case, the WCG plaintiffs contend that loss causation is present where the concealed risk simply, \u201cmaterialized\u201d in the form of unfavorable developments that caused the market to drive the share price down \u2014 a proposition aptly articulated by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at argument as \u201ca revelation of the truth via materialization of the risk that was concealed. No one ever announced it, no one ever went on the public air waves and said, you know, here is the truth, but the truth was, nonetheless, made evident by virtue of materialization of exactly the risk that had been concealed by the misrepresentations.\u201d Hrg. transcript, Nov. 1, 2006 at 235. Cases, including <em>Lentell, </em>addressing loss causation in the form of materialization of the risk are collected and analyzed in <em>Glover v. DeLuca, </em>2006 WL 2850448 at *33-37 (W.D.Pa. Sept. 29, 2006), where the court describes the concept as \u201can alternate way of pleading loss causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *38. <em>See also, Lentell, </em>396 F.3d at 172-74; <em>In re AOL Time Warner, Inc.

June 20, 2007) (Loss causation pleaded \u201cby allegations that a defendant\u2019s misstatements or omissions concealed a risk that later materialized to cause the plaintiffs loss.\u201d); <em>In re Teco Energy, Inc., Securities Litigation, </em>2006 WL 2884960 at *6 (M.D.Fla.2006); <em>Leykin v.

To the extent that plaintiffs assert, as may be inferred from the above-quoted statement at argument, that \u201cmaterialization of the risk\u201d is a cognizable approach to loss causation where the \u201crelevant truth\u201d gradually leaks out and the effects of the relevant truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number><em>(e.g., </em>facts which expose the fraud or are at least indicative of the fraud) cannot be differentiated from bad news unrelated to the fraud, the court concludes that plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on materialization of the risk is misplaced. <em>See, Glover, </em>2006 WL 2850448 at *33-34. The suggestion that a fraud premium can be drained off by materialization of the risk (as distinguished from one or more identifiable corrective disclosures) provides no warrant for dispensing with <em>Dura\u2019s </em>requirement that plaintiff prove a \u201ccausal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss.\u201d 544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627. Although <em>Dura </em>did not address the concept of materialization of the risk as a substitute for corrective disclosure (and, it may be noted, did not even use the term \u201ccorrective disclosure\u201d), the Court, in <em>Dura, </em>did recognize the concept that there will be cases in which \u201cthe relevant truth begins to leak out.\u201d <em>Id. Dura\u2019s </em>causation requirement would be entirely undermined if, in the context of an overall implosion of shareholders\u2019 equity in the relevant industry, a plaintiff could exempt himself from the obligation to separate the effects of fraud-related inflation from the effects of non-fraud risks by asserting simply that he is the victim of materialization of a fraudulently-concealed risk. Thus, if plaintiff asserts that the fraud surfaced \u201cthrough disclosure of another event,\u201d he \u201cmust provide proof that the market recognized a relationship between the event disclosed and the fraud.\u201d <em>McKowan Lowe &amp; Co., Ltd. v. Jasmine, Ltd., </em>2005 WL 1541062 at *8 (D.N.J. June 30, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">b. <em>The Daubert challenge as to Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 1 (common stock).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 1 collides directly with loss causation doctrine and is accordingly rejected. Dr. Nye does not even purport, in Scenario 1, to have removed the effects of \u201c[njonfraud company-specific information.\u201d Nye deposition at 210. Nor has he identified any corrective disclosures before January 29, 2002 other than to insist, meaninglessly, that corrective disclosures occurred \u201cevery day.\u201d Nye deposition at 51 (discussed in Part V(E)(l)(a)(ii), above). Thus, remarkably, he has not identified either fraud or non-fraud related news (much less parsed the effects of the two) for the class period through January 28, 2002, <em>id., </em>even though he acknowledges, as he must, that \u201cThe market provides a measure of inflation on dates on which the company\u2019s misrepresentations and omissions are revealed, in the decline in value of the stock related to the company-specific return attributable to those omissions and misrepresentations.\u201d Nye Rpt., \u00b6 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-8\">The court accordingly concludes that Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 1 methodology is deficient in that his conclusions with respect to loss causation and damages are not supported by identification of any corrective disclosures or \u201cmaterialization of the risk\u201d cognizable under <em>Dura </em>and its progeny. He fails to differentiate between losses rooted in causes cognizable under loss causation doctrine, on one hand, and, on the other hand, losses attributable to industry-specific stresses, the meltdown in the telecommunications sector, and other negative developments unrelated to the alleged fraud. The consequence of this failure is that Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 1, viewed as charitably as the record will permit, does not establish loss causation at all, much less enable \u201ca factfinder to ascribe some rough proportion of the whole loss to [the] misstatements.\u201d <em>Lattanzio v. Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, </em>476 F.3d 147, 158 (2nd Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-9\">The Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Dura </em>leaves no room for doubt that even where a securities fraud plaintiff proceeds on a \u201cleakage\u201d theory of corrective disclosure, he must still establish that the lower price reflects the fraud-related inflation and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>\u201cchanged economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new-industry-specific facts, conditions or other events, which taken separately or together account for some or all of that lower price.\u201d <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342-43, 125 S.Ct. 1627. As a practical matter, Dr. Nye <em>assumes </em>leakage of the relevant truth. He identifies no such leakage before January 29. His Scenario 1 methodology is neither \u201crelevant\u201d nor \u201creliable.\u201d <em>See, Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786. In securities litigation, non-fraud causes of a loss in value are \u201cobvious alternative explanations,\u201d Rule 702, Fed.R.Evid., Advisory Committee notes to 2002 amendments. Because Dr. Nye fails to address the obvious alternative explanations as required by the law of loss causation, his Scenario 1 will be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">c. <em>The Daubert challenge as to Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 2 (common stock).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">Scenario 2 is described in detail in Part V(E)(l)(b), above. The Daubert motions will be granted as to Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 2 for two reasons. First, Dr. Nye has not demonstrated an adequate factual basis for his assertion of loss causation on the basis of corrective disclosures which are claimed to have occurred on or after January 29, 2002. Secondly, Scenario 2, premised on a \u201cconstant percentage inflation\u201d approach, Nye Rpt., \u00b6 111, impermis-sibly seeks recovery of losses as to which loss causation has not been, and cannot be, established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">(i) <em>Corrective disclosures on or after January 29, 2002.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-10\">As has been noted, Dr. Nye has testified that Scenario 2 \u201cwas produced to meet some sort of legal definition of damages.\u201d Nye deposition at 124. One of the essential features of Scenario 2 is that it is based on the premise that, as plaintiffs\u2019 counsel put it, \u201cthe first public corrective disclosure\u201d occurred on January 29, 2002. Hrg. transcript, Nov. 1, 2006 at 230. As Dr. Nye puts it, these are \u201ccertain corrective disclosures later in the Class Period and at the end of the Class Period.\u201d Nye Rpt., \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-12\">Under Scenario 2, no recovery is available to an investor who sold his securities before January 29, 2002. Thus, an investor who bought at $28.50 per share on the first day of the class period and sold his shares at the January 28, 2002 closing price of $1.63, would not, under Scenario 2, recover any of the drop from $28.50 to $1.63. If he sold on the next day, his per-share recovery, due to the fraud, would be $24.40. Dr. Nye acknowledged that he could give no \u201ceconomic or logical reason\u201d why a shareholder who sold on January 29 would have a claim and a shareholder who sold on January 28 would not. Nye deposition at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-13\">Plaintiffs and Dr. Nye assert, for purposes of Scenario 2, that the first corrective disclosure, on January 29, 2002, consisted of the revelatory effect of <em>WMB\u2019s </em>announcement \u201cthat it was delaying the reporting of its fourth quarter and 2001 year-end financial statements while it reevaluated the status of certain contingent liabilities it had with respect to WCG.\u201d Nye Rpt. at \u00b6 86. In the relevant passage of his report, Dr. Nye discusses the import of this revelation without mentioning that, on the same day, January 29, the first of the present class actions was filed by the Milberg, Weiss law firm on behalf of these plaintiffs <em>(Cali, et al. v. Williams Companies, Inc, et al </em>No. 02-CV-072, N.D. Okla., Doc. No 1. Herein: Cali Complaint). The Cali Complaint was accompanied by certification from the named plaintiffs, seeking to proceed as representatives of the putative class, dated January 23, 2002. Doc. No. 1, pp. 68-71. The January 23, 2002 certifications declared, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>things, that the named plaintiffs had reviewed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">In terms of negative things that might be said about WCG, its history and its prospects, the Cali Complaint, read together with the Milberg, Weiss press release of the same date, leaves very little to the imagination. The 67-page Cali Complaint can speak for itself, but it provides a detailed compendium of two important categories of matters that were \u201cknowable\u201d before the day the complaint was filed: (i) negative information about WCG that was demonstrably \u201cin the market\u201d during the class period and (ii) misstatements, the falsity of which was known on the basis of publicly available information, before Scenario 2\u2019s first corrective disclosure date\u2014 January 29, 2002. It is, for that reason, worthy of note that the Cali Complaint alleges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-5\">\u2014During the class period, a huge oversupply of fiber-optic capacity was created and that \u201cover the objection of defendants,\u201d market analysts warned of the oversupply. \u00b6 26.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-6\">\u2014Defendants consistently, and falsely, denied that WCG had been adversely affected by \u201cthe glut of over-supply.\u201d \u00b6 28.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-7\">\u2014The defendants \u201cengineered\u201d the spin-off of WCG so that WMB could rid itself of WCG \u201cbefore investors came to realize the true impaired condition of WCG.\u201d \u00b6 29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-8\">\u2014The defendants made false statements about the true reason for the spin-off, which was to \u201cdump WCG\u201d before WMB would have to take a massive charge related to the ownership of WCG. \u00b6 38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-9\">\u2014The spin-off was designed to \u201cavoid a massive write-down as WCG\u2019s stock price was decimated as its impaired condition slowly became known to investors.\u201d \u00b6 30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-10\">\u2014The press releases touting the spinoff were false and misleading because WCG was \u201cexperiencing declining demand for bandwidth such that its revenue projections were lacking in a reasonable basis,\u201d and because they falsely created the impression that WCG would be able to fund its operations with internally-generated cash or by issuing more debt. \u00b6 36(i), (iii).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-11\">\u2014At the time the spin-off was executed, there was no disclosure of \u201cthe true risks which resulted from guaranteeing WCG\u2019s debt as a result of the undisclosed, impaired condition of WCG.\u201d \u00b6 77.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-12\">\u2014In mid-2001, WMB failed to make \u201cadjustments to its balance sheet to account for the WCG loan guarantees, and the fact that now WCG faced a substantial likelihood of a default.\u201d \u00b6 91.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-13\">\u2014A registration statement filed in June, 2001 misleadingly failed to disclose that \u201cas a result of the impaired operational and financial condition of WCG that WMB has a substantial undisclosed risk of loss.\u201d \u00b6 99(ii).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-14\">\u2014In August, 2001, an analyst opined that \u201cthere is a high probability that they [WCG] are going to have difficulty surviving in their present form.\u201d \u00b6 104.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-15\">\u2014On October 1, 2001, WCG misleadingly announced that \u201c[w]e continue to execute on our financing plan.\u201d \u00b6 108.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1308-16\">The Milberg Weiss January 29 press release, Doc. 1297, Ex. 4, concisely summarized the Cali Complaint, including the allegations about impairment of WCG\u2019s assets and the misstatements which concealed the likelihood that WCG would default on its debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-17\">Regardless of what might have been said before January 29, Dr. Nye\u2019s testimony and report make three things clear: First, that by the end of the day on January 29, a reasonable investor could not but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>conclude that there was an overwhelming likelihood that WCG had run out its string: \u201cWCG was not making any money; that it couldn\u2019t fund its business plan; that it couldn\u2019t get any more capital to fund its business plan and, therefore, the projected value of its equity was virtually nil.\u201d Nye deposition at 118 (discussing January 29 press release). Second: that Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 2 is premised on his assertion that \u201cthe \u2018relevant truth\u2019 is that WCG likely would not be able to repay its debt as scheduled and, therefore, its assets likely would not provide a return to its equity investors.\u201d Nye Rpt., \u00b6 109. And third: that the efficient market, in which \u201cthe market price reflects all publicly available information,\u201d Nye deposition at 39, knew what Milberg Weiss knew when it wrote the Cali Complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 38-40.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Moreover, although Dr. Nye\u2019s deposition testimony (pp. 122-23) qualifies this statement, he opined in his report that the movement in WCG\u2019s share price on January 29, 2002 was not significant<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> in light of declines in \u201cthe market\u201d and \u201cthe industry\u201d on that day. Nye Rpt., \u00b6 88.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">The record undermines any assertion\u2014 crucial to Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 2 \u2014 that any material, new, company-specific and fraud-related information became available to the efficient market on January 29, 2002 or on the three subsequent corrective disclosure dates proposed by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">(ii) <em>The constant percentage inflation approach.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">As has been noted, under Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 2, an investor who sold on January 28, 2002 gets no recovery, while an investor who sold on January 29 recovers for all of his loss of per-share value <em>for the entire class period </em>(nearly $25 per share for an investor who bought at the beginning of the class period) even though the price of the stock had already declined 94 percent, to $1.60 before (as postulated in Scenario 2) \u201cthe relevant truth\u201d emerged. <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627. The drop from January 28 to January 29 was 29 cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">A loss in value occurring before the first corrective disclosure \u201ccannot be considered causally related to [defendant\u2019s] fraudulent accounting methods because before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>revelations began in August, 1998, the true nature of [defendant\u2019s] financial condition had not yet been disclosed.\u201d <em>In re Daou Systems, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>411 F.3d 1006, 1027 (9th Cir.2005). <em>See also, In re Redback Networks, Inc., Securities Litigation, </em>2007 WL 963958 at *6 (N.D.Cal. March 30, 2007) (\u201c[T]he stock price began to fall in June 2001 when the \u2018truth\u2019 began coming out. However, at that time the stock <em>already had fallen to less than $12 per share. </em>Based on Plaintiffs\u2019 own allegations, the fall from $150 to $12 cannot be attributed to the alleged fraud.\u201d (emphasis in original)). Where, as in the case at bar, the value of a common share is driven down to the penny stock range by forces unrelated to revelation of the fraud (as must be assumed for purposes of Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 2, Nye Rpt., \u00b6 86), the application of the constant percentage inflation approach would give the equity investor the \u201cpartial downside insurance policy\u201d which <em>Dura </em>counsels that the securities law should not provide. 544 U.S. at 348,125 S.Ct. 1627.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 2 does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 702 and <em>Daubert </em>and its progeny, and will accordingly be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">d. <em>The Daubert challenge as to Dr. Nye\u2019s Alternative Scenario 2 (common stock).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">Anticipating objections to the constant percentage inflation approach which the court has rejected, Dr. Nye developed a \u201cconstant dollar\u201d variation of Scenario 2. As is discussed in more detail in Part V(E)(l)(c), above, this version of Scenario 2 quantifies damages on the basis of the dollar decline (rather than the percentage decline) in per-share prices on the four corrective disclosure dates in early 2002. This modification eliminates the defendants\u2019 objection to use of the constant percentage inflation approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">Pointing out that Dr. Nye himself insists that Alternative Scenario 2 is inappropriate \u201ceconomically and logically,\u201d Nye deposition at 227, defendants argue that Alternative Scenario 2 should be rejected out of hand. The court does not agree. Alternative Scenario 2 represents nothing more than a mathematical variation on Scenario 2, designed to conform plaintiffs\u2019 trial presentation to the law as the court may find it to be. The reason for which Alternative Scenario 2 was developed is clear, and the basis on which plaintiffs and Dr. Nye assert that they ought not to be subjected to the limitations of Alternative Scenario 2 is equally clear. Dr. Nye\u2019s disagreement with Alternative Scenario 2 is no more disqualifying than would be an accountant\u2019s preparation of two alternative lost profit scenarios (and disagreement with one of them) for a plaintiff seeking to recover lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-10\">Although Dr. Nye\u2019s disagreement with Alternative Scenario 2\u2019s constant dollar approach is not fatal to its admissibility, Alternative Scenario 2 is identical to Scenario 2 in that it is not supported by a showing of material, new, company-specific and fraud-related information that became available to the efficient market on January 29, 2002 or on the three subsequent corrective disclosure dates proposed by plaintiffs. Alternative Scenario 2 will, for that reason, be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>e. <em>The Daubert challenge with respect to the notes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">Dr. Nye\u2019s work with respect to the notes is in some ways similar to, and in some ways different from, his work with respect to the common stock. The Dau-bert challenges with respect to Dr. Nye\u2019s proposed expert testimony relating to the notes may be resolved by examining his opinions as to the notes, the bases for those opinions, and the matters that are not disclosed by his analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">Dr. Nye\u2019s report points out that the weighted average price of the WCG notes was 97.8 percent of face value at the beginning of the class period and 16 percent of face value after the bankruptcy filing. Nye Rpt., \u00b6 28. He concludes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-7\">[T]he price of the WCG Notes reacted to news about the Company and to changes in WCG\u2019s perceived financial condition. Thus, the misrepresentations and omissions in defendants\u2019 disclosures to investors regarding its true financial condition could and did have an effect on the WCG Notes\u2019 prices and served to inflate the prices of the WCG Notes during the Class Period. The corrective disclosures later in the Class Period caused the WCG Notes\u2019 prices to decline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">Nye Rpt., \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">Later in his report, Dr. Nye elaborates on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-10\">As with WCG stock, WCG Notes prices responded to information about the declining fortunes at WCG. Thus, the alleged fraud, including the failure to timely write down the value of certain assets, directly caused the inflated prices of the WCG Notes throughout the Class Period. News of WCG\u2019s true financial condition in 2001 and 2002 caused the prices of WCG Notes to decline and, consequently, caused investors who purchased WCG Notes during the Class Period to incur losses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1311-14\"><em>Id., </em>\u00b6 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-15\">Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenarios 1 and 2, analyzed as to the common stock in Part V(E)(3)(b)-(d), above, are turned out in slightly different livery as applied to the notes. Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 1 assigns to the notes, <em>on every day of the class period, </em>\u201ctrue values\u201d equal to the market value of the notes when WCG filed for bankruptcy. <em>Id, </em>\u00b6 138(a). He then posits that \u201c[t]he price inflation is equal to the difference between the actual price and the true value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Lest there be any confusion: Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 1 makes no pretense of differentiating between fraud and non-fraud losses in value, as was made clear at his deposition: \u201cQ: So, if I understand, then, under Scenario 1, no other fact would be significant other than the price of the notes in terms of damages? A: That\u2019s how you calculate it, right.\u201d Nye deposition at 233. By way of example, because Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 1 does not separate fraud from non-fraud losses, defendants are chargeable, under Scenario 1, with the entire drop in the value of the notes that occurred on the first trading day after September 11, 2001. <em>Id. </em>at 234; Doc. No. 1092, Ex. 4(E) (p. 11) to Ex. 2. They are thus impermissibly held to account for \u201cthe entire bundle of negative information,\u201d <em>Oscar Private Equity Investments, </em>487 F.3d 261, 270 (5th Cir.2007), with no identification of any \u201ccausal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss,\u201d <em>Dura, </em>at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-16\">In Scenario 2, as to the notes as with the stock, an investor who sold on January 28 (by which time the notes had fallen to about 40 percent of face value) has no recovery. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 139. Scenario 2 uses the same four corrective disclosure dates (January 29, February 5 and 25, and April 23). Dr. Nye explains the operation of Scenario 2,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> as applied to the notes, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>From the start of the damages period (July 24, 2000, November 16, 2000, February 5, 2001, March 12, 2001, or April 23, 2001) through January 28, 2002, inclusive, the price inflation in the WCG Notes is a constant value and is equal to the sum of the drops in the prices of each of the WCG Notes from the four days used to measure the price inflation. From January 29, 2002 through February 4, 2002, inclusive, the price inflation is equal to the sum of the drops on February 5, February 25, and April 23, 2002. From February 5 through February 24, 2002, inclusive, the price inflation is equal to the sum of the drops on February 25 and April 23, 2002. From February 25 through April 23, 2002, inclusive, the price inflation is equal to the drop on April 23, 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXb\"><em>Id., </em>\u00b6 138(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">Dr. Nye calculates Scenario 2 damages as the sum of the price declines on the four disclosure dates in early 2002<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> (as applicable, depending on the date of sale), and assumes that the sum of all four drops would have been reflected in the prices of the notes on day one of the class period. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10, 138(b), 139. With respect to his Scenario 2 approach as applied to the notes, Dr. Nye performed no regression analysis,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> or even an analysis of statistical significance, to differentiate fraud-related effects from forces unrelated to the fraud, Nye deposition at 147-50, 235, all of which is acknowledged by plaintiffs in their briefs. Doc. No. 1376 at 23; 1378 at 13-14. He does, however, claim to have performed an event study with respect to the notes under Scenario 2. <em>Id. </em>at 231. This deserves some discussion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-10\">An event study is a statistical regression analysis that examines the effect of an event on a dependent variable, such as a corporation\u2019s stock price. This approach assumes that the price and value of the security move together except during days when disclosures of company-specific information influence the price of the stock. The analyst then looks at the days when the stock moves differently than anticipated solely based upon market and industry factors-so-called days of \u201cabnormal returns.\u201d The analyst then determines whether those abnormal returns are due to fraud or non-fraud related factors.... [E]vent study methodology has been used by financial economists as a tool to measure the effect on market prices from all types of new information relevant to a company\u2019s equity valuation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-11\"><em>In re Enron Corp. Securities Litigation, </em>2006 WL 4381143 at *54 (S.D.Tex. June 5, 2006) (quoting from Jay W. Eisenhoffer, Geoffrey C. Jarvis, and James R. Banko, <em>Securities Fraud, Stock Price Valuation, and Loss Causation: Toward A Corporate Finance-Based Theory of Loss Causation, </em>59 Bus. Law. 1419, 1425-26 (August 2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-12\">An event study can play a pivotal role in a securities fraud case: \u201cBecause of the need to distinguish between the fraud-re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>lated and non-fraud related influences of [sic] the stock\u2019s price behavior, a number of courts have rejected or refused to admit into evidence damages reports or testimony by damages experts in securities cases which fail to include event studies or something similar.\u201d <em>In re Imperial Credit Industries, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>252 F.Supp.2d 1005, 1015 (C.D.Cal.2003) (collecting cases; citation and quotation marks omitted). <em>See also, Gordon Partners v.

Aguila, Inc., </em>2005 WL 1138833 at *3-4 (W.D. Mo. March 23, 2005). \u201cEvent study\u201d is thus \u201ca term of art in the relevant economic literature that refers to a regression analysis that examines the effect of an event on some dependent variable, such as a corporation\u2019s stock price.\u201d <em>RMED International, Inc. v. Sloan\u2019s Supermarkets, Inc., </em>2000 WL 310352 at *6 (S.D.N.Y. March 23, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">The obvious purpose of an event study, in the present context, is to isolate fraud-related effects so that the finder of fact may determine \u201cwhat the causal connection might be between [the notes\u2019 loss of value] and the misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Dura, </em>at 347, 125 S.Ct. 1627. \u201cWhen questioned at his deposition about his failure to perform an event study to support his Scenario 2<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> with respect to the notes, Dr. Nye responded that: \u201cUnder Scenario 2, I looked at the change in the price of the bonds on the date information was released. That\u2019s an event study.\u201d Nye deposition at 231. This declaration cannot be reconciled with any accepted definition of an event study, or with the fact that, as E <em>&amp; </em>Y put it, Dr. Nye \u201cdoes not do any independent analysis to determine whether the Notes price movements on these four dates were statistically significant based on the price movements or in any way causally linked to disclosure of the fraud,\u201d Doc. No. 1297 at 14-15. Thus, Dr. Nye\u2019s lame assertion notwithstanding, it is clear that he did not conduct an event study in any sense in which that term is used in his profession. If his version of an event study for Scenario 2 is to be thought of at all as an \u201cevent study\u201d then it is a \u201cstep [which] completely changes a reliable methodology,\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>165 F.3d 778 at 782, (quoting <em>In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litigation, </em>35 F.3d 717, 745 (3d Cir.1994)), because what he calls an event study does not even purport to differentiate between forces related to the fraud and those not related to the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">In response to defendants\u2019 assertions as to the deficiencies in Dr. Nye\u2019s work as to the notes, plaintiffs argue, somewhat contradictorily, that (i) \u201cDr. Nye\u2019s event study for the Notes reasonably parallels his event study for WCG common stock,\u201d Doc. No. 1378 at 13, (ii) he did not \u201cperform a separate, independent regression analysis for the Notes\u201d because to have done so would only have increased damages, <em>id., </em>and (iii) defendants fail to point out how an event study could have been performed as to the notes. Doc. No. 1376 at 23. The court will address these responses in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-9\">Plaintiffs support their argument that Dr. Nye\u2019s event study for the notes paralleled his event study for the common stock by pointing out that, just as was the case with the stock, there were, indeed, negative price movements for the notes on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>four disclosure dates posited by Scenario 2, and that these movements were among the largest movements in the entire class period. Doc. No. 1378 at 14. This echoes Dr. Nye\u2019s testimony that he looked at the prices and found that the prices went down, Nye deposition at 231, which is essentially the same as an accountant, in a lost profits case, excusing his failure to measure lost net profits by arguing that, after all, he did calculate lost gross receipts. Dr. Nye simply did not perform an event study with respect to the notes, and no assertion that \u201cyes, he found that note prices dropped on the disclosure dates\u201d can change that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">The second argument, that performing a regression analysis <em>(e.g., </em>at a component of an event study) would have been unnecessary because a regression analysis would only have increased damages, has two premises. Plaintiffs and Dr. Nye argue, first, that the only non-company specific information that would have been factored out by an event study as to the notes would have been the steady decline in interest rates during the relevant period, and, secondly, that adjusting for the decline in interest rates would only have increased damages. As to the contention that prevailing interest rates would have been the only exogenous influence on the price of the notes, Dr. Nye\u2019s testimony is contradictory. At one point, Dr. Nye suggested that bond (note) prices are influenced only by interest rates and default risk, which is company-specific. <em>Id. </em>at 147-48. Later, he testified that \u201cthe market\u201d can affect default risk, <em>id. </em>at 231, which would lead inexorably to the conclusion that those influences must be factored out. However, there is no need to consider whether Dr. Nye\u2019s explanation is undermined by the seemingly common-sense proposition that the default risk component of note values certainly could be affected by a perception that an industry-wide meltdown is in progress. The reason is that, even as to news affecting perceptions of <em>company-specific </em>default risk <em>(i.e., </em>assuming that there <em>were </em>no exogenous factors other than the trend in interest rates), Dr. Nye did nothing to differentiate between fraud-related bad news and bad news unrelated to the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">As to plaintiffs\u2019 third argument, questioning whether an event study <em>could </em>have been performed as to the notes, the court notes that this contention is apparently bottomed on the problematic proposition that note prices would not have been found to have been affected by non-company specific influences other than interest rates. Doc. No. 1376 at 23-24. There is no need, however, to resolve that issue, nor is there any need to determine whether plaintiffs\u2019 view of the matter is undercut by a very cogent showing that an event study could have been performed as to the notes. Doc. No. 1297, Ex. 7 (Affidavit of David Tabak, Ph.D.). The reason is that it does not fall to the defendants, in support of their Daubert challenge, to prescribe a method by which plaintiffs and Dr. Nye either might or must carry their burden of establishing the admissibility of Dr. Nye\u2019s proposed expert testimony as to loss causation. What is required is an event study \u201cor something similar.\u201d <em>Imperial Credit, </em>252 F.Supp.2d at 1015.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> This court assays, within the confines of <em>Dau-bert </em>and Rule 702, the methodology the expert chose to use, <em>Bitler, </em>400 F.3d at 1233; it need not select the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>methodology. \u201cThus, Judge Peck did not say that summary judgment was appropriate because plaintiffs had not submitted an event study. He said that it was appropriate because plaintiffs had submitted <em>no evidence </em>on the issue of loss causation.\u201d <em>Gordon Partners, </em>2007 WL 1438753 at *2 (emphasis in original). Because he did <em>nothing </em>to differentiate between fraud and non-fraud effects on note prices, it is not necessary to determine what methodology would have sufficed if Dr. Nye had done <em>something.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">Viewing Dr. Nye\u2019s proposed expert testimony as to the notes in light of the combined demands of <em>Daubert </em>and <em>Dura, </em>it is plain that he expounds conclusions that are greater than the sum of their factual and analytical parts. \u201c[Tjhere is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered,\u201d <em>Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136 at 146, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508. His work with respect to the notes does not address, in any manner that lends itself to reasoned analysis, the question of \u201cwhat the causal connection might be between [the notes\u2019 loss of value] and the misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Dura, </em>at 347, 125 S.Ct. 1627. Having offered no analysis that differentiates between the effects of fraud-related and non-fraud news and events, Dr. Nye\u2019s declaration that corrective disclosures caused the notes\u2019 prices to decline represents, at best, an opinion \u201cconnected to existing data only by the <em>ipse dixit </em>of the expert.\u201d <em>Joiner, </em>522 U.S. at 146,118 S.Ct. 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">All of Dr. Nye\u2019s causation-related opinions, including his damage scenarios, have been analyzed to determine whether they square with the law of loss causation, applied through the prism of <em>Daubert </em>and Rule 702. Dr. Nye\u2019s proposed opinion testimony does not square with the law of loss causation, principally because his approaches to causation fail to differentiate, by means sufficient to pass muster under <em>Daubert, </em>between losses attributable to fraud and losses attributable to other forces that caused the historic debacle in the telecommunications industry. Implicit in Dr. Nye\u2019s work is the supposition that virtually none of the market value of WCG\u2019s stock at the beginning of the class period (or at any time until the telecom chickens had all come home to roost) was attributable to inflated investor expectations for the telecom industry as a whole\u2014 and the concomitant proposition that virtually none of the decline in the value of the stock is attributable to the industry-wide debacle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">The defendants\u2019 Daubert motions with respect to the proposed opinion testimony of Dr. Blaine F. Nye are GRANTED with respect to his opinions as to loss causation and his damage scenarios, both as to the common stock and as to the notes. This partial granting of the Daubert motions with respect to Dr. Nye, in combination with the granting of the Daubert motions as to Messrs. Mathis and Mintzer, is, as set forth in part VI, below, dispositive of all of the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the WCG class action. Accordingly, the court does not reach, and denies as moot,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> the defendants\u2019 Daubert motions as to Dr. Nye, to the extent that they challenge his proposed expert testimony as to matters other than loss causation and his damage scenarios.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">VI. <em>The Motions for Summary Judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">The court\u2019s rulings on the Dau-bert motions will, as discussed below, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>suit in summary judgment in favor of <em>all </em>defendants on the WCG Subclass plaintiffs\u2019 claims because plaintiffs cannot establish the elements of loss causation and damages. The defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment raise other issues. They have been fully briefed and argued. As has been noted, the briefs and exhibits supporting and opposing the motions run to nearly 23,000 pages. The motions thus present live issues that are ripe for determination by the court even though the court could, in its discretion, proceed no further than to render summary judgment on the basis of its resolution of the Daubert motions. Accordingly, having thoroughly reviewed the briefs and the voluminous record, and for substantially the same reasons as have been discussed in note 36, above (as to the court\u2019s consideration of the Daubert motions with respect to Dr. Nye), the court will proceed to address the other issues raised by the WMB defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, E &amp; Y\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the WCG Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">A. <em>The Williams Companies, Inc. and Keith E. Bailey\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Alleged Misstatements and Omissions Made Before WCG\u2019s Spin-Off from Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">The WMB defendants move for partial summary judgment as to the WCG Subclass plaintiffs\u2019 claims relating to alleged misstatements or omissions made before the spin-off of WCG from WMB on April 23, 2001. The WMB defendants assert that plaintiffs cannot establish the requisite elements of materiality or scienter in support of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">Initially, the WMB defendants challenge plaintiffs\u2019 claims which focus on WCG\u2019s purported failure to disclose that certain of its employees, including defendant Matthew Bross, had received \u201cdirected\u201d or \u201cfriends and family\u201d shares and options to purchase shares in the initial public offerings of certain companies that were WCG\u2019s strategic partners. WMB defendants assert that the alleged omissions occurred before the class period began. Because liability can be imposed only for statements or omissions made during the class period, the WMB defendants contend the alleged pre-class period omissions are not actionable as a matter of law. In addition, they contend that the alleged omissions are immaterial as a matter of law because they related to matters that were publicly known. The WMB defendants contend that the details of the \u201cdirected\u201d or \u201cfriends and family\u201d shares programs were publicly disclosed and thoroughly discussed in the national press, such as <em>Fortune </em>magazine, before the beginning of the class period. Moreover, WCG, in response to that publicity, adopted a policy in April of 2000 specifically prohibiting the WCG employees from engaging in such transactions. In light of these facts, the WMB defendants argue that plaintiffs cannot establish the materiality element of their claims based upon alleged omissions relating to the \u201cdirected\u201d or \u201cfriends and family\u201d shares and options to purchase shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">The WMB defendants challenge the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that pre-class period events resulted in the purchase of inferior equipment by WCG from companies (such as Sycamore Networks) which had to be written off during the class period. The WMB defendants contend that the equipment was of superior quality and is still functioning on the network, arguing that the only identified problem with the equipment was WCG\u2019s inability to get the equipment delivered when it was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>In response, plaintiffs do not dispute that certain of the \u201cfriends and family\u201d transactions were adversely reported in the press, and that, consequently, WCG sought to restrict the ability of its employees to engage in such transactions prior to the class period. Doc. No. 1225 (plaintiffs) at 54. Rather, plaintiffs argue that the evidence relating to the transactions is relevant to their claim that defendants, in violation of GAAP, failed to take any inventory write-downs for excess or impaired equipment that was acquired in transactions associated with employee \u201cfriends and family\u201d benefits until late in the class period, significantly after WCG had placed restrictions on employee participation in the \u201cfriends and family\u201d programs. Plaintiffs contend that what the WMB defendants seek, in effect, is an order <em>in limine </em>precluding plaintiffs from offering any evidence regarding these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">Plaintiffs have conceded in their briefing that information relating to the \u201cdirected\u201d or \u201cfriends and family\u201d programs was publicly disclosed prior to the start of the class period. Accordingly, the court concludes that plaintiffs cannot establish<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> the element of materiality as to their claims based upon alleged omissions involving the \u201cdirected\u201d or \u201cfriends and family\u201d programs. <em>See, e.g., Baron v. Smith, </em>380 F.3d 49, 57 (1st Cir.2004) (\u201cIt is not a material omission to fail to point out information of which the market is already aware.\u201d); <em>Smith v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>286 F.Supp.2d 707, 721-22 (E.D.Va.2003) (an omitted fact is immaterial as a matter of law where \u201cthe relevant information was already publicly available\u201d at the time of the purported omission). Therefore, the court concludes that the WMB defendants are entitled to summary judgment on those claims.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-8\">At this stage of the proceedings, the court need not determine the admissibility of any evidence relating to the \u201cdirected\u201d or \u201cfriends and family\u201d share transactions. The court, however, would note that during oral argument on the motion, defendants\u2019 counsel stated that based upon representations of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, plaintiffs would not have an expert to address the issue of impairment of network equipment or inventory (not to be confused with impairment of dark fiber) and that they did not plan to pursue a claim related to impairment of network equipment or inventory. Moreover, as previously discussed, the court has specifically determined that Mr. Mintzer\u2019s testimony as to the equipment impairment is inadmissible under <em>Daubert. </em>Plaintiffs cannot, without expert testimony, establish their claims relating to any alleged misstatement in the financial statements of WCG at year-end 2000 dealing with impairment of network equipment or inventory. This issue will receive more attention in the court\u2019s ruling on E &amp; Y\u2019s summary judgment motion. The evidence as to the \u201cfriends and family\u201d transactions would likely be highly potent at a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>trial \u2014 and quite properly so. Those transactions strongly suggest, at a minimum, flaccid ethical standards among members of WCG\u2019s senior management. However, at this juncture, the admissibility of that decidedly unflattering evidence need not be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">The WMB defendants next challenge plaintiffs\u2019 claims as to alleged misstatements about the reasons for the spinoff which were made in the press releases of July 24, 2000,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> November 16, 2000<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> and March 30, 2001.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The WMB defendants assert that the alleged misstatements are not actionable as a matter of law because they can only be classified as statements of \u201ccorporate optimism\u201d or \u201cmere puffing.\u201d Such statements, the WMB defendants maintain, are typically forward-looking statements or are generalized statements of optimism that are not capable of objective verification. The WMB defendants argue that vague, optimistic statements are not actionable because they are not statements relied upon by reasonable investors when making investment decisions. Mustering just a bit of chutzpah, or admirable modesty, or both, they argue in essence that public pronouncements about WMB\u2019s subjective motives for the spin-off would not be relied upon by reasonable investors in making their decisions to buy or sell stock. Asserting that the alleged misstatements are immaterial as a matter of law, the WMB defendants contend that partial summary judgment should be entered as to plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-11\">In response, plaintiffs contend that the court should not dismiss the claims based on the asserted misstatements because the court, per the Honorable Sven Erik Holmes, has ruled (in the order addressing defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the Complaint) that \u201cstatements concerning the reasons for WCG\u2019s spin-off, WCG\u2019s business condition and prospects, and WCG\u2019s capitalization\u201d should not be dismissed as immaterial. <em>In re Williams Securities Litigation, </em>339 F.Supp.2d at 1224-1233. Plaintiffs argue that Judge Holmes\u2019 ruling is the law of this case and that, in any event, the challenged statements concern facts that defendants, themselves, recognized as critical. Plaintiffs contend that defendants\u2019 own act of repeatedly making the statements about the reasons for WCG\u2019s spin-off, about WCG\u2019s condition and prospects, and about WCG\u2019s capitalization, increased the likelihood that investors would have found those matters to be important, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>natural result that they would have relied upon the statements in making their investment decisions. Plaintiffs also assert that the alleged misstatements should not be dismissed because there are issues of fact as to the materiality of the misstatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-4\">Only \u201cmaterial\u201d false or misleading statements or omissions are actionable under \u00a7 10(b). 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5(b). \u201c \u2018[A] statement or omission is only material if a reasonable investor would consider it important in determining whether to buy or sell stock,\u2019 and if it would have \u2018significantly altered the total mix of information available\u2019 to current and potential investors.\u201d <em>Fleming Companies, Inc., </em>264 F.3d at 1267-68 (quoting <em>Grossman v. Novell, Inc., </em>120 F.3d 1112, 1119 (10th Cir.1997)). Materiality is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 450, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976). The question of materiality can be resolved as a matter of law only when the information is so obviously unimportant to an investor that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality. <em>Connett v. Justus Enterprises of Kansas, Inc., </em>68 F.3d 382, 384 (10th Cir.1995); <em>Manavazian v. Atec Group, Inc., </em>160 F.Supp.2d 468, 478 (E.D.N.Y.2001) (\u201cDismissal due to immateriality is not warranted unless the misstatement or omission is so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the question of their importance.\u201d) (quotations omitted). Forward-looking statements can be material. <em>Grossman, </em>120 F.3d at 1120, n. 6. A statement as to beliefs or opinions may be actionable if the statement is known by the speaker at the time it is expressed to be untrue or to have no reasonable basis in fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1319-10\">The court finds it unnecessary to address the issue of whether the previous ruling on the issue of materiality must be left untouched as the law of the case. Reviewing the summary judgment record in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, the court is convinced that summary judgment is not appropriate on the issue of the materiality of the challenged statements. The plaintiffs have proffered sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact as to the falsity of the statements. They have also presented evidence sufficient, by a significant margin, to raise an issue of fact as to whether the alleged statements, at the time they were made, were known to Bailey or Janzen to be untrue or without reasonable basis in fact and thus the product of sheer duplicity on the part of those executives. <em>Grossman, </em>120 F.3d at 1120, n. 6. The court accordingly concludes that reasonable minds could differ on the materiality question. Therefore, the court concludes that partial summary judgment is not appropriate as to the issue of materiality on the challenged misstatements relating to the reasons for the spin-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-11\">The WMB defendants next challenge alleged misstatements as to the quality of WCG\u2019s network and technology, as made in the October 25, 2000 press release.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> To the extent that plaintiffs rely upon the \u201cfriends and family\u201d transactions to support their claim, the WMB defendants\u2019 arguments in response are those that have been previously discussed in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>memorandum. As to plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments as to the falsity of the statements,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> the WMB defendants contend that plaintiffs\u2019 contentions have not been borne out in discovery and that the facts relied upon by plaintiffs do not contradict the statements. The WMB defendants also contend that the statements in the press release are classic examples of \u201cvague corporate optimism\u201d routinely held to be immaterial and that the statements, by their nature, would not be relied upon by investors in making investment decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">The court concludes that partial summary judgment is not appropriate as to the alleged false and misleading statements relating to the October 25, 2000 press release. The summary judgment record, viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, is sufficient to raise triable issues as to whether these statements are actionable under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">The WMB defendants further challenge plaintiffs\u2019 claims predicated on the alleged misstatements about WCG\u2019s financial results and expectations, as made in the July 27, 2000 press release,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> the November 16, 2000 press release,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> the February 5, 2001 press release,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> the February 15, 2001 <em>The Street.com </em>Report<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> and the March 15, 2001 press release.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The WMB defendants contend that the statements constitute mere corporate puffing incapable of objective verification. In addition, the WMB defendants contend that the forward-looking, optimistic statements were accompanied by cautionary statements regarding the risks of WCG\u2019s business and are inactionable as a matter of law under the \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-11\">The court disagrees. The record is clearly adequate to raise triable issues as to the materiality of the challenged statements; most prominently the issue of whether the speakers, at the time the statements were made, knew or had very good reason to know that the statements were untrue or had no reasonable basis in fact. <em>Grossman, </em>120 F.3d at 1120 n. 6. In light of the evidence in the record, the court also concludes that partial summary judgment is not appropriate based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>\u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine. <em>Gabriel Capital, L.P. v. NatWest Finance, Inc., </em>122 F.Supp.2d 407, 419 (S.D.N.Y.2000) (\u201cThe \u2018bespeaks doctrine,\u2019 [ ] does not apply where a defendant knew that its statement was false when made.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-4\">The WMB defendants also contend, in their reply brief, that the plaintiffs, in responding to the WMB defendants\u2019 motion, have referred to statements not previously pled in the Complaint. The WMB defendants assert that plaintiffs seek, belatedly, to rely on the statements made by Bailey as to the reasons for the spin-off in the July 28, 2000 conference call,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> the statements made by Bailey about WCG\u2019s funding situation during the October 25, 2000 conference call,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> the statements made by Bailey and other officers on the reasons for the spin-off during the January 2001 road show,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> the statements by Bailey about the reasons of the spin-off in the March 30, 2001 press release<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> and the statements made by certain WMB executives as to the reasons for the spin-off during the April 2001 road show.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> The WMB defendants contend that plaintiffs should not be permitted to amend their complaint at the summary judgment stage, after discovery has closed, and that plaintiffs have offered no justification for their delay. Defendants maintain that most of the new allegations are based on public statements that have always been accessible. Defendants contend that they will be seriously prejudiced if plaintiffs are permitted to amend, arguing, among other things, that they have been denied their opportunity to challenge the sufficiency of the allegations by way of a motion to dismiss. The WMB defendants also assert that even if the plaintiffs are granted leave to amend, the new allegations nevertheless fail as a matter of law because plaintiffs cannot show falsity, materiality and scien-ter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-10\">Although the WMB defendants are correct that the cited statements are not specifically pleaded in the Complaint, the court concludes that plaintiffs should be permitted to rely upon them.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> <em>See, </em>Rule 15(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. (leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d). The alleged misstatements are similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>those previously pled, which survived dismissal. No new discovery is required to address these additional matters. The defenses to these allegations, at least in the present procedural context, are the same as- those raised as to other matters which have been pleaded. The court specifically rejects defendants\u2019 bare, conclusory statement that they will suffer substantial prejudice if plaintiffs are allowed to rely upon these alleged misstatements.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> As to the merits of the new allegations, the court concludes that there is sufficient evidence in the record to survive a challenge under Rule 56 on the issues of falsity, materiality and scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">The WMB defendants also contend that they are entitled to partial summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims relating to the alleged misstatements as to the reasons for WCG\u2019s spin-off, WCG\u2019s network quality and WCG\u2019s financial results and expectations because plaintiffs do not have sufficient evidence that the WMB defendants acted with the requisite scienter. The WMB defendants argue that plaintiffs have produced no competent evidence that defendants knew that the purported misstatements were false or misleading when made or that they made the statements recklessly. They further argue that plaintiffs have no significant \u201cmotive and opportunity\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">The scienter element in a securities fraud case requires \u201ca mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\u201d <em>Fleming Cos., </em>264 F.3d at 1258 (quotations omitted). It includes \u201cknowing or intentional conduct\u201d and \u201crecklessness,\u201d which is \u201cconduct that it is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOne of the classic fact patterns giving rise to a strong inference of scienter is that defendants published statements when they knew facts or had access to information suggesting that their public statements were materially inaccurate.\u201d <em>Florida State Bd. of Admin. v. Green Tree Financial Corp., </em>270 F.3d 645, 665 (8th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Novak v. Kasaks, </em>216 F.3d 300, 311 (2nd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1012, 121 S.Ct. 567, 148 L.Ed.2d 486 (2000)); <em>see also, Fleming Cos., </em>264 F.3d at 1260-61(in case of omissions, scienter proved by knowledge of the omitted fact plus knowledge that the omission is likely to mislead investors). Evidence of motive and opportunity may also be relevant to the issue of scienter. <em>Fleming Cos., </em>264 F.3d at 1263. Furthermore, the scienter of senior controlling officers of a corporation may be attributed to the corporation itself to establish liability under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 when those senior officials act within the scope of their apparent authority. <em>Adams v. Kinder-Morgan, Inc., </em>340 F.3d 1083, 1106 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-8\">Reviewing the summary judgment record and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the court concludes that genuine issues of fact exist as to the scienter element as challenged by the WMB defendants. The evidence before the court shows that defendants knew facts or had access to non-public information contradicting the challenged public statements. Moreover, there is evidence in the record, easily sufficient to raise an issue of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>that defendants knew of undisclosed material facts and that failure to reveal such facts would likely mislead investors. The court is persuaded that this evidence, if credited by the trier of fact, would establish recklessness as defined by relevant case law. The court also concludes that evidence in the record, viewed favorably to plaintiffs, raises an issue of fact as to defendants\u2019 motive and opportunity to commit the alleged fraud. The court therefore concludes that, for summary judgment purposes, a sufficient showing of scienter has been made as to the claims relating to the 'WMB defendants\u2019 statements about the reasons for the spin-off, WCG\u2019s network quality and WCG\u2019s financial results and expectations.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">The WMB defendants further contend that the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of scienter, as to the claimed GAAP violations, fail as a matter of law. Specifically, the WMB defendants attack plaintiffs\u2019 contentions (i) that WCG violated GAAP in that impairment charges should have been taken earlier as to WCG\u2019s inventory, international assets and Winstar assets, as well as the dark fiber and conduit assets, and (ii) that WCG improperly booked revenues in connection with purported dark fiber \u201cswaps\u201d which in reality had no business purpose. At oral argument on the motion, the WMB defendants\u2019 counsel represented to the court, without contradiction from plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, that plaintiffs were not pursuing the issues relating to Winstar assets and the fiber swaps. On the basis of this representation (among others made at oral argument), taken together with the court\u2019s exclusion of the proposed expert testimony of Mr. Mintzer, there are several aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 GAAP-related claims that would not ultimately be submitted to a jury as this matter now stands. But, as to the scienter element<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> of the GAAP claims against the WMB defendants, there are genuine issues of fact which preclude summary judgment.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">B. <em>Motion of the Williams Companies, Inc. and Keith E. Bailey for Partial Summary Judgment on Alleged Misstatements or Omissions Made After WCG\u2019s Spin-Off from Williams</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-9\">The WMB defendants move for partial summary judgment as to the WCG Subclass plaintiffs\u2019 claims relating to alleged misstatements or omissions made by WCG or its officers and directors after the spinoff of WCG from WMB on April 23, 2001.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The WMB defendants argue that they can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>not be held liable under \u00a7 20(a) for these alleged post-spin-off misrepresentations and omissions and that, in any event, plaintiffs have no evidence to show that the WMB defendants conspired with unspecified persons at WCG, or that they were \u201ccontrol persons\u201d of WCG after the spinoff. Arguing that Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit law plainly establish that third parties such as the WMB defendants cannot be held liable for alleged misrepresentations and omissions made by WCG after the spin-off, the WMB defendants contend that partial summary judgment is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">In response, plaintiffs concede that the WMB defendants did not control WCG after the spin-off and agree that those defendants cannot have any \u00a7 20(a) control person liability for WCG\u2019s primary violations after the spin-off. They also do not challenge any of the WMB defendants\u2019 arguments relating to the alleged conspiracy. The court therefore concludes that partial summary judgment is appropriate on plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 20(a) claims as to alleged misrepresentations and omissions made by WCG or its officers and directors after the spin-off of WCG from WMB on April 23, 2001 and as to any claims relating to the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">However, plaintiffs do argue that Bailey (as distinguished from WCG) made three additional false and misleading statements after the spin-off.

The WMB defendants protest that none of these alleged false and misleading statements were pleaded in the Complaint and that plaintiffs should not be allowed, at this stage, to proceed on the basis of these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-11\">As to the allegations relating to the April 26, 2001 conference call and the May 17, 2001 WMB shareholder meeting, the court disagrees with the defendants. The alleged false and misleading statements relating to WCG\u2019s financing and reasons for the spin-off are similar to those previously pled, which survived a motion to dismiss. The court again rejects the WMB defendants\u2019 bare, conclusory statements of prejudice. The court also concludes that plaintiffs have demonstrated triable issues of fact as to materiality and scienter with respect to these allegations. However, plaintiffs will not be permitted to proceed on the basis of the October 31, 2001 e-mail. In that e-mail to Janzen, Bailey stated: \u201cI gave a fire breathing endorsement of WCG and the strategy that underpinned it (a bandwidth machine-low cost/high quality) during our analysts meetings yesterday.\u201d Ex. 117, KB Deck There is no evidence in the record as to the actual statement made by Bailey to the analysts. The actionability of the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>ment to the analysts, for that reason, defies analysis. Consequently, it would be futile to allow plaintiffs to rely on this allegation and to include it in any pretrial order because it would not survive a test of its legal sufficiency. <em>See, Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962) (court need not grant leave to amend if amendment would be futile).<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">Plaintiffs also contend that the WMB defendants made false and misleading statements post-spin-off as a result of their failure to take any WCG-related charges on WMB\u2019s own books until January 29, 2002.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> In response, defendants argue that plaintiffs lack standing to complain about WMB\u2019s accounting and that WMB did disclose its contingent liabilities relating to WCG in November of 2001 \u2014 as plaintiffs\u2019 accounting expert, Mr. Mintzer, suggested should have been done. The WMB defendants also point out that the disclosure, when made, had no negative effect on WCG\u2019s stock price, indicating that the disclosure was immaterial. Summary judgment is not specifically sought as to this claim and will not be granted, because there are triable issues of materiality and scienter.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The standing issue is more complex and has not been adequately briefed. It will receive no further attention at this stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-8\">C. <em>Defendant Ernst &amp; Young LLP\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-9\">E &amp; Y moves for summary judgment on the WCG Subclass plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim, relating to E &amp; Y\u2019s March 12, 2001 audit opinion on WCG\u2019s year-end 2000 financial statements. In the challenged audit opinion, E <em>&amp; </em>Y stated that the audit was \u201cconducted in accordance with [GAAS],\u201d and that \u201cthe financial statements ... present fairly, in all material respects\u201d WCG\u2019s financial position. E &amp; Y asserts that plaintiffs cannot establish that there was a materially false statement because the evidence does not establish that the audit was not conducted an accordance with GAAS and that WCG\u2019s financial statements violated GAAP. In addition, E <em>&amp; </em>Y contends that plaintiffs cannot prevail because the evidence fails to show that E <em>&amp; </em>Y acted with the requisite scienter. Specifically, E <em>&amp; </em>Y argues that the evidence fails to show that its auditing practices were so deficient that the audit amounted to \u201cno audit at all\u201d or that \u201cno reasonable accountant would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>1. <em>Material misstatements or omissions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-3\">Plaintiffs allege that WCG violated GAAP in its financial statements by: (i) \u201cimproperly failing to record required write-downs for impairment on the value of WCG\u2019s excess fiber and conduit of approximately $1.9 billion;\u201d and (ii) \u201cimproperly failing to record required write-downs for impairment in the value of WCG\u2019s excessive inventory on a timely basis of approximately $336 million.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Complaint \u00b6 157. As previously discussed, FAS 121, which, during the periods relevant in the case at bar, governed accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets, requires a three-step analysis before a company takes an impairment charge. E <em>&amp; </em>Y argues that plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that any of the three sequential steps in the FAS 121 analysis at year-end 2000 indicated that an impairment charge was required, contending that plaintiffs cannot prove that (i) there were impairment indicators or triggering events as of December 31, 2000; (ii) a cash flow analysis conducted on WCG\u2019s network would have shown an impairment; or (iii) a material charge would have resulted. On this basis, E &amp; Y maintains that plaintiffs cannot establish that either the network or the network equipment were materially impaired at year-end 2000 \u2014 hence no GAAP violation occurred and there was not a material misstatement. The court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">The court has excluded the report and testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 expert, H. Sean Mathis, and has excluded the report and testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 expert Andrew M. Mintzer as to the impairment issues. Without this testimony, plaintiffs cannot establish a genuine issue of fact as to whether WCG failed all three steps of the impairment analysis and that, consequently, a material impairment existed as to WCG\u2019s network and network equipment at year-end 2000. For that reason, plaintiffs cannot establish that WCG violated GAAP by failing to record impairments in the year-end 2000 financial statements. Plaintiffs are accordingly unable to establish the essential element of material misrepresentation or omission in support of their claim of impairment under FAS 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\">Because plaintiffs cannot show that WCG\u2019s year-end 2000 financial statements were inaccurate with respect to application of FAS 121, the court concludes, with respect to impairment, that plaintiffs also cannot succeed on their claim that E <em>&amp; </em>Y made a material misstatement in reporting that it had performed its audit in accordance with GAAS. To succeed on this issue, plaintiffs must show a \u201cmaterial\u201d misrepresentation or omission. <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 341, 125 S.Ct. 1627. However, an auditor\u2019s statement that it conducted an audit in compliance with GAAS, even if untrue, is not \u201cmaterial\u201d if the company\u2019s financial statements do not materially violate GAAP because \u201cit is difficult to imagine how a reasonable investor could conclude,\u201d under those circumstances, that the purported misstatement of the auditor \u201csignificantly altered the total mix of information available.\u201d <em>See, New Jersey and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number><em>its Div. of Investment v. Sprint Corp., </em>314 F.Supp.2d 1119, 1147 (D.Kan.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">Plaintiffs also allege that at year-end 2000 WCG was in violation of its debt covenants and failed \u2014 thus violating GAAP \u2014 to disclose the violations in its financial statements. They also allege that E &amp; Y failed to modify its report as to the debt covenant violations, in violation of GAAS. The debt covenants required WCG to satisfy several financial measurements, including the Total Leverage Ratio (of no more than 18) and the Minimum EBITDA (of $120 million). Plaintiffs contend that WCG met its Total Leverage Ratio (calculated to be 17.07) by resorting to four improper items, which if properly accounted for, would have caused the ratio to exceed 18.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> They also argue that WCG satisfied its EBITDA requirement by using two improper items, which, if excluded, would have caused WCG to miss the EBITDA mark by about $60 million.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">The court has not excluded Mr. Mint-zer\u2019s proposed expert testimony with respect to WCG\u2019s violations of the debt covenants. Paragraphs 172 through 223 of Mr. Mintzer\u2019s expert report specifically discuss the debt covenant violation asserted by plaintiffs. Ex. 8, CM Decl. Based upon the report and the other evidence in the summary judgment record, viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, the court concludes that genuine issues of fact do exist as to whether WCG failed to disclose that it was in violation of its debt covenants and as to whether E &amp; Y failed to ascertain and report the asserted violation. Summary judgment must therefore be denied as to the element of material misrepresentation with respect to the alleged debt covenant violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-13\">Plaintiffs also contend that E &amp; Y failed to modify its audit opinion language, thus departing from GAAS, to indicate that there was substantial doubt that WCG could continue as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d for twelve months beyond December 31, 2000. According to AU \u00a7 341, one of AICPA\u2019s professional standards, E <em>&amp; </em>Y, in conducting an audit of WCG\u2019s financial statements in accordance with GAAS, was required to evaluate whether there was substantial doubt as to WCG\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year from the date of the financial statements. Ex. 61 at AU \u00a7 341.01 and AU \u00a7 341.02, CM Decl. Continuation of an entity as a going concern is assumed in the absence of significant information to the contrary. Information that significantly contradicts that assumption relates to the entity\u2019s inability to continue to meet its obligations as they become due without substantial disposition of assets outside of the ordinary course of business, restructuring of debt, externally forced revisions of its operations, or similar actions. <em>Id. </em>at AU \u00a7 341.01. Plaintiffs contend that the evidence establishes the existence of factors clearly indicating that substantial doubt existed about WCG\u2019s ability to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>tinue as a going concern as of December 31, 2000. - These factors, plaintiffs argue, portended that WCG would have needed to restructure its debt, dispose of assets and restructure its.operations in order to meet its obligations in 2001. In support of this claim, plaintiffs point out that less than seven days after the April, 2001 spin-off, WCG began working with The Blackstone Group to look at strategies to restructure its balance sheet. Less than two months later, in June of 2001, WCG attempted a capital spending freeze to control expenditures and announced a 10 percent lay off of its work force. Subsequently, in August of 2001, WCG bought back some of its long term debt in an attempt to restructure its balance sheet. Plaintiffs contend that these attempts at restructuring, shortly after the spin-off, show that WCG was not a going concern as defined by GAAS as of year-end 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">E &amp; Y contends that during the audit, it reviewed WCG\u2019s liquidity position, considered WCG\u2019s specific characteristics within the telecom industry and obtained a management representation letter from WMB confirming its financial support of WCG. As a result of this review and based upon its professional judgment, it concluded that there was no substantial doubt about WCG\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond December 31, 2000. Based upon the evidence in the record, including WMB\u2019s assurance of funding for WCG in 2001 as long as the spin-off did not occur, and Lehman Brothers\u2019 opinion that if the spin-off occurred it would not materially impair WCG\u2019s ability to fund its future capital needs, E <em>&amp; </em>Y contends that plaintiffs\u2019 claim that there was substantial doubt about WCG\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern as of year-end 2000 is untenable. In addition, E <em>&amp; </em>Y argues that plaintiffs\u2019 going concern argument is undermined by the indisputable fact that WCG did indeed continue as a going concern beyond December 31, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">E &amp; Y also challenges plaintiffs\u2019 argument that WCG\u2019s \u201crestructuring,\u201d which occurred months after the audit, shows substantial doubt that WCG was a going concern, contending that there is no evidence in the record to show that, to stay in business, WCG was forced to sell assets to meet its obligations as they became due.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">The court concludes that plaintiffs have not presented evidence sufficient under the minimal Rule 56 standard to show a material misrepresentation or omission by E &amp; Y as to WCG\u2019s status as a going concern. There is no dispute that WCG did continue as a going concern past December 31, 2001. For that reason, E &amp; Y\u2019s failure to include a going concern qualification cannot constitute a \u201cmaterial\u201d misrepresentation or omission. <em>See, Pew v. Cardarelli, </em>2005 WL 3817472, *9 (N.D.N.Y. March 17, 2005) (citing <em>In re Integrated Resources Real Estate, Ltd. Partnerships Securities Litigation, </em>815 F.Supp. 620, 670 (S.D.N.Y.1993) and <em>Schick v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>808 F.Supp. 1097, 1102-03 (S.D.N.Y.1992)). Moreover, as did the court in Pew, the court notes that the AICPA\u2019s professional standards specifically state that \u201cthe absence of reference to substantial doubt in an auditor\u2019s report should not be viewed as providing assurance as to an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d <em>Id.; see also, </em>Ex. 61 at AU \u00a7 341.04, CM Deck Consequently, the court concludes that plaintiffs cannot establish a material misrepresentation or omission as to WCG\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern as of year-end 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">2. <em>Scienter astoE &amp; Y.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-8\">The court has concluded that as to as to the material misrepresentation or omission element of plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim against E &amp; Y, genuine issues of fact exist only with respect to the alleged debt covenant violations. E &amp; Y <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>also moves for summary judgment on the basis that plaintiffs cannot establish the scienter element of their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">Although recklessness can satisfy the requirement of scienter in a securities fraud action against an accountant, \u201crecklessness,\u201d for purposes of a securities fraud claim against an outside auditor, has persuasively been defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1329-6\">highly unreasonable [conduct], involving not merely simple, or even inexcusable negligence, but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it. That standard requires more than a misapplication of accounting principles. [Plaintiffs] must prove that the accounting practices were so deficient that the audit amounted to no audit at all, or \u201can egregious refusal to see the obvious, or to investigate the doubtful,\u201d or that the accounting judgments which were made were such that no reasonable accountant would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\"><em>Sprint Corp., </em>314 F.Supp.2d at 1148 (quoting <em>S.E.C. v. Price Waterhouse, </em>797 F.Supp. 1217, 1240 (S.D.N.Y.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-8\">Applying that standard and viewing the evidence most favorably to the plaintiffs, the court concludes that plaintiffs cannot meet this exacting standard as to the alleged debt covenant violations. Although plaintiffs have shown that another accountant, Mr. Mintzer, would have handled the matter differently and reached different audit conclusions, they have not shown that E &amp; Y\u2019s accounting practices were so deficient that the audit amounted to no audit at all or that the accounting judgments made were such that no reasonable accountant would have made the same decision if confronted with the same facts. Moreover, they have not shown an egregious refusal by E &amp; Y to see the obvious or to investigate the doubtful. At best, plaintiffs have shown negligence by E &amp; Y \u2014 not reckless conduct. Recklessness, however, is \u201ca mental state apart from negligence and [is] akin to conscious disregard.\u201d <em>In re Comshare Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>183 F.3d 542, 550 (6th Cir.1999); <em>see also, In re Cardinal Health Inc. Securities Litigations, </em>426 F.Supp.2d 688, (S.D.Ohio 2006) (\u201cRecklessness on the part of an independent auditor entails a mental state so culpable that it approximate^] an actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated by the audited company.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-10\">GAAP and GAAS violations, standing alone, are not sufficient to establish scien-ter. <em>Zucker v. Sasaki, </em>963 F.Supp. 301, 307 (S.D.N.Y.1997). The GAAP or GAAS violations must be coupled with evidence that the violations were the result of the auditor\u2019s <em>fraudulent intent to mislead investors. Fleming Cos., </em>264 F.3d at 1261. The court\u2019s careful review of the substantial summary judgment record in this case convinces the court that plaintiffs cannot make the required showing as to E &amp; Y. Plaintiffs\u2019 proffered evidence that E &amp; Y lacked independence is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to scienter. The mere fact that E &amp; Y had an interest in continued employment by WCG after the spin-off and to continue to receive substantial auditing fees is likewise not sufficient. <em>Sprint Corp., </em>314 F.Supp.2d at 1148, n. 26. Accordingly, because plaintiffs have failed to show by competent evidence that E <em>&amp; </em>Y acted with scienter as to the alleged debt covenant violations, the court concludes that summary judgment is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-11\">The court further concludes that even if plaintiffs could establish material misrepresentations or omissions as to the impairment of WCG\u2019s network and network <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>equipment and as to WCG\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern as of year-end 2000, plaintiffs have failed to raise genuine issues of fact as to whether E &amp; Y\u2019s treatment of those matters was reckless. The summary judgment record in this case does not establish that E &amp; Y\u2019s audit amounted, effectively, to no audit at all. The plaintiffs\u2019 primary argument is that because only two sentences in the 17,000 pages of work papers mention the FAS 121 impairment analysis, E &amp; Y\u2019s year-end 200 audit amounted to \u201cno audit at all.\u201d The evidence clearly shows that E &amp; Y evaluated whether FAS 121 impairment indicators existed and concluded that they did not. E &amp; Y documented this conclusion in the work papers. Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions on this point boil down to an argument with E <em>&amp; </em>Y\u2019s professional judgment as to FAS 121 impairment indicators. But plaintiffs have not made a showing, sufficient for summary judgment purposes, that \u201cno reasonable accountant would have made the same decisions\u201d E &amp; Y made. Moreover, the summary judgment record shows that none of WCG\u2019s competitors took a network or equipment impairment charge at year-end 2000. This substantially undercuts plaintiffs\u2019 contention that E &amp; Y reached a conclusion that no reasonable accountant would have reached. Furthermore, as to scienter with respect to the going concern qualification, at least one court has held that scienter is not demonstrated as to status as a going concern when the company survives for twelve months. <em>See, Fidel v. Farley, </em>2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9461, at *32, n. 21 (W.D. Ky. June 27, 2001). Accordingly, the court concludes that E &amp; Y is entitled to summary judgment as to the scienter element.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">D. <em>WCG Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">1. <em>WCG\u2019s contentions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">The WCG defendants move for summary judgment on the ground that the WCG Subclass plaintiffs cannot, as a matter of law, establish loss causation, an element of their \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims. Defendants argue that under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dura, plaintiffs must show that their claimed losses were caused by the revelation of the fraud to the market (\u201cthe corrective disclosure\u201d) and not by \u201cchanged economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or other events.... \u201d <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342-43, 125 S.Ct. 1627. The WCG defendants contend that plaintiffs cannot show that their losses were caused by the fraud. Defendants contend that the Complaint (not to be confused with Dr. Nye\u2019s report) alleges only two corrective disclosures as to WCG common stock and none as to WCG\u2019s notes.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">The earliest of the two disclosures alleged in the Complaint was February 25, 2002, the date WCG announced in a press release that it was considering bankruptcy as an option to restructure its debt. Defendants contend, however, that this announcement was not a corrective disclosure \u2014 pointing out that WCG had warned the investing public in its February 4, 2002 press release, as well as in a February 13, 2002 earnings conference call, that bankruptcy might be an option. In addition, defendants assert that by the time the February 25th announcement as made, WCG\u2019s stock had lost more than 98 percent of its value from the beginning of the class period. Indeed, the price of WCG\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>stock had declined from $28.50 to $0.51 per share. Because the value of the WCG stock had fallen so far before the announcement, defendants contend that the market clearly knew WCG was in dire financial straits. Thus, defendants maintain that there was nothing corrective, at least in a causal sense, about the February 25th announcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">Defendants also argue that even ' if WCG\u2019s announcement could be treated as a corrective disclosure, a price decline of only an additional one percent (based on its price on the first day of the class period) after the per-share price had fallen more than 98 percent, taken together with the fact that the Telecom Index had declined more than 81 percent during the same period, precludes any finding of loss causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">Defendants also assert that the second disclosure pleaded in the Complaint, WCG\u2019s actual bankruptcy filing on April 22, 2002, likewise cannot be treated as a corrective disclosure for loss causation purposes. Defendants point out that WCG disclosed on February 4, 2002, February 13, 2002, February 25, 2002 and April 1, 2002, that bankruptcy was a possibility. Defendants also contend that WCG had not fraudulently claimed to the investing public that it would not file for bankruptcy. Consequently, defendants contend that while the bankruptcy filing disclosed negative news, it cannot be said to have disclosed corrective news.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">Defendants also point out that before the bankruptcy announcement, the price of WCG\u2019s stock was $0.17 per share \u2014 representing a decline of 99.4 percent from the first day of the class period, substantially tracking the overall decline in the value of securities in the telecommunications sector.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">The WCG defendants further argue that plaintiffs cannot salvage their case through evidence offered by their damages and loss causation expert, Dr. Nye. First, defendants contend that Dr. Nye\u2019s opinion testimony is inadmissible under <em>Daubert. </em>Defendants next argue that Dr. Nye\u2019s theory of loss causation, \u201cleakage\u201d or gradual disclosure of the \u201crelevant truth\u201d as to WCG\u2019s financial condition throughout the class period, runs contrary to the allegations of the Complaint. Defendants insist that plaintiffs should be held to the theory of loss causation stated in their amended pleading (that WCG\u2019s financial condition was concealed from the investing public until February 25, 2002). Because plaintiffs did not seek leave to plead any \u201cleakage\u201d theory of loss causation,, defendants contend that they should not' be permitted to rely on the \u201cleakage\u201d theory to support their case at this juncture. Defendants also contend that the \u201cleakage\u201d theory collides with the holding in Dura. On this point, defendants argue that while courts have allowed plaintiffs to establish loss causation by showing that the truth leaked out through a series of partial corrective disclosures, the courts have not excused plaintiffs from identifying those disclosures. Nor, say the defendants, are the plaintiffs excused from showing statistically significant market reactions to the leaked truth. Defendants argue that Dr. Nye has presented no evidence or analysis showing any corrective disclosures prior to January 29, 2002. Because Dr. Nye\u2019s \u201cleakage\u201d opinion does not identify the emergence of corrective information on an identifiable date, with an associated drop in the price of the stock, defendants contend that plaintiffs cannot establish loss causation by way of Dr. Nye\u2019s \u201cleakage\u201d opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-9\">Defendants acknowledge that in his report, Dr. Nye has identified four specific partial corrective disclosure dates. Dr. Nye proffers corrective disclosures on January 29, February 4, February 25, and April 22, 2002. But defendants argue that the identified disclosures do not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>corrective disclosures. The defendants\u2019 arguments as to the February 25 and April 22 announcements are summarized above. As to the January 29, 2002 disclosure (WMB\u2019s announcement that it was delaying the fourth quarter and 2001 year-end financial statements while it re-evaluated the status of its contingent liabilities relating to WCG), defendants assert that the disclosure did not directly expose any fraud by WCG and that if an announcement does not directly expose the fraud, the plaintiffs\u2019 expert may not be permitted to speculate, without evidence, that the market recognized a relationship between the announcement and the fraud. Defendants assert that Dr. Nye\u2019s work has not shown, on any acceptable basis, that the market recognized a relationship between WMB\u2019s announcement and WCG\u2019s alleged concealment of its \u201ctrue\u201d financial condition, thus precluding any attempt, through Dr. Nye or otherwise, to speculate that the market recognized a relationship between the announcement and fraud. Defendants also contend that Dr. Nye\u2019s own economic analysis refutes any claim that the January 29, 2002 announcement operated as a corrective disclosure, pointing out that his event study shows that the price decline following the announcement was not statistically significant, and concluding that in the absence of a statistically significant price decline following the corrective disclosure, there can be no loss causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">As to the February 4, 2002 disclosure (WCG\u2019s announcement that the bank group had informed WCG that it may be in default under its credit facility and that WCG was performing a review of possible impairment of long-lived assets), defendants assert that, at best, the disclosure was in part corrective and in part merely negative and that Dr. Nye has wholly failed to differentiate between the effects of the two categories of information, thus precluding the use of Dr. Nye\u2019s proposed testimony on this point to support loss causation. Doc. No. 1092 (WCG defendants) at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">Aside from their contentions as to loss causation, the WCG defendants move for summary judgment on the basis of a related (but not identical) contention that plaintiffs cannot establish either the fact of their damages or the means of calculating their damages, both of which failures are fatal to plaintiffs\u2019 securities fraud claims, asserting that Dr. Nye\u2019s three proposed damage scenarios (Scenario 1, Scenario 2 and Alternative Scenario 2) are so inadequate as to render them useless. Defendants argue that each of the scenarios would permit plaintiffs to recover losses which either preceded disclosure of the alleged fraud or were the result of market factors unrelated to the alleged fraud, or both. Because plaintiffs are unable to either prove the fact of damages or present a reliable method for calculating legally cognizable damages, defendants contend that they are entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">2. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 response to WCG\u2019s motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">Plaintiffs argue that the \u201cleakage\u201d theory is not inconsistent with the allegations of the Complaint. They contend that their amended pleading contains numerous examples of the market\u2019s gradual realization of WCG\u2019s poor financial condition during the class period, as well as defendants\u2019 efforts to rebut the market\u2019s realization. The allegations, plaintiffs maintain, provide sufficient notice of plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that negative information concerning WCG slowly leaked into the marketplace, gradually revealing WCG\u2019s true financial condition and gradually dissipating the artificial inflation in WCG\u2019s stock price. Plaintiffs also suggest that even if the leakage theory has not been pleaded, the court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>consider the issue at this stage by treating it as an amendment to their pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">Aside from pleading issues, plaintiffs also contend that the leakage theory is consistent with <em>Dura. </em>Plaintiffs assert that in the <em>Dura </em>opinion, the Supreme Court explained that a loss may be caused if the purchaser sells after \u201cthe relevant truth begins to leak out,\u201d <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627, thus recognizing that some cases may involve a gradual, fraud-related stock price decline. Plaintiffs contend that their leakage theory in this case is not precluded simply because they cannot specifically identify each piece of corrective information that leaked out into the market during the class period. It is noteworthy, and telling, that they assert that <em>any </em>information that allowed investors to understand WCG\u2019s true financial condition and prospects for success is \u201cleakage of the relevant truth.\u201d Doc. No. 1210 (plaintiffs) at 23. They maintain that the very nature of the leakage theory makes it impossible to identify each and every piece of information that revealed the true state of WCG\u2019s financial condition because a statistical analysis of WCG\u2019s stock price movements will not necessarily identify the \u201cbits and pieces\u201d of corrective information which cause the stock price to imperceptibly but inexorably decline to its true value. They contend, in substance, that it should be sufficient for them to show that by the end of the class period, the market knew the truth about WCG\u2019s previously-misrepresented financial condition and prospects for success.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">Plaintiffs also contend that they have shown, with Dr. Nye\u2019s Scenario 2 and Alternative Scenario 2, that the truth about WCG\u2019s financial condition and its prospects for success was revealed to the investing public, at the very least, through the four specific corrective disclosures on January 29, 2002, February 4, 2002, February 25, 2002 and April 22, 2002 and that their assertion of the January 29 and February 4 disclosures is not inconsistent with the allegations of the Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the January 29, 2002 announcement (about WMB\u2019s assessment of its contingent liabilities) was a corrective disclosure because that announcement partially revealed believable negative information in the possession of WMB, previously concealed, about WCG\u2019s financial condition and prospects for success. Plaintiffs also challenge defendants\u2019 argument that the disclosure was not corrective because the resulting stock price movement was not statistically significant, arguing that defendants\u2019 argument is based on an incorrect interpretation of \u201cstatical significance\u201d and its meaning in relation to the materiality of a stock price drop.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-9\">Plaintiffs contend that the February 4, 2002 disclosure was a corrective disclosure because it revealed to the market material risks that had been fraudulently concealed, specifically (i) that WCG had been overloaded with debt and would be unable to service that debt while maintaining its business plan and (ii) that WCG\u2019s long-lived assets were materially impaired. Plaintiffs argue that it was not necessary for Dr. Nye to separate corrective bad news from garden-variety, bad news on February 4 as long as some portion of WCG\u2019s stock price drop on that-day was caused by investors\u2019 reaction to the fraud-related information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">Next, plaintiffs argue that-the February 25, 2002 announcement was a corrective disclosure because it disclosed the substantial likelihood that WCG would not be able to survive as a viable standalone entity after the spin-off, which had previously been concealed by defendants. Noting that bankruptcy is always a possibility for any corporation, plaintiffs contend that pri- or to February 25, 2002, the market was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>not made aware that it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that WCG would be forced to declare bankruptcy, Doc. No. 1210, at 33, pointing out that one of the defendants\u2019 experts (Dr. Tabak) admitted that the February 25, 2002 announcement revealed to investors a heightened risk of WCG\u2019s bankruptcy-</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">As to the final disclosure date, plaintiffs argue that the bankruptcy filing on April 22, 2002 was a corrective disclosure because it finally revealed the truth, previously undisclosed, as to the \u201cmagnitude\u201d of the likelihood that WCG would be forced to declare bankruptcy. Plaintiffs maintain that the bankruptcy filing can constitute a corrective disclosure because the defendants\u2019 prior misrepresentation had concealed that it was foreseeable that a company would declare bankruptcy in the near future, pointing out again that Dr. Tabak acknowledged in deposition that if plaintiffs\u2019 allegations concerning defendants\u2019 awareness of the likelihood of bankruptcy were proven, loss causation is associated with the April 22nd bankruptcy filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">Finally, plaintiffs contend that their damage theories are legally and economically sound, at least for summary judgment purposes. They contend that Dr. Nye\u2019s proposed expert testimony on the related issues of loss causation and damages satisfies <em>Daubert </em>and <em>Kumho. </em>Pointing out that the Court, in Dura, did not address the measure of damages in a securities fraud case, plaintiffs argue that the traditional method, the out-of-pocket rule,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> is still the law and that their case passes muster under the out-of-pocket rule, both as to the common stock and as to the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-7\">The court need not determine whether Dr. Nye\u2019s leakage theory is fatally inconsistent with the Complaint. The court has concluded, in Part V(E) of this memorandum, that Dr. Nye\u2019s causation-related opinions, including his damage scenarios, do not square with the law of loss causation, applied through the prism of <em>Daubert </em>and Rule 702. The court has granted defendants\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>motions with respect to Dr. Nye\u2019s proposed expert testimony with respect to loss causation and his damage scenarios. That discussion and analysis need not be repeated here. Loss causation is an essential element of plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim and is an issue on which plaintiffs have the burden of proof at trial. <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627; <em>Gordon Partners v. Blumenthal, </em>2007 WL 1438753, at *2. Confronted with defendants\u2019 motions, plaintiffs are obliged to come forward with evidence which, if credited, would be sufficient to support a finding in their favor on the issue of loss causation. <em>Gordon Partners, </em>2007 WL 1438753 at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-8\">The court has carefully reviewed the summary judgment record for competent evidence, aside from the excluded expert testimony, to support such a finding. Having done so, the court concludes that plaintiffs have failed to present evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue as to loss causation. The plaintiffs have not made a showing, sufficient for summary judgment purposes, that defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations or omissions were the cause of plaintiffs\u2019 actual losses. <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (defining loss causation as a \u201ccausal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss\u201d). \u201c[A]n inflated purchase price will not itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss.\u201d <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627. With or without Dr. Nye\u2019s proposed expert testimony, the summary judgment record provides no basis upon which a finder of fact could reasonably determine, consistent with loss causation doctrine established by Dura and its progeny, that plaintiffs\u2019 claimed losses were caused by defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations or omissions and not by \u201cchanged economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or other events.... \u201d <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342-43, 125 S.Ct. 1627. Having failed to provide admissible expert or lay evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to the causal nexus between defendants\u2019 misrepresentations or omissions and plaintiffs\u2019 alleged losses, the court concludes that all defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the issue of loss causation.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">\u201cEconomic loss,\u201d in the words of the Court in <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4)), is an essential element of these plaintiffs\u2019 securities fraud claim. Plaintiffs asserting claims under \u00a7 1 0(b) and Rule 10b-5 case generally rely on expert testimony to establish the fact of damages and the recoverable amount of damages. <em>Sowell v. Butcher &amp; Singer, Inc., </em>926 F.2d 289, 301 (3d Cir.1991). The court has excluded Dr. Nye\u2019s expert testimony as to each of his damage scenarios. The conclusion follows that plaintiffs cannot satisfy their burden of establishing the fact of damages and the means of calculating damages. Summary judgment should consequently be granted in favor of all defendants on the issue of damages. <em>Carpe, </em>2005 WL 1138833 at *8 (granting summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor as to plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims based upon a failure to establish the fact of damages and the means of calculating damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-8\">Because summary judgment is appropriate on the issues of loss causation and damages, plaintiffs cannot establish the essential elements of their \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim and therefore cannot prevail on their claims against any of the defendants. This conclusion is fatal to plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 20(a) claim. As has been discussed, the basic elements of a control person liability claim under \u00a7 20(a) are (i) a primary violation of the securities laws and (ii) \u201ccontrol\u201d over the primary violator by the alleged controlling person. <em>Fleming Companies, </em>264 F.3d at 1270-71. Because plaintiffs are unable to establish their \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim, they cannot establish the first element of their \u00a7 20(a) claim. The court therefore concludes that summary judgment is appropriate on the \u00a7 20(a) claim against the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 1271 (\u00a7 20(a) claim properly dismissed upon dismissal of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-9\">VII. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-10\">Based upon the foregoing, the court ORDERS as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-11\">1.

Although, as noted, Mr. Mathis did assert that he formed an opinion that it would be appropriate for him to perform an impairment analysis on the dark fiber assets (Mathis deposition at 44), a fair reading of his report leaves one with the distinct impression that, from the very outset, his task, as he perceived it, was to perform an impairment analysis <em>only </em>on the dark fiber assets. <em>See, e.g., </em>Mathis Rpt. at 3 (task was to conduct \u201can impairment analysis of WCG\u2019s excess dark fiber and spare conduit assets\u201d), 10 (analysis was \"of WCG\u2019s excess dark fiber and spare conduits\u201d), 11 (Step 1 was to determine the \u201cbook value of WCG\u2019s excess dark fiber\u201d). However, that matter need not be resolved in this memorandum, because it is plainly apparent that, in any event, Mr. Mathis disclaims an opinion as to whether it would have been inappropriate for a year-end 2000 impairment analysis to have treated the fiber network as a unified asset.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1288-29\">. <em>See, In re BellSouth Corp.
