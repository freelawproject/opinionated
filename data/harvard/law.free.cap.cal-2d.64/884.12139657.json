Her application was refused, and she claims that the sole reason for the refusal, as stated to her by one of the defendants, was the fact that she is a member of the Negro race. She thereupon commenced the instant action in the municipal court and, following a jury trial, recovered judgment in the amount of $1250, including $250 statutory damages as provided in section 52 of the Civil Code. Defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial was then granted after plaintiff refused to stipulate to the remittance of a portion of the award for general damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Following certification by the Secretary of State of the passage of Proposition 14 by the electorate of the State of California on November 3, 1964, and its incorporation into the Constitution as article I, section 26,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendants moved to strike plaintiff\u2019s complaint on the ground that the constitutional amendment rendered sections 51 and 52 of the Civil Code inoperative. The motion was granted by a three-judge court which, in view of the importance of the questions involved and \u201cserious doubts\u201d entertained by the court as to the constitutionality of article I, section 26, recommended that the matter be appealed and that the appellate department of the superior court certify the matter to this court pursuant to rule 63, California Rules of Court. The matter is now before us after the judgment was affirmed by the appellate depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>ment and certified as recommended. In so certifying the appellate department stated that the \u201csole question involved herein is the constitutionality of Article I, Section 26, of the Constitution of the State of California. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">We have concluded today in <em>Mulkey </em>v. <em>Reitman, ante, </em>p. 529 [50 Cal.Rptr. 881, 413 P.2d 825], that article I, section 26, is an unconstitutional infringement on the Fourteenth Amendment and for that reason void in its entirety. In accordance therewith the motion to strike plaintiff\u2019s complaint in the instant case must be deemed to have been improperly granted, and the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b916-5\">Traynor, C.
