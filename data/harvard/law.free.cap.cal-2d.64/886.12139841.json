The chairman refuses to execute the contract on the ground that article I, section 26, of the California Constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> expressly prohibits the agency from denying the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>any redeveloper of any real property within the agency project to sell, lease or rent such project real property to whomsoever he chooses, whereas the agency would be contractually obligated to actively prevent discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin should it enter into the contract. As such contractual obligations would thus be inconsistent with article I, section 26, the chairman claims they constitute obligations which the agency cannot assume or fulfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">It is contended that the chairman\u2019s refusal to execute the contract will result in irreparable injury to petitioner, that it has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law, and accordingly seeks mandate \u201cfor the reason that public necessity and general welfare of the People of the State of California direly need and require a final and immediate determination of the nature, validity and applicability of the said Article I, Section 26, of the Constitution of the State of California.\u201d The petitioner prays that its chairman be directed to execute the proposed contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Petitioner also seeks a declaration that article I, section 26, as a matter of statutory interpretation, does not apply to redevelopment programs or, if it does so apply, such specific application is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment in denying the equal protection of the law, and for that reason unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">The argument that the provision does not apply to urban renewal depends upon the definition of \u201cpersons\u201d who are affected as not including \u201cthe State or any subdivision thereof,\u201d campaign propaganda prior to the adoption of the provision by popular vote in the 1964 general election to the effect that the state and its agencies would not be affected, and the clear prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment against direct and obvious state action in discriminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">We have concluded today in <em>Mulkey </em>v. <em>Reitman, ante, </em>p. 529 [50 Cal.Rptr. 881, 413 P.2d 825], that article I, section 26, is unconstitutional in its entirety. Certainly in the instant application, if indeed section 26 is applicable to urban redevelopment as urged by the chairman in his return, the agency\u2019s participation in making properties available to even private parties (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 33000 et seq.) would compel a conclusion <em>a fortiori, </em>that state action is significantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>involved. (See <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 722 [81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45].) But it is unnecessary that we construe article I, section 26, to determine whether the contemplated conduct falls within the proscription of that provision, as it must be deemed null and void and not applicable in any and all circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">The real relief sought by petitioner appears to be more in the nature of an advisory opinion that article I, section 26, is unconstitutional rather than \u201cto compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085.) As we have, in <em>Mulkey </em>v. <em>Reitman, ante, </em>p. 529 [50 Cal.Rptr. 881, 413 P.2d 825] in effect rendered such an advisory opinion, the instant issues should be deemed to have been rendered moot, and for that reason the alternative writ is discharged and the peremptory writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b919-5\">Traynor, C.

To this end the provisions of this Article are <em>severable.\"</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b919-6\">WHITE, J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"A59\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">The majority hold that it is unnecessary to determine whether section 26 is applicable to urban redevelopment for the reason that section 26 is unconstitutional in its entirety and therefore not applicable \u201cin any and all circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">With this conclusion I disagree for the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in <em>Mulkey </em>v. <em>Reitman, ante, </em>p. 545 [50 Cal.Rptr. 892, 413 P.2d 836].</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Also, I am further convinced that there is nothing in section 26 which would prohibit respondent herein from entering into the agreement here in question, or any other agreement with a federal agency, upon such terms as the latter may require.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">The redevelopment and housing legislation in California establishes a redevelopment agency in each community as an administrative arm of the state. Indeed, the California Health and Safety Code, section 33005, defines the term \u201cState\u201d to include any state agency or instrumentality.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Since property owned by a redevelopment agency is excluded from the coverage of section 26, the agency may clearly include a nondiscrimination covenant as a condition of the disposition of its own property. And a purchaser of project property, whether from the redevelopment agency or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>subsequent purchaser of the same property, may purchase it or not, as he sees fit. However, if he does purchase he accepts the land subject to other conditions or restrictions running with the land. If these restrictions, including a nondiscrimination one, do not suit his tastes, he is under no obligation to purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">This is equally true with the owner of property in a redevelopment project who enters into an agreement as a participating owner, thereby avoiding the acquisition of his property by eminent domain. It seems clear to me that if one enters into an agreement to sell or to purchase property upon terms satisfactory to the buyer and seller, such an agreement is binding and enforceable. Therefore, if a person chooses to take property with a nondiscrimination covenant, the state is not interfering with any right he might have to refuse to sell in the absence of such a contract. A nondiscrimination covenant running with the land is legal and lawful, and is accepted the same as all other covenants by subsequent purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Solely upon the ground that section 26 is no barrier whatever to petitioner\u2019s ability to comply fully with the proposed contract with a federal agency which respondent for the same reason may lawfully execute, I would issue the writ as prayed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b920-6\">McComb, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b919-12\">Retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
