A. Donovan, </em>(D. <em>J. Sullivan </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A_9\"><em>H. R.

The speed of the car was increased somewhat as the front wheels came upon the regular macadam surface so that the rear wheels jounced. There were four passengers in the vehicle. There was no evidence that any one else was severely shaken. The plaintiff testified that \u201cso far as driving along there was concerned it seemed all right; everything. seemed all right until the bump came.\u201d Until the bump, \u201cMr. Lyons\u2019 driving had been careful and all right. . . . She had noticed the bump coming .... She could see ahead, and see it, and she saw there was a bump there, but said nothing about it. . . . she had no idea in her mind but that the defendant was driving carefully and properly until after her injury had been received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Nothing more than a bounce as the car ascended to the level of the undisturbed surface of the road is shown to indicate lack of care. The speed of the vehicle did not seem unreasonable even to the plaintiff. She does not introduce evidence of any lack of attention on the part of the driver. Although a jounce may be some evidence of negligence when taken in connection with other evidence, \u2014 as of excessive speed, failure by the driver to maintain a proper lookout, of careless handling of the machine, \u2014 when it stands alone, it is not enough to sustain a finding of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Inasmuch as there was no sufficient evidence of negligence, the verdicts on both counts were directed properly, and it is not necessary to consider whether the plaintiff was other than a guest.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
