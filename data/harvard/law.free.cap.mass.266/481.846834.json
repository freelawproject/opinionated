He was seen to get on the rear car of \u201cthe train, that is, he had his hands on the two bars of the train ... or the rails . . . had taken hold of the irons and stepped up on to the first step.\u201d When last seen \u201che was on the running board, or the floor board\u201d of the car, and the train started almost immediately thereafter. Later he was found about three hundred thirty feet distant on the tracks of the defendant, mortally injured. Subsidiary facts and suggested inferences need not be stated in further detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">On all the evidence it could not rightly have been found that negligence of the defendant had any causal connection with the injury and death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. It does not appear that the train which he boarded was a passenger train or designed to carry passengers, or that his injury resulted from negligent operation of a train on which he was a passenger. The case falls within the general principle that, where the cause of the injury for which damages are sought is left to conjecture or surmise and has no solid foundation in established facts, there can be no recovery. <em>Bigwood </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>209 Mass. 345. <em>Lyford </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>227 Mass. 10. <em>Kansas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>City Southern Railway </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>276 U.
