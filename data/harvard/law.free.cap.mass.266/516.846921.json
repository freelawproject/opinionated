The single member and a majority of the Industrial Accident Board have found, that when he entered upon his work he had a valvular disease of the heart; and that this condition \u201cwas the remote cause of his incapacity and injury; the strain and exertion of his job was the proximate, contributing cause.\u201d One member of the board dissented stating that: \u201cIt seems to me that the employee\u2019s work did no more than help wear out a diseased organ of his body.\u201d The evidence is undisputed that after first working for the Arnold Print Works at North Adams, Burns went to New York for twenty-four or twenty-five years. He returned to North Adams and worked for the Hunter Machine Company from November 11, 1922, till October 27, 1923, when he became disabled. His trouble was diagnosed as acute rheumatism; and from November 3, 1923, until May, 1924, he was paid for disability from rheumatism under a \u201cgroup health\u201d policy issued to the Hunter Machine Company. He never returned to work with the Hunter Company and did little, if any, regular work until he began as watchman with the Windsor Print Works in August, 1925. In this work he traversed nightly, seven nights in the week, in going through halls and up and down stairs, from thirteen to fifteen miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Physicians testified that valvular disease of the heart is an usual consequence of acute rheumatism, and that Burns was suffering from valvular disease of the heart, when he began work for the assured. This was contradicted, but the single member so found. The finding was affirmed by the Industrial Accident Board on appeal, and we think it must be taken to be the finding of the Board, \u2014 a finding of fact with which, as there is evidence to support it, under familiar principles, we cannot interfere. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>As was said in <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57, 62, this court has gone further than most courts in allowing recovery-in cases of heart lesions, where there has been a weak heart before the injury was received. <em>Brightman\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 17. <em>Fisher\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 581. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487. <em>Mooradjian\u2019s Case, </em>229 Mass. 521. All the cases of heart lesion that have been called to our attention in which compensation has been allowed, however, differ from the case which is now before us in that there was in those cases some special act or incident bringing a sudden strain upon the weakened heart. In the case before us there is nothing of the kind. The employee, with a weakened heart when he entered the employment, undertook to do an amount of walking which involved going up and down stairs. There was, however, no particular instance of strain in the course of his work, and his ultimate breakdown appears to us to be merely the natural effect of exertion in this work upon a heart already weakened by valvular disease. In such circumstances we think that the workmen\u2019s compensation act does not apply; and that as matter of law the suffering which the employee has undergone cannot be said to be the result of a personal injury arising out of the employment entitling him to compensation under the act. See <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The case is controlled by the principles laid down in <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57. It results that the order must be</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
