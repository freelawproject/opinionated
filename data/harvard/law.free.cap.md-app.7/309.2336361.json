Marshall, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County </em>and <em>Joseph J. Bonner, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b328-5\">Thompson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2kZ\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">John Cordell Swann, the appellant, was convicted of assault with intent to murder in a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Judge Ralph W. Powers presiding. Swann, who was sentenced to a term of fifteen years, now asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\"><em>\u201c1. </em>Should the defendant\u2019s conviction be vitiated because of lack of proper jurisdiction over the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak4\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Should indigent accused, represented by assigned counsel, be bound by counsel\u2019s statements, objections, or failures to object at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201c3. Should the Court have permitted the defendant to be cross-examined by the prosecutor as to a prior unrelated housebreaking conviction.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">On July 6, 1968 at about 3:45 A.M., Pauline Hawkins stepped out of the rear of Jiffy Carry Out Shop, where she was employed, to dispose of some dirty linen when she was confronted by Swann who shot her. About a month before the shooting, Swann, posing as a janitor, had gained entrance into Hawkins\u2019 apartment and raped her. On cross-examination, she testified that she felt that Swann had shot her to keep her from testifying in the rape case.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Swann was apprehended in the District of Columbia by District policemen and returned to Prince George\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>County by Prince George\u2019s detectives. Swann contends that since he was improperly returned to Maryland, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County lacked the necessary jurisdiction to try him.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The Supreme Court of the United States held in <em>Frisbie v. Collins, </em>342 U. S. 519, 522, 72 S. Ct. 509, 511, 96 L. Ed. 541, <em>reh. denied </em>343 U. S. 937, 72 S. Ct. 768, 96 L. Ed. 1344 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">\u201cThis Court has never departed from the rule announced in <em>Ker v. Illinois, </em>119 U. S. 436, 444, 7 S. Ct. 225, 229, 30 L. Ed. 421, that the power of a court to try a person for crime is not impaired by the fact that he had been brought within the court\u2019s jurisdiction by reason of a \u2018forcible abduction\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The Court of Appeals of Maryland has followed <em>Ker v. Illinois, supra </em>and <em>Frisbie v. Collins, supra, </em>see <em>McGuire v. State, </em>200 Md. 601, 92 A. 2d 582, <em>cert. den. </em>344 U. S. 928, 73 S. Ct. 497, 97 L. Ed. 714, <em>Bell v. Warden, </em>215 Md. 614, 137 A. 2d 118, and <em>Austin v. Director, </em>237 Md. 314, 206 A. 2d 145 and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">\u20142\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">This question is posed apparently to support question no. 3. We see no valid distinction between paid and court appointed counsel; and we are referred to no case so holding. As to the importance of state procedural requirements on raising constitutional questions see <em>Bork v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 404, 243 A. 2d 647, <em>cert. den. </em>Court of Appeals of Maryland, <em>January lip, 1969 </em>and by the Supreme Court of United States, <em>June 2,1969. </em>\u201cThe matter of competency of trial counsel was not tried and decided below and is not properly before us for review,\u201d <em>Franklin v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 572, 580, 252 A. 2d 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u20143\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Prior Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">When Swann took the stand and testified, he was cross-examined by the State\u2019s Attorney as to a prior conviction for housebreaking. There was no objection below and the issue is not properly before this Court under Md. Eule 1085; nonetheless, the question may be easily answered. By taking the stand, Swann placed his character into issue and could thus be questioned by the State\u2019s Attorney as to his previous criminal conviction insofar as it pertained to his credibility as a witness. <em>Minor v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 82, 88, 250 A. 2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-13\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel abandoned a fourth question at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
