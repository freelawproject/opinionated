Hackett Turner, Jr. of the Circuit Court for Kent County, denying Thomas\u2019 first petition under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act. This Court\u2019s opinion on appeal from the original conviction is reported in <em>Thomas v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 708, 240 A. 2d 646. Thomas, in his application for leave to appeal, contends that:</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">(1) he was denied a speedy trial;</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">(2) he was prejudiced by the State\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 informing the jury of his prior convictions;</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">(3) he was prejudiced because the jury was allowed to take the indictment into the jury room during their deliberation;</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">(4) his pretrial lineup was not fair and impartial;</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">(5) the evidence was not sufficient to support the verdict;</p>\n<p id=\"b233-17\">(6) his trial counsel was incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-18\">\u20141\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b233-19\">Speedy Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b233-20\">Thomas was arrested on September 7, 1966 and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>leased on bail on December 16, 1966. Indictments were presented against him on February 9, 1967; he was convicted by a jury of uttering five checks on April 18, 1967. At no time during this period did Thomas ask for a speedy trial. This contention is but a bald allegation as there is nothing in the record to show that he made any effort for an earlier trial, or that he was in any way prejudiced. The lapse of time, of itself, was not sufficient to show the denial of a speedy trial. <em>Graham, v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 458, 251 A. 2d 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u20142\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Prior Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">When Thomas took the stand and testified at his trial, he was cross-examined by the State\u2019s Attorney as to his prior convictions. By taking the stand, Thomas placed his character in issue and could then be questioned by the State\u2019s Attorney as to his previous criminal convictions. <em>Minor v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 82, 88, 250 A. 2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Thomas cites <em>Burgett v. Texas, </em>389 U. S. 109, 88 S. Ct. 258, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 to support his contention, alleging that the state did not establish that he had counsel at the prior trials. A reading of <em>Burgett, supra </em>will show that the prior convictions in that case were declared void because Burgett had not been represented by counsel at those previous trials. See <em>Suggs v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 231, 235, 250 A. 2d 670 and <em>Brown v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 623, 244 A. 2d 471. There is no allegation or testimony that Thomas was not represented by counsel at the prior trials. The mere fact that the state did not affirmatively establish that fact at the trial in question does not constitute grounds for post conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u20143\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">This Court has held that it is not improper for the jury to take the indictment in the jury room for their deliberations, <em>Darby v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 407, 411, 239 A. 2d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u20144\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Lineup</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Thomas contends that the State, at his trial, did not establish first, before the State elicited an in-court identification and testimony pertaining to the result of a lineup, that it had been conducted fairly and impartially. In testimony he alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">\u201cA. Well the lineup I was placed in with two young boys, one eighteen and one nineteen. The other fellow was around sixty-eight and myself. The boys were born and raised here in the city and the other fellow had been here around thirty-five years so I\u2019m the only stranger in the lineup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">\u201cQ. Where are you from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">\u201cA. Baltimore. I was the only stranger in the lineup that wasn\u2019t known by pretty near everybody in town.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">\u201cQ. How many were in the lineup, if you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-12\">\u201cA. There were four.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-13\">\u201cQ. And how old are you, Mr. Thomas ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-14\">\u201cA. I\u2019m forty-four.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-15\">\u201cQ. Then at that time you were forty-two. Is that correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-16\">\u201cA. Yes sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-17\">The hearing judge did not decide whether the lineup procedures had been fair but discussed the identification of Thomas by the several eyewitnesses. The contention did not deal with the sufficiency of the identification but the fairness of the lineup; therefore, the case must be remanded for a finding on this point. Although the lineup involved was conducted prior to June 12, 1967, and therefore <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, is not applicable insofar as the presence of counsel is concerned, <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, 87 S. Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199; nevertheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>constitutional right to a fair lineup antedated <em>Wade, </em>see <em>Reeves v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 195, 238 A. 2d 307, <em>Rath v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 721, 240 A. 2d 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u20145\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Sufficiency of the evidence <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to sustain the conviction is not considered on post conviction, <em>Booth v. Warden, </em>3 Md. App. 480, 484, 240 A. 2d 352.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u20146\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Incompetency of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">In determining competency of counsel, the hearing judge applied the older standard saying counsel was not \u201cso d\u00e9ficient as to make a farce out of the trial\u201d instead of the newer standard which we discussed in full in <em>Green v. Warden, </em>3 Md. App. 266, 269, 238 A. 2d 920. This standard requires that counsel shall afford the accused \u201cgenuine and effective representation.\u201d The hearing judge will, of course, on the remand, make a determination under the correct standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">\n<em>Application granted and case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-12\">. In Thomas\u2019 appeal to this Court, the issue of sufficiency was also finally litigated, <em>Thomas v. State, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-13\">. At his hearing, Thomas maintained that the State took handwriting exemplar from him but withheld the results. It should be pointed out that Thomas was convicted of uttering and not of forgery. Whether or not he personally forged the instruments is of no consequence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
