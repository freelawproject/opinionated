He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction and to a consecutive sentence of 15 years on the assault conviction. On appeal he contends: (I) The lower court erred in its denial of a motion made by him, and (II) the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">On 6 November 1967, prior to trial, the appellant filed a petition requesting that he be given a \u201ctruth serum test\u201d and the petition was denied the same day by Judge Anselm Sodaro, presiding in the Criminal Court of Baltimore. On 18 December 1967 the State answered the petition and, although alleging that the results of a truth serum test have no probative value in a criminal case in Maryland, that the petition was not supported by reasons as required by Md. Rule 725 (e)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that it did not appear that results of the test could in any way be necessary to the defense, stated that it would not object to the signing of the order requested if at the time of the test both prosecuting attorney and defense attorney were present and if it was agreed that the results of the test would have probative value and be admitted in evidence as an agreed exhibit either for or against the defendant at his trial. On 6 February 1968 the appellant filed a consent and authorization to take the test and to have the results used for or against him at his trial. On 3 May Judge James A. Perrott, presiding in the Criminal Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>of Baltimore, ordered that the test be administered by-John Hamilton, M. D., Supervisor of Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital, but preserving the right of the court to rule on the admissibility of the results of the test at the trial \u201cnotwithstanding the agreement of the parties.\u201d At the trial Dr. Hamilton, called by the defendant but apparently a joint witness by stipulation, testified that pursuant to the order, which he insisted upon before giving the test,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he had examined the appellant except that by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>agreement it was a sodium amytal interview procedure rather than a truth serum test. Dr. Hamilton conducted two such sodium amytal interviews. The appellant\u2019s responses to questions were the same \u2014 \u201cthat he was innocent, had nothing to do with it, that he was not present at the time of the commission of the alleged offense, et cetera.\u201d Dr. Hamilton was not able to determine truth or error. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201cI find myself in this position. I am pretty well estopped from making a ruling because it has been conceded by the State and counsel for the Defendant it was agreed this would be introduced into evidence and for whatever it may be worth, I shall allow it to remain on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Subsequent to the convictions of the appellant, he filed, in proper person, a \u201cMotion for a Private Clinical Physical Hypnotic Examination\u201d to be obtained at State expense. The motion was heard by the court on 27 November. It appeared from argument of counsel that the appellant was not satisfied with Dr. Hamilton\u2019s opinion as to the reliability of the test. The motion was denied. It is this denial that the appellant claims was error. The matter is not properly before us. There was no objection by the appellant, to the testimony of Dr. Hamilton during the trial, and the issue was not tried and decided below before the verdict was rendered. Md. Rule 1085. Further it appears that the point was argued below as one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>grounds of a motion for a new trial. The general rule is that the granting of a new trial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and is not reviewable by this Court. <em>Stallard v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 560; <em>Adams v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 135.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Rosina DiPaula, single, age 76 years, and Concettina DiPaula, single, age 71 years were taken to Maryland General Hospital in an ambulance on 4 October 1966. Rosina DiPaula died in the hospital on 12 November 1966. The opinion of the Medical Examiner was that she died of broncho-pneumonia complicating extensive head injuries with brain damage and that the manner of death was homicide. Concettina DiPaula remained in the Intensive Care Ward at the hospital for five weeks, and after a month and a half stay at the hospital came home to live with her brother Joseph DiPaula. At the time of the trial she was \u201cincommunicative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The DiPaula sisters lived at 1323 West North Avenue, a three story row house, of which the third floor was not occupied. Their brother Joseph DiPaula, whose practice was to stop by to see them both in the morning and after finishing work \u201cto see whether they need anything\u201d, visited them at 6:00 P.M. on 4 October. They were in the sewing room working. He ate a dish of soup Concettina prepared for him. She then asked him to cash Rosina\u2019s social security check in the amount of $69.80, but he had only $50 which he gave Concettina \u2014 \u201cthree ten dollar bills, three five dollar bills and five one dollar bills.\u201d Concettina put the bills into her apron pocket. Rosina was still upstairs on the second floor doing her embroidery. As he left the house, the inner door closing and locking automatically, about 6:30 P.M., he saw a young man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>standing at the door. He had a cap on, glasses and was holding a satchel in his hand and wearing a white jacket with the inscription of the University of Maryland, and was about twenty years of age. He had a brief conversation with the boy; \u201cwhen I saw his standing there I asked him whether there was anyting I could do for him. His reply was \u2018No, I don\u2019t want any insurance, I got enough,\u2019 \u201d When he got home his wife had received a telephone call about his sisters and he went to Maryland General Hospital. \u201cI saw both of my sisters laying on top of the tables, beyond recognition, full of blood and hair full of blood * * * both were unconscious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">On 4 October 1966 about 6:40 P.M. Officer James Osborne and Officer Richard Catania of the Baltimore City Police went to 1323 West North Avenue in response to a call that a burglary was being committed at that address. The vestibule door to the house was closed but not locked. The second door which leads into the house was partly ajar, with the hinges off. They entered and found Concettina DiPaula and Rosina DiPaula in the hallway, each bleeding profusely. \u201cIt appeared to me these women were hit with some kind of sharp instrument.\u201d The police heard a noise in the back, then heard some shots, and then worked themselves \u201cfrom one room to another, one at a time, make sure nobody in the house.\u201d They heard a lot of running, saw one figure \u201csomebody in a white top\u201d and they gave chase. When they heard police in car 704, who had subsequently arrived at the rear of the house, chasing them, they ran back into the house to call an ambulance. There was blood from where the sisters were found on the first floor all the way to the sewing room on the second floor. The entire house had been ransacked, \u2014doors and drawers pulled open, a mattress on the third floor turned over, covers in disarray, papers strewn about, clothes taken from closets and discarded on the floor. Officer Wayne McKenna of the K-9 Corps testified that on 5 October 1966, after receiving information from various people in the 1300 block West North Avenue, went to the alley in back of a house located at 2332 Etting where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>there was a wall roughly six feet high. On top of the wall he found a pocketbook in which were some \u201choly papers\u201d and a doctor\u2019s appointment card. Beside the pocketbook, he found a prayer book, a key and some change. The pocketbook was subequently identified as belonging to Concettina DiPaula.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Rudolph Matthews, age 15 years, was with Antonio Vega, Lee Cephas, Jerome and Edward Wells at Buddy Boy\u2019s Pizza Shop, located at Pennsylvania and Lafette Avenues, at about 5:00 P.M. on 4 October 1966 \u201clistening to records and dancing\u201d when the appellant and Wiggins came in. Appellant then said \u201che was going to make a hustle\u201d, meaning, in the witnesses interpretation, \u201cRob somebody.\u201d The appellant had brass knuckles. Matthews left Buddy Boy\u2019s a little after five in the company of the appellant, Cephas, Vega and Wiggins, walking on Pennsylvania Avenue up towards North Avenue, leaving the group at Pennsylvania and North Avenues to proceed to his home. He saw the appellant the next day with Wiggins playing dice. The appellant told him \u201che made a hustle.\u201d He saw the appellant put a $5 bill in the middle of the crap game.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Gary Lee Cephas, 15 years of age, testified that he, Wiggins and Vega were at the City Food Market on the day of the crimes and were watching two women, about 70 and 80, getting change. They then went down to a lunchroom located on Pennsylvania Avenue where they met the appellant. They all then went to the women\u2019s house. Vega went to see if the door was open, but when he got to the door, a \u201cman came out the door and Tony went down to the corner, make a phone call and the man followed him.\u201d The man, about 67, started to argue with Vega at the phone booth located at the corner of North Avenue. The witness, appellant and Wiggins were at this time \u201cpushing on the front, first door and broke in the second door\u201d and then they \u201cseen this woman hollering, talking about get out of her house.\u201d When she started screaming, Cephas and the appellant hit her, appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>blows hitting her in the face. Cephas searched in the kitchen and the living room, appellant and Wiggins went upstairs \u201cfive or ten minutes after we got in the house.\u201d Cephas found $50 in the lady\u2019s apron. While he was downstairs he heard a woman\u2019s voice, but he didn\u2019t pay much attention. Appellant was carrying a cigar box when he came down the steps. They then went out the back door. He heard the police \u201chollering stop\u201d and Wiggins took a blank gun and fired two shots and they all ran to a house on Brunt Street, about five to eight blocks away, where they went down the basement. Wiggins started counting the money, giving him $11. Vega subsequently came down the basement. Cephas did not know what was in the box appellant took. He further stated that he saw the appellant at \u201chis girlfriend\u2019s house\u201d the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Antonio Vega, age 14 years, was with the appellant, Wiggins and Lee Cephas about 5:00 P.M. on 4 October 1966 at Buddy Boy\u2019s Sub Shop on North Avenue. Wiggins told him \u201cLet\u2019s go make a hustle.\u201d Vega said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cHe said, Why don\u2019t you stop acting like a little chump ?\u2019 I didn\u2019t say nothing. He started calling me names, stuff. So I was going with him.\u201d They went on North Avenue and saw \u201cthese ladies in the City Food Market with some change.\u201d Appellant suggested they snatch a pocketbook but Vega said he did not want to do that. They didn\u2019t get the pocketbook because when the ladies came out of the market they went across the street and went in the house. Appellant and Wiggins then said that \u201cthey was going in the house and get it.\u201d Vega declined to do this and the others asked him to watch for them. He agreed. Then \u201ca man came out of the house, went across the street, came up to me * * * asked me did I want insurance.\u201d Wiggins, Cephas and appellant entered the house in that order. \u201cAfter they went in and after a while I heard some lady scream.\u201d Vega further stated that the man who asked him about insurance went down to the phone booth. Then he heard the police coming. He hollered \u201cpolice\u201d and ran up North Avenue. He heard shots. He ran to a house on Brunt Street and peeped down the cellar. He saw Wig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>gins and the appellant. When he came down the cellar, \u201cWillie June (appellant) had some rings and earrings and Lee (Cephas) had money and Lee had a pipe against the wall. Willie June handed Wiggins some knucks (brass knuckles).\u201d Lee\u2019s hand was bleeding. \u201cHe wiped his hand on my jacket and left it down the cellar.\u201d He heard the appellant say, \u201cWe got the ladies and you got the stuff and we still get to divide even.\u201d On redirect examination, Vega stated that he was talking to the insurance man \u201cthree or four steps from the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The appellant, testifying in his own behalf, denied participation in the crimes. His testimony was that he was elsewhere when the crimes were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The contention as to the sufficiency of the evidence as presented by the appellant goes only to his criminal agency and not to the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime. His criminal agency was established by the testimony of Cephas and Vega, but it is clear that they were accomplices. The testimony of accomplices is not sufficient to sustain a conviction unless corroborated. <em>Burley v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 469. Not much in the way of corroboration is required; it is not necessary in and of itself that the corroborative evidence be sufficient to convict. <em>Wright v. State, </em>219 Md. 643. However, it must support material facts which tend to show that the accused was either identified with the perpetrators of the crime or had participated in the commission of the crime itself. <em>Boone v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 11, 19-20. Whether testimony of accomplices had in fact been sufficiently corroborated must, of course, depend upon the facts and circumstances and the inferences deducible therefrom in each case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In the instant case it appears that the required corroboration of the testimony of the accomplices can only be from the testimony of Matthews for neither the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>timony of the other witnesses nor other evidence in the case supplied it. The corroboration was supplied by the testimony of Matthews that on the afternoon of 4 October 1966 about 5:00 P.M. he saw the appellant in Buddy Boy\u2019s Pizza Shop with Vega, Cephas and Wiggins. The appellant said he was going \u201cto make a hustle.\u201d Asked how he used the term \u201chustle\u201d, he said, \u201cWhen you are going to get some money.\u201d Asked, \u201cIn what particular way?\u201d, he replied, \u201cRob somebody.\u201d The appellant had brass knuckles. The appellant, Cephas, Vega, Wiggins and Matthews left the shop, which was located at Pennsylvania and Lafayette Avenues, and went up Pennsylvania Avenue towards North Avenue. Matthews left them at Pennsylvania and North Avenues and went home. He saw the appellant again the next day on Brunt Street. Wiggins was with the appellant and they were shooting dice. The appellant said that they had made a hustle and he \u201cthought he got caught.\u201d The stakes in the game were \u201cbills, dollar bills\u201d, and a five dollar bill was by the appellant. On cross-examination he said the appellant was putting the money in the \u201cmiddle.\u201d The testimony that the appellant was in the company of Wiggins, Cephas and Vega shortly before the commission of the crimes and in the company of Wiggins the day after the crimes, in the circumstances, tended to show that the appellant was identified with the perpetrators of the crimes. The following testimony of Matthews corroborated the testimony of the accomplices by tending to show that the appellant had participated in the commission of the crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">1) the appellant\u2019s statement shortly before the commission of the crimes that he was going to make a hustle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">2) the appellant\u2019s statement the day after the crimes that they had made a hustle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">3) the appellant\u2019s statement that he thought he got caught in the light of the accomplices\u2019 testimony of the arrival of the police and the events which then took place and the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>officers\u2019 testimony that when they were at the scene of the crime they heard someone running in the house and gave chase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">4) that the appellant was shooting craps in which the stakes were bills and that he put a $5.00 bill in the \u201cmiddle\u201d in the light of the accomplices\u2019 testimony as to the dividing of the loot, Joseph DiPaula\u2019s testimony as to the money he had given his sister Concettina which was stolen and the appellant\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that he was not working at the time the crimes were committed and that although his mother had given him $30 on 3 October \u2014 \u201cmy mother draw security\u201d \u2014 he had purchased a pair of pants for $29 on that day;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">5) the appellant\u2019s possession of brass knuckles in the light of the nature of the injuries to the victims and Cephas\u2019 testimony that the appellant struck Concettina DiPaula in the face.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We find that the testimony of Matthews corroborated the testimony of the accomplices within the purview of the rule and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The trial court was not obliged to believe the denials or explanations or alibi of the appellant. <em>Fletcher and Smith v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 219. And even if the evidence as to the sodium amytal interviews was improperly admitted in evidence, the appellant received more than that to which he was entitled and was not prejudiced thereby. In any event, the weight to be given such evidence was a matter for the trier of fact. <em>Felder v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 212. The judgments of the trial court on the evidence were not clearly erroneous and we may not set them aside. Md. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">. He was indicted with Alphonso Wiggins for the murder of Rosina DiPaula. Wiggins was tried separately in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, convicted of murder in the first degree at a court trial and sentenced to imprisonment for the balance of his natural life. The judgment was affirmed by this Court on appeal. <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 95.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-9\">. The State apparently had reference to Rule 725(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b389-5\">. Asked by the trial court why he required a court order before proceeding with the interview Dr. Hamilton said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">\u201cThere are several reasons why, and I\u2019ll try to give them in order of priority of importance to me. Number one, the injection of a hypnotic agent or any agent which lessens the level of consciousness in a human being is, as far as I am concerned, a very serious thing and it has been held in various courts in this State and, or course, in various courts in other States, that this represents an unwarranted assault on the body and person of the individual who is injected. I felt that because this was to be done in a State institution rather than under the auspices of my private practice, in order to protect the hospital as well as the staff members who are there, it was essential we receive not only the permission of counsel for the defense and the Defendant, but that we have some Order from the State this be done. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">Secondly, it had been a principle in the institution under my administration all such requests had been denied because it is my belief that there is some doubt as to the test providing the information which is sought by the request for such an examination. Succinctly, I mean by that this: It is assumed by various lay people and by people in various other professions that there is such a thing as a truth serum and it is a procedure whereby this might be administered and the \u2018truth\u2019 be determined. Psychiatrically, I am not familiar with this and I felt it would be something less than presumptuous if I were to undertake such an examination with the purpose of providing such information which I felt could not be provided by such an examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">It was elicited from Dr. Hamilton that he agreed that \u201cevidence obtained by administering a so-called truth telling serum to an accused and then questioning him is inadmissible whether for or against the accused, because of the lack of scientific certainty or dependability of the results.\u201d He said: \u201cThe test is used as an adjunct. It is a psychologically induced hypnotic situation. It enhances the susceptibility * * * There are enumerable dangers in the use of the hypnotic state. I can elaborate as to each, but the principle ones are that in a suggestible individual it is quite difficult to control the flow of unconscious material and we are always concerned with what will happen to an individual who has certain kinds of unconscious material brought to the surface dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ing the questioning in a hypnotic trance.\u201d He agreed that if a person agreed to take the test with certain ideas in mind, it could affect the result of the test. He stated that sodium amytal \u201cis a central nervous system depressant which acts in limited doses as a hypnotic * * *\u25a0 [It] depresses the elements in the central nervous system, neurons, so that they are less susceptible to the controlling inhibitions, influence, the sections which have to do with these controls.\u201d But a person in a hypnotic state can \u201cresist the question\u201d asked him. The court inquired; \u201cDr. Hamilton, based upon your experience as a physician skilled in the practice of psychiatry, can you, with any degree of medical certainty, advance an opinion to the reliability or unreliability, falsity, of statements, which you would obtain by this sodium amytal interview?\u201d Dr. Hamilton answered, \u201cI cannot.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\">, The admissibility of the results of the sodium amytal interview procedure or even the admissibility of evidence as to a defendant\u2019s willingness or reluctance to undergo a psychological truth test is not presented on this appeal.
