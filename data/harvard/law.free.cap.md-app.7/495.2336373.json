Judge James A. Perrott, presiding with a jury, imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. He contends that his motion for judgment of acquittal of murder in the first degree should have been granted; that certain records should have been admitted into evidence; and that the trial judge committed error in his instructions on the law of self-defense and in denying the appellant\u2019s requests concerning the <em>voir dire </em>examination of jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">James Witherspoon, a bar owner, on West Baltimore Street, testified that about 7:30 P.M. on January 12,1968, he was talking to Moore on the sidewalk near his premises and specifically as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>While I was talking to him, George Carroll came out and he walked to his left a few feet where we were standing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">\u201cQ. Let\u2019s stop there. What, if anything, did you see in George Carroll\u2019s hand when he came out of the bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">\u201cA. He didn\u2019t have anything in his hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">\u201cQ. He walked over to where you were standing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u201cQ. Who else was standing there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">\u201cA. Moore and another fellow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\u201cQ. From that point, tell the Jury what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">\u201cA. While we were standing there talking, Carroll came out, so he walked over where we was too. They had started an argument again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">\u201cQ. Who started an argument ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Both of them started an argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">\u201cQ. Byname.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">\u201cA. George Carroll and Mr. Moore started arguing with each other again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">\u201cQ. Know what they were arguing about ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-13\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-14\">\u201cQ. Know who started the argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-15\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-16\">\u201cQ. Continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-17\">\u201cA. I told them \u2018Why don\u2019t you guys be friends and cut this,\u2019 whatever it was, \u2018out.\u2019 You know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-18\">\u201cQ. I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-19\">\u201cA. So then, George Carroll was standing there. I told him, I said \u2018Look, don\u2019t argue with him. Just go on home.\u2019 So, he said \u2018O.K.\u2019 So, George Carroll walked east on Baltimore Street. He turned around, started walking down the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-21\">\u201cQ. George Carroll was walking away?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-22\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-23\">\u201cQ. Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-24\">\u201cA. He had \u2014 just before \u2014 no, he had started walking away. Robert Moore had his hand in his pocket. When George Carroll started walking away, he took his hand out of his pocket, had a pistol in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-25\">\u201cQ. Continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-26\">\u201cA. He said \u2018I\u2019m going to kill him.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-27\">\u201cQ. Who said \u2018I\u2019m going to kill him?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-28\">\u201cA. Moore said he was going to kill George <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Carroll. I saw the pistol. I ran in the door, ran in the doorway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">\u201cQ. Did you go inside the bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">\u201cA. Standing inside, looking out the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">\u201cQ. Looking out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">\u201cA. Yes. After he went past the door with the pistol, we were standing on the step.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">\u201cQ. Did you watch the entire time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">\u201cQ. Tell us what you saw when you watched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\">\u201cA. Moore stopped him in front of the barber shop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-13\">\u201cQ. Stopped who ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-14\">\u201cA. Carroll. Told him T told you I was going to kill you, you s.o.b.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-15\">\u201cQ. What, if anything, did the Defendant have in his hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-16\">\u201cA. He had a pistol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-17\">\u201cQ. At that point, what occurred then, after he had stopped Carroll?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-18\">\u201cA. When he stopped Carroll, after Carroll saw the pistol in his hand, he took a knife, I think it had a brown handle, took a knife out of his pocket, standing there holding it in his hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-19\">\u201cQ. Then what occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-20\">\u201cA. Carroll told him \u2018If that\u2019s what you are going to do, go ahead, do it.\u2019 He got in a crouching position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-21\">\u201cQ. Who is he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-22\">\u201cA. Moore. He was in a crouching position. He shot him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-23\">\u201cQ. Did you actually see him fire the gun ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-24\">\u201cA. Sure, I was looking right at him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-25\">\u201cQ. How many shots did he fire ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-26\">\u201cA. I heard five shots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-27\">\u201cQ. Did Mr. Carroll take the knife out any time before Moore came up with the gun and said \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u201cA. He had walked away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">\u201cQ. You saw the Defendant fire five shots at Mr. Carroll?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">\u201cQ. How far was the Defendant from Carroll when he fired those five shots?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">\u201cA. About, two, two and a half feet in front of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">\u201cQ. How far were you in feet from the Defendant and Mr. Carroll when you saw the Defendant fire those five shots ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">\u201cA. About, maybe seven or eight feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">\u201cQ. After the Defendant fired those five shots at a distance of two or three feet from Mr. Carroll, what, if anything, did you see then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>After he fired the five shots and George Carroll just stood up. He didn\u2019t fall. Robert Moore turned, ran directly across the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">\u201cQ. Let\u2019s stop there. At any time before those five shots were fired by the Defendant at the deceased, did the deceased, George Carroll, in any way make a motion against the Defendant with the knife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-14\">\u201cA. No, because he had his pistol drawn on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-15\">\u201cQ. You just said Moore, the Defendant, ran across the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-16\">\u201cA. Directly across the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-17\">\u201cQ. What, if anything, did Carroll do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-18\">\u201cA. He was in pursuit of Robert Moore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-19\">\u201cQ. Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-20\">\u201cA. When he ran across the street, he caught him, threw him down, and I just saw his hands go up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-21\">\u201cQ. Whose hands?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-22\">\u201cA. George Carroll.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-23\">After Carroll chased Moore across the street, he stabbed him and then took a bottle of whiskey from his pocket, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>drank some of it and then spit upon Carroll. Moore then made some comments, \u201cThere he is.\u201d \u201cEverybody after him and I finally got him.\u201d \u201cYes, I did it and I have been after him a long time and I finally did it.\u201d Some witnesses supported Witherspoon\u2019s testimony, but Moore and other witnesses testified that the killing occurred while Moore was defending himself from an attack. The medical examiner\u2019s testimony showed that Carroll was shot five times, two in the arms, one in the lower abdomen, one through the face and one through the chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">I (Sufficiency of the Evidence)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Moore seems to concede that Witherspoon\u2019s in-court testimony would be sufficient to support a verdict of murder in the first degree under <em>Chisley v. State, </em>202 Md. 87, 95 A. 2d 577 but argues that his testimony is not worthy of belief because a few hours after the crime he gave a report to the police, which in part said as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201cI than made a attempt to stop them from arguing, but Robert Moore wouldn\u2019t listern to me, George stated to me, okay \u2018Spoon\u2019, I\u2019ll lister to you, and George started to walk East on Baltimore Street, where he walked in front of the Barber Shop located at 2591 West Baltimore Street. Robert Moore followed him and at this time Robert Moore, pulled a gun on George, When George walked down the street, he had placed the knife that he had in his hands back into his pocket, But upon Robert Moore pulling the Gun on him, George took the knife that he had placed in his pocket back out, and turned and started towards Robert Moore, at that time Robert Moore started shooting at George, Robert fired five times at George. Robert Moore than turned and started running North across Baltimore Street, towards the North side of the Street, with George running after him. George caught Robert Moore in front of 2566 W. Bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>timore Street and they started fighting. I didn\u2019t go over to look because Robert Moore had a pistol. Both George and Robert Moore fell to the ground, than I saw Robert Moore get up and walk around. Than he drank a bottle of whiskey, which he had and threw the bottle on the ground and stated \u2018Yes, I did it, I\u2019m glad that I did it\u2019. Than after that Robert Moore walked over and spit on George as, he was laying on the ground. By that time the Police came and locked up Robert Moore.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Although Witherspoon\u2019s statement to the police was more favorable to Moore than his in-court testimony, Wither-spoon stated that what he said in court was true and what he told the police was not entirely accurate because he was in a hurry to get home and because they did not ask him specific questions as was done in court. Ignoring the fact that some of the other witnesses tended to support the testimony of Witherspoon, we think that that testimony alone was sufficient to support the verdict. The difference in the statements does not bring the case within the rule of <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334, 201 A. 2d 683 which has no application to out-of-court statements. <em>Alexander v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 214, 218, 242 A. 2d 180. Since it was the trial court\u2019s duty to deny the motion for acquittal if there was any evidence legally sufficient for the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Culver v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 406, 409, 230 A. 2d 361 and since there was some such evidence, we see no error in the action of the trial judge in denying the motion to acquit.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Moore alleges error in the refusal of the trial court to admit into evidence an alleged FBI report showing that the victim had been convicted of manslaughter on December 17, 1955, in Raleigh, North Carolina. Under the prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ciples we discussed in <em>Barger v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 565, 568-69, 235 A. 2d 751, the court admitted Moore\u2019s testimony that he knew of this conviction at the time of the affray. Moore contends, in oral argument, that since <em>Austin v. State, </em>253 Md. 313, 252 A. 2d 797 ruled that relevant police reports are admissible this report should have been admitted to support his testimony. In the instant case, the record was simply offered into evidence without any testimony as to its origin or where it came from, and neither was it authenticated in any other manner. We do not think the Court of Appeals in <em>Austin, supra </em>waived these requirements. More importantly we do not believe that <em>Austin, supra, </em>stands for the general proposition that police reports are admissible in every case but only as stated therein where necessary for \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d to the accused. We do not think it applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Moore contends that the trial judge committed error in \u201climiting his instructions on the law of self-defense.\u201d There was no objection to the instructions as given and the exact instructions requested by Moore are not a part of the record before us, and, therefore, under Maryland Rule 756 Moore has no right to require us to review the instructions. In accordance with the rule, however, we have read the instructions regarding self-defense and do not see any plain error therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Moore requested that his counsel be permitted to examine the jurors on <em>voir dire </em>under Maryland Rule 745 which permits such examinations to be conducted by either the court or the attorney in the discretion of the trial judge. He contends that an examination by counsel is permitted in federal and other state courts and in some courts within the State of Maryland, but we fail to see how this would make the trial judge\u2019s action an abuse of discretion when the rule specifically permits what he did. His contention that counsel\u2019s questions would more read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ily elicit prejudice than the judge\u2019s is a matter, we think, that should be directed towards the rules committee or to the legislature rather than to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Moore further alleges error in the failure of the trial judge to ask, on the <em>voir dire, </em>three questions concerning firearms. He requested that the jurors be asked the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">\u201cDo you intend to turn in any firearms which you now have in your home ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">\u201cDo you harbor any prejudice or ill feeling against anyone who owns or possesses a firearm ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201cHave you written or contacted your Congressman, State Legislator or City Councilman or governmental agency advocating the banning or licensing of firearms ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The trial judge asked the following question only on this subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">\u201cDo you harbor any prejudice against firearms or any prejudice or ill feeling against anyone who owns or possesses firearms? If the answer is yes, will you please rise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">In <em>Borman v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 276, 279, 229 A. 2d 440 and <em>Carder v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 531, 537, 248 A. 2d 495 we reviewed the authorities and stated the purpose of <em>voir dire </em>examinations is to ascertain the existence of cause of disqualification. We think the trial judge\u2019s question was quite adequate for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\">.
