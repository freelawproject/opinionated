Knott was adjudicated a defective delinquent within the meaning of the Maryland Defective Delinquent Act in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, Judge Patrick M. Schnauffer sitting without a jury. Following his commitment to Patuxent Institution, he expressed his desire to file an application for leave to appeal from Judge Schnauffer\u2019s determination, stating in a letter to this court, dated December 29, 1968, that he felt his attorney was incompetent. He alleged that there were \u201ccharges brought up in court that [he] was never convicted of\u201d and that his attorney \u201cwouldn\u2019t say a thing in [his] defense.\u201d Subsequently, his court-appointed counsel filed a supplemental application for leave to appeal, stating therein that applicant\u2019s counsel at the defective delinquency hearing was incompetent for failure to object to the introduction in evidence of \u201ccertain criminal charges and convictions for which he, * * * had never been convicted.\u201d Counsel also urged on applicant\u2019s behalf that the defective delinquency hearing was unfair and improper because the psychiatrist testifying on behalf of the State made reference to applicant\u2019s record of arrests and criminal convictions; and that applicant was being held at Patuxent \u201cbecause of \u00e1 drinking problem,\u201d in violation of his constitutional right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">We see no merit in any of these contentions with the possible exception of that relating to the competency of counsel representing the applicant at his defective delinquency hearing. The applicant is, of course, entitled to competent counsel at such a hearing, <em>viz., </em>to counsel who would afford him genuine and effective representation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Keeling v. Director, </em>5 Md. App. 123. As it appears clear that the record of the proceedings at the defective delinquency hearing will not on its face disclose whether the applicant\u2019s record of arrests and prior convictions was misrepresented by the State, and whether his counsel knowingly refused to make objection thereto, we are not in a position to determine the merits of the applicant\u2019s contention. We, therefore, deny his application for leave to appeal without prejudice to the filing by the applicant of a habeas corpus petition in the appropriate court to determine the question whether, in light of the alleged incompetency of his counsel in the cited particulars, he is being unconstitutionally incarcerated at Patuxent Institution, and should be afforded another hearing to determine whether he is a defective delinquent under Article 31B of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
