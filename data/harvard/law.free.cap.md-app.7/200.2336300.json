Phillips \u201cwith intent then and there the goods and chattels, monies and properties of the said Robert L. Phillips, in the same dwelling house, * * * feloniously to steal, take and carry away * * <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellant was convicted of both offenses by the court sitting without a jury and was sentenced to two consecutive two-year terms under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction. Appellant contends on this appeal that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support his conviction for attempted breaking and entering in that the State failed to prove either the attempt to break or that he had the requisite larcenous intent, as charged in the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">There was evidence adduced at the trial showing that Shirley Phillips, the daughter of Esther and Robert Phillips, had for some time been dating the appellant, who lived around the corner from the Phillipses; that on August 13, 1968, the appellant assaulted Shirley with a hammer, as a result of which a warrant had been obtained on August 15 for his arrest; that on the 15th, appellant was observed by Mrs. Phillips smashing her husband\u2019s car window; that appellant was thereafter observed by Mrs. Phillips on August 16 in a drunken condition on the street, and later that night he phoned her and said \u201cyou had a warrant out for me, didn\u2019t you,\u201d and that \u201cyou are all going to pay for it, you watch and see.\u201d There was also some indication from the evidence that an attempt had been made to set a fire in the cellar of the Phillips\u2019 home and that appellant was suspected by the Phillipses of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Esther Phillips testified that at approximately 1:30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>a.m. on August 17 she was home watching television when she heard a \u201cracking to the door\u201d which \u201cgot worsey and worsey\u201d as she listened. Mrs. Phillips awakened her sleeping husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Mr. Phillips testified that after his wife awakened him he got his pistol and fired from four to seven shots through the closed door; that he \u201chad an idea\u201d at whom he was shooting and upon investigation he observed appellant running from his porch. Phillips testified that there were \u201cmarks\u201d on the door near the latch.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">While both Mr. and Mrs. Phillips testified that they did not hear the doorbell ring, the investigating police officer, William Burch, testified that Mr. Phillips told him that appellant had rung the bell and when no one answered, he applied force to the door by pushing on it, at which time he, Mr. Phillips, fired through the door. Officer Burch further testified that he observed no jimmy marks on the door, and that appellant had called the police for assistance immediately after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Appellant testified that he had known Shirley Phillips for <em>81/2 </em>months prior to August 17; that when he heard about the outstanding warrant for his arrest, he went to the Phillips\u2019 home about 1:00 a.m. and rang the bell, after which he sat on the side of the porch waiting for a reply; and that the shots grazed his chest sideways as he sat on the floor of the porch. He testified that his purpose in going to the Phillips\u2019 home was to come to some agreement about a fire in the Phillips\u2019 cellar and to tell Mr. and Mrs. Phillips that he would not see their daughter any more if they wouldn\u2019t press the warrant. Appellant testified that he did not realize it was so late when he went to the Phillips\u2019 home \u2014 that he was on his way home when he stopped there, the Phillips\u2019 home being just around the corner from his own home.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">In finding appellant guilty, the court found as a fact that appellant had rung the doorbell of the Phillips\u2019 home; that he didn\u2019t try to jimmy the door; but that he did push on it against the lock. The court found from the evidence that appellant was very angry at Mr. and Mrs. Phillips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and their daughter Shirley; that he had smashed the window of the Phillips\u2019 car, assaulted Shirley, and threatened Mrs. Phillips. From these facts and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, the court concluded that appellant attempted to break into the Phillips\u2019 home. The court further stated that it disbelieved appellant\u2019s explanation for stopping at the Phillips\u2019 home, and found as a fact that appellant harbored a \u201cdefinite spirit of vengefulness\u201d against the Phillips\u2019 family and \u201cthat he was trying to break in at 1 o\u2019clock in the morning to gain some revenge or satisfaction from having been turned down by the young lady.\u201d The court made no finding, one way or the other, on the question of whether appellant entertained a larcenous intent when attempting to gain entry to the Phillips\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">As heretofore indicated, it appears clear from the record that appellant was charged with an attempt to commit the statutory offense proscribed by Maryland Code, Article 27, Section 30(a), <em>viz., </em>an attempt to break and enter a dwelling house <em>with the intent to steal goods of any value therefrom. </em>An attempt to commit a crime consists of an intention to commit it, the performance of some act towards its commission and the failure to consummate the offense. <em>Boone v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 80. It was thus essential for the State to show that appellant attempted to break and enter the Phillips\u2019 home with a larcenous intent. While there was direct evidence that appellant pushed on the door, from which it might be inferred that he attempted to break into the Phillips\u2019 home, there was no direct evidence that appellant\u2019s intent in attempting to enter the house was to commit a larceny on the premises. Of course, finding the requisite intent to steal is never a precise process, for intention is subjective and it must therefore be inferred from the circumstances of the case, if it is found at all. <em>Yopps v. State, </em>234 Md. 216, 220; <em>Irving v. State, </em>230 Md. 364; <em>Radcliffe v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 285; <em>Johnson v. State, 5 </em>Md. App. 540. While the State need not prove the larcenous intent by direct evidence, it has been held that there must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>be proof of some fact or circumstance or act or declaration of the accused in addition to the proof of the mere breaking and entry or, as here, the attempt to break and enter, from which the trier of fact can find the requisite intent; but the trier of fact can only draw reasonable inferences in an effort to discover the intent of the intruder. See <em>Felkner v. State, </em>218 Md. 300, 307-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In view of the fact that the trial judge believed that appellant rang the doorbell of the Phillips\u2019 home before pushing on the door and also believed the testimony of the police officer that there were no jimmy marks on the door, we think he was clearly erroneous in concluding that appellant\u2019s intention was to steal from the Phillips\u2019 home, particularly since he found as a fact that appellant\u2019s purpose in attempting entry was \u201cto gain some revenge or satisfaction from having been turned down by the young lady.\u201d In so concluding, we need not decide whether the evidence better supports the inference that appellant\u2019s intent in attempting to enter the Phillips\u2019 home was to physically harm the members of the Phillips\u2019 family, or their property. We simply hold that on the record before us, there was no evidence legally sufficient, or rational inferences drawable therefrom, from which the trier of fact could properly conclude that appellant attempted entry into the Phillips\u2019 home with the intent to steal goods therefrom of any value.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\">.
