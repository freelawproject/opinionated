Miller, Jr., </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-9\"><em>William E. Brannan, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, Arthur A. Marshall, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>and <em>Vincent J. Femia, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b238-10\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">In this appeal the sole question is whether there was evidence legally sufficient to sustain the appellant\u2019s conviction in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County of storehouse breaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">According to the owner of an establishment known as Sandy\u2019s Liquors, he closed the store about midnight on March 14, 1968; the alarm system in the building was actuated about 1:00 a.m.; and upon returning to the store, at the request of the police, he observed that cinder blocks had been \u201cknocked out\u201d of the rear wall of the building creating a hole \u201clarge enough for a person to get through.\u201d He testified that the hole led into a storeroom containing liquors, wines and beer having a value in excess of one hundred ($100) dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">Another witness testified that he was sitting with a companion in their parked car eating a sandwich, after having worked until midnight, when he observed three men get out of a car parked in front of them and proceed \u201ctoward the back of Sandy\u2019s Liquor Store.\u201d Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ing to the witness, \u201cthey stayed approximately ten minutes, and then came back to the car and [got] into the car and drove off.\u201d Shortly thereafter, \u201cthe same car came back from around the corner <em>* </em>* * from the opposite direction from the way he went, and parked behind us.\u201d The witness stated that two men then left the car and \u201cwent across a field this time\u201d toward the rear of the liquor store \u201cand one stayed in the car.\u201d Approximately six or seven minutes later \u201cthe burglar alarm went off\u201d and \u201cwhen the burglar alarm went off * * * the horn blew on the car, one person ran from across the field and got into the car. And at this point the car started up and pulled off around us and turned the corner.\u201d The witness and his companion thereupon noted the license number, make and color of the car which they gave to police officers who responded to the sounding of the burglar alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">A detective on the Prince George\u2019s County Police Force testified that he was cruising in the area when he received on his police car radio the alert that the burglar alarm at Sandy\u2019s Liquors was sounding and a description of a car which was leaving the vicinity of the liquor store. He immediately proceeded some three blocks to Sandy\u2019s Liquors, there heard the alarm sounding and observed a car fitting the description pull from the curb about twenty-five feet from the liquor store. He stopped the car which was being driven by the appellant, accompanied by his seventeen-year-old nephew, and took them back to the liquor store. There he observed \u201ca hole approximately two cinder blocks high and three cinder blocks wide knocked completely through\u201d and the cinder blocks which had filled the hole were \u201cinside on the floor, and also over top the cases of beer and whiskey that was inside of the establishment.\u201d He thereupon arrested the appellant and his companion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The appellant testified that he and his nephew went to the area to purchase cigarettes and beer at another store; that he parked his car within one hundred feet of Sandy\u2019s Liquors; that he went behind Sandy\u2019s Liquors to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>urinate; that he was sitting in his car when the burglar alarm sounded and, because he had a previous criminal record, thought he should leave immediately. He denied any participation in the crime but admitted that he had been previously convicted of breaking and entering and assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">It is first contended that the evidence produced by the State simply shows that the appellant was in the general area of Sandy\u2019s Liquors and this, in law, is insufficient to sustain his conviction. While it is true \u201cthat the mere presence of a person at the scene of a crime is not, <em>of itself, </em>sufficient to establish that that person was either a principal or an accessory to the crime,\u201d <em>Tasco v. State, </em>223 Md. 503, 509, it is an important element in determining an accused\u2019s guilt. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>227 Md. 159, <em>163; Shifflett v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 550, 553. In the case at bar, however, contrary to the appellant\u2019s assertion, we have more than the appellant\u2019s mere presence at the scene of the crime. Here the evidence shows that the appellant was driving a ear which just prior to his apprehension was seen twice circling the liquor store; the car then stopped, three men alighted and went to the rear of the store where they stayed approximately ten minutes; the men then left the area in the car, only to return and park; and two of the three men returned to the rear of the store. When the burglar alarm sounded minutes later, the driver of the car gave a horn signal and one of the men ran back to the car, which then departed. The car, when stopped as it was leaving the area, was being driven by the appellant. The owner had testified that there was no hole in the rear of his building when he closed the store at midnight and it was there when he returned shortly after 1:00 a.m. On this evidence, we cannot say that the trial judge was clearly erroneous in finding the appellant to be one of the criminal agents. Md. Rule 1086. The lower court was not required to believe the appellant\u2019s assigned reason for his presence at the rear of the store or his flight from the scene when the burglar alarm sounded. <em>Jones v. State, </em>5 Md. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>180; <em>Chavis v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 179. The Court of Appeals and this Court have consistently held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">\u201cThe trier of facts in a criminal case is enjoined by law to give due force to the presumption of innocence, and then to proceed cautiously in weighing the evidence; but he is not commanded to be naive and to believe without scrutiny every glib suggestion or far-fetched fairy tale whether emanating from State or defense. An indispensable ingredient in judgment, in court as well as out of it, is a modicum of common sense. <em>Berry v. State, </em>202 Md. 62, 67.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0J\">\u201cTo prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt it is not necessary that every conceivable miraculous coincidence consistent with innocence be negatived.\u201d <em>Hayette v. State, </em>199 Md. 140, 144.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">See also, <em>Tasco v. State, supra; Pettis v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">It is also contended that \u201cthere was no proof of the appellant\u2019s \u2018entry\u2019 shown in the attempt to prove the appellant\u2019s guilt of storehouse breaking; that under the common law, burglary is the breaking and entering of the dwelling house of another, in the nighttime, with the intent to commit a felony\u201d; and that this concept of breaking, as well as entering, has been carried into the statutory crime of burglary by the Maryland General Assembly in enacting Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 30 (a). While we are of the opinion that it could reasonably be inferred that there was an entry into the store, since the cinder blocks had been pushed into the storeroom of the building and the resulting debris was strewn over the cases of liquor stored therein, it must be borne in mind that the appellant was not convicted of common law burglary or statutory burglary as defined in \u00a7 30 (a). He was convicted of violating Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 32, and that statute is explicit that whoever \u201cshall be convicted of the crime of breaking a storehouse * * * in the day or night * * * with intent to steal * * * goods of another of the value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more therefrom, shall be guilty of a felony * <em>* </em>No reference is made anywhere in the statute to \u201centering\u201d or \u201centry\u201d. This statute was originally enacted in 1809 and at that time only a \u201cbreaking\u201d was required; the added ingredient of \u201centering\u201d was omitted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute has been amended many times since its original enactment but on each occasion the Legislature has failed to include the additional requirement of \u201centry\u201d. The appellant concedes that the \u201centry\u201d requirement is not expressly included in the statute but he argues that \u201cthere have been hundreds of cases which refer to this statute as the breaking and entering statute and seem to take for granted that \u2018entry\u2019 is an element of the crime of \u2018storehouse breaking\u2019 \u201d; and that the failure of the Legislature to amend the statute by including the specific requirement of entry \u201camounts to Legislative approval and ratification of the construction placed upon the statute by the Courts * * We find this argument to be unpersuasive for we are not aware of any reported court decision in this State that has construed \u00a7 32 as requiring an \u201centry.\u201d The appellant misreads our opinion in <em>O\u2019Brien v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 94, when he argues that this Court, by implication, held that an entry is required to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 32. It is true that in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>it was argued that \u00a7 32 requires an entry but we found it unnecessary to reach this contention since there was \u201csufficient evidence to convince the lower court that the appellant not only broke but also partly entered the building * *</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The general rule governing statutory interpretation was stated in <em>League v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 681, as follows (p. 687) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cIn determining the meaning and scope of a legislative enactment, the Court considers the language thereof in its natural and ordinary connotation. If there be no obscurity or ambiguity on the face of it, there is no necessity for construction, and the language will be accorded its apparent meaning. <em>Pressman v. Barnes, </em>209 Md. 544.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Within this principle, we think it is abundantly clear that \u00a7 32 literally contains no \u201centry\u201d requirement and that this omission was not an oversight on the part of the General Assembly but a studied and deliberate deletion. To adopt the construction sought by the appellant, this Court would be compelled to invade the legislative process by inserting an ingredient or element into the statute which is not there and, in our opinion, was never intended by the General Assembly to be there. This is a function we are without authority to perform. Art. 8, Md. Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-5\">. Sec. 5, Ch. 138 of the Laws of 1809, provided, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">\u201cEvery person, his or her aiders, abettors and counsellors, who shall be duly convicted of the crime of * * * breaking a storehouse, warehouse or other out-house, in the day or night, with an intent to commit murder or felony therein, shall be sentenced to confinement in the said penitentiary-house for a period of tim\u00e9 not less than two nor more than ten years, to be dealt with according . to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The \u201centry\u201d requirement has, likewise, been omitted from Secs. 30 (b) and 342 of Md. Code, Art. 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
