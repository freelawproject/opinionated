Ejectment was brought under the statutory form for the land described in the deed by the son and sole heir of Mrs. Doty against Mrs. Charles S. Pickett, who held under her husband, Charles S., named as a co-grantee in the deed. The son and heir of Mrs. Doty, sued as remainderman under the deed, the three children of Mrs. Ann Pickett having died, leaving no issue at the time of their respective deaths ; and the defendant claimed under the deed of her husband to Hiram Roberts, as trustee for her and her children. Those children died in infancy, and thus she became sole beneficiary under the deed. Pending the suit, Doty, the plaintiff, and Mrs. Charles S. Pickett, the defendant, both died, and the action proceeded in the names of their res<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>pective administrators. When Charles S. Pickett became of age there was no division of the lands under the deed of Mrs. Elon, but the other children were dead, or he had bought their interest in the estate. He came to his mn jority in 1834, and executed the deed to Roberts in trust for his wife in 1848 ; and surviving one of his sisters win, died leaving no issue, died himself without issue, in 1857 \u2014the other sister died in 1862, also without issue \u2014 Mrs. Ann Pickett herself died in 1845, leaving Charles S. and one daughter surviving her. So that the question is, did Charles S. Pickett take under this deed a vested remainder in fee when he attained his majority? and when he bought the interest of his sister, and survived his mother, was the whole estate his? If this beso, he conveyed it to Roberts in trust for his wife, and her administrator will hold the land; if the remainder did not then vest in him, but he took only an estate for life, unless he left issue, with contingent remainder over to the other offspring of Ann Elon, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover as such contingent remainderman. Leaving out the last clause of the deed, which is the only clause in it which makes any mention of or allusion to the other children of Ann Elon, the grantor, it would be beyond cavil that he took the absolute title ; and it is conceded by the plaintiff in error to be so. Does that clause alter it ? We think not, for by its very words, if Ann Pickett, Ann Crane, Mary Pickett or Charles S. Pickett left lawful issue, there was to be no reversion and remainder over to Ann Elon\u2019s other children, and at the death of Ann Pickett, which was in 1845, she had issue living, to-wit: Charles S. and Ann Crane.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">But independently of this construction of the plain language of the last clauses of the deed, we think that the last clause has reference to the time when Charles S. attained his majority, and when the estate was to be divided. It was put in the hands of trustees until that time ; Ann Pickett was to hold it in trust until that time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>if she lived so long, and in the event of her death, then it was to be held by such trustees or executors or administrators as she might leave. She was to enjoy the whole of it during her life, and for that use she held the title, but at her death, to preserve the estate until the time for division, her executors, etc., were to hold the title, that is, keep the estate together until Charles S. attained majority, then it was to be divided, the use for life being in the mother still to all of it, but the remainder then to vest in the survivors of the three children. But if they were all <em>then </em>dead, the remainder was to vest in the surviving children of Ann Elon, the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In other words, whilst it cannot be denied that there is confusion in the words, and doubt about the true construction of this deed, we hold that the grantor conveyed a life estate to Ann Pickett with remainder to those of her three children named in the deed who should be in life when Charles S. attained his majority, and if none then should be in life, then over to the other children of the grantor, share and share alike; that the estate in remainder vested in Ann Crane and Charles S., who were alive when the time for division came; and when Charles S. bought the interest of his sister, Ann Crane, the entire remainder became his, and his deed to Roberts, in trust for his wife, passed it to her. So, the ruling of the court below is right, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
