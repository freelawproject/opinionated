Bypassing Baltimore County, where he lives and where the automobile accident that is the subject of this lawsuit occurred, appellant brought a negligence action in Prince George\u2019s County. Although no rationale was offered by appellant for his choice of forum, his selection suggests that, while home may be where the heart is, it is not necessarily where the largest recovery lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Because Prince George\u2019s County has virtually no connection with this matter, the Prince George\u2019s County circuit court promptly granted appellees\u2019 request to transfer the case to Baltimore County, which does. Insisting that, in doing so, the circuit court abused its discretion, appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">The material facts are not in dispute. In an Agreed Statement of Essential Facts filed in this Court pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-207(b) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, the parties stated that on October 11, 2001, an automobile, owned by appellee David Morris and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>operated by appellee Rachel Morris, struck the rear of appellant\u2019s vehicle on a local road in Baltimore County. As noted, the appellees are residents of Felton, Pennsylvania, and appellant is a resident of Baltimore County, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Alleging that the accident would not have occurred but for the negligence of the Morrises, appellant filed an action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to recover damages for injuries he sustained in the accident. Contesting appellant\u2019s choice of forum, the Morrises filed a motion, under Maryland Rule 2-327(c), to transfer venue to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On August 25, 2004, the circuit court granted that motion and ordered the transfer of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The following day, on August 26, 2004, appellant filed a motion to reconsider the order transferring venue. On September 8, 2004, that motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">\u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s decision to transfer a case to another venue, pursuant to [Maryland] Rule 2-327(c), under an abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u201d <em>Cobrand v. Adventist Healthcare, Inc., </em>149 Md.App. 431, 437, 816 A.2d 117 (2003). \u201cAn abuse of discretion is said to occur where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court, or when the court acts without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cAccordingly, when reviewing a motion to transfer, a reviewing court should be reluctant to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Appellant contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in transferring venue from Prince George\u2019s County, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>where the appellant filed suit, to Baltimore County, where both the appellant resides and the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">At first blush, appellant\u2019s claim appears to have some merit to it. After all, under Maryland Code (1974, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7 6-202(11) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d), an \u201c[a]ction for damages against a non-resident individual\u201d may be brought in \u201c[a]ny county in the State\u201d. Appellant is therefore correct in asserting that venue, in this case, lay in any county in Maryland, including Prince Georges\u2019s County. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, CJP \u00a7\u00a7 6-201 through 6-203. And his choice to file suit in Prince George\u2019s County, we concede, was a lawful exercise of his statutorily-sanctioned prerogative to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">But while CJP \u00a7 6-202(11) grants appellant the right to file an action in whatever county he chooses, it does not prohibit the transfer of that action, if justice and the convenience of the parties and their witnesses so requires. In fact, Maryland Rule 2-327(c) provides that, \u201c[o]n motion of any party, the court may transfer any action to any other circuit court where the action might have been brought if the transfer is for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and serves the interests of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\"> In deciding whether to grant such a motion, the court is vested with \u201c \u2018wide discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leung v. Nunes, </em>354 Md. 217, 223-224, 729 A.2d 956 <em>(1999)(quoting Odenton Dev. Co. v. Lamy, </em>320 Md. 33, 40, 575 A.2d 1235 (1990)). But that discretion is not without limits. \u201cA motion to transfer should be granted only when the balance weighs strongly in favor of the moving party.\u201d <em>Leung, </em>354 Md. at 224, 729 A.2d 956 (citations omitted). And, in making that determination, a court should consider \u201cthe convenience of the witnesses and those public-interest factors of systemic integrity and fairness that, in addition to private concerns, come under the heading of \u2018the interest of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Just how we are to apply this standard requires that we pause briefly to review the genealogy of Rule 2-327(c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201cSection (c) of Md. Rule 2-327 was derived from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).\u201d <em>Odenton, </em>320 Md. at 40, 575 A.2d 1235; <em>see also </em>Paul V. Niemeyer and Linda M. Schuett, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>at 236 (3rd ed. <em>2003^Maryland Rules Commentary </em>\u201d). That federal statute provides: \u201cFor the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\u201d Indeed, our current \u201crespect for the plaintiffs choice of forum is derived largely from federal law developed under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).\u201d <em>Leung, </em>354 Md. at 224, 729 A.2d 956. \u201cConsequently the federal law in construing \u00a7 1404(a) is highly persuasive\u201d when we review, as we do here, a circuit court ruling based on Md. Rule 2~327(c). <em>Odenton, </em>320 Md. at 40, 575 A.2d 1235. In fact, federal and Maryland law, on this point, can almost be viewed as one body of law. <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>at 236 (\u201c[Rule 2-327(c)] is derived from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) and is intended to incorporate the body of law construing that statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In deciding a motion to transfer, we, as do the federal courts, consider two overarching factors: \u201cconvenience\u201d and \u201cthe interests of justice\u201d. <em>See Cobrand, </em>149 Md.App. at 438, 816 A.2d 117. \u201c[T]he \u2018convenience\u2019 factor requires a court to review the convenience of the parties and the witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438 n. 5, 816 A.2d 117. \u201cThe \u2018interests of justice\u2019 factor requires a court to weigh both the private and public interests; the public interests being composed of \u2018systemic integrity and fairness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. (citing Odenton, </em>320 Md. at 40, 575 A.2d 1235).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Private interests include \u201c[t]he relative ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses; possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate to the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive.\u201d <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. 501, 508, 67 S.Ct. 839, 91 L.Ed. 1055 (1947); <em>see also Johnson v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co., </em>314 Md. 521, 526, 552 A.2d 29 (1989). On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>other hand, public interests include, among other things, considerations of court congestion, the burdens of jury duty, and local interest in the matter. <em>Johnson, </em>314 Md. at 526, 552 A.2d 29 (quoting <em>Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. at 508-509, 67 S.Ct. 839). \u201cJury duty,\u201d the Court of Appeals has stressed, \u201cis a burden that ought not to be imposed upon the people of a community which has no relation to the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, as for \u201clocal interest,\u201d that Court has observed, \u201c[tjhere is a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Although ordinarily a \u201cproper regard for the plaintiffs choice of forum\u201d should be given, <em>Leung, </em>354 Md. at 224, 729 A.2d 956, \u201cless deference\u201d should be accorded that choice when the plaintiff is not a resident of the forum he chooses. <em>Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, </em>454 U.S. 235, 255-56, 102 S.Ct. 252, 70 L.Ed.2d 419 (1981)(\u201cBecause the central purpose of <em>any forum non conveniens </em>inquiry is to ensure that the trial is convenient, a foreign plaintiffs choice deserves less deference.\u201d) And such \u201cdeference is further mitigated if a plaintiffs choice of forum has no meaningful ties to the controversy and no particular interest in the parties or subject matter.\u201d <em>Liban v. Churchey Group II, L.L.C., </em>305 F.Supp.2d 136, 142 (D.D.C.2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We therefore conclude that, because appellant is a resident of the transferee jurisdiction, Baltimore County, his choice of Prince George\u2019s County, which \u201chas no meaningful ties to the controversy and no particular interest in the parties or subject matter,\u201d is entitled to little deference and thus little weight when the factors for and against transfer are weighed. Offsetting whatever minimal weight is attributable to appellant\u2019s choice, under the circumstances of this case, is the fact that, in addition to being appellant\u2019s residence, Baltimore County is the place where the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Attempting to minimize the weight that should be accorded that factor, appellant invokes <em>Leung v. Nunes, </em>354 Md. 217, 729 A.2d 956 (1999). Relying on <em>Leung, </em>appellant argues that considerations such as his place of residence and the site of the accident do not outweigh his choice of forum. That choice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>applies, in his view, a judicial thumb to the scales, tipping it in his favor, or at least producing an \u201cequipoise\u201d, which according to <em>Leung, </em>is all that is needed for the plaintiff to prevail. <em>Id. </em>at 229, 729 A.2d 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In <em>Leung, </em>three automobiles containing, respectively, residents of New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and Virginia were involved in an automobile accident in Howard County, \u201cin the northbound lanes of Interstate 95.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220, 729 A.2d 956. The occupants of one of the vehicles were the plaintiffs: Mr. and Mrs. Nunes and their children, all of whom were residents of New Jersey. The occupants of the other two vehicles were the defendants: Ms. Leung, a resident of a Washington, D.C., and Mr. Commock, a resident of Virginia. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 729 A.2d 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The Nuneses filed a negligence action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Leung and Commock and three corporate defendants that allegedly owned Commock\u2019s car. Prior to trial, the circuit court granted Leung\u2019s motion to transfer the case to Howard County, where the accident had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 220-221, 729 A.2d 956. Following a jury verdict in favor of all defendants, the Nuneses appealed, claiming, among other things, that the circuit court had abused its discretion in granting the transfer motion. <em>Id. </em>at 222-223, 729 A.2d 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The Court of Appeals agreed. After restating the principle that \u201ca motion to transfer from the forum chosen by the plaintiff should be granted only when the balance weighs strongly in favor of the moving party,\u201d the Court observed that decisions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) \u201creflect the rather general opinion that a transfer is not sustainable solely on the ground that the transfer requested is to the place where the claim arose.\u201d <em>Leung, </em>354 Md. at 226, 729 A.2d 956. That factor alone, the Court opined, did not \u201cweigh strongly\u201d in favor of transfer. Pointing out that \u201cthe only relevant contact that [Leung and the other defendants] ha[d] with Howard County is that they happened to have been passing through that county on an interstate highway when the accident oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>curred,\u201d the Court declared that the Nuneses, as \u201cthe proponents of transfer,\u201d had \u201cfailed to meet the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225-226, 229, 729 A.2d 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In contrast to <em>Leung, </em>the parties to this action did not happen to collide on an interstate highway as they were passing through Baltimore County. The accident occurred on a local road in the county in which appellant resides. It is reasonable to assume that any witnesses to the accident or its aftermath either work or live in Baltimore County and that any medical treatment appellant received following the accident was rendered in that county<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. <em>See Grubs v. Consolidated Freightways, Inc., </em>189 F.Supp. 404, 410 (D.C.Mont.1960)(Although \u201cthe convenience of an expert witness is entitled to little consideration ... [t]he residence and availability of the physicians who treated plaintiff are factors to be considered, particularly ... where a crucial issue for determination must necessarily evolve about the degree and character of the injury sustained.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Although not raised by the Morrises or considered by the court below, we note that Towson, Baltimore County, is geographically more convenient for both parties and their potential witnesses. Appellant, as we have heretofore noted, lives in Baltimore County, and the distance the Morrises would have to travel from Felton, Pennsylvania to Towson is half the distance they would have to travel if the case had remained in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County in Upper Marlboro.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Moreover, as noted earlier, \u201c[j]ury duty is a burden that ought not to be imposed upon the people of a community which has no relation to the litigation.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>314 Md. at 526, 552 A.2d 29 (quoting <em>Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. at 508-509, 67 S.Ct. 839). Furthermore, \u201c[t]here is a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In short, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>people of Baltimore County have a direct interest in what occurs on Baltimore County roads; the people of Prince George\u2019s County do not. Given the substantial contacts weighing in favor of Baltimore County and the absence of all but one factor weighing in favor of Prince George\u2019s County, the circuit court\u2019s decision to transfer this case to Baltimore County did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">ORDER AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-13\">.
