The statute that prohibits and penalizes the causation of a life-threatening injury by motor vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol is unconstitutionally vague.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">II. Even if the statute is not unconstitutionally vague, the trial court erred by applying an incorrect standard in determining that the injuries in question were life-threatening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>III. The evidence was insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the injuries in question were life-threatening.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Finding no merit in any of these arguments, we shall affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Todd\u2019s convictions stem from a two-car accident that occurred in Wicomico County on the early evening of August 3, 2001. Todd does not now dispute that the car he was driving crossed the center line and collided head-on with a car that was being driven by James Vance and in which Vance\u2019s three children were riding. Nor does Todd dispute that he was intoxicated at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The State presented evidence that Vance and all three of his children suffered injuries. The most seriously injured was 12-year old Sarah Vance, who had been riding in the back seat, on the passenger side.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Immediately after the crash, James Vance turned to check on his children and saw that Sarah had <em>\u201ca </em>big hole in her head.\u201d Wallace Bennett, an emergency medical technician who was driving behind Vance and saw the accident occur, testified that he stopped to help. Bennett told the court that Sarah was his \u201cpriority patient\u201d because \u201cshe was in and out of consciousness, she had a cut on her forehead that was pretty well deep around, her eyes were turning black and blue.\u201d Another witness, Jack Bozek, was standing by the side of the road and witnessed the crash. Bozek approached the vehicles to try to help. He noticed that Sarah\u2019s \u201chead was all split wide open\u201d and he \u201cthought she was dead.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Trooper George Noonan of the Maryland State Police arrived on the scene within minutes of the accident. He testified that, because \u201call of the injuries ... seemed to be life threatening at the time,\u201d his first priority was \u201cto make sure they get them to the hospital.\u201d More emergency medical personnel arrived, and the Vances as well as Todd were then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>taken to Peninsula Regional Medical Center (\u201cPeninsula\u201d) in Salisbury.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Kathy Vance, the wife of James Vance and mother of the three injured children, met her family at Peninsula. As to Sarah\u2019s condition, Mrs. Vance testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">Well, when I first got there I didn\u2019t even know her.... She was, had a cut from ear to ear across the top of her head, and she was bleeding pretty badly. She was, her face was swollen so much that it was almost black, and her eyes were swollen shut. She had a lot of blood on her face. They were working on her trying to get a breathing tube down her throat to stabilize her so they could take her to surgery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">She was unconscious. She didn\u2019t know anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Mrs. Vance then explained that the physicians at Peninsula \u201ccouldn\u2019t stabilize\u201d Sarah, and because Sarah had bleeding on her brain they \u201chad no choice but to ... take her to surgery right away.... \u201d Mrs. Vance testified that, after the physicians at Peninsula operated, \u201cthey did not close the wound, they just pulled the skin up over the wound and put a bandage on her and left her like that.\u201d The next day, after Sarah\u2019s condition was sufficiently stabilized, \u201cshe was flown to Johns Hopkins where they were waiting for her to take her into surgery.\u201d At Johns Hopkins Hospital (\u201cHopkins\u201d), \u201cthey pulled [the] skin back and operated on her head more for the bleed on the brain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Mrs. Vance testified that Sarah \u201cwas taken to the ICU\u201d immediately after the surgery at Hopkins, and then \u201cwas taken to ... a step-down unit for several days.\u201d She added that since then Sarah has undergone several additional surgeries to repair portions of her face that were \u201ccompletely crushed\u201d in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Sarah\u2019s medical records from both Peninsula and Hopkins were admitted into evidence. The emergency room physician at Peninsula who treated Sarah upon her arrival wrote in his report: \u201cTHIS IS A 12-YEAR-OLD WITH SEVERE CRANIAL INJURY, EPIDURAL BLEED, WHO NEED[S] EM<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ERGENT CRANIOTOMY.\u201d He added, \u201cOnce she is stable from a neurosurgical standpoint, she will be transferred to a specialty center for attention to her orbital fracture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Todd was found guilty of, <em>inter alia, </em>violating former Md. Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 388B(b) and (c) of Art. 27 in connection with Sarah Vance\u2019s injuries. The statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">(b) Driving while intoxicated. \u2014 A person who causes a life[-]threatening injury to another as a result of the person\u2019s negligent driving, operation, or control of a motor vehicle or vessel while intoxicated or intoxicated per se is guilty of a misdemeanor to be known as \u201clife[-]threatening injury by motor vehicle or vessel while intoxicated or intoxicated per se,\u201d and on conviction the person shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 3 years or a fine of not more than $5,000 or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">(c) <em>Driving while under the influence of alcohol. </em>\u2014 A person who causes a life[-]threatening injury to another as a result of the person\u2019s negligent driving, operation, or control of a motor vehicle or vessel while under the influence of alcohol is guilty of a misdemeanor to be know as \u201clifer-]threatening injury by motor vehicle or vessel while under the influence of alcohol,\u201d and on conviction the person shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 2 years or a fine of not more than $3,000 or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Section 388B became effective on October 1, 1996. <em>See </em>1996 Laws of Maryland, Chapter 427. Todd points out that, prior to the enactment of that statute, there was some discussion among legislators concerning whether the term \u201clife-threatening injury\u201d should be defined and, if so, how it should be defined. <em>See </em>bill files for Senate Bill 277 (1996) and House Bill 32 (1996). At least one lawmaker urged that the term be defined as \u201can injury that creates an immediate and substantial risk of death.\u201d <em>See </em>bill file for Senate Bill 277 (1996). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The 1996 General Assembly ultimately decided not to define the term, however.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Todd argues that the legislature\u2019s failure to include a definition of \u201clife-threatening injury\u201d in the statute left the term \u201cimpermissibly ambiguous because reasonable people can and do reach widely divergent conclusions on what it means.\u201d He therefore concludes that the statute is void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u201cThe void-for-vagueness doctrine as applied to the analysis of penal statutes requires that the statute be \u2018sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 614, 781 A.2d 851 (2001) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 990, 122 S.Ct. 1547, 152 L.Ed.2d 472 (2002). As the Court of Appeals has summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">In determining the constitutionality of statutes, \u201c[t]he basic rule is that there is a presumption\u201d that the statute is valid.... We are reluctant to find a statute unconstitutional if, \u201cby any construction, it can be sustained.\u201d ... If, however, a statute violates a \u201cmandatory provision\u201d of the Constitution, \u201cwe are required to declare such an act unconstitutional and void.\u201d ... Therefore, if it is established that a statute is vague \u2014 offends due process \u2014 and/or over-broad \u2014 sweeps within the ambit of constitutionally \u201cprotect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>ed expressive or associational rights\u201d \u2014 then the statute is unconstitutional. The party attacking the statute has the burden of establishing its unconstitutionality....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 610-11, 781 A.2d 851 (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201c[W]hen considering the void-for-vagueness doctrine, courts consistently consider two criteria or rationales. The first rationale is the fair notice principle that \u2018persons of ordinary intelligence and experience be afforded a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that they may govern their behavior accordingly.\u2019 The standard for determining whether a statute provides fair notice is \u2018whether persons \u201cof common intelligence must necessarily guess at [the statute\u2019s] meaning.\u201d \u2019 A statute is not vague under the fair notice principle if the meaning \u2018of the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises or even the words themselves, if they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 615, 781 A.2d 851 (citations omitted) (emphasis omitted). <em>See also Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 459, 569 A.2d 604 (1990) (\u201cA law is not vague simply because it requires conformity to an imprecise normative standard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u201cThe second criterion of the vagueness doctrine regards enforcement of the statute. This rationale exists \u2018to ensure that criminal statutes provide \u201clegally fixed standards and adequate guidelines for police, judicial officers, triers of fact and others whose obligations it is to enforce, apply and administer the penal laws.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 615-16, 781 A.2d 851 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">[A] statute is not unconstitutionally vague</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">\u201cmerely because it allows for the exercise of some discretion on the part of law enforcement and judicial officials. It is only where a statute is so broad as to be susceptible to irrational and selective patterns of enforcement that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>will be held unconstitutional under this second arm of the vagueness principle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 616, 781 A.2d 851 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, the application of the void-for-vagueness doctrine is based on the application of the statute to the \u2018facts at hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201c[T]he vagueness doctrine is designed to balance the need for criminal statutes \u2018 \u201cgeneral enough to take into account a variety of human conduct and sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that certain kinds of conduct are prohibited.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>McKenzie v. State, </em>131 Md.App. 124, 137, 748 A.2d 67 (2000) (citations omitted). Upon interpreting the \u201cfacts at hand,\u201d the Court of Appeals rejected vagueness challenges in: <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 608, 781 A.2d 851 upholding former Md.Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol., 2000 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 123(c) of Art. 27 (now Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 3-803(a)(l) of the Criminal Law Article (C.L.)), which prohibited a person from \u201cfollowing] another person in or about a public place or maliciously engaging] in a course of conduct that alarms or <em>seriously </em>annoys another person ... [w]ith intent to harass, alarm, or annoy the other person\u201d; <em>Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 8, 616 A.2d 1275 (1992) (upholding former Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 286(g) of Art. 27 (now Md.Code (2002), C.L. \u00a7 5-613(a)), which prohibited persons from being drug kingpins and defined \u201cdrug kingpin\u201d as an \u201corganizer, supervisor, financier, or manager\u201d in a drug conspiracy; <em>Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. at 461, 569 A.2d 604 upholding former Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 121 of Art. 27 (now, in substantive part, Md.Code (2002), C.L. \u00a7 10-201(c)(5)), which prohibited \u201cloud and unseemly noises\u201d as disorderly conduct); and <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 125, 389 A.2d 341 (1978) upholding former Md.Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 35A(b)(7)(A) of Art. 27 (now Md.Code (2002, 2004 Cum.Supp.), C.L. \u00a7 3-601, which defined child abuse as, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201ccruel or inhumane\u201d treatment of a minor). Similarly, in <em>McKenzie, </em>131 Md.App. at 137, 748 A.2d 67, this Court upheld Maryland\u2019s anti-hazing statute, which defined \u201chaze\u201d as \u201cdoing an act or causing any situation which recklessly or intentionally subject a student to the risk of serious bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>injury for the purpose of initiation into a student organization of a school, college, or university.\u201d Former Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 268H of Article 27 now Md.Code (2002), C.L. \u00a7 3-607.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u201cIn contrast, ... when Maryland Courts <em>have held </em>statutes and ordinances void for vagueness, the enforcement action challenged had created an absurd result, explicitly illustrating for the court the problems with the statute.\u201d <em>McKenzie, </em>131 Md.App. at 140, 748 A.2d 67. For example, in <em>In Re Leroy T., </em>285 Md. 508, 403 A.2d 1226 (1979), a juvenile who was arrested while allegedly trying to break into a car was accused of, and adjudicated delinquent for, the possession of a burglary tool\u2014 in his case a pair of pliers \u2014 in violation of former Baltimore City Code, Art. 19, \u00a7 9(a)(5). The juvenile argued upon appeal that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, and the Court of Appeals agreed. The Court observed that \u00a7 9(a)(5) prohibited the possession of any \u201cdevice, instrument, or article <em>commonly used, </em>designed or specially adopted for criminal use.\u201d 285 Md. at 510, 403 A.2d 1226. The State admitted, and the Court concluded, that \u201calmost any common article or instrument imaginable, which might be used by persons in the course of committing unlawful acts, would be encompassed by \u00a7 9(a)(5).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512-13, 403 A.2d 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Similarly, in <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 660 A.2d 447 (1995), a Frederick City ordinance established a curfew for juveniles who were not accompanied by adults, <em>see </em>former Frederick City Code \u00a7 15-10 (1966, 1992 Supp.), and created a variety of exceptions, including one for any \u201cchild attending a cultural, scholastic, athletic or recreational activity supervised by a bona fide organization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, \u00a7 15-11. A group of teenagers who were arrested after attending a youth-oriented event sponsored by a local Chinese restaurant, and who were later found guilty of violating the curfew, challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The Court of Appeals invalidated the ordinance because it failed to clearly define which organizations were to be considered \u201cbona fide.\u201d 339 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Md. at 89, 660 A.2d 447. The Court stated: \u201cIt must be possible for citizens to decide whether an unaccompanied seventeen year old might be detained in Frederick under the curfew ordinance for attending a midnight church service, a baseball game that ran into extra innings, a concert at Hood College, or a movie that ended after eleven.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">With respect to the facts in this case, we are satisfied that the term \u201clife-threatening injury\u201d is neither ambiguous nor mysterious. The term can be readily and indisputably defined by reference to a dictionary. <em>See </em>823 Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11th ed.2004) (defining \u201clife-threatening\u201d as \u201cpotentially fatal\u201d); 1042 Encarta World English Dictionary (1999) (defining \u201clife-threatening\u201d as \u201cvery dangerous or serious with the possibility of death as an outcome\u201d); 1306 Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary (1981) (hereinafter \u201cWEBSTER\u2019s\u201d)(defining \u201clife\u201d as \u201cthe earthly state of human existence\u201d); 2382 Webster\u2019s (defining \u201cthreatening\u201d as \u201cindicating] as impending\u201d); and 1164 Webster\u2019s (defining \u201cinjury\u201d as \u201churt, damage, or loss sustained\u201d). Consequently, it was not necessary for the legislature to define the term \u201clife-threatening injury\u201d in order to give fair notice to motorists that the act of driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol would constitute a violation of former \u00a7 388B if the act resulted in an injury to another person that could cause that person\u2019s death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The meaning of the term, moreover, was sufficiently clear to permit police, judicial officers, and triers of fact to enforce the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Trial Court\u2019s Application of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Todd argues that, even if the term \u201clife-threatening injury,\u201d as used in \u00a7 388B, is not unconstitutionally vague, the trial court erred by \u201cfailing to strictly construe the term and instead applying a broad interpretation of \u2018life[-]threatening injury\u2019 to the facts before [it].\u201d Todd points out that the rule of lenity requires that an ambiguous penal statute be construed in the light most favorable to the defendant. <em>See generally Webster v. State, </em>359 Md. 465, 481, 754 A.2d 1004 (2000). Todd asserts that the term \u201clife-threatening injury\u201d is ambiguous and therefore should have been interpreted to mean an injury involving \u201ca high probability of imminent death.\u201d He complains that the court \u201cinterpreted \u2018life[-]threatening injury\u2019 broadly, to include injuries that created the mere \u2018potential\u2019 for death.\u201d Todd\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The record reflects that Todd was charged with causing life-threatening injuries by motor vehicle, while intoxicated and while under the influence of alcohol, not only to Sarah Vance but also to her father, James Vance. Todd\u2019s counsel moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case, asserting that the statute\u2019s \u201clack of definitiveness\u201d as to the meaning of \u201clife-threatening injury\u201d rendered \u00a7 388B of Article 27 void for vagueness. The court responded: \u201cI think that when they don\u2019t have a definition, we are to employ our common sense and everyday experiences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The trial court asked the prosecutor if there was \u201canything that would indicate that the injuries to [James Vance] were life threatening.\u201d The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">Only the sense that the seriousness of the injuries to the leg, for some reason I thought that the wound to the leg was protruding and I guess until Mr. Vance set me straight on the stand, other than the fact that he was pinned in, his ... ankles and leg were broken, I don\u2019t recall anything specific in the records that would be anything, but certainly the fact that he was injured, given the extent of the injury, I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>they could be considered life-threatening. But of course the help was there fairly quickly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The court then granted the motion for judgment of acquittal as to the counts naming James Vance as the victim, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">Well, I have to say I think he had serious injuries, and there is no dispute about that as far as I\u2019ve heard thus far. And in all serious automobile accidents the potential is there for death. But in this case I believe that I\u2019m required by my review of the statute, and I have to, that life threatening injuries is not defined anywhere, wouldn\u2019t that have been a helpful thought for the legislature to add, but just common sense would mean that <em>injuries from which you could directly infer a potential death. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">And I can\u2019t find that [as to James Vance] from this set of facts. I can find very serious injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">As to Sarah it\u2019s a different ball game because I think any time you have serious brain injuries, we go into emergency treatment for those kinds of injuries, there was, and obviously by virtue of the fact that the treatment that was rendered to her on the basis that it was, that she did suffer life-threatening injuries, and I think that\u2019s a fair inference that can be drawn from the testimony and the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asj\">(Emphasis added.) The court did not address the matter further when it announced its verdicts at the close of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">For the same reasons that the term was not void for vagueness, it was not ambiguous. Although \u201clife-threatening injury\u201d was not defined in former \u00a7 388B, and although the trial court indicated that such a definition would have been \u201chelpful,\u201d the court correctly indicated that the definition could readily be established through \u201ccommon sense and everyday experience.\u201d As we have indicated, by common parlance a life-threatening injury is one that is \u201cpotentially fatal,\u201d 23 Concise Oxford English Dictionary, <em>supra, </em>in that it is \u201cvery dangerous or serious with the possibility of death as an outcome.\u201d 1042 Encarta World English Dictionary, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>It is obvious, from the trial court\u2019s explanation of its reason for granting judgment of acquittal as to the counts involving James Vance, that the trial court did not view a \u201clife-threatening injury\u201d as one in which the possibility of death was attenuated or remote. The trial court expressly determined that the injuries to James Vance, although \u201cvery serious,\u201d were not likely to cause his death. It explained that the head injuries suffered by Sarah were life-threatening; the injuries suffered by James Vance to his ankles and leg were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Finally, Todd argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions for causing a life-threatening injury by motor vehicle while intoxicated and causing a life-threatening injury by motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. He bases his argument on the fact that no expert medical witness expressly testified that the injuries to Sarah were life-threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">It is true that, \u201c[w]hen a complicated issue of medical causation arises, expert testimony is almost always required.\u201d <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Booker, </em>152 Md.App. 166, 178, 831 A.2d 481 (2003) (regarding workers\u2019 compensation claim alleging employee\u2019s asthma was due to exposure to freon gas at workplace), <em>cert. denied, </em>378 Md. 614, 837 A.2d 926 (2003). \u201cExpert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue....\u201d Md. Rule 5-702. The trial court apparently did not believe that expert medical testimony was necessary to its determination as to whether Sarah\u2019s injury was life-threatening, and we perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">\u201cUpon appellate review!,] the \u2018applicable standard is whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galloway, </em>365 Md. at 649, 781 A.2d 851 (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201cOur concern, therefore, is not whether the verdict was in accord with the weight of the evidence but rather, whether there was sufficient evidence produced at trial \u2018that either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">As we summarized in our statement of the relevant facts, the State presented evidence that Sarah suffered a deep gash across her forehead that bled profusely and caused her to lose consciousness.. Portions of her face were \u201ccompletely crushed\u201d in the accident. She was rushed to Peninsula Regional Medical Center, where physicians diagnosed bleeding on the brain. Hospital records that were admitted into evidence reflect that the emergency room physician determined that Sarah had suffered \u201csevere cranial injury\u201d and was in need of emergency surgery to repair it. Physicians at Peninsula attempted to stabilize Sarah\u2019s condition so that emergency surgery could be performed on her skull. The physicians were unable to stabilize her, however, and could perform no more surgery than that which- was necessary to control the bleeding. The next day, when Sarah\u2019s condition was more stable, she was flown to Johns Hopkins Hospital, where a surgical team was waiting to perform more surgery to repair Sarah\u2019s head wound and to stop the bleeding on her brain. Sarah was later required to undergo several more surgeries as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">We are convinced that, on this evidence, a rational trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Sarah\u2019s injury was of such a nature that, but for the intervening medical attention, she would have died. No expert medical testimony was necessary to establish that Sarah suffered a life-threatening injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">COST TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\">.
