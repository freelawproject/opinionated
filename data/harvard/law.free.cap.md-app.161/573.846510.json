During discovery in that action, the parties disputed the applicability of Hooper\u2019s insurance policies for the premises, issued by United Services Automobile Association (USAA).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">To resolve the insurance dispute, USAA, the appellee here, brought a declaratory judgment action against appellants, the Carpenters, and Hooper,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking to establish that USAA\u2019s maximum exposure in the underlying tort action is $300,000. Appellants initially contended that Hooper\u2019s USAA policies provided $2.7 million of coverage, but now contend they provide $1.2 million. The lead paint case was stayed pending resolution of the insurance case.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">The circuit court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, declaring that appellee\u2019s policies indemnify Hooper up to $600,000 of liability. From that judgment, appellants noted this appeal and presented the following question, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">Did the circuit court err by making findings of fact when it granted summary judgment for appellee?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Appellee noted a cross-appeal and presented the following question, which we have also rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">Did the circuit court err in declaring that USAA\u2019s policies provided $600,000 of coverage, instead of $300,000?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">We answer \u201cyes\u201d to the first question, and, accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment. To guide the parties on remand, we address the second question as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Hooper purchased four consecutive homeowner\u2019s insurance policies from USAA to cover 1803 West Mosher Street, the property he rented to the Carpenters. The Carpenters lived at the premises during portions of each of the four insurance periods, which were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">\u2022 July 28,1990 to July 28,1991;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">\u2022 July 28,1991 to March 1, 1992;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">\u2022 March 1,1992 to March 1,1993; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-13\">\u2022 March 1,1993 to March 1,1994.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">The family left the house sometime in the fall of 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">Counts 1 through 3 of the underlying complaint each sought $1 million dollars for damages resulting from injuries to Jeremy Carpenter, who was born shortly after the family\u2019s tenancy began.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counts 4, 5, and 6 each sought $1 million dollars for damages resulting from the injuries to Wendy Carpenter, who was two years old when the family moved into the residence. Finally, counts 7, 8, and 9 each sought the same damages for injuries to Christian Carpenter, who was not yet one when the family moved in. The allegations in the complaint of lead ingestion were subsequently supported by a relative\u2019s affidavit, stating that the children were frequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>seen \u201cgnawing on the windows and picking the paint\u201d throughout the tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">In the course of the litigation, the Carpenters submitted evidence of their blood-lead level histories. Blood-lead levels are usually measured in micrograms per deciliter of blood, abbreviated as \u201c\u00a1xg/dL.\u201d <em>See </em>Scott A. Smith, <em>Turning Lead into Asbestos and Tobacco: Litigation Alchemy Gone Wrong, </em>Defense Counsel Journal, Apr. 2004, at 123. As medical research has progressed, what experts consider to be a \u201csafe\u201d lead level has consistently dropped:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">Prior to 1970, the U.S. Surgeon General defined the \u201clevel of concern\u201d of lead in a young child\u2019s blood as 60|xg/dL, a level rarely seen today. In 1970, the Surgeon General reduced the level of concern to 40|xg/dL. In 1978, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), having assumed jurisdiction over lead poisoning prevention from the Surgeon General, further reduced the level of concern to 30\u00a1xg/dL; in 1985, to 25|xg/dL; and in 1991, to 10|xg/dL, where it stands today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Only recently has research shown that lead levels below 10[xg/dL not only are injurious, but, in fact, are disproportionately injurious, causing more harm per gg/dL up to 10 than beyond 10. Richard L. Canfield <em>et al, Intellectual Impairment in Children with Blood Lead Concentrations Below </em>10pg <em>per Deciliter, </em>348 New Eng. J. Med. 1517, 1521-25 (2003) (Canfield). Appellants submitted to us a copy of the Canfield article in a motion to supplement the record, but, because the results of the Canfield research had not yet been published when this case was before the trial court, it did not consider that research in rendering the challenged summary judgment decision, and therefore neither shall we. <em>See, e.g., Douglas v. First Sec. Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>101 Md.App. 170, 176-78, 643 A.2d 920 (1994).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The Carpenter children\u2019s lead levels were not measured until the fourth insurance policy period. Their results were:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b600-47\">Thus, owing to the late date at which the children were tested, it remains unknown when the children\u2019s lead levels first exceeded 10|xg/dL. In its summary judgment motion in the declaratory judgment action, appellee asserted that the Carpenters could not prove that any bodily injuries were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>sustained during the first and second policy periods (i.e., before March 1, 1992), because no evidence showed that their lead levels exceeded the level-of-concern threshold of the Center of Disease Control of 10|xg/dL during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">From the lead-level tables above, it is apparent that the earliest of the children\u2019s blood tests occurred in April 1993, showing a level of 29pg/dL for Jeremy Carpenter, and 19pg/dL for Wendy Carpenter. The Carpenters\u2019 medical expert, Dr. Howard Klein, conceded in his deposition that, based solely on this data and then-current medical research, when projecting backwards in time before the children\u2019s lead tests, he could only conclude that the children\u2019s blood-lead levels exceeded lOpg/dL during the third and fourth insurance periods. Simultaneously, however, Dr. Klein averred in an affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">It is my opinion within a reasonable degree of medical probability that Christian Carpenter and Wendy Carpenter were \u201cexposed\u201d to hazardous lead-based paint and dust at the premises 1803 W. Mosher Street beginning the date they first moved into the property in June 1989. Likewise it is my opinion within a reasonable degree of medical probability that Jeremy Carpenter was \u201cexposed\u201d to hazardous lead based paint and dust at the premises ... beginning <em>[in \u00fatero </em>] and continuing at his birth on February 24, 1990.... It is further my opinion within a reasonable degree of medical probability that this exposure for all three children caused damage on a cellular level to the children\u2019s brains, disrupting normal cellular development. These opinions are based on the deteriorated condition of the lead-based paint while the children resided at the property, evidence of hand to mouth activity, gnawing on leaded paint, as well as actual observation of ingestion of lead paint chips.... It is further my opinion within a reasonable degree of medical probability that the lead-based paint and dust exposure during each separate policy period, in and of itself caused immediate bodily harm and injury to the cells of the brain, central nervous system tissues and organs for each of the three Carpenter children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>In his deposition, Dr. Klein never reconciled this opinion with his concession that, at the time, no published research confirmed that lead paint was harmful at levels below 10|xg/dL, and that he could not say when the children\u2019s lead levels exceeded 10pg/dL. In a subsequent affidavit, however, he essentially explained that the question was not asked of him during the depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Arguing that Dr. Klein\u2019s opinion would be inadmissible at trial, appellee asserted that there was no evidence of injury in the first and second policy periods, so no recovery could possibly be had under those policies. The trial court agreed and entered partial summary judgment for appellee on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">As to the remaining policies, appellee asserted that, although the aggregate of the two policies\u2019 limits of liability was $600,000, because the children\u2019s injuries during the two policy periods constituted a single occurrence under the policies\u2019 terms, recovery could only be had under one policy, up to $300,000. Each of the policies are materially identical, and each of them provides, under \u201cCoverage E\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies, we [the insurer] will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">1. pay up to your limit of liability [i.e., $300,000] for the damages for which the insured is legally liable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">2. provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice, even if the suit is groundless, false or fraudulent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">The policies define \u201coccurrence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">An accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, which results, during the policy period, in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">a. bodily injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">b. property damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201cBodily injury\u201d is then defined as \u201cbodily harm, sickness or disease, including required care, loss of services and death that results,\u201d and finally, the policies impose a limit of liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKe\">Our total liability under Coverage E for all damages resulting from any one occurrence will not be more than the limit of liability for Coverage E as shown in the Declarations. This limit is the same regardless of the number of insureds, claims made or persons injured. All bodily injury and property damage resulting from any one accident or from continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions shall be considered to be the result of one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The trial court rejected appellee\u2019s argument that, under these provisions, recovery could be had from only one policy. The court concluded that appellee\u2019s policies were ambiguous as to whether an insured may \u201cstack\u201d consecutive policies\u2019 coverage limits in cases of a continuous injury spanning more than one policy. Construing the ambiguity against the insurance company, the court declared that appellee was exposed to $600,000 liability in the underlying tort action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AD-Y\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Appellee moved for summary judgment under Maryland Rule 2-501, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">(a) Any party may make a motion for summary judgment on all or part of an action on the ground that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>The motion shall be supported by affidavit if it is </em>... <em>based on facts not contained in the record.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">(b) A response to a written motion for summary judgment shall be in writing and shall (1) identify with particularity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>each material fact as to which it is contended that there is a genuine dispute and (2) as to each such fact, identify and attach the relevant portion of the specific document, discovery response, transcript of testimony (by page and line), or other statement under oath that demonstrated the dispute. A response asserting the existence of a material fact or controverting any fact contained in the record shall be supported by an affidavit or other written statement under oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">(c) An affidavit supporting or opposing a motion for summary judgment shall be made upon personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts <em>as would be admissible in evidence, </em>and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">(f) The court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The trial court\u2019s decision as to the first two policy periods simply reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">As a factual matter, on the record before the Court, the three Carpenter Children cannot establish that any one of them suffered bodily injury within the meaning of the USAA policies during the terms of the first two policies.... Therefore, as a factual matter, the maximum number of USAA policies implicated is two.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Appellee\u2019s theory on appeal is that the trial court appropriately disregarded Dr. Klein\u2019s opinion because it would have been inadmissible at trial under Maryland Rule 5-702, governing the admissibility of expert testimony. Thus, the refusal to admit Dr. Klein\u2019s opinion regarding injuries below 10|xg/dL as part of the record, appellee argues, results in its entitlement to summary judgment as a matter of law because there no longer remained a genuine dispute as to whether the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>suffered \u201cbodily injury,\u201d as defined in the policies, during the first two policy periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">On this evidentiary issue, we will only disturb the trial court\u2019s decision if it amounts to an abuse of discretion, error of law, or other serious mistake. <em>See, e.g., Giant Food, Inc. v. Booker, </em>152 Md.App. 166, 182 n. 9, 831 A.2d 481, <em>cert. denied, </em>378 Md. 614, 837 A.2d 926 (2003); <em>Myers v. Celotex Corp., </em>88 Md.App. 442, 460, 594 A.2d 1248 (1991). Rule 5-702 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject and <em>(3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">(Emphasis added); <em>see also </em>6 Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7\u00a7 702:1-703:1 (2001 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2004). Appellee\u2019s argument focuses solely on the third prong of the rule \u2014 whether a sufficient factual basis supported Dr. Klein\u2019s opinion that all three children sustained lead-induced injuries throughout their tenancy. Before resolving that issue, however, we must first define, as precisely as possible, what Dr. Klein\u2019s opinion was offered to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In order for the first two policies to be \u201ctriggered,\u201d during those policy periods, the Carpenter children must have suffered \u201cbodily injury,\u201d as defined by the policy (and, where necessary, interpreted by the courts). The policies define bodily injury essentially as \u201cbodily harm, sickness or disease,\u201d which, in a similar lead paint case, the Court of Appeals has interpreted to mean \u201charm or damage of, or relating to the body or any localized abnormal condition of the living body.\u201d <em>Chantel </em>Assocs. <em>v. Mt. Vernon Fire Ins. Co., </em>338 Md. 131, 143, 656 A.2d 779 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>In <em>Chantel, </em>an expert witness testified to many of the same opinions as Dr. Klein has in the present case, including that \u201c[t]here is probably no safe threshold at which lead has no effect.\u201d The expert\u2019s opinion was offered in lieu of blood-lead level histories showing exact test results, to prove that the plaintiff-children suffered \u201cbodily injury\u201d for purposes of several potentially triggered insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The Court of Appeals held in <em>Chantel </em>that the expert\u2019s opinion, which was offered in an affidavit, in concert with the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that they had ingested deteriorating lead paint at the premises throughout the policy periods, met their burden of showing bodily injury; and thus triggered the policies. The Court noted that, as in this case, the opposing party had not offered any evidence, by way of affidavit or otherwise, to discredit the expert\u2019s opinion that lead ingestion in any amount causes bodily injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 144 &amp; n. 8, 656 A.2d 779.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Consistent with <em>Chantel, </em>appellee tacitly concedes that, <em>if </em>Dr. Klein\u2019s opinion is admissible, then, when combined with the children\u2019s lead-level histories and the family\u2019s direct observations of lead ingestion, the opinion satisfies appellants\u2019 burden of production as to evidence of their injuries during the first and second policy periods. Appellee, however, argues that the opinion is not admissible to prove the point because no published research supports the doctor\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We dealt with a similar argument in <em>N.B.S., Inc. v. Harvey, </em>121 Md.App. 334, 709 A.2d 162 (1998). In that case, at a trial which occurred sometime after 1995 (i.e., at least four years after the CDC lowered the blood-lead level of concern to 10pg/dL), the medical expert of one of the parties proffered an opinion that lead ingestion only becomes harmful at levels above 40|xg/dL. For two reasons the trial court found that the witness was not qualified as an expert, and excluded her testimony: (1) she had not worked as a practitioner or researcher in the field for more than ten years; and (2) as the trial court observed, \u201cthere isn\u2019t another physician out there who agrees with\u201d her opinion that lead only becomes injurious over 40|xg/dL, so under Rule 5-702(3) \u201cthere was no existing factual basis\u201d supporting her opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 339, 709 A.2d 162. We affirmed that trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in applying Rule 5-702(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">However, the fact that an expert\u2019s medical opinion is not generally accepted by the medical community does not stand as an automatic bar to its admissibility under Rule 5-702(3). We so held in <em>Myers v. Celotex Corp., </em>88 Md.App. at 455-60, 594 A.2d 1248, concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 expert \u201cshould have been permitted to state his opinion as to how asbestos fibers cause cancer even though he could not state that the theory he espoused was generally accepted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>medical community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455, 594 A.2d 1248. We were careful to add, in that case, that the challenged expert\u2019s opinion, while not generally accepted, was also not uniquely held by that expert alone. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 594 A.2d 1248; <em>cf. Giant Food, Inc., </em>152 Md.App. at 188-89, 831 A.2d 481; <em>Owens Corning v. Bauman, </em>125 Md.App. 454, 498-502, 726 A.2d 745 (1999). The challenged opinion simply represented a minority view. We stressed that the standard for admissibility, at bottom, is whether the opinion is offered with a reasonable degree of medical probability. <em>See also </em>5 McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 401:4; <em>cf. id. </em>\u00a7 702:2 at 512-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Here, Dr. Klein acknowledged that, as of the time of his depositions, no published research had measured children\u2019s lead-induced injuries at levels below 10|xg/dL. However, the doctor opined that the Carpenter children sustained lead-induced bodily injuries throughout the tenancy \u2014 even without knowing their precise lead levels during the first two policy periods \u2014 based upon evidence that lead causes measurable damage at levels above 10pg/dL, and that the Carpenter children were eating lead paint throughout the tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Appellee\u2019s attack on Dr. Klein\u2019s opinion fails because it assumes a fact not in evidence. Appellee assumes that the record shows that lead ingestion only becomes injurious at levels above 10|xg/dL, but appellee offered no evidence supporting the assumption. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-501 (a), quoted <em>supra; cf. Chantel </em>Assocs., 338 Md. at 149-50, 656 A.2d 779. In fact, to the contrary, Dr. Klein testified to his understanding that there is no safe level of lead ingestion. As he pointed out, lead is a \u201ctoxin.\u201d Dr. Klein is not alone in subscribing to this theory. The expert in <em>Chantel </em>testified to essentially the same opinion. 338 Md. at 138-39, 656 A.2d 779.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was adequate factual support for Dr. Klein\u2019s opinion to be offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>to a reasonable degree of medical probability, like the opinion offered in <em>Myers v. Celotex Corp., </em>and unlike that offered in <em>N.B.S., Inc. v. </em>Harvey.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In effect, appellee\u2019s theory would write into Rule 5-702(3) a requirement that all medical opinions find support in published research, but neither the rule, nor cases construing it, impose such a requirement. Therefore, we hold that the circuit court erred in concluding that there was no genuine dispute as to whether the Carpenter children were injured during the first and second policy periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In light of our resolution of the first issue, the judgment must be vacated and remanded to the trial court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To offer some guidance to the court and the parties on remand, we will address, to some extent, the question appellee has presented in its cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Our consideration of the issue of how any judgment in the tort action should be allocated among the consecutive policies begins with a hypothetical counterfactual, but prefatory to that, we must briefly explain the distinction between triggering of insurance policies versus the allocation of an insured\u2019s liability among consecutive policies. The distinction is fairly simple: <em>if </em>an insurance policy is triggered, then some amount of the policy\u2019s coverage may be applied to indemnify the insured, but allocation (in consecutive, primary policy cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>such as this) deals with the separate question of how much coverage from each policy applies to indemnify the insured for continuous injuries spanning multiple policy periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">For our hypothetical, assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the injuries complained of involved only one child, and further, that the injury was the loss of a limb, for which Hooper was held liable. Obviously, despite the continuing, permanent nature of the injury (the limb remains lost during subsequent policy periods), the only policy triggered would be the one in force at the moment of injury; subsequent insurance policies would not be triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The allegations here, however, are that the children suffered a continuous injury throughout consecutive policy periods. In an earlier lead paint case, <em>Harford Mutual Insurance Co. v. Jacobson, </em>73 Md.App. 670, 679-84, 536 A.2d 120 (1988), we held that the test for determining which, if any, policies are triggered in lead paint cases was the \u201cmanifestation of injury\u201d standard. In <em>Jacobson, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">We agree with those cases that the date of an \u201coccurrence\u201d for purposes of determining coverage under an insurance policy is the date when the harm is first discovered. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the insurance policy provided coverage only for an occurrence which gave rise to bodily harm <em>during the period. </em>[The plaintiff] was first exposed to leaded paint in 1981. Unquestionably, the injurious effects of that exposure persisted into the period of coverage. But, her injuries first manifested themselves <em>prior </em>to coverage when she was diagnosed in 1982 by the Baltimore City Health Department as having lead poisoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 684, 536 A.2d 120. As we shall explain, that holding has been substantially abrogated by subsequent decisions of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\"><em>Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc. v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>324 Md. 44, 595 A.2d 469 (1991), was an asbestos injury case. Workers who had been exposed to Mitchell\u2019s asbestos products sued the company, and at issue was whether the workers\u2019 continuous injuries \u2014 from the time of exposure to the manifestation of their injuries \u2014 triggered each of the company\u2019s consecutive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>liability insurance policies. The trial court had concluded, in part relying on <em>Jacobson, </em>that the asbestos plaintiffs\u2019 injuries only triggered the policies in effect when their injuries manifested, not at the moment of exposure, and not during the development of the attendant illnesses. The Court of Appeals, in an opinion by Chief Judge Robert Murphy, reversed, holding that, \u201cat a minimum, coverage under the policy ... is triggered upon exposure to the insured\u2019s asbestos products during the policy period by a person who suffers bodily injury as a result of that exposure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 595 A.2d 469.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">A year later, Chief Judge Murphy authored the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Harford County v. Harford Mutual Insurance Co., </em>327 Md. 418, 610 A.2d 286 (1992), an environmental tort case where pollutants had seeped out of landfills over a long period of time, during numerous consecutive insurance periods. The Court again held, \u201c[Mjanifestation is not the sole trigger of coverage in environmental pollution cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435-36, 610 A.2d 286. Rather, consistent with the policies\u2019 terms, the policies that were triggered were those in effect when injury (or, in that case, property damage) in fact occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In a lead paint case brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Judge J. Frederick Motz concluded, based on his reading of <em>Mitchell </em>and <em>Harford County, </em>that <em>Jacobson </em>was no longer good law, and that in lead paint cases such as this, the appropriate trigger theory is the continuous trigger, not solely manifestation of injury. <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Am. Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co., </em>811 F.Supp. 210, 215 (1998).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Motz concluded: \u201c[Ejxposure plus bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>injury (even if unmanifested) is now sufficient under Maryland law to trigger coverage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Finally, in an asbestos property damage case, <em>Mayor of Baltimore v. Utica Mutual Insurance Co., </em>145 Md.App. 256, 802 A.2d 1070 (2002) (Utica), we held, in an opinion authored by Chief Judge Joseph Murphy, that consecutive policies were triggered by the plaintiffs continuous injury, as long as plaintiffs could prove that damages in fact occurred during the policy periods. <em>Id. </em>at 304-06, 802 A.2d 1070. The bulk of the remainder of <em>Utica </em>dealt with allocation of liability, which we will analyze presently.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In light of those cases subsequent to <em>Jacobson, </em>we agree with Judge Motz\u2019s conclusion, in <em>Scottsdale, </em>that continuous injury, not solely manifestation, is the appropriate trigger in lead paint poisoning cases. <em>See also 5 ATLA\u2019s Litigating Tort Cases </em>\u00a7 56-42 (2004) (\u201c[T]he continuous nature of lead poisoning supports an argument for triggering every policy that was in effect during the period of ingestion.\u201d); <em>see also, generally, </em>Lee H. Ogburn, <em>The Progression of Trigger Litigation in Maryland </em>\u2014 Determining <em>the Appropriate Trigger of Coverage, Its Limitations, and Ramifications, </em>53 Md. L.Rev. 220 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Here, appellee argues that even if a continuous injury spanned multiple policy periods, recovery may be had only up to $300,000 \u2014 in effect, only one policy is triggered \u2014 because the above-quoted policy provisions state that USAA\u2019s liability for any one occurrence is $300,000.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In considering this argument, we apply general interpretive rules applicable to all contracts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>An insurance policy is construed as an ordinary contract, according to usual, ordinary and accepted meaning [of its terms] unless there is evidence that the parties intended to employ [them] in a special or technical sense. [I]t is the function of the Court to interpret the policy and decide whether or not there is coverage. Maryland does not follow the rule that insurance policies should, as a matter of course, be construed against the insurer. We must observe rules of construction of ordinary contracts, and will review the policy as a whole to ascertain the intentions of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><em>Utica, </em>145 Md.App. at 301 n. 46, 802 A.2d 1070 (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The circuit court concluded that the policies\u2019 limit of liability provisions, while susceptible to the reading given by appellee, are equally susceptible to appellant\u2019s interpretation that, while any one policy would pay no more than $300,000 per occurrence, a continuing injury may trigger sequential policies, stacking each of the policies\u2019 liability caps. We agree, and again, we begin our analysis with a counterfactual.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In the underlying case, assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Carpenters win a total judgment of $3 million for injuries sustained during the four insurance periods, and further assume that Hooper had procured the four policies from four different insurers. In such a case, obviously each insurers\u2019 per-occurrence liability limits would not apply to limit the availability of coverage from the other policies; Hooper would have $1.2 million dollars of coverage toward his liability to the Carpenters.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Appellee\u2019s interpretation of the per occurrence liability limitation would alter the amount of insurance available, merely on the aleatory circumstance of whether Hooper had changed insurers over the course of the Carpenters\u2019 tenancy. Under our hypothetical, Hooper would enjoy the full benefit of the aggregate $1.2 million dollars of coverage he purchased; under appellee\u2019s theory, Hooper would only have $300,000 of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Appellee\u2019s interpretation is not compelled by the language of the insurance agreements. When the liability limitation section states, \u201cOur total liability under Coverage E for all damages resulting from any one occurrence will not be more than\u201d $300,000, it can be read to mean \u201ctotal liability under <em>this policy\u201d </em>rather than \u201ctotal liability under all policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Additionally, because appellee\u2019s interpretation would substantially alter liability allocation in continuous injury cases, we believe appellee\u2019s interpretation is not what was expected by the parties when they made those contracts. <em>Cf. Scottsdale, </em>811 F.Supp. at 216 (\u201c[T]he purpose of the [limitation of liability] clause in question is not to apportion coverage between insurers providing coterminous coverage. Rather, it is to protect the issuing insurer from a claim that each instance of exposure constitutes a separate occurrence for which an independent claim up to the policy limits can be made.\u201d); <em>Utica, </em>145 Md.App. at 310-11, 802 A.2d 1070 (indicating compelling force of parties\u2019 reasonable expectations in policy interpretation); Robert E. Keeton, <em>Insurance Law Rights at Variance with Policy Provisions, </em>83 Harv. L.Rev. 961 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Appellee\u2019s theory runs counter to the pro rata by time-on-the-risk allocation method adopted in continuous injury cases in Maryland. To return to, and extend our hypothetical, if the Carpenters won a $3 million judgment, and if (as is likely the case) the parties cannot establish based on the evidence how to attribute the damages among each of the insurance periods, Maryland law dictates that the judgment be allocated pro rata among the policies based on their time on the risk. <em>See Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>355 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Md. 566, 584-89, 735 A.2d 1081 (1999) (requiring evidence as to impossibility of attributing amounts of liability to particular policy periods); <em>Harford County, </em>327 Md. at 436, 610 A.2d 286 (\u201cThe burden to show that property damage occurred within the coverage of the policies is, of course, upon the insured.... [The issue is] quite likely a matter for expert testimony.\u201d); <em>Utica, </em>145 Md.App. at 307-314, 802 A.2d 1070 (thoroughly analyzing liability allocation; expressly adopting time-on-the-risk pro rata allocation, rejecting other theories); <em>see also Scottsdale, </em>811 F.Supp. at 216-18 (applying time-on-the-risk allocation in lead paint case). In such cases, liability is pro rated according to each policy\u2019s time on the risk because it is only fair (and consistent with policy language) that policies indemnify the insured for those injuries sustained when the policy was in effect, and no others. <em>See Utica, </em>145 Md.App. at 310-14, 802 A.2d 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Applying time-on-the-risk allocation to our hypothetical, assuming four equal one-year policy periods, the $3 million judgment would be allocated as a $750,000 liability against each insurance period. Of course, each policy\u2019s limits would bar recovery over $300,000, leaving the insured exposed for the excess $450,000 liability for each insurance period. <em>See id. </em>at 314, 802 A.2d 1070 (\u201c[N]o policy would be required to exceed its indemnification limits in any event.\u201d). If Hooper were uninsured for any period of time, liability would be allocated to him for that proportion of the judgment \u2014 unless he was uninsured because he <em>could not </em>obtain insurance \u2014 but obviously no liability limit would apply. <em>Id. </em>at 313 &amp; n. 54, 802 A.2d 1070 (\u201c[L]osses will be prorated to the insured, unless a gap in coverage is due to the insured\u2019s inability to obtain insurance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">While those results would obtain under settled Maryland law if Hooper had switched insurers for each policy period, appellee\u2019s theory would evade those results, and punish insureds for renewing policies with the same insurer. If this issue were ripe for our review, we would reject appellee\u2019s theory, as it is inconsistent with Maryland\u2019s time-on-the-risk allocation cases, and not mandated by the policies\u2019 language. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>However, because our resolution of the first issue requires that the case be remanded to the trial court, the parties shall have an opportunity to re-present their arguments to the trial court. They will, at that time, need to establish when the Carpenters moved into the residence; if their first exposure pre-dated appellee\u2019s first policy, it may be that Hooper, or whoever insured him at that time, is liable for that portion of the tort judgment attributable to that time period. Additionally, to determine how long the insurer was on the risk, it must be determined (more accurately than \u201cfall of 1993\u201d) when the Carpenters\u2019 tenancy ended. Finally, to avail themselves of time-on-the-risk allocation, it must be established that a more accurate allocation is not feasible. <em>See Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., </em>355 Md. at 586-89, 735 A.2d 1081.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED; THE CASE IS REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-13\">.

Notably, the <em>Chantel </em>Court compared lead paint ingestion to asbestos inhalation, finding them \"similar.\u201d 338 Md. at 144, 656 A.2d 779. The <em>Chantel </em>decision states, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">The [lead-paint plaintiffs\u2019] complaint, along with Dr. Schroeder's undisputed affidavit, leads to the conclusion that the \"direct and indirect damage to the cells, tissues and organs,\u201d caused by the ... plaintiffs\u2019 exposure to lead <em>constitutes </em>a \"bodily injury\u201d as that term was defined in <em>[Lloyd E.] Mitchell[, Inc. v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>324 Md. 44, 62, 595 A.2d 469 (1991)]. In fact, the record in the instant case establishes that the \u201cbodily injury\u201d suffered by the ... plaintiffs\u2019 exposure to lead is similar to the \"bodily injury\u201d suffered in <em>Mitchell </em>where we held that \" 'bodily injury' occurs when asbestos is inhaled and retained in the lungs.\u201d Additionally, according to Dr. Schroeder\u2019s uncontradicted affidavit, \"bodily injury\u201d occurred immediately or shortly after exposure ... [or] through <em>in \u00fatero </em>exposure. Thus, the record in the instant case establishes that the ... plaintiffs suffered \"bodily injury,\u201d immediately or soon after their exposure to the chipping and flaking lead paint at the Chantel property during the Mount Vernon policy period and that this \"continuous and repeated exposure\u201d resulted in bodily injury constituting an \"occurrence\u201d triggering coverage under the Mount Vernon policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The Court's comparison of lead paint to asbestos is noteworthy because, at oral argument on the summary judgment motion in this case, the trial judge asked a hypothetical question of counsel for appellee: \"If the lay witnesses indicate that these children were ingesting lead paint from the beginning of their residence at this property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>doesn't that undermine your argument?\u201d Counsel replied, \u2018\u2018No, because ... asbestos is different from lead.... Ingesting or exposure to lead does not result in an injury, cellular changes, until there is a certain level of lead built up into the system.\u201d Appellee offered no evidence to support counsel\u2019s assertion, or to refute Dr. Klein's opinion to the contraiy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">. The expert in <em>Chantel </em>stated, \u2018\u2018There are injuries to cells, tissues and organs caused by exposure to lead paint, lead paint chips, lead paint fumes, and/or lead paint dust, even though the injuries may not be noticeable to a harmed individual or diagnosable by a clinician until some later point in time.... There is probably no safe threshold at which lead has no effect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">. It is one thing for a doctor to say, based on the continuously dropping \"level of concern\u201d set by the CDC, and professional experience, that no lead level is safe; it is quite another to say, more than seventeen years after the CDC lowered the level of concern from 40g.g/dL, and more than four years after it was lowered to 10p,g/dL, that injuries only occur above 40g,g/dL. The first opinion, while unsupported by published research, is a plausible one, currently espoused by some practitioners and researchers; the latter opinion exceeds the bounds of credulity. Such a reasonableness evaluation is an appropriate consideration for trial judges applying Rule 5-702(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\">.
