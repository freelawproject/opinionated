She challenged her termination in an intra-agency appeal, and an administrative law judge (ALJ) affirmed the DPSCS\u2019s decision. When appellant sought judicial review, a Baltimore City Circuit Court judge affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Having noted a timely appeal, appellant presented three questions for our review. Our resolution of the following question, which we have rephrased, renders appellant\u2019s other two questions <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> moot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">Was the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that appellant used or possessed marijuana while at work supported by substantial evidence, when the only evidence bearing on that issue was appellant\u2019s positive drug test?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence, and we shall, therefore, reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">According to the ALJ, the DPSCS employed appellant as a secretary at a prison in Baltimore City. Because appellant\u2019s job was classified as \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d under the DPSCS\u2019s internal regulations, she was not subject to random drug testing. Appellant was, however, subject to drug testing if her \u201cap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>pointing authority\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had \u201creasonable suspicion to believe that the employee [had] illegally used drugs.\u201d COMAR 17.04.09.04(B)(1). Reasonable suspicion of drug use exists when \u201cthe appointing authority has reasonable and specific grounds to believe that a drug abuse test of an employee shall produce evidence of illegal use of drugs.\u201d COMAR 17.04.09.04(B)(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Appellant\u2019s direct supervisor, Lisa Lewis, worked part-time at Anderson Automotive Group in Baltimore, and she recommended appellant for a job at Anderson. Appellant applied and was required to take a drug test, which she failed; she tested positive for using marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Appellant told Lewis that she did not get the job because she had tested positive for using marijuana. Before then, Lewis had never suspected that appellant used illegal drugs. Lewis told her supervisor about appellant\u2019s drug test and, based on Lewis\u2019s report, the warden ordered appellant to take a drug test for the DPSCS. Appellant failed that drug test. Appellant later admitted that she had smoked marijuana on a Saturday afternoon two or three weeks before the drug tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Under S.P.P. \u00a7 11-105(3), the \u201cillegal sale, use, or possession of drugs on the job\u201d is \u201ccause[ ] for automatic termination of employment.\u201d In accord with S.P.P. \u00a7 11-106, the DPSCS met with appellant to discuss her drug test and to consider mitigating circumstances before determining the appropriate disciplinary action. The DPSCS ultimately fired appellant based on her positive drug test.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">State employees and the State are encouraged to enter into settlement agreements to resolve their disputes when the employees contest disciplinary actions. <em>See </em>S.P.P. \u00a7 11\u2014 108(a)-(d); <em>see also McKay v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety and Corr. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>Servs., </em>150 Md.App. 182, 819 A.2d 1088, <em>cert. denied, </em>376 Md. 50, 827 A.2d 113 (2003). In accordance with \u00a7 11-108, while appellant pursued her intra-agency appeal, she continued negotiating with the DPSCS for a less severe discipline. Before the ALJ, appellant contended that she and a personnel representative had reached a binding settlement agreement including reinstatement; the DPSCS, however, presented evidence to the contrary, and the ALJ agreed with the DPSCS that no agreement had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Based on the positive drug tests, the ALJ concluded that appellant violated the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\u2022 S.P.P. \u00a7 11-105;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u2022 COMAR 17.04.09.04;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">\u2022 DPSCS \u201cStandards of Conduct and Internal Administrative Disciplinary Process,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 IIB, IV;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">\u2022 Executive Order 01.01.1991.16.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The ALJ never specified which subsection of S.P.P. \u00a7 11-105 that appellant had violated, but the DPSCS agrees with appellant\u2019s assumption that the ALJ focused on subparagraph (3), prohibiting the \u201cillegal sale, use, or possession of drugs on the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Strictly speaking, COMAR 17.04.09.04 does not prohibit anything; rather, the regulation implements a procedure for drug testing and disciplining employees. It does not, itself, impose a substantive prohibition of drug use beyond that of S.P.P. \u00a7 11-105. Appellant thus could not have \u201cviolated\u201d that regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">The relevant portions of the DPSCS\u2019s Standards of Conduct guidelines, which we quote below, do not enlarge upon the prohibitions of S.P.P. \u00a7 11-105 and the process in COMAR 17.04.09.04. In the following section on drug use, the Standards begin with a declarative preamble:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">G. Drugs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">All institutions, facilities, and offices of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services are drug free work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>places. As a condition of employment, an employee shall refrain from using illegal drugs and abusing legally prescribed or over-the-counter drugs on and off the work place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The Standards then summarize the investigative and disciplinary processes for on-the-job drug violations:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">1. CDS Violations at the Workplace.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">a. Reporting to work under the influence of CDS, [and] being in possession of or using CDS at the workplace is forbidden. When there is reasonable suspicion, (sensitive and nonsensitive employees) or [a] triggering incident has occurred (sensitive employees only)[,] the supervisor shall complete the Suspected Substance Use Observation Record and contact the IU (for employees of DOC, PATX or DPDS) or the designated ATR (for employees of all other agencies).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">b. The IU or ATR shall report to the work site to arrange for a drug test. The employee shall be given two forms: Written Order to Submit to a Urine Test and CDS Test Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">c. The IU or ATR shall direct the employee to the designated testing site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">d. An employee who tests positive for CDS shall be suspended pending termination from State service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Finally, the Standards summarize a more lenient proc\u00e9ss for off-the-job drug violations:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">2. CDS Violations Off the Workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">\u25a0 a. Non-sensitive classes or positions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-13\">1) An employee who is arrested for a CDS violation shall be subject to action based on a review of his/her case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-14\">2) An employee who (i) is found guilty of a CDS violation prior to 10/1/95, or (ii) is convicted of a CDS violation thereafter, or (iii) receives a PBJ disposition and for whom there is a demonstrable relationship between the offense and job duties, shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-15\">a) On the first occasion, be suspended for a minimum of 15 working days, be referred to the EAP, be required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>participate successfully in a treatment program designated by the EAP, and in addition, be subject to other appropriate disciplinary actions, up to and including termination from State service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\">b) On the second occasion, be suspended pending termination from State service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The relevant portions of Executive Order 01.01.1991.16 are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">B. General Policy. The State of Maryland establishes and adopts the following substance abuse policy for the Executive Branch of State Government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">(1) The State of Maryland is committed to making good faith efforts to insure a safe, secure, and drug-free workplace for its employees consistent with the Drug-Free Workplace Act as enacted by Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">(5) Employees are prohibited from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">(a) Abusing alcohol or drugs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">(b) Committing a controlled dangerous substance offense; * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">D. Drug Abuse Policy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">(2) Working under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance is a violation of this policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\">(3) An employee charged with a controlled dangerous substance offense shall report a finding of guilty, an acceptance of a plea of nolo contendere, or a probation before judgment to the appointing authority within 5 work days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">Appellant argues that all of these legal provisions require, as a prerequisite to appellant\u2019s automatic termination, that she used, possessed, or was under the influence of drugs while at work. The DPSCS does not dispute that argument, but contends that substantial evidence in the record supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that appellant used, possessed, or was under the influence of drugs at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">We refer to the decision of the ALJ, but in judicial review actions such as this, the decision under review is the final decision of the agency. <em>See, e.g., Mehrling v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>371 Md. 40, 57, 806 A.2d 662 (2002). Even though our mandates in administrative law cases remand, affirm, reverse, or modify the circuit court\u2019s judgment, we are reviewing the agency\u2019s decision, not that of the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the final agency decision <em>is </em>the ALJ\u2019s decision, because S.P.P. \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(b)(1) requires the DPSCS to delegate final decision-making authority to the Office of Administrative Hearings for employee discipline cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">We may only reverse an administrative agency\u2019s decision if it prejudiced appellant because it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-12\">(iv) is affected by other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-13\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-15\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">Md.Code (1999 Repl.Vol.), State Gov\u2019t, \u00a7 10-222(h); <em>see also Gigeous v. Eastern Corr. Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 496, 769 A.2d 912 (2001). The Court of Appeals has explained that those six specific grounds for reversal can be grouped into three levels of judicial review, depending on the amount of discretion an agency is afforded for the challenged action. <em>See Spencer v. Md. State Bd. of Pharmacy, </em>380 Md. 515, 528-30, 846 A.2d 341 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-17\">First, subsections (i) through (iv) govern the agency\u2019s purely legal conclusions. Administrative agencies have no discretion to commit legal error. Therefore, we will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>hesitate to overturn an agency\u2019s erroneous legal conclusions, although we generally respect the agency\u2019s expertise in its field and extend some degree of deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the laws it administers. <em>See, e.g., Gigeous, </em>363 Md. at 496, 769 A.2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Because agencies have more discretion in making factual determinations, our review of subsection (v) is more deferential to the agency. On this level, we limit our inquiry to whether \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in the record supports the agency\u2019s conclusions. <em>Spencer, </em>380 Md. at 529, 846 A.2d 341. More precisely stated, we decide whether \u201ca reasoning mind could have reached the same factual conclusions reached by the agency on the record before it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals has emphasized that \u201cthe heart of fact-finding is drawing inferences from facts,\u201d and we may not overturn an agency\u2019s fact-finding merely because we disagree with it; \u201cthe test is <em>reasonableness, </em>not rightness.\u201d <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Mullan, </em>381 Md. 157, 173, 848 A.2d 642 (2004) (emphasis added). Nevertheless, if an agency\u2019s decision depends upon an inference, it is our duty to examine the record to determine whether the inference reasonably follows from the evidence. <em>Travers v. Baltimore Police Dep\u2019t, </em>115 Md.App. 395, 420-21, 693 A.2d 378 (1997). This reasonableness review also applies to mixed questions of law and <em>fact </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201can application of law to a specific set of facts.\u201d <em>See Charles County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Vann, </em>382 Md. 286, 296, 855 A.2d 313 (2004); <em>Travers, </em>115 Md.App. at 420, 693 A.2d 378; Arnold Rochvarg, <em>Maryland Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 4.37 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Finally, we apply arbitrary or capricious review under subsection (vi) when the agency is neither making findings of fact nor drawing conclusions of law, but is acting in a purely discretionary capacity. <em>Spencer, </em>380 Md. at 529-30, 846 A.2d 341. This standard of review is most deferential to the agency. \u201c[A]s long as an administrative agency\u2019s exercise of discretion does not violate regulations, statutes, common law principles, due process and other constitutional require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ments, it is ordinarily unreviewable by the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 846 A.2d 341 (quoting <em>Md. State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 625 A.2d 914 (1993)). But, when an agency exercises its discretion in an arbitrary and capricious manner, we will intervene and reverse the agency\u2019s actions. Id.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">At the outset, we find the written decision of the ALJ is deficient in certain respects. For example, the decision never specified which portion of S.P.P. \u00a7 11-105 appellant violated. In addition, the decision fails to acknowledge the significance of the distinction between on-the-job and off-the-job drug use. Moreover, the decision fails to specify what facts support her conclusion that appellant used or possessed drugs <em>at work </em>and it never expressly draws the inference, as a pure matter of fact, that based on appellant\u2019s positive drug test, it is more likely than not that appellant used or possessed marijuana at work. Nor does the decision expressly conclude, as a mixed question of fact and law, that the mere presence of detectable traces of marijuana usage in appellant\u2019s body constitutes use or possession of drugs at work under S.P.P. \u00a7 11\u2014 105(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Generally, this Court can only review an agency\u2019s actions on the bases actually relied upon by the agency. <em>See, e.g., Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 123, 771 A.2d 1051 (2001). Our task is hampered by a lack of clarity in agency decisions, sometimes detrimentally so. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Crim. Injuries Comp. Bd., </em>145 Md.App. 96, 112-13, 801 A.2d 1092 (2002) (remanding because of inade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>quate agency decision-making). Under the circumstances here, however, we will review the record for substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s decision. We do so because we can discern that the ALJ either concluded, (1) as a pure matter of fact, that one can reasonably infer, based on appellant\u2019s positive drug test, that appellant actually smoked or possessed marijuana at work, or (2) as a mixed question of fact and law, one can reasonably conclude that the presence of detectable traces of marijuana use in appellant\u2019s body constitutes use or possession of drugs at work under S.P.P. \u00a7 11\u2014 105(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">A. Factual Inference</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Giving due deference to the agency\u2019s fact-finding role, we must decide whether a reasonable inference that appellant smoked, possessed, or was under the influence of marijuana at work can be drawn from the bare fact that she tested positive for marijuana use. In this inquiry, we are mindful of how limited our role is; we \u201cmay not substitute our judgment for that of the agency concerning the appropriate inferences to be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Travers, </em>115 Md.App. at 420, 693 A.2d 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The record contains no direct evidence that appellant used or possessed marijuana at work. The DPSCS theorizes that the ALJ reasonably inferred, based on appellant\u2019s failed drug test, that it is more likely than not that appellant used or possessed marijuana at work. We disagree. The inference that appellant used or possessed marijuana at work cannot reasonably be drawn from the bare fact that she tested positive for marijuana use. Rather than drawing a permissible inference, the ALJ engaged in speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The drug test itself and her admission do not provide direct evidence that appellant smoked marijuana, although the test provides very strong circumstantial evidence that she did. Thus, the ALJ could reasonably infer that appellant smoked marijuana. But, the more specific conclusion that appellant smoked, possessed, or was under the influence of marijuana at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>work does not reasonably flow from the fact that she tested positive for using marijuana. She may have; she may not have. No evidence in the record supports the ALJ\u2019s supposition that appellant used or possessed marijuana at work. Without an evidentiary basis linking appellant\u2019s marijuana use to her job, the ALJ\u2019s \u201cinference\u201d is unreasonable and cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">B. Mixed Question of Fact and Law</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Aside from the inference we have held to be unreasonable, the parties do not dispute the facts underlying this case. Nor is there any serious dispute as to the ALJ\u2019s statements of the applicable law. The parties\u2019 dispute, rather, is over the proper application of the law to the specific, undisputed facts. Therefore, we inquire whether the ALJ could reasonably conclude, as the DPSCS suggests, that \u201c[t]he presence of an illegal drug in the body of a State employee while on the job at the State workplace, as revealed by an undisputed drug test result, <em>constitutes </em>... evidence of use of that drug on the job, in violation of [S.P.P. \u00a7 ] 11-105(3).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 173, 783 A.2d 169 (2001); <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 837-38, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The salient facts are that (1) while at work, appellant had within her body detectable traces of marijuana, and (2) while at work, appellant tested positive for marijuana use. These are the totality of circumstances supporting the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that appellant \u201cused\u201d marijuana at work. Nothing in the record shows (directly or inferentially) that appellant smoked marijuana at work, or that, while at work, appellant remained under the influence of the marijuana she admitted smoking on a Saturday afternoon two or three weeks before the drug tests. The record does not show that appellant has previously been convicted of a drug-related offense. Appellant\u2019s direct supervisor never suspected appellant\u2019s marijuana use. Nevertheless, the DPSCS contends that the presence of traces of marijuana in appellant\u2019s body somehow constitutes \u201cuse\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 11-105(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The pertinent regulations distinguish between on-the-job and off-the-job drug use. Simply put, drug use at work warrants automatic termination; drug use away from work does not. If testing positive for marijuana usage, standing alone, amounts to substantial evidence of on-the-job drug use, then the provisions relating to off-the-job drug use would be superfluous. Every case of off-the-job drug use would amount to on-the-job drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The issue then becomes whether, given these undisputed facts and the ALJ\u2019s correct statements of law, a reasoning mind could conclude that appellant \u201cused\u201d marijuana at work based solely on evidence that appellant smoked marijuana away from work and had traces of that marijuana in her body while at work. Accordingly, we are constrained to conclude that the ALJ\u2019s application of the law to the facts was erroneous. The record lacks substantial evidence that appellant used marijuana at work, rather than away from work, within the meaning of S.P.P. \u00a7 11-105(3). We therefore reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.
