On February 6, 2003, White was suspended without pay for five days. She appealed the suspension on the ground that the appointing authority, WCC Chairman Thomas O\u2019Reilly, did not impose the suspension within five (5) work days following the close of her last shift after acquiring knowledge of the misconduct for which she was suspended, as required by Md.Code Ann., State Pers. <em>&amp; </em>Pens. (\u201cSPP\u201d) \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(c)(1). On June 20, 2003, Administrative Law Judge Eleanor Wilkin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>son (\u201cALJ\u201d) rescinded White\u2019s suspension, finding that her suspension was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">WCC filed a petition for judicial review seeking reversal of the ALJ\u2019s decision to rescind White\u2019s suspension. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City reversed the decision of the ALJ and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The sole issue presented for our consideration is whether the ALJ\u2019s decision to rescind White\u2019s suspension was supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error. Finding that it was, we shall reverse the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The basic facts of this case are not in dispute. At all times relevant to this appeal, White was employed as an Assistant Commissioner II with the WCC. On November 19, 2002, she testified at a hearing at the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) regarding the duties of some of her co-workers. Subsequently, on January 14, 2003, at a staff meeting called by an administrator, Judith Johnston, White made some comments that led Johnston to question whether White had given truthful testimony at the November 19th meeting at the OAH. On January 14, 2003, Johnston informed Chairman O\u2019Reilly, both verbally and in a written memorandum, that White\u2019s statements at the meeting were contrary to her sworn testimony at the OAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In response to the information received from Johnston, O\u2019Reilly \u201cimmediately ordered the transcript\u201d of the OAH hearing. He received that transcript on January 31, 2003. After reviewing the transcript, O\u2019Reilly concluded that White had not told the truth when she testified before the OAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">O\u2019Reilly met with White on February 4, 2003, to discuss the matter of her testimony at OAH and her statements at the meeting of January 14th. Two days later, O\u2019Reilly informed White that she was to be suspended without pay for five days, from February 7-13, 2003. In a Notice of Disciplinary Action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>dated February 6, 2003, White was advised that she had violated the following provisions of COMAR:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">17.04.05.04(B)(3)(being guilty of conduct that has brought, or if publicized, would bring the State into disrepute); 17.04.05.04(B)(8)(engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, misrepresentations, or illegality); and, 17.04.05.04(B)(10)(willfully making a false official statement or report).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The Notice of Disciplinary Action also advised White that the date of the incident prompting her suspension was January 14, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">On appeal, the ALJ found that O\u2019Reilly acquired knowledge of White\u2019s misconduct on January 14, 2003, and that the close of White\u2019s next shift was on January 15, 2003. The ALJ concluded that in order for White\u2019s suspension to be timely imposed pursuant to SPP \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(c)(1), it would have had to have been imposed by the close of business on January 23, 2003. Since the suspension was not imposed until February 6th, the ALJ concluded that White\u2019s suspension was not imposed in a timely manner and must be rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Appellee filed a petition for judicial review with the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">In reviewing a contested case decision made by an administrative agency, our role \u201c \u2018is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised on an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adventist Healthcare Midatlantic, Inc. v. Suburban Hosp., Inc., </em>350 Md. 104, 120, 711 A.2d 158 (1998)(quoting <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994)). In <em>Adventist Healthcare Midatlantic, Inc., </em>the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">\u201cThis standard of review is both narrow and expansive. It is narrow to the extent that reviewing courts, out of defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>ence to agency expertise, are required to affirm an agency\u2019s findings of fact, as well as its application of law to those facts, if reasonably supported by the administrative record, viewed as a whole. The standard is equally broad to the extent that reviewing courts are under no constraint to affirm an agency decision premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Insurance Com\u2019r for the State v. Engelman, </em>345 Md. 402, 411, 692 A.2d 474 (1997) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">When we review an administrative decision, \u201cwe perform precisely the same role as the circuit court.\u201d <em>Ocean City Police Department v. Marshall, </em>158 Md.App. 115, 121, 854 A.2d 299 (2004)(and cases cited therein). We look only at the decision of the agency, and not that of the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>Ordinarily, we are constrained to affirm the agency decision only for the reasons given by the agency, but where a pure question of law is involved, we may substitute our judgment for that of the administrative agency. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The case <em>sub judice </em>presents an issue of statutory construction. In <em>Smack v. Dep\u2019t. of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 835 A.2d 1175 (2003), the Court of Appeals reviewed the well settled and oft repeated canons of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">The predominant goal of statutory construction \u201cis to ascertain and implement, to the extent possible, the legislative intent.\u201d We begin the interpretive analysis with the words of the statute and, when they are clear and unambiguous, there is no need to search further. \u201c[WJe look first to the words of the statute, on the tacit theory that the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u201d In that regard, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, \u201cnot one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense.\u201d Moreover, statutes are to be interpreted so that no portion is rendered superfluous or nugatory. Words may not be added to, or removed from, an unambiguous statute in order to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature chose to use, \u201c[n]or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>[may we] engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">When the statute is ambiguous \u2014 the words do not clearly disclose the legislative intention or, while clear and unambiguous viewed in isolation, the terms are ambiguous when it is part of a larger statutory scheme, we look for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other sources extraneous to the statute itself, as well \u201cas the structure of the statute, how it relates to other laws ... its general purpose, and the \u2018relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.\u2019 \u201d We pointed out in <em>Witte [v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160 (2002)] that \u201c[o]ne aspect of examining these indicia is the presumption, which itself is a rule of construction, that the Legislature \u2018intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law,\u2019 such that no part of the statute is rendered meaningless and nugatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">In that regard, where the statute to be construed is a part of an entire statutory scheme, construction of the provisions of the scheme must be done in the context of that scheme. When, in that context, two statutes conflict and one is general and the other specific, \u201cthe statutes may be harmonized by viewing the more specific statute as an exception to the more general one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\"><em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 304-06, 835 A.2d 1175 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">With these standards in mind, we shall examine the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Maryland law permits an appointing authority to take a number of disciplinary actions against an employee, including suspension without pay. SPP \u00a7 11-104(3). The duty of an appointing authority prior to imposing such a sanction is set forth in SPP \u00a7 11-106, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">(a) <em>Procedure. </em>\u2014 Before taking any disciplinary action related to employee misconduct, an appointing authority shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ7\">(1) investigate the alleged misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>(2) meet with the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">(3) consider any mitigating circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">(4) determine the appropriate disciplinary action, if any, to be imposed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">(5) give the employee a written notice of the disciplinary action to be taken and the employee\u2019s appeal rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">(b) <em>Time limit. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, an appointing authority may impose any disciplinary action no later than 30 days after the appointing authority acquires knowledge of the misconduct for which the disciplinary action is imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">(c) <em>Suspension. </em>\u2014 (1) An appointing authority may suspend an employee without pay no later than 5 workdays following the close of the employee\u2019s next shift after the appointing authority acquires knowledge of the misconduct for which the suspension is imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">(2) Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and employee leave days are excluded in calculating the 5-workday period under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Both subsections (b) and (c) contain similar language permitting disciplinary action or suspension when \u201cthe appointing authority acquires knowledge of the misconduct for which the\u201d disciplinary action or suspension is imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">This phrase was considered by the Court of Appeals in <em>Western Correctional Institution v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 807 A.2d 32 (2002). In that case, the high court recognized that, when viewed in context, the phrase \u201cis not ambiguous and, in fact, clearly pinpoints when the time limit for imposing disciplinary action starts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">All three subsections of \u00a7 11-106 are interrelated; one can not be read and interpreted without reading and interpreting the others. Subsection (a) prescribes what must be done before imposing discipline, subsection (b) sets the general time limitation on when the imposition of discipline must occur and subsection (c) provides a special time limit for suspensions without pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>It is significant that one of the prerequisites for the imposition of discipline is the conduct of an investigation of the alleged misconduct. To be sure, as the Court of Special Appeals observed, \u201c[tjhere is an important distinction between (1) information that indicates the necessity for an investigation, and (2) the completion of an investigation required by \u00a7 11-106(a)(1).\u201d <em>Geiger, </em>130 Md.App. at 569, 747 A.2d at 701. The intermediate appellate court, thus, drew a distinction between the quantum of knowledge the appointing authority must have at the beginning of the process and at the end, when the investigation is complete, settling on a level of knowledge sufficient to justify the imposition of discipline. Section 11-106(b) does not, by its terms, state a distinction between the amount of knowledge necessary to initiate an investigation and that required to discipline. It simply prohibits the imposition of discipline more than thirty days after knowledge of the misconduct for which the disciplinary action is imposed is acquired. Knowledge sufficient to order an investigation is knowledge of the misconduct for which discipline was imposed, if discipline ultimately is imposed for that misconduct. It is not at that stage in the process, to be sure, proof as to who is the responsible person and may not even be knowledge as to who that person is. Section 11-106, however, is not person specific; it is situation and fact based. Thus, the knowledge that triggers the running of the thirty day period need not, and may not, although it generally will, identify the employee ultimately disciplined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">We hold that, viewed in context, \u00a7 11-106 gives the appointing authority 30 days to conduct an investigation, meet with the employee the investigation identifies as culpable, consider any mitigating circumstances, determine the appropriate action and give notice to the employee of the disciplinary action taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>Geiger, </em>371 Md. at 143-45, 807 A.2d 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In reaching this holding, the Court of Appeals examined the legislative history of Section 11-106. The Court considered, among other things, Executive Order No. 01.01.1995.15, dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>June 9, 1995, by which Governor Glendening established a Task Force to Reform the State Personnel Management System; the Task Force\u2019s Final Report of June 19, 1996; and documents in the legislative file submitted as the legislation progressed through the General Assembly. From these materials, the Court concluded that the legislature intended to establish a specific time period in which an appointing authority must investigate, meet with the employee, and impose discipline. Based on the language of the statute and the legislative history, the Court in <em>Geiger </em>determined that the legislature intended to establish a bright line rule designed to afford certainty and uniformity in the application of disciplinary policies throughout the various State agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Section ll-106(c)(l) requires an appointing authority to give an employee notice of suspension within 5 work days after the close of the employee\u2019s next shift after acquiring knowledge of employee misconduct sufficient to order an investigation. The reasoning articulated in <em>Geiger </em>requires us to hold, <em>sub judice, </em>that any suspension imposed outside of the 5 work day time limit is violative of the statute and cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that since the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Geiger, </em>the General Assembly has not amended the statute to modify the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the time limits established in Section 11-106. The General Assembly is presumed to be aware of the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of its enactments. <em>Forbes v. State, </em>324 Md. 335, 342-43, 597 A.2d 427 (1991); <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 210, 438 A.2d 1301 (1981). <em>Geiger, </em>371 Md. at 144, 807 A.2d 32. Since it has not legislatively overturned the interpretation articulated in <em>Geiger,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we can only conclude that the General Assembly has acquiesced in that interpretation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>In the case at hand, the ALJ found that the appointing authority, Chairman O\u2019Reilly, was informed of White\u2019s alleged misconduct on January 14, 2003, that White\u2019s next shift ended on January 15, 2003, and that 5 work days from January 15th was January 23, 2003. These findings were supported by substantial evidence, including the testimony of both Chairman O\u2019Reilly and White and White\u2019s time sheet for the month of January 2003. Because White was not given notice of her suspension until February 6, 2003, her suspension was untimely and must be rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENTERING AN ORDER AFFIRMING THE DECISION AND ORDER OF THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS DATED JUNE 20, 2003; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\">.
