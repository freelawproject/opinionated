(\u201cGiant\u201d), in the Circuit Court for Harford County, claiming that Giant, by negligently allowing water to remain on the floor, had caused her to fall and injure herself. The case was bifurcated and tried before a jury on the issue of negligence only. At the conclusion of plaintiffs case, the trial judge granted a motion for judgment in favor of Giant because, in the trial judge\u2019s view, Maans had failed to prove that Giant had either constructive or actual pre-injury notice of the wet floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Maans filed this timely appeal in which she asserts that the motion for judgment should not have been granted because (1) she produced sufficient evidence to raise a jury question as to whether Giant had either actual or constructive knowledge of the defective condition that caused her injury and (2) alternatively, there was no need to prove that Giant had either constructive or actual knowledge of the dangerous condition because her proof was sufficient to meet the requirements of the \u201cmode-of-operation\u201d rule under which proof that Giant had actual or constructive knowledge of the hazard, prior to injury, was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">On Sunday, May 23, 1999, at approximately 1 p.m., Maans and her fifteen-year-old niece, Amanda Randolph (\u201cRandolph\u201d), were shopping at a busy Giant store. After selecting several items for purchase, Maans and Randolph proceeded to one of the checkout lines to pay for the items. Randolph stayed in the checkout line, but Maans walked away from it in the hope of finding a shorter one. Maans then turned around and began walking back toward her niece. When she was about \u201cone cart length\u201d away from the line in which her niece stood, Maans slipped and fell. She tried to avoid the fall by grabbing onto the cart of a woman in front of her but nevertheless landed on her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Maans, who was approximately six-and-one-half-months pregnant, felt immediate pain in her back and was unable to get up. She was transported by ambulance to a local hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Maans did not see anything on the floor either before, or after her fall. And, while on the floor waiting for the ambulance, she never felt water, nor did she sense that her clothes were wet.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Maans recalled that while she was on the floor she heard the assistant store manager, Roberta Braswell (\u201cBraswell\u201d), tell a man, who was standing nearby and holding a roll of paper towels in his hands, \u201cto get up all the water off the floor.\u201d Later, when the paramedics arrived, she heard Bras-well tell the paramedics \u201cto be careful so they didn\u2019t slip and fall in the water.\u201d Maans did not know how the water got on the floor or how long it had been there prior to her fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Randolph saw her aunt fall but did not see what caused it. Afterward, because she was preoccupied with helping her aunt, she did not inspect the floor. She remembered, however, that as one of the female paramedics was picking her aunt up, \u201cthe manager said, \u2018Watch out, there\u2019s water.\u2019 \u201d Randolph had no idea how the water, mentioned by the manager, got onto the floor. According to Randolph\u2019s testimony, Maans was about ten feet away from her when she fell. She did not notice whether her aunt\u2019s clothing was wet after the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Braswell was the ranking store employee on duty at the time that Maans fell and was responsible for the investigation of the accident. Braswell testified that she did not see Maans fall, but when she arrived at the scene of the accident, she did find \u201c[a] couple of drops of Citra soda on the floor.\u201d She followed the drops back to a shopping cart pushed by a customer who stood in one of the checkout lines. The customer\u2019s cart had a twelve-pack of Citra soda on the bottom rack. According to Braswell, the drops led directly from the customer\u2019s shopping cart back to where Maans fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Braswell filled out an accident report on May 24, 1999, which was the day after the accident. In the report, Braswell quotes Maans as saying \u201cthat she fell on water on floor.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>report also says that the floor was \u201clast cleaned\u201d on \u201c5/24/99\u201d by \u201cMatt Pietrowski.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Braswell testified that it was not store policy to keep records of when mopping and cleaning of the floors occurred. Instead, Giant\u2019s policy required that every employee look for spills and other hazards, and if the employee discovered any hazard, it was the employee\u2019s responsibility to clean up the hazard immediately or call for a porter to do so and, when appropriate, \u201cput a \u2018wet floor\u2019 sign\u201d at the place of danger. There was, however, no one employee whose exclusive assignment was to patrol the store looking for spills or hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">At the time of the subject accident, Matt Pietrowski (\u201cPiet-rowski\u201d) was a courtesy clerk. A Giant courtesy clerk has numerous duties, including bagging and loading groceries and cleaning up around the front of the store. At trial, excerpts of Pietrowski\u2019s deposition were read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Even though his name was on the accident report as the person who had last cleaned the floor prior to the accident,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pietrowski had no recollection concerning the fall or any actions he took relevant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">About four months after the accident, Pietrowski became a porter. The duties of a porter at Giant are to \u201csweep the floor, empty trash cans, mop if there was clean up, and any little odd jobs around the store that needed to be done.\u201d His duties as a porter also included patrolling around the store \u201cpretty much at all times except when ... on break.\u201d If a porter saw a hazard on the floor, he or she was \u201csupposed to take care of it right away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">David Miller (\u201cMiller\u201d), the store manager at the time of the accident, was not on duty when Maans fell, and as a consequence, he had no recollection of the incident. His testimony concerned Giant\u2019s store policies. According to Miller, one responsibility of a store porter was to walk through the store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>looking for spills. The floors were \u201calways cleaned in the morning prior to opening, and then cleaned throughout the day as needed.\u201d Except for the morning cleaning, there were \u201cno set times\u201d for the floors to be recleaned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Miller, like Braswell, testified that all Giant employees were responsible for maintaining the area of the store where he or she worked and, if hazards were spotted, to either clean up the hazard or call someone else to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The Court of Appeals has adopted the formulation enunciated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 343 (1965), which sets forth the general duty a private landowner, such as Giant, owes to its invitees. <em>Deering Woods Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Spoon, </em>377 Md. 250, 263, 833 A.2d 17 (2003). Section 343 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his invitees by a condition on the land if, but only if, he</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">(a) knows or by the exercise of reasonable care would discover the condition, and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such invitees, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">(b) should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger, or will fail to protect themselves against it, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">(c) fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 343 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">In <em>Burkowske v. Church Hospital Corp., </em>50 Md.App. 515, 439 A.2d 40 (1982), we applied the Section 343 standard in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>case in which an invitee sat on a bench in a hospital waiting room and was injured when the bench collapsed. <em>Id. </em>at 516, 522, 439 A.2d 40. Judge Alan Wilner, for this Court, said:</p>\n<p id=\"AKQk\">\u201cIt was incumbent upon appellant to produce admissible evidence that (1) appellee failed in its duty to make reasonable periodic inspections of the bench, <em>and </em>(2) <em>had it made such reasonable inspections, it would have discovered a dangerous condition. See Smith v. Kelly, </em>246 Md. 640, 229 A.2d 79 (1967); <em>Bona, v. Graefe, </em>264 Md. 69, 285 A.2d 607 (1972); <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. v. Hicks, </em>25 Md.App. 503, 337 A.2d 744, <em>cert den. </em>275 Md. 750 (1975). It simply does not suffice to claim the obvious \u2014 that if appellee had inspected the bench at the instant before its collapse, it would (or may) have noticed the condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 439 A.2d 40 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">At the time of the accident, Maans was Giant\u2019s invitee. \u201cIt is the law in Maryland ... that the proprietor of a store owes a duty to ... [an invitee] to exercise ordinary care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and will be liable for injuries sustained in consequence of a failure to do so.\u201d <em>Rawls v. Hochschild, Kohn &amp; Co., </em>207 Md. 113, 117, 113 A.2d 405 (1955).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">The customer is entitled to assume that the proprietor will exercise reasonable care to ascertain the condition of the premises, and if he discovers any unsafe condition he will either take such action as will correct the condition and make it reasonably safe or give a warning of the unsafe condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 117-18, 113 A.2d 405 (citations omitted). \u201cThe duties of a business invitor thus include the obligation to warn invitees of known hidden dangers, a duty to inspect, and a duty to take reasonable precautions against foreseeable dangers.\u201d <em>Ten-nant v. Shoppers Food Warehouse Md. Corp., </em>115 Md.App. 381, 388, 693 A.2d 370 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">A store operator, such as Giant, is not the insurer of the invitee\u2019s safety. <em>Moulden v. Greenbelt Consumer Servs., Inc., </em>239 Md. 229, 232, 210 A.2d 724 (1965). In addition, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>burden is upon the customer to show that the proprietor created the dangerous condition or had actual or constructive knowledge of its existence\u201d prior to the invitee\u2019s injury. <em>Lexington Mkt. Auth. v. Zappala, </em>233 Md. 444, 446, 197 A.2d 147 (1964) (citations omitted); <em>see also Moulden, </em>239 Md. at 232, 210 A.2d 724, and <em>Tennant, </em>115 Md.App. at 389, 693 A.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Approximately seventy years ago, the Court of Appeals, in <em>Moore v. American Stores Co., </em>169 Md. 541, 550-51, 182 A. 436 (1936), spelled out in detail the duty that the operator of a grocery store owes to its patron. The grocery store owner/operator has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">a duty to exercise reasonable and ordinary care to see that its premises were in such a condition that its customers might safely use them while visiting the store upon its invitation to buy its wares.... In the performance of that duty it [is] required to exercise reasonable care to discover conditions which, if known to it, it should have realized involved an unreasonable risk to such patrons.... Any \u2022 breach of that duty resulting in injury to one lawfully on its premises as an invitee would constitute negligence, <em>if, but only if, it knew, or by the exercise of reasonable care could have discovered, the conditions which created the peni, and had no reason to believe that its invitees would realize the \u25a0 risk involved therein.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Recently, in <em>Deering Woods, supra, </em>377 Md. at 264, 833 A.2d 17, the Court of Appeals quoted <em>Moore, supra, </em>with approval, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">.It is not necessary that there be proof that the invit[o]r had actual knowledge of the conditions creating the peril; it is . enough if it appear that it could have discovered them by the exercise of ordinary care, <em>so that, if it is shown that the conditions have existed for a time sufficient to permit one, under a duty to know of them, to. discover them, had he exercised reasonable care, his failure to discover them may </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>in itself be evidence of negligence sufficient to charge him with knowledge of them.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In <em>Rehn v. Westfield Am., </em>153 Md.App. 586, 593, 837 A.2d 981 (2003), Judge Adkins, for this Court, succinctly summarized the evidence that a customer must put forward in a slip- and-fall case against the invitor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">The evidence must show not only that a dangerous condition existed, but also that the proprietor <em>\u201chad actual or constructive knowledge of it, and that that knowledge was gained in sufficient time to give the owner the opportunity to remove it or to warn the invitee.\u201d Keene v. Arlan\u2019s Dep\u2019t Store of Baltimore, Inc., </em>35 Md.App. 250, 256, 370 A.2d 124 (1977). Whether there has been sufficient time for a business proprietor to discover, cure, or clean up a dangerous condition depends on the circumstances surrounding the fall. <em>See Deering Woods Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Spoon, </em>377 Md. 250, 833 A.2d 17 (2003). \u201c \u2018What will amount to sufficient time depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, and involves consideration of the nature of the danger, the number of persons likely to be affected by it, the diligence required to discover or prevent it, opportunities and means of knowledge, the foresight which a person of ordinary care and prudence would be expected to exercise under the circumstances, and the foreseeable consequences of the conditions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Moore v. Am. Stores Co., </em>169 Md. 541, 551, 182 A. 436 (1936)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Maans argues that she presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that she slipped on water rather than droplets of Citra soda,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as testified to by Braswell. We agree. Evidence that the assistant manager, immediately after Maans\u2019s fall, directed a person with towels in his hand \u201cto clean up all that water\u201d was sufficient evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>standing alone, to allow a fact-finder to infer that Maans slipped on water, not on Citra soda.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Maans also contends that she presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that Giant had, prior to the accident, constructive knowledge of the presence of water on the floor. In support of that contention, appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aon\">First, there was no evidence as to when the area where Maans fell was last inspected or cleaned; [sjecond, Giant did not specifically assign an employee to look for spills and other hazards; [tjhird, Maans fell right near one of Giant\u2019s employee\u2019s work stations; and [f]ourth, this employee [the cashier] was never told to look for hazards near her check out line. These facts, when considered together, at least present a jury question as to whether Giant should have known about the water on the floor. In other words, Maans presented sufficient evidence to at least present a jury question as to whether Giant had constructive notice of the condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">(References to record extract omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">It is true that Giant produced no evidence during appellant\u2019s case as to when the area where appellant fell was last inspected or cleaned, but appellant\u2019s statement that \u201cGiant did not specifically assign an employee to look for spills and other hazards\u201d is potentially misleading. The relevant testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">Q [ATTORNEY FOR APPELLANT]: On May 23, 1999, Giant did not assign any employees to walk through the store and look for hazards; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">A [BRASWELL]: That\u2019s everyone\u2019s job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">Q: Was there a specific employee assigned to that job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>A: Not specifically for that one duty, <em>but we all do that as we go through the store. </em>I guess I would be the one that would be most inclined to have that as one of my job descriptions touring the store. It\u2019s continual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Later in Braswell\u2019s testimony, she estimated that 98 percent of her time was spent walking the floors of the store looking for hazards. She also testified that any employee who sees a hazardous condition on the floor is responsible for either cleaning it up or getting someone else to do so. Braswell\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Pietrowski, who testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">Q [ATTORNEY FOR APPELLANT]: Now, in terms of whether things were on the floor, were you required or were you supposed to patrol around the store and look for anything that could probably [sic] be on the floor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">A: Well, we were always walking around the store, pretty much at all times except when we were on break. So you don\u2019t have an assigned route, but yes, we were always walking around the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">Q: And then if you noticed something on the floor, you were supposed to take care of it right away?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">Miller, the store manager, also corroborated Braswell\u2019s testimony. He testified that throughout the day \u201cemployees are looking down at the floor going about their business, and if they see a spill it\u2019s their job to either clean it up themselves or call for someone else to clean it up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">It may well be true, as appellant intimates, that the cash-register operators at Giant should have been, but were not, told to look out for spills near the checkout line. But that fact is here irrelevant because appellant produced not one scintilla of evidence to show that if any of the cash-register operators had looked they would have seen the water. No evidence was elicited as to how far any cash-register operator was from the spot where the fall occurred. All that was shown was that Maans fell approximately one \u201ccart length\u201d away from the line in which her niece stood and that her niece was standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>somewhere in a register line. There was no testimony as to how long the line was or how far away Maans\u2019s niece was from the cash-register operator, nor was there evidence as to how far <em>any </em>cashier was from the water. Additionally, in regard to the issue of what the cash-register operator would have seen if she had looked, there was no evidence produced as to how much water was on the floor to be seen, nor was there evidence that a cashier, if he or she had looked, could have seen the transparent liquid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Appellant contends that constructive notice may be proven by introduction of evidence that, prior to the accident, defendant failed to make reasonable inspection of the premises. We shall assume, purely for purposes of argument, that Giant breached its duty to make reasonable inspections. The adoption of this assumption, however, does not aid appellant. Appellant failed to produce any evidence that had Giant made reasonable inspections prior to the accident it would have discovered the water on the floor in time to prevent the accident. For all that was shown by appellant, the water could have been spilled by a customer seconds before her fall. This is fatal to her argument that Giant is liable because it breached its duty to make reasonable inspections. <em>See Burkowske, </em>50 Md.App. at 523, 439 A.2d 40 (To prove liability, an invitee must show that if the owner/occupier had made reasonable inspections, the defect would have been discovered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>time to prevent the invitee\u2019s injury.). <em>See also Deering Woods, </em>377 Md. at 267-68, 833 A.2d 17 (to show constructive knowledge, invitee must demonstrate that defective condition existed long enough to permit one under a duty to inspect to discover the defect and remedy it prior to the injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Appellant, relying on a Court of Appeals case decided approximately seventy-six years ago <em>(Dickey v. Hochschild, Kohn &amp; Co., </em>157 Md. 448, 146 A. 282 (1929)), contends that an invitee is not required to prove that if a reasonable inspection had been made by the store owner, such an inspection would have revealed the defect in sufficient time to abate the danger prior to the accident. Tn <em>Dickey, </em>the plaintiff was walking down some stairs when her left foot caught on a step; she was thrown off balance and fell to the bottom of some stairs. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 146 A. 282. Immediately after the accident, plaintiffs shoe was observed to be \u201cso tightly wedged between the floor of the first step down from the landing and the metal strap nearest the riser, that, to remove it, it was necessary to pull it out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449, 146 A. 282. Plaintiff introduced proof showing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">the accident was caused by the loose end of an iron strap being raised above the surface of the step. It appears that the strap was designed to be fastened to the step by a screw, for the fast part was so fastened, and there was a hole for the screw in the loose end, but there was no screw in it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 452, 146 A. 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">E\u2019orty-two years after <em>Dickey </em>was decided, the Court of Appeals in <em>Leannarda v. Lansburgh\u2019s, </em>260 Md. 701, 706, 273 A.2d 149 (1971), summarized the holding and import of <em>Dickey. </em>The Court did so in a slip-and-fall case in which the plaintiff tripped after one of her spiked heels caught in a rug on store premises. The <em>Leannarda </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">In <em>Dickey </em>the plaintiffs heel became wedged between a metal tread and the wooden step supporting it. <em>We held, it was proper to submit the issue of negligence to the jury since the only permissible inferences were that the steps </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>were defectively designed or constructed, or else there was a failure to inspect. </em>There was evidence that the screws with which the tread was fastened to the step were loose immediately after the accident. Since the plaintiff could not have created the defective condition <em>it was possible to infer that it had existed for some time before her injury. </em>Such an inference is unavailable here. As in <em>Selby [v. S. Kann Sons Co., </em>73 F.2d 853 (D.C.Cir.1934),] it is quite possible that [Leannarda\u2019s] stumble created the alleged defect. We see a clear distinction between a metal tread which could have been loosened only by a screwdriver or a long period of sustained wear and tear, and a carpet seam none the worse for wear but vulnerable to the spiked heels of [Leannarda] or an earlier customer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 706-07, 273 A.2d 149 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The case at hand is also distinguishable from <em>Dickey </em>in that here it is impossible to infer, legitimately, that the defect (water on the floor) had existed for some appreciable time before the injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">As mentioned earlier, appellant stresses that \u201cthere was no evidence as to when the area where Maans fell was last inspected or cleaned.\u201d Nevertheless, the issue as to when the area was last cleaned was irrelevant because there was no evidence that the floor\u2019s lack of cleanliness caused the accident. Moreover, while it is true that there was no proof as to when the floor was last inspected prior to the accident, that lack of proof, standing alone, is insufficient to prove liability. <em>See Deering Woods, </em>377 Md. at 267-68, 833 A.2d 17, and <em>Burkowske, </em>50 Md.App. at 523, 439 A.2d 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">In support of her constructive-notice argument, appellant also contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>It is true that self-service grocery store owners are not required by statute to maintain ... [sweep records]. However, if they fail to maintain such records, they do so at their peril, since if in fact they cannot produce any testimony or records to document when the area was last inspected, a jury is entitled to conclude that they did not satisfy their duty to inspect. To hold otherwise would place an unreasonable burden on plaintiffs. Customers do not have access to a grocery store\u2019s records or employees. In cases where no sweep logs are kept, it is almost impossible for the customer to gather evidence as to when the area was last inspected and/or cleaned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Appellant cites no Maryland authority supporting the aforementioned <em>ipse dixit, </em>and we know of none. The duty of a store owner to an invitee, such as appellant, is well established in Maryland, as can be seen by the cases cited <em>supra. </em>Under Maryland law, the owner/operator of a store has no duty to an invitee to keep records in order to lighten the invitee\u2019s burden of proving negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Appellant also argues that she presented evidence sufficient to prove that \u201cGiant had actual notice of the water\u201d prior to the accident. According to appellant, \u201ca reasonable inference can be drawn that the water was on the floor because an employee of Giant spot mopped the floor.\u201d The sole factual predicate for her \u201cactual notice\u201d argument is expressed by appellant as follows: \u201cGiant employees ... testified that Giant will spot mop the floor, including the area around the cash registers, if it is necessary to clean up a hazard or if the floor is dirty.\u201d From this accurate summary of pertinent testimony, appellant continues, \u201cAs Giant does not keep any records nor [were] any Giant employees able to testify when the area where [pjlaintiff fell was last mopped ..., a jury certainly could conclude that the plaintiff fell on water after the area where she fell had been mopped by a Giant employee.\u201d As authority for the foregoing proposition, appellant cites <em>Moore v. American Stores, </em>169 Md. 541, 182 A. 436 (1936); <em>Grzboski v. Bernheimer Leader Stores, </em>156 Md. 146, 143 A. 706 (1928); <em>Tennant v. Shoppers Food Warehouse Md.

None of the cases cited support appellant\u2019s argument. There simply was no evidence from which a jury could find that the area of the store had been \u201cspot mopped\u201d at any time here relevant. The only way the jury could conclude that the water on the floor was caused by spot mopping would be if the jury engaged in raw speculation or conjecture, which is forbidden. <em>See Moulden, supra, </em>239 Md. at 232, 210 A.2d 724 (\u201cThe evidence is legally sufficient to warrant submission of a case to the jury if it rises above speculation or conjecture....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Appellant urges us to reject the requirement that an invitee must prove that the invitor had actual or constructive preinjury notice of a defect and substitute for that requirement the \u201cmode-of-operation rule.\u201d Twenty-one of our sister states have adopted that rule, <em>viz: </em>Arizona, <em>Chiara v.

The key to the application of the mode-of-operation rule is the reasonable anticipation of the patron\u2019s carelessness under the circumstances. <em>Tom v. S.S. Kresge Co., Inc., </em>130 Ariz. 30, 633 P.2d 439, 441 (1981). Under the mode-of-operation rule, actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition prior to an accident is immaterial. <em>Gump, </em>5 P.3d at 441.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The \u201cmode-of-operation\u201d rule was explained by the Arizona Supreme Court in <em>Chiara </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">Courts in Arizona and in other jurisdictions have mitigated this seeming inequity [of requiring that the store owner have prior actual or constructive notice of the defect] by developing the \u201cmode-of-operation\u201d rule. The \u201cmode-of-operation\u201d rule looks to a business\u2019s choice of a particular mode-of-operation and not events surrounding the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>accident. Under the rule, the plaintiff is not required to prove notice if the proprietor could reasonably anticipate that hazardous conditions would regularly arise. <em>See Bloom v. Fry\u2019s Food Stores, </em>130 Ariz. 447, 636 P.2d 1229 (1981); <em>Tom v. S.S. Kresge Co., </em>130 Ariz. 30, 633 P.2d 439 (1981). In other words, a third person\u2019s independent negligence is no longer the source of liability, and the plaintiff is freed from the burden of discovering and proving a third person\u2019s actions. <em>A plaintiff\u2019s proof of a particular mode-of-operation simply substitutes for the traditional elements of a prima facie case </em>\u2014 the <em>existence of a dangerous condition and notice of a dangerous condition. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">The mode-of-operation rule is of limited application because nearly every business enterprise produces some risk of customer interference. If the mode-of-operation rule applied whenever customer interference was conceivable, the rule would engulf the remainder of negligence law. A plaintiff could get to the jury in most cases simply by presenting proof that a store\u2019s customer could have conceivably produced the hazardous condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">For this reason, a particular mode-of-operation only falls within the mode-of-operation rule when a business can reasonably anticipate that hazardous conditions will regularly arise. <em>Cf. Jamison v. Mark C. Bloome Co., </em>112 Cal. App.3d 570, 169 Cal.Rptr. 399, 401-02 (1980) (business not liable to persons injured on spilled oil because business has no reason to anticipate vandalism of oil drums); <em>Overstreet v. Gibson Product Co., </em>558 S.W.2d 58, 61 (Tex.Civ.App.1977) (grocery store owner not liable for customer bitten by a rattlesnake). A plaintiff must demonstrate the foreseeability of third-party interference before Arizona courts will dispense with traditional notice requirements. Many of the cases upholding the applicability of the mode-of-operation rule have accordingly involved open food displays. <em>E.g., Bloom v. Fry\u2019s Food Stores, Inc., supra </em>(grapes); <em>Tom v. S.S. Kresge Co., supra </em>(soft drinks); <em>Rhodes v. El Rancho Markets, </em>9 Ariz.App. 576, 454 P.2d 1016 (1969)(lettuce); <em>Jasko v. F.W. Woolworth Co., </em>177 Colo. 418, 494 P.2d 839 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>(1972)(pizza sold by the slice); <em>Gonzales v. Winn-Dixie Louisiana, Inc., </em>326 So.2d 486 (La.1976) (glass bottle of olive oil); <em>Bozza v. Vornado, Inc., </em>42 N.J. 355, 200 A.2d 777 (1964) (self-service cafeteria); <em>Ciminski v. Finn Corp., </em>13 Wash.App. 815, 537 P.2d 850 (1975) (self-service cafeteria).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">733 P.2d at 285-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Appellant contends that under the mode-of-operation rule she produced sufficient evidence that Giant could have reasonably anticipated that customers \u201cmight drop items when placing them on the conveyor belt in the checkout line.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Although a minority of our sister states have adopted the mode-of-operation rule advocated by appellant, that rule is at odds with the precedent (cited supra) from this Court and the Maryland Court of Appeals requiring that an invitee who sues an invitor for a defective condition on the premises must prove that, prior to the injury, the landowner had actual or constructive knowledge of the defective condition in sufficient time to remedy or warn of it prior to the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">In sum, the mode-of-operation rule, unlike the Maryland rule, does not require the invitee to prove \u201ctime on the floor.\u201d The Maryland rule has two purposes: (1) it requires a demonstration of how long the dangerous condition existed prior to the accident so that the fact-finder can decide whether the storekeeper would have discovered it if he or she had exercised ordinary care; and (2) it also shows that the interval between inspections was at least as long as the time on the floor. Thus, proof of time on the floor is relevant, not only as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>to notice but also as to the issue of what care was exercised. <em>See </em>Winegar, <em>supra, </em>41 UCLA L.Rev. at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Doing away with the requirement that the invitee must prove how long the dangerous condition existed pre-injury is the functional equivalent of doing away with the requirement that the plaintiff prove that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury. This case illustrates that point. Without \u201ctime on the floor\u201d evidence, the storekeeper would be potentially liable even though there is no way of telling whether there was anything Giant could have done that would have avoided the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-10\">. The accident report states that the floor was last cleaned on 5/24/99, which was the day <em>after </em>the accident. Braswell, the writer of the report, apparently mistakenly wrote the wrong date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-14\">. Maans asserts that she presented evidence that the Giant store \"was short staffed on the date of the incident\u201d because \"the duty to clean up spills normally would have been assigned to a porter,\u201d but in this case the store used Pietrowski, a courtesy clerk, to clean up the water that caused her to fall. There was no evidence that Giant was short staffed, nor was there any evidence that Pietrowski cleaned up the spill in question. Pietrowski\u2019s name appears in the records of Giant as the person who \u201clast cleaned\u201d the floor in question \u2014 not the person who removed the hazard that caused Maans's fall.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\">. Citra Soda, like water, is a colorless liquid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b652-11\">. In <em>Keene v. Arlan's Dep\u2019t Store of Baltimore, Inc., </em>35 Md.App. 250, 252, 370 A.2d 124 (1977), a cashier, shortly after the plaintiff\u2019s fall, blurted out: \"I told them if this wasn't cleaned up, someone\u2019s going to fall.\u201d We held in <em>Keene </em>that the cashier\u2019s blurt was an excited utterance from which the jury could infer legitimately that, prior to the fall, the cashier notified her principal, the store owner, \"that a dangerous condition existed in the premises and that an invitee might suffer injuries as a result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257, 370 A.2d 124.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\">. To support her contention that constructive notice can be inferred from the mere fact that the fall occurred \"right near one of Giant's work stations,\u201d Maans cites to cases from other jurisdictions. But, in <em>Lusby v. Baltimore Transit </em>Co., 195 Md. 118, 72 A.2d 754 (1950), the Court of Appeals rejected an analogous contention. In <em>Lusby, </em>the appellant slipped and fell on a grease spot while exiting a bus. The plaintifhappellant argued that the evidence demonstrated constructive notice because the grease spot \"was plainly visible to [the bus operator], had he looked at the spot where the foreign substance was located.\" <em>Id. </em>at 122, 72 A.2d 754. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">There is no allegation that he [the bus operator] did, in fact, see it [the grease spot].... Just why it is claimed that the operator could have seen it, if he had looked, but that the injured appellant did not see it, is not explained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 122-23, 72 A.2d 754.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\">. The case <em>sub judice </em>is also distinguishable from <em>Dickey </em>in that it could not be inferred, legitimately, that the injury was caused by defendant's defective construction, nor can it be said that Giant produced no evidence that it exercised ordinary care to see that the floor was kept in a safe condition. Here, appellant\u2019s own witness, Braswell, testified uncontradictedly that, while on duty, she spent 98 percent of her time patrolling the store and looking out for possible dangers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">.

In <em>Chiara, </em>the Arizona Court of Appeals held that the plaintiff had the burden of proving that a hazardous condition, like the one that caused the plaintiff\u2019s fall, could reasonably have been anticipated prior to plaintiff\u2019s injury. It is doubtful that Maans\u2019s proof, in the case at hand, was suflicient to prove that the fall occurred when a customer was loading the checkout conveyor belt. Maans was about one cart lenglh away from the checkout line when she fell, but the record is silent as to how far she was from the conveyor belt (as opposed to the line) when she was injured. Thus, it is not at all clear that the water on the floor was caused by a customer who dropped an item in the checkout line.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
