Marshall presents the following issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-13\">I. Did the circuit court err in reversing an order of the Commission that found Marshall\u2019s entire award of 25% permanent partial disability attributable to the later of two claims involving similar parts of the body?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-14\">II. Assuming that the Commission\u2019s award was attributable to both claims, did the circuit court err in finding that the Commission was required to apportion its award between that claim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Finding no error in the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the University, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">On May 21, 1999, while walking down a hallway at work, Marshall slipped on a grape and fell, landing on both knees. Due to the injury sustained from this accident, Marshall underwent arthroscopic surgery on her right knee. On April 10, 2001, Marshall was involved in a second accident at work when a chair Marshall was attempting to sit on collapsed, causing her to fall to the ground. Marshall claimed injury to her \u201cshoulders, ankles, lower back, and not too much to her knees\u201d from this fall. Marshall then underwent two more surgeries, one for her left knee and one for her left elbow. Marshall was employed by the University at the time of both incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Marshall filed claims for both accidents with the Commission, which she thereafter reopened, alleging permanent partial disability (\u201cPPD\u201d) to various parts of her body.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The claims were consolidated, and on November 15, 2002, the Commission held a hearing, during which the University contested causal relationship and sought an apportionment of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The Commission then issued an award of compensation, ruling that Marshall sustained 25% PPD \u201cas a result of the injury to the right leg (knee), back, left foot (ankle), left leg (knee), and left arm[.]\u201d The Commission awarded compensation \u201cat the rate of $223.00, payable weekly, beginning January 13, 2002, for a period of 125 weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The University thereafter filed a Motion for Rehearing with the Commission, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>failed to apportion the 25% PPD finding between the 1999 and the 2001 incidents. The Commission denied the rehearing motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The University then filed petitions for review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, which consolidated the cases into one action. The University next filed a motion for summary judgment, and after hearing argument, the circuit court, by written order: (1) granted summary judgment to the University, (2) rescinded and annulled the Commission\u2019s award, and (3) remanded to the Commission to schedule a hearing in both claims in order to apportion the percentage of PPD among the two accidents. Marshall then filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">On appeal, Commission decisions are presumed to be <em>prima facie </em>correct. Md.Code (1991, 1999 RepLVol., 2004 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 9-745(b)(l) of the Labor &amp; Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d). The circuit court, however, must still consider whether the Commission: \u201c(1) justly considered all the facts about the accidental personal injury ...; (2) exceeded the powers granted to it under [LE title 9]; or (3) misconstrued the law and facts applicable in the case decided.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-745(c). Summary judgment is appropriate in a worker compensation appeal to avoid an unnecessary trial if the requirements of Md. Rule 2-501(e) are met.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Dawson\u2019s Charter Serv. v. Chin, </em>68 Md.App. 433, 440, 511 A.2d 1138 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">In turn, our standard of review is governed by LE section 9-750, which states that \u201c[a] party may appeal from a decision of the circuit court to the Court of Special Appeals as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>for other civil cases.\u201d Thus, in reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we must determine whether the circuit court\u2019s ruling was legally correct. <em>See Converge Servs. Group, LLC v. Curran, 383 </em>Md. 462, 476, 860 A.2d 871 (2004) (citations omitted). \u201c \u2018We review the same information from the record and decide the same issues of law as the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Info. Sys. &amp; Network, Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>145 Md.App. 457, 463, 805 A.2d 1141 (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 Md. 430, 813 A.2d 258 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Apportionment Of PPD Percentage</p>\n<p id=\"AXM\">A. Compensation Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">An employee who sustains PPD from a work-related accidental injury is entitled to compensation, which is determined based on the area of the body disabled. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-625, 9-627. PPD to areas of the body not specifically enumerated in section 9-627(a)-(j) falls under the category of \u201cother cases.\u201d <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-627(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In awarding PPD compensation for \u201cother cases,\u201d the Commission must first determine \u201cthe percentage by which the industrial use of the covered employee\u2019s body was impaired as a result of the accidental personal injury!.]\u201d LE \u00a7 9-627(k)(l). That percentage is then apportioned against the 500 weeks that \u201cthe legislature has deemed the whole body to be \u2018worth\u2019 \u201d to calculate the duration of compensation. Gilbert and Humphreys, <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook, </em>214 (2nd ed.1993, 2001 Cum.Supp.). For example, if a covered employee sustains 10% PPD, compensation would be awarded for 50 weeks <em>(i.e., </em>10% of 500 weeks). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Once the duration of compensation is ascertained, the award amount is calculated according to LE sections 9-628 to 9-630. These sections create a three tier system for PPD benefits, which depends on the number of weeks compensation is awarded. For first tier benefits, or compensation for less than 75 weeks, \u201cthe employer or its insurer shall pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>covered employee compensation that equals one-third of the average weekly wage of the covered employee<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but does not exceed [a maximum rate, which depends on the year of the accident.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> LE \u00a7 9-628.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">For second tier benefits, or 75 to 249 weeks compensation, the covered employee is paid \u201cweekly compensation that equals two-thirds of the average weekly wage of the covered employee but does not exceed one-third of the State average weekly wage.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> LE \u00a7 9-629.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The third tier, or \u201cserious disability\u201d benefits, addresses compensation for 250 weeks or more. LE section 9-630 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">[I]f a covered employee is given an award or a combination of awards resulting from 1 accidental personal injury ... for 250 weeks or more ...:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">(i) the Commission shall increase the award or awards by one-third the number of weeks in the award or awards ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">(ii) the employer or its insurer shall pay the covered employee weekly compensation that equals two-thirds of the average weekly wage of the covered employee, but does not exceed 75% of the State average weekly wage. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>B. Marshall\u2019s PPD Award</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Here, the Commission determined that Marshall sustained 25% PPD, and then awarded her compensation for 125 weeks <em>(Le., </em>25% of 500 weeks). The Commission ordered that the 125 weeks be paid at the rate of $223.00 per week, one-third of the State average weekly wage for the 2001 calendar year. <em>See </em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, <em>Maximum Rate of Benefits for Calendar Year 2001, </em>accessible at &lt; http://www.wcc.state.md.us/PDF/Rates/2001.pdf&gt; (\u201cWCC Rates\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">On review, the circuit court ruled that the Commission erred because it failed to apportion the PPD percentage between the 1999 and 2001 incidents. We agree, and hold that the statutory scheme detailed above requires the Commission to award PPD compensation at the rates scheduled for the year the accidental injury occurred. Thus, where separate accidental injuries occur, the Commission must determine the PPD percentage caused by each accident, and award compensation accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In construing the applicable sections of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute, we recognize that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">\u201cthe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the true legislative intent that lies behind the statutory enactment, itself.\u201d To determine the legislative intent, we primarily look to \u201cthe plain language of the statute, with the words given their ordinary and natural meanings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">In addition, \u201call sections of the Act must be read together, in conjunction with one another, to discern the true intent of the legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-10\"><em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Pennel, </em>133 Md.App. 279, 291, 293, 754 A.2d 1120 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">For the three tiers of benefits, the compensation amount is calculated using a fraction of the covered employee\u2019s average weekly wage, subject to a \u201cceiling\u201d amount. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-628 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>to 9-630. The average weekly wage of a covered employee is determined from wages earned \u201cat the time of ... the accidental personal injury.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-602(a). The compensation, relates to the time the accidental injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Likewise, the \u201cceiling\u201d for first tier benefits depends solely on the date of accidental injury. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-628(b)-(e). Section 9-628(b)-(e) creates four first tier benefit rate m\u00e1xi-mums, delineated by the accidental injury date. For instance, a covered employee cannot be compensated more than $94.20 a week for a \u201cclaim arising from events occurring on or after January 1, 1993,\u201d whereas an employee injured on or after January 1, 2000, cannot be compensated more than $114 a week. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Compensation for second and third tier benefits cannot exceed a set percentage of the State average weekly wage. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-629, 9-630 (one-third and three-fourths, respectively). The State average weekly wage, in turn, is calculated on a yearly basis by the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-603(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Finally, LE section 9-604(a) requires the Commission to \u201ccompute all compensation awarded under this title in accordance with the applicable schedule in this subtitle.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Construing the above sections together, we hold that the Legislature intended that PPD benefits be awarded at rates applicable at the time of the accidental injury. Accordingly, where, as here, two separate accidental injuries occurred, the Commission is required to apportion PPD percentage among the two incidents, and award benefits at the rates applicable at the time of each accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>In this case, the Commission erred when it found a total of 25% PPD stemming from both claims, and then awarded benefits at the 2001 rate only. On remand, the Commission must determine the PPD percentage for each claim, and award benefits at the rates in effect at the time of the separate accidents. For example, if, on remand, the Commission determines that 10% PPD is attributable to the 1999 incident and 15% PPD is attributable to the 2001 incident, Marshall should be awarded: (1) 50 weeks of compensation at a rate no greater than $94.20 a week, and (2) 75 weeks of compensation at a rate no greater than $223.00 a week, respectively. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-628(d), 9-629. <em>See </em>also WCC Rates 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Marshall argues that because the Commission ordered the PPD award to be paid at the 2001 weekly rate, it therefore found that the entire 25% PPD was attributable to the 2001 accident. Such a conclusion cannot reasonably be drawn from the Commission\u2019s order. Under the temporary total disability section of the award, the Commission stated that Marshall sustained \u201caccidental injuries ... on May 21, 1999 and April 10, 2001.\u201d The Commission clearly was addressing injuries from both incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Moreover, the 25% PPD finding was based on injury to \u201cthe right leg (knee), back, left foot (ankle), left leg (knee), and left arm[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). The injury to Marshall\u2019s right knee undisputedly occurred as a result of the May 1999 accident. In addition, the Commission explicitly stated that only \u201cthe disability of the claimant\u2019s left leg (knee) and left arm [were] causally related to the accidental injury of April 10, 2001.\u201d The Commission\u2019s finding of PPD from injury to the listed parts of Marshall\u2019s body, then, was not based solely on the May 2001 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>We are also unpersuaded by Marshall\u2019s argument that, even if the Commission had found that Marshall\u2019s PPD was attributable to both the 1999 and the 2001 accidents, it had discretion to order payment of the award at the higher 2001 rate. Marshall cites no legal authority to support this assertion. Furthermore, the Legislature\u2019s intention that benefits be awarded at rates in effect at the time the accidental injury occurred refutes the notion of Commission discretion in awarding benefits at higher rates. Indeed, the Commission\u2019s own rate schedule acknowledges that benefits are awarded according to the time the injury occurred. <em>See </em>WCC Rates 2001 (\u201cthe following maximum benefits for death and disability for injuries occurring on or after January 1, 2001 ... \u201d)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

More specifically, Marshall sough) 12% PPD to the body as a whole, 24% PPD to the left ankle, 45% PPD to each lower extremity due to knee pathology, and 36% PPD (8% pre-existing) to the left arm. In contrast, the University alleged that the only compensable PPD for the two incidents was 2.5% PPD to (he left ankle and 25% PPD to the right knee (both attributable to the May 1999 incident), and 2.5% PPD to the left ankle (attributable to the April 2001 incident).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-11\"><em>. </em>Md.
