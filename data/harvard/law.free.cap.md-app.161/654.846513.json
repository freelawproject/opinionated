After merging the two offenses, the court sentenced appellant to four years\u2019 incarceration for the felony drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">On appeal, Cox presents one question for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">On October 2, 2001, Baltimore City Police Officer Maxwell Anderson was in uniform and on patrol in an unmarked police vehicle, accompanied by Officer Chris Tims. As a member of the City\u2019s police force for more than fifteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>years, Anderson was received as an expert in narcotics investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Anderson testified that, late in the morning on October 2, 2001, he saw appellant standing with other individuals on the corner of Federal and Wolfe streets in Baltimore City, an area \u201cknown for heroin sales.\u201d Anderson spoke to Cox \u201cin reference to being on that corner, why are you there, you have to go, that type of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">About forty minutes later, at approximately noon, Officer Anderson was driving \u201cin the area of Federal and Wolfe,\u201d with Officer Tims as a passenger. As they were proceeding eastbound in the 1900 block of Federal Street, Anderson saw appellant \u201criding a BMX styled bicycle,\u201d heading eastbound on the same street. Appellant \u201cglanced over his shoulder\u201d at the officers and \u201cappeared nervous[.]\u201d Then, appellant \u201csped up on the bike,\u201d turned south onto Chapel Street,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and headed west onto Oliver Street. On Oliver Street, appellant \u201cslowed up\u201d and \u201ckept glancing over his shoulder\u201d at the officers. From Oliver Street, Cox turned north onto Wolfe Street. By that point, Cox had made three right turns, and appeared to be making a \u201csquare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">When appellant turned onto Chapel Street and then onto Oliver Street, Officer Anderson lost sight of him briefly. The officer explained: \u201cWhen I say lost sight, I\u2019m talking about momentarily. Like a second. He turned the corner, then I\u2019m around the corner. I could actually still see him at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Anderson noted that Wolfe Street is a one-way street in the southbound direction, and appellant \u201cwas riding against traffic on Wolfe Street ... cars were coming southbound.\u201d Anderson considered \u201chighly suspicious\u201d appellant\u2019s conduct of riding the wrong way on Wolfe Street. In an effort to follow Cox, Anderson turned onto Wolfe Street, driving \u201cthe wrong way on a one-way street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>When Cox was \u201chalf way up the block\u201d on Wolfe Street, he \u201ccut\u201d between two parked vehicles, made a \u201cU-turn,\u201d and went onto the sidewalk. According to Officer Anderson, while appellant made the U-turn, he (Cox) took his right hand off the handle bars of his bicycle and reached into his right front pocket. As appellant made this maneuver \u201cin the middle of a turn,\u201d he \u201clost his balance\u201d and had to stop his bicycle by putting his foot down \u201cmomentarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Anderson pulled up to the space between the parked cars, through which appellant had just ridden his bicycle. Anderson estimated that he was seven yards from appellant at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">While appellant was stopped, Anderson saw appellant remove from his front pocket a clear plastic bag that contained \u201cnumerous small gel caps.\u201d Officer Anderson recalled: \u201cThey were clear, containing a white powder I knew to be, based upon my training, to be heroin. Suspected heroin, at least.\u201d Anderson also testified: \u201cWhen [appellant] stopped, reached into his pocket and pulled out what I could see to be drugs, at that point he was told to stop.\u201d However, Anderson maintained that he had not asserted his authority as a police officer prior to that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Officer Anderson also stated that, at the \u201cmoment\u201d that appellant was removing the drugs from his pocket, Officer Tims \u201cwas getting out of the car and was going right towards [appellant].\u201d Officer Tims then \u201cgrabbed a hold\u201d of appellant and \u201cseized him along with the bag.\u201d Tims \u201csubsequently handcuffed\u201d appellant and placed him \u201cunder arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The officers recovered the plastic bag that appellant had removed from his pocket; it contained 24 gel caps. Officer Anderson described that bag as being knotted at the top and about an inch and a half in size, which could fit in appellant\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Appellant was also searched incident to his arrest. During the search, the officers recovered another plastic bag containing \u201c25 small clear gel caps with white powder suspected to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>heroin similar to the ones in the other bag,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and $790 in U.S. currency. Officer Anderson opined that the heroin was \u201cfor street level distribution.\u201d The officer added that, while being searched, appellant stated: \u201c[I]t\u2019s only 50 pills. So, if I get you a gun, what can be done?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Officer Anderson denied that he called out, \u201cDavid, come here.\u201d Moreover, he maintained that he did not instruct appellant to stop until after he saw appellant remove the drugs from his pocket. Officer Anderson agreed, however, that the Statement of Charges, which he wrote, stated: \u201cPolice Officer Tims asked Mr. Cox to stop so we could talk to him. Instead, Mr. Cox tried to make an abrupt U-turn on the bicycle at the same time trying to discard a plastic bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Officer Tims testified that, while the officers were following appellant, they lost sight of him for \u201c[n]ot more than a second or two\u201d as he turned each corner. According to Officer Tims, appellant \u201ckept looking back over his shoulder, peddling fast, looking over his shoulder peddling faster.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">According to Officer Tims, he was still in the police car, about ten feet from appellant, when he told Cox to stop. He directed appellant to stop when he (Cox) \u201cattempted to do a u-turn to pull the bike up on the sidewalk and was attempting to discard the drugs.\u201d Tims exited the police car when he saw appellant \u201cpulling drugs out of his pocket.\u201d Tims explained: \u201cI could see that they were drugs and I took him to the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">According to Officer Tims, appellant committed a \u201cwhole multitude\u201d of traffic violations, including failure to signal and riding the wrong way on a one-way street. Therefore, the officer wanted to conduct a field interview of appellant and issue a traffic citation. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">COURT: All right, Officer Tims, on the occasion that gave rise to this complaint number on October 2, 2001, about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>noon in the street, just in front of Oliver, did you ever give any command, either verbally or non-verbally \u2014 when I say you, I mean you and/or Anderson \u2014 to the defendant before you did the instructions?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">[TIMS]: I believe I said could I speak to you a second.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai-\">COURT: What was your basis for saying that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">[TIMS]: Just when he appeared to be fleeing from us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a3n-dedup-0\">COURT: What was it about fleeing that caused you to assert your authority as a policeman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">[TIMS]: Just the area. I know that\u2019s in a high drug area. When people flee from you, there is usually a reason for it. I believe the court has upheld that people fleeing in a high drug traffic area is probable cause for a field interview. And at that time, I believe <em>I was going to conduct a field interview when he saw us and issue a traffic violation for traveling the wrong way on a one-way street.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">COURT: Had the traffic violation already occurred at the time you gave the command?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">[TIMS]: Yes, sir....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">In addition, Officer Tims said: \u201c[I]t wasn\u2019t until after he committed the traffic violation, traveling the wrong way on a one-way street, that we went behind him.\u201d Notably, Tims stated: \u201cHad [appellant] not committed any traffic violations or didn\u2019t try to flee from us, we might have driven right on by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Officer Tims claimed that, in his twelve-year career, he had ticketed bicyclists \u201c[t]hree or four\u201d times for traveling the wrong way on a one-way street. He acknowledged, however, that he never issued a traffic citation to Cox. Tims explained that \u201cthe drug offense supersedes the traffic violation so I believed there was no need for [the citation].\u201d He added: \u201cI could have gave him a warning. It is the officer\u2019s discretion on traffic cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">Appellant testified in his own defense. He stated that, on the date in question, he was stopped by Officers Maxwell and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Tims while he was on foot in the 1900 block of East Lanvale Street. The officers checked his identification, asked why he was in the area, and told him \u201cto go home.\u201d Appellant also stated that he consented to the officers\u2019 search of him, and claimed he had no drugs in his possession at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Approximately forty-five minutes later, while appellant was riding his bicycle on Federal Street, he again saw the officers. When appellant turned onto Chappel Street, he noticed that the officers were \u201cdirectly behind\u201d him. Appellant turned right from Chapel Street onto Oliver Street and, from Oliver Street, appellant then turned right onto Wolfe Street, where he rode his bicycle on the sidewalk. Appellant denied riding his bike the wrong way on a one-way street. Appellant added that he did not realize the officers were following him until he made his third turn. He claimed that he only glanced over his shoulder once, and he denied speeding up at any point.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Further, Cox testified that, as he rode on the sidewalk, Officer Tims directed him to stop, stating: \u201cDavid, stop.\u201d Appellant continued to ride his bike, however, so Officer Tims got out of the vehicle, \u201cpushed\u201d him off of his bicycle, \u201cgrabbed\u201d him, and \u201csearched\u201d him. Appellant admitted that he had two bags of drugs in his pocket, but denied reaching into his pocket and pulling one out. To the contrary, he claimed that the bags were still in his pocket when he was detained. According to appellant, Officer Tims removed the bags from Cox\u2019s pocket, without Cox\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">At the close of the evidence, the defense challenged the officers\u2019 credibility, disputing their claim that they told Cox to stop once the drugs were visible to them. Cox\u2019s lawyer suggested that it was not plausible that appellant would have tried to discard the drugs, knowing the officers were following him. Further, the defense argued that, merely because appellant was on a bicycle and continued on his way, without stopping, that did not give rise to a justifiable \u201cbasis for the stop.\u201d Cox claimed that he had \u201ca constitutional right to continue going.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">In particular, appellant\u2019s lawyer argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>[E]ven under the version that he\u2019s riding the wrong way, that doesn\u2019t allow the police to arrest him. It would only allow them to give him a ticket. Even under that farce that they have created here, that these officers are going to give him a ticket because he\u2019s riding the wrong way, Mr. Cox told you he was on the sidewalk. Even if you believe the officers that he was on the street at that time, that doesn\u2019t justify a search of Mr. Cox\u2019s person. The court would still have to find that Mr. Cox who is still trying to discard drugs, as the police would have you believe, reached into his pocket. And it is very interesting how this officer testified .... Does that make any sense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">He doesn\u2019t discard [the drugs], your honor, when the police are 25 to 30 yards away, he waits until the police get within several feet of him and now he discards it like this. Is that credible testimony, your honor?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The State contended, in part, that appellant was not \u201cseized\u201d until he was in custody, after the officers saw him with narcotics in his hand. The prosecutor also claimed that the officers had probable cause for Cox\u2019s arrest upon seeing him with the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. It said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">I find the testimony of [0]fficer Tims to be credible. Officer Anderson almost covers what Tims covers, but he falters in a few respects. And defendant almost covers what Tims covers, but he falters in a few respects. But, I think that the version of the seizure by the officer who focused on the seizure, Tims, is the most credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">The bottom line is that, as Tims indicated in this particular case, that the defendant was riding on a bicycle. Tims recognized him from an earlier encounter, but that, alone, wasn\u2019t dispositive of the issue. Apparently Anderson didn\u2019t. What got Tims\u2019 attention was the fact that defendant glanced over his shoulder, began to speed up and made four right-hand turns going around in a circle, and while that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>peeked [sic] the officer\u2019s curiosity, they kept their distance of 25 to 30 yards and followed the defendant to see what would happen next. And what happened next is the defendant committed a transportation code violation by going northbound on Wolfe [S'jtreet against the one-way southbound and at that time, Tims believed that, under the double ambit of him being able to write a citation for a transportation code violation, which he does once every three years, but does do, and because he thought the person was fleeing under <em>Illinois v. Wardlow[, </em>528 U.S. 119, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000),] \u2014 he didn\u2019t use those words, but when he said the law allows us to stop and interview people who are fleeing, I believe he was indicating he had reasonable suspicion to detain the person long enough to find out who he was and what he was doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">As a result of that, [Tims] issues the command to stop at an interesting moment. I mean, he can issue the command to stop just to write the citation, but he picks an interesting moment. At that moment that he does it, defendant is trying to cut from the street between two parked cars onto sidewalk, make a u-turn with the bike and discard items from his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">I\u2019ll give the defendant the benefit of the doubt that either the word stop was said first or that the item was concealed in his hand at the time that the word stop was uttered because there was such reasonable suspicion for Tims to tell him to stop absent seeing the controlled dangerous substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">But the defendant didn\u2019t succeed in discarding the controlled dangerous substances in a way that escaped the police\u2019s attention, that at some point the substance was visible in his hand and that the <em>Terry </em>stop initiated by Tims at the moment that he said stop ripened into probable cause for arrest because, once the drugs were more visible, it was clear both to Tims and Anderson that what they were seeing was the defendant discarding drugs. I find that this was not a forced abandonment because, in order for there to be a forced abandonment, there had to be no justification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>for the <em>Terry </em>stop and the individual had to have disgorged the evidence as a result of police misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APx\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, because the officers lacked reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop. Among other things, appellant argues that the drugs were not yet visible when Officer Tims told Cox to stop, and Officer Tims\u2019s belief that Cox was fleeing was insufficient to support an investigatory stop. Moreover, appellant asserts: \u201cThe trial court\u2019s finding that the officers saw Appellant attempting to discard a plastic bag containing heroin was clearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">The State counters that the police had ample basis to make an investigatory stop. It maintains that the stop was justified because the police saw Cox riding his bicycle in the wrong direction on a one-way street. In addition to the traffic violation, the State points to Cox\u2019s nervous behavior, his evasive conduct, and his presence in an area known for drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">In any event, the State maintains that the \u201cpolice did not effect an investigatory stop of Cox, because \u2014 assuming the police ordered him to stop \u2014 he did not comply.\u201d And, because \u201cCox did not submit to the authority of the police,\u201d the State insists that there was no seizure. In addition, the State argues: \u201c[Wjithin moments,\u201d the police observed, \u201cin plain view,\u201d a clear baggie in Cox\u2019s hand, which contained suspected drugs. At that point, asserts the State, the police had \u201cprobable cause to effect an arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">In our review of the court\u2019s ruling, we extend great deference to the court\u2019s findings of fact and determinations of credibility. <em>McMillian v. State, </em>325 Md. 272, 281-82, 600 A.2d 430 (1992); <em>Charity v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 598, 606, 753 A.2d 556, <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 487, 759 A.2d 231 (2000).

State, </em>364 Md. 554, 569, 774 A.2d 420 (2001). \u201cAfter giving due regard to the suppression court\u2019s findings of fact, we then make our own independent appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pappaconstantinou v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 668, 670, 703 A.2d 1295, <em>aff'd, </em>352 Md. 167, 721 A.2d 241 (1998); <em>see Ornelas v.

State, </em>359 Md. 272, 282-83, 753 A.2d 519 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 551, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980). A traffic stop involving a motorist is a detention that implicates the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985); <em>State v. Green, </em>375 Md. 595, 609, 826 A.2d 486 (2003); <em>Rowe v.

State, </em>143 Md.App. 155, 164, 792 A.2d 1197 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment does not proscribe all state-initiated searches and seizures; it merely proscribes those which are unreasonable.\u201d <em>Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 250, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991) (citing <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 183, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990)); <em>see United States v.

Therefore, if the police have probable cause to believe that a driver has committed a traffic violation, a stop of the driver generally does not violate the Constitution. <em>See Whren v.

Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21-22, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), the Supreme Court held that police officers may also stop persons to investigate possible criminal activity even without probable cause. But, a valid investigatory stop requires that \u201cthe police have specific articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, create reasonable suspicion that the person has been or is about to be involved in criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Aguilar v.

Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000). Moreover, we must consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the police had reasonable, articulable suspicion to effect an investigatory stop. <em>United States v.

A person\u2019s flight and nervousness, along with his presence in a high crime area, are factors that are relevant to the issue of reasonable, articulable suspicion. <em>See Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. at 124-25, 120 S.Ct. 673 (consideration may be given to the nature of the area and the individual\u2019s unprovoked flight from police in determining if reasonable articulable suspicion was present); <em>Anderson v.

We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">As noted, appellant rode his bicycle northbound on Wolfe Street, a one-way southbound street. In <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), the Supreme Court explained: \u201cAs a general matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court concluded that the constitutional reasonableness of traffic stops does not depend on the actual motivations of the officers involved; \u201c[sjubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818,116 S.Ct. 1769.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In <em>Devenpeck, supra, </em>125 S.Ct. 588, the Supreme Court underscored the vitality of <em>Whren. </em>Citing <em>Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 812-13, 116 S.Ct. 1769, it said, <em>id. </em>at 593, 116 S.Ct. 1769: \u201cOur cases make clear that an arresting officer\u2019s state of mind (except for the facts that he knows) is irrelevant to the existence of probable cause.\u201d The Supreme Court added that an officer\u2019s \u201csubjective reason for making the arrest need not be the criminal offense as to which the known facts provide probable cause.\u201d <em>Devenpeck, </em>125 S.Ct. at 594. Put another way, \u201cthe legal justification\u201d offered \u201cfor the officer\u2019s action does not invalidate the action taken so long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Traffic stops founded upon probable cause, but motivated by considerations other than the traffic infraction, have become known as <em>\u2018Whren </em>stops.\u201d Addressing <em>Whren, </em>we said in <em>Pryor v. State, supra, </em>122 Md.App. at 679, 716 A.2d 338: \u201cUnder <em>Whren, </em>the law enforcement officer who observes a traffic violation may stop the violator, even though the officer does so out of curiosity as to whether (or in the hope that) the stop will lead to the discovery of other incriminating evidence.\u201d Similarly, we explained in <em>Whitehead v. State, </em>116 Md.App. 497, 500, 698 A.2d 1115, <em>cert. denied, </em>348 Md. 207, 703 A.2d 148 (1997): \u201cIn <em>Whren, ... </em>the Supreme Court held that, as long as the police <em>could </em>have stopped the driver for a traffic violation, it is inconsequential that the police actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>stopped the driver to investigate another offense.\u201d (Emphasis in original; citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Here, the police officers saw appellant violate the traffic law' by riding his bicycle in the wrong direction on a one-way street. Although appellant urges us to limit an officer\u2019s right to make a traffic stop to the motor vehicle context, he fails to offer any reason why a police officer may not stop a bicyclist who is observed committing a violation of applicable transportation laws. Indeed, he overlooks \u00a7 21-1202 of the Transportation Article (\u201cTr.\u201d) of the Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), titled: \u201cTraffic laws apply to bicycles and motor scooters.\u201d Tr. \u00a7 21-1202 provides, in part, that a person operating a bicycle \u201cis subject to all the duties required of the driver of a vehicle by this title.... \u201d In addition, he ignores Tr. \u00a7 21-308(a)(2), which provides: \u201cOn a roadway designated and signposted for one-way traffic, a vehicle may be driven only in the direction designated.\u201d <em>See also Billings v. Shaw, </em>247 Md. 335, 336, 231 A.2d 12 (1967) (\u201cThe motor vehicle laws as to the rules of the road apply to a cyclist....\u201d) (Citations omitted); <em>Kane v. Williams, </em>229 Md. 59, 61, 181 A.2d 651 (1962) (noting that \u201cthe motor vehicle laws pertaining to the rules of the road and traffic control devices and signals are as applicable to a cyclist as they are to the driver of a motor vehicle ...\u201d); <em>Gazvoda v. McCaslin, </em>36 Md.App. 604, 608, 375 A.2d 570 (1977) (\u201cA bicycle is a vehicle ...\u201d for purposes of the \u201cboulevard rule,\u201d which requires the unfavored driver to yield the right of way); <em>Richards v.

Greene, </em>11 Md.App. 153, 155-56 n. 3, 273 A.2d 232 (1971) (stating that the boulevard rule \u201cis not limited in its application to motor vehicles; it applies to bicycles.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Other jurisdictions have applied <em>Whren </em>in the context of a traffic stop of a bicyclist. In <em>United States v. Bell, </em>86 F.3d 820 (8th Cir.1996), for example, the defendant was seen riding his bicycle at night, without a headlamp, in a known high-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>crime area, in violation of Iowa law. The officers knew the suspect was a gang member who had been arrested for possession of cocaine base, and that bicycles were used by gangs in the area to transport drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 822. Therefore, the officers arrested the defendant for the traffic offense, and recovered cocaine base from him. The defendant sought to suppress the drugs, claiming the traffic stop \u201cwas merely a pretext to investigate drug activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The Eighth Circuit upheld the search. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">Although a pretextual traffic stop violates the Fourth Amendment, any traffic violation, even a minor one, gives an officer probable cause to stop the violator. If the officer has probable cause to stop the violator, the stop is objectively reasonable and any ulterior motivation on the officer\u2019s part is irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The court added: \u201cThe officer\u2019s suspicion that Bell was involved in drug activity does not affect the stop\u2019s objective reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\"><em>State v. Flowers, </em>880 So.2d 887, 889 (La.Ct.App.2004), is also pertinent. There, the officers observed a bicyclist who rode in the middle of the road in an erratic and swerving manner, failed to keep his hands on the handlebars, and appeared to be intoxicated. Applicable traffic regulations required cyclists to ride on the right side of the road. Upon stopping the cyclist, the officers saw him drop an object, which turned out to be crack cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 888. The defendant challenged the legality of the stop. Relying on <em>Whren, </em>the Louisiana court concluded that the officers lawfully effected the stop after observing the traffic infraction, even if the stop was merely a pretext to investigate for drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Here, Officers Tims and Anderson made a valid traffic stop. They observed appellant violate Tr. \u00a7 21-308(a)(2), because he was riding the wrong way on a one-way street. Therefore, the officers had probable cause to effect a stop of appellant based on that traffic violation. To the extent that the officers may also have suspected that appellant was involved with drugs, and were motivated to effect the traffic stop for that reason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>their suspicions and motivations were irrelevant with regard to the analysis of the legality of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Appellant also challenges the legality of his arrest. According to Cox, regardless of the validity of the <em>Terry </em>stop, if he \u201cnever removed the drugs from his pocket, there was no probable cause for the arrest that followed on the heels of the officers\u2019 <em>Terry </em>stop.\u201d In this regard, Cox attacks the credibility of the officers\u2019 testimony that they observed him remove from his pocket a plastic bag containing heroin. He asserts that the trial court was clearly erroneous when it made the factual finding that \u201cat some point the substance was visible in [Appellant\u2019s] hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">To attack the officers\u2019 credibility, appellant draws our attention to the discrepancies in their testimonies: Officer Anderson indicated that he told appellant to stop only after he saw the bag of drugs in appellant\u2019s hand, while Officer Tims stated that he told appellant to stop before he saw appellant with the drugs. Further, Cox alleges that testimony from the officers that he did not attempt to discard the drugs until they were within a short distance of him strains credulity. This is so, he claims, because the officers briefly lost sight of him as he turned the corners, thereby giving him an opportunity to discard the drugs. Therefore, he alleges that there would have been no reason for him to wait until the officers were close to him before discarding the drugs. Finally, appellant refers us to his testimony that he never removed the drugs from his pocket. Thus, he contends that the trial court was clearly erroneous in finding that the officers observed him remove the bag of drugs from his pocket after they issued their command to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">The court below was aware of the discrepancies in the testimonies of Officer Anderson and appellant, but it expressly credited the testimony of Officer Tims. As we noted earlier, an appellate court must give due regard to the trial court\u2019s \u201copportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>McMillian v. State, </em>325 Md. 272, 282, 600 A.2d 430 (1992). <em>See In re TariqA-R-Y, </em>347 Md. 484, 488, 701 A.2d 691 (1997) (\u201cIn considering the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, we extend great deference to the fact-finding of the suppression hearing judge with respect to determining the credibility of witnesses....\u201d); <em>Riddick v.
