The court sentenced appellant on the stalking conviction to a concurrent term of five years\u2019 incarceration, \"with all but two years suspended and five years of supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">Appellant\u2019s sole argument on appeal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his stalking conviction. For the following reasons, we shall affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">\u2022 FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">At the time of trial, Devora P. had known appellant for approximately thirteen years. The two dated for some time and have a child, Adriana, who was born in October, 1991. Eventually, Ms. P. and appellant stopped seeing each other, and did not come into contact for a number of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Around 7:30 a.m., on November 17, 2001, Ms. P. was sitting in her car, preparing to leave for work. The car was parked in the driveway of her home. As she looked in the rear view mirror, she saw a man walking towards her. She recognized the man as appellant when he reached her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Ms. P. was surprised by appellant\u2019s presence. Appellant repeatedly asked Ms. P., \u201cWhere\u2019s my daughter?\u201d, to which she responded, \u201cAdriana is not here. She is with my mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Ms. P. testified that appellant reached in his coat pocket and pulled out a gun. He then opened up the car door, pulled Ms. P. out of the car, and started hitting her on the head with the gun, cutting her. Ms. P. kicked appellant and screamed for her mother. Ms. P.\u2019s mother called the Bladensburg Police Department, then went outside. After that, appellant let go of Ms. P. and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Officer Cowling responded to the scene and found Ms. P. with blood on her shirt and head. Ms. P.\u2019s mother eventually drove Ms. P. to the hospital, where she received eight to nine stitches to her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Over the next month, appellant made contact with Ms. P. on four more occasions. The first occurred when Ms. P. found two letters, in appellant\u2019s handwriting, under her car\u2019s windshield wiper. The police were called and, upon arrival at Ms. P.\u2019s home, removed the letters from the car\u2019s windshield.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">One of the letters was addressed to appellant\u2019s daughter, Adriana. Appellant wrote, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">I know your [sic] mad at daddy for hitting your mother but I had no control over that. I tried to warn her that I need you and her to help me because I was losing my mind. When I was hearing voices they want me to hurt you and her. But I no [sic] I will never harm you but I can\u2019t say that about her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\">What I think I did to her is nothing compared to what was going to happen that day. I came there to kill her and that\u2019s the truth but when I was walking there from down the street I began seeing pictures of you in my mind of how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>you would look, and I started crying because all I wanted was my little girl.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">In a letter addressed to Ms. P., appellant wrote, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">I tried and I tried to warn you, how my mind was becoming crazy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">I\u2019m sorry for hitting you but that was not me, I told you when I use drugs another personality comes out of me, and he came over there to kill you on that day, but when I started walking towards the house I began crying because I wanted my family back (you and Dinky) but you laughed at me not knowing all the pain I\u2019ve had built up inside of me for years. You have [sic] better listen because the only thing that saved your life that day was Adriana and my love for her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">This is how it\u2019s going to be[,] we will be a family together, or we (me &amp; you) will die together because I couldn\u2019t hurt her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-9\">If I see you with another man in these next few weeks I\u2019m shooting no questions asked and that\u2019s a promise I will not break. I\u2019m trying to warn you before I seriously hurt you, I think you now see what I\u2019m capable of but that\u2019s nothing compared to what I have done before, and will do it again if necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">[T]he way you saw me is not the way I always look, but I used so much drugs about 8 days before you seen [sic] me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-12\">I\u2019m sorry for hitting you and if we become a family again it would never happen again, I promise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-13\">Rember [sic] that was a gun in my hand and I had intended to kill you that morning not me.... (I\u2019m warning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>you for the last time[.]) Take this very seriously[.] I will be watching you very closely[.] No men around you or her, you have until December 27 after that, no more warnings. This time it will not be years to come there but hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\"><em>* </em>\u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-6\">P.S. You no [sic] how my temper was, now it\u2019s 5 times crazier, only when I do drugs. If y\u2019all return never again will I do them[,] if not prepare for the worst. Do you know I still don\u2019t even know if I came [over] there for real, or if it was a dream. I woke up with blood all over my hands[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">On a subsequent day, Ms. P. found two more letters placed under her car\u2019s windshield wiper. Again, the letters were in appellant\u2019s handwriting. Again, Ms. P. called the police, who came and removed the letters from the windshield. The letter addressed to Adriana stated, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">Your no good mother has only ten days before the killing starts.... On your life and your sister somebody will die over there, and it might even be you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-9\">She just doesn\u2019t no [sic] how crazy and violent I\u2019ve become all because of my love for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-10\">I\u2019m tired of looking at your pictures!,] the ones I have left and didn\u2019t tear up. My moods v[a]ry so much I never no [sic] what I\u2019ll do. But I do no [sic] you could change my whole way of life, but there is not a lot of time. Whatever happens I will always love you. But time is near and I\u2019m not playing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">The letter addressed to Ms P. stated, among other things: \u201cYou have ten days left or the killing starts. Don\u2019t think [the] police can stop me[,] they can\u2019t stop me.... Play and you will die in ten days. But your [sic] not the only one, I will kill whoevers [sic] around when we kick those doors in. Bullets will ring out____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">On the morning of December 14, Ms. P. went with her children next door to her babysitter\u2019s house to ask the babysitter a question. As they were leaving the babysitter\u2019s house, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Ms. P. saw appellant driving \u201cup the street\u201d in the cream colored Jeep he had driven on the day he had assaulted her a month earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Ms. P. told the children to \u201c[h]urry up [and] [g]et in the car.\u201d As appellant drove closer, however, Ms. P. told them instead to \u201crun to the house.\u201d She and her children ran into her house and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">On December 16, a book bag was left on Ms. P.\u2019s car windshield. Ms. P. called the police, who came and retrieved the book bag. Inside the book bag was children\u2019s clothing, a basketball, and a note pad on which two letters were written by appellant. The letter addressed to Adriana had written on the top of it: \u201cthe day you saw me.\u201d In it appellant wrote, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">You do not have to run from daddy because of what your mother said to you or says to you about me.... It hurt me very badly when she told you to run in house, from me.... [N]ow she has made me more angry than I\u2019ve ever been at her. I started to shoot her right there for telling you to run from me.... What I\u2019ll do if I\u2019m not allowed to see you a lot of people over there are going to get hurt badly. I have enough guns to kill everybody in that house except you____ I\u2019ve not even used drugs since I hit [Ms. P.] because I felt bad it had to come to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-10\">[I]f that\u2019s her son that was with y\u2019all [sic], I\u2019m going to show her how it [feels] to take a child from it\u2019s parent and then, den[y] me of what Allah gave me. If I do not hear from y\u2019all [sic], I will declare Jihad on her and everybody over there....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-11\">But I will warn her no more.... I still have three cars so she won\u2019t know what I\u2019m driving next time.... I see she still the stupid (B) I met 10 years ago, that I should [have] left alone the night I met her.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">The second letter was addressed to Ms. P. In it appellant wrote, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-13\">You\u2019ve really done it [this] time, I left that note on your car for a reason. I said I was sorry because I was using drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>when I hit you[,] it wasn\u2019t me who hit you but voices made me do it.... But a strong warning to you, do not ever tell my daughter to run from me again or I\u2019ll shoot you on the spot I promise that on drugs or not.... Don\u2019t think that\u2019s my only car because I have 2 more and plenty of bullets to go around. I started</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">to stay there and shoot it out with police that came.... You have until the 27th Dec and I don\u2019t care how many kids you got, but it\u2019s me or the grave yard. That Jeep you seen [sic] was going to yours....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">[T]hat little boy will be first to go I promise that on my daughter\u2019s life the 27th is all you have [ ] as you can see I\u2019m not playing no more. I\u2019m watching you even when you think I\u2019m not there believe [me], make a mistake like this today and tell my daughter to run from me will cost you your life next time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Appellant testified in his defense. He admitted going to Ms. P.\u2019s house on November 17. He explained that he had been \u201cdoing cocaine\u201d for three days and was hearing voices. The voices kept telling him to \u201cGo get your daughter.\u201d He remembered asking Ms. P., \u201cWhere[\u2019s] my daughter?\u201d He told Ms. P. that he loved his daughter, that he wanted to stop \u201cdoing coke,\u201d and the only way he was going to stop was to make Adriana a promise. Appellant testified that he had told Ms. P. them \u201cdaughter was going to end up to be no freak like her,\u201d to which she responded by kicking him. Appellant then pushed Ms. P., causing her to fall into her car seat. He saw that her head was bleeding. Appellant denied ever having a weapon or a gun and he denied striking her in the head with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Appellant admitted writing the letters we have mentioned, but claimed that he wrote them to Ms. P. in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Appellant challenges the legal sufficiency of his stalking conviction. The stalking statute in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s actions read, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>(a) <em>Definitions. </em>\u2014 (1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">(2) \u201cCourse of conduct\u201d means a persistent pattern of conduct, composed of a series of acts over a period of time, that evidences a continuity of purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">(3) \u201cStalking\u201d means a malicious course of conduct that includes approaching or pursuing another person with intent to place that person in reasonable fear:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">(i) Of serious bodily injury or death; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">(ii) That a third person likely will suffer serious bodily injury or death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">(b) <em>Prohibited conduct. </em>\u2014 A person may not engage in stalking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 124.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">Appellant argues that the terms \u201capproaching\u201d and \u201cpursuing\u201d in subsection (3) require that the stalker act \u201cin the victim\u2019s presence and with the victim\u2019s awareness.\u201d From this, appellant asserts that the letters he left on three occasions on the windshield of Ms. P.\u2019s car do not come within the statute\u2019s prohibition, because there was no evidence that he acted in her presence. In a similar vein, appellant asserts that his conduct on December 14 does not come within the statute\u2019s prohibition, because he was <em>only </em>driving down the street, and not \u201capproaching or pursuing\u201d Ms. P. He concludes that, because none of these acts can properly be considered in determining whether he engaged in a malicious \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d requiring a \u201cseries of acts,\u201d what remains is the single act of his assault upon Ms. P. on November 17, which cannot alone establish the course of conduct needed for conviction of stalking.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">The State responds that the malicious course of conduct required by the stalking statute is not limited to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>involving the defendant\u2019s \u201capproaching or pursuing\u201d the victim, because the statute provides that the prohibited course of conduct merely \u201cincludes\u201d approaching or pursuing the victim. Even so, the State additionally argues, the phrase \u201capproaching or pursuing\u201d does not require that the victim be actually present for and aware of the conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Resolution of the parties\u2019 arguments requires that we employ principles of statutory construction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The cardinal rule of statutory construction \u201cis to discover and effectuate the actual intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484 (2004). Our inquiry begins with an examination of the plain language of the statute. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe view the words of a statute in ordinary terms, in their natural meaning, in the manner in which they are most commonly understood.\u201d <em>Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426 (2002). \u201cIf the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends and we need investigate no further, but simply apply the statute as it reads.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We may neither add words to or delete words from \u201can unambiguous statute in an attempt to extend the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\"> \u201cGiving the words their ordinary and common meaning in light of the full context in which they appear, and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence, normally will result in the discovery of the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946 (1993) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn the interest of completeness, however, we may look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account.\u201d <em>Id.; accord Chilcoat v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 394, 405, 843 A.2d 240, <em>cent. denied, </em>381 Md. 675, 851 A.2d 594 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The statute we construe in this case is penal. As the Court of Appeals has observed, \u201cIt is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that criminal statutes are to be construed narrowly so that courts will not extend the punishment to cases not plainly within the language used.\u201d <em>Boffen v. State, </em>872 Md. 724, 735, 816 A.2d 88 (2003) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But, \u201c[wjhile penal statutes are to be strictly construed in favor of the defendant, the construction must ultimately depend upon discerning the intention of the Legislature when it drafted and enacted the law in question.\u201d <em>Garnett v. State, </em>332 Md. 571, 585, 632 A.2d 797 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The Meaning of \u201cIncludes\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We first consider the State\u2019s argument that the stalking statute is not limited to a malicious course of conduct that involves \u201capproaching or pursuing\u201d the victim, because the statute merely \u201cinclud[es]\u201d such conduct. Article I, \u00a7 30 of the Maryland Code states: \u201cThe words \u2018includes\u2019 or \u2018including\u2019 mean, unless the context requires otherwise, includes or including by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 2001 Repl.Vol.), Art. 1, \u00a7 30. <em>See also State v. Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. 585, 593, 714 A.2d 841 (1998) (\u201cOrdinarily, the word \u2018including\u2019 means comprising by illustration and not by way of limitation.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals has observed that \u201cthe term \u2018includes,\u2019 by itself, is not free from ambiguity.\u201d <em>Liverpool v. Baltimore Diamond Exchange Inc., </em>369 Md. 304, 321, 799 A.2d 1264 (2002). The Court said in <em>Liverpool:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">\u201cIncludes\u201d has various shades of meaning, and its interpretation \u201cdepends upon the context\u201d in which the term is used. We have said that \u201c[o]rdinarily, the word \u2018include[s]\u2019 means comprising by illustration [of a general term] and not by way of limitation.\u201d We have also stated the term \u201cincludes\u201d may \u201csignal an expansion in meaning of previous language,\u201d and may be interpreted to mean \u201cand\u201d or \u201cin addition to.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>It has also been construed as a word of limitation or restriction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">369 Md. at 321-22, 799 A.2d 1264 (citations and some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">As it is used in the stalking statute, the word \u201cincludes\u201d is a term of limitation or restriction. The sentence in which the term appears reads: \u201c \u2018Stalking\u2019 means a malicious course of conduct that includes approaching or pursuing another person with intent to place that person in reasonable fear: (i) Of serious bodily injury or death; or (ii) That a third person likely will suffer serious bodily injury or death.\u201d \u00a7 124(a)(3). Thus employed, the word \u201cincludes\u201d has a meaning akin to \u201ccomprehends\u201d or \u201cembraces.\u201d <em>See Helvering v. Morgan\u2019s Inc., </em>293 U.S. 121, 125, 55 S.Ct. 60, 79 L.Ed. 232 (1934). In other words, whatever else the course of conduct referred to in subsection (3) might involve, it <em>must </em>include the stalker\u2019s \u201capproaching or pursuing\u201d the victim. Indeed, when the sentence that is subsection (3) is read in its entirety, and consideration is given to its structure and punctuation, we can discern no other reasonable interpretation of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Our interpretation of \u201cincludes,\u201d moreover, adheres to the rule that penal statutes are to be construed strictly in favor of the defendant. We hold, therefore, that the crime of stalking requires proof that the defendant\u2019s malicious course of conduct involves, at the least, \u201capproaching or pursuing\u201d the victim with the requisite intent of placing the victim in fear of serious bodily harm to the victim or some other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The Meaning of \u201cApproaching or Pursuing\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">We next must decide what the Legislature meant by its use of the phrase \u201capproaching or pursuing\u201d the victim. As appellant would have it, these words \u201ccontemplate a physical proximity between the person doing the approaching or pursuing and the victim,\u201d requiring \u201ca series of acts [on the part of the stalker] in the victim\u2019s presence and with the victim\u2019s awareness.\u201d The State responds that appellant\u2019s construction is too restrictive. The State, however, does not offer an alternative construction of the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201cOrdinary and popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of terminology within legislation.\u201d <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223, 858 A.2d 484. We may consult a dictionary to discern the generally understood meaning of a word. <em>Hamwright v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 17, 30 n. 4, 787 A.2d 824 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 180, 798 A.2d 552 (2002). The first definition given for the word \u201capproach\u201d in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, 106 (2002) is: \u201cTo come or go near or nearer to in place or time: draw nearer to.\u201d Likewise, The American Heritage Dictionary 122 (2nd College ed.1985) defines \u201capproach,\u201d first, as: \u201cTo come or go near or nearer to.\u201d The first definition of the word \u201cpursue\u201d in Webster\u2019s is \u201cto follow with enmity.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1848 (2002). And in The American Heritage Dictionary 1006 (2nd College ed.1985), \u201cpursue\u201d is first defined as: \u201cTo follow in an effort to overtake or capture; chase.\u201d None of these definitions of either \u201capproach\u201d or \u201cpursue\u201d requires that the person approaching or pursuing another person do so in the actual presence of the other person <em>and </em>with the concurrent awareness of that person, as appellant suggests. Rather, \u201c[g]iving the words their ordinary and common meaning in light of the full context in which they appear,\u201d <em>Harris, </em>331 Md. at 146, 626 A.2d 946, appellant\u2019s conduct comes within the meaning of one, if not both, terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Our review of the legislative history of the stalking statute confirms this conclusion. Legislative history includes \u201cthe derivation of the statute, comments and explanations regarding it by authoritative sources during the legislative process, and amendments proposed or added to it....\u201d <em>Boffen, </em>372 Md. at 736-37, 816 A.2d 88 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The \u201cprevailing mood of the legislative body with respect to the type of criminal conduct involved\u201d may also be considered. <em>Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 327, 558 A.2d 715 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Maryland\u2019s stalking statute became law in 1993. In the three years immediately prior to 1993, at least twenty-seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>other states enacted statutes that proscribed \u201cstalking\u201d in one form or another. <em>See </em>Congressional Research Service Report For Congress, Anti-Stalking Statutes: Background and Constitutional Analysis, at 1 (September 26, 1992) (\u201cCRS Report\u201d). The CRS Report provides insight into the prevailing mood across the country at the time. The report refers generally to \u201cstalking behavior\u201d as \u201charassing or threatening behavior which an individual engages in repeatedly, such as following a person, appearing at a person\u2019s home or place of business, making harassing phone calls, leaving written messages or objects or vandalizing a person\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The CRS Report states further that the various stalking statutes sought to \u201caddress various perceived problems with how traditional criminal laws are applied to threatening behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1. That is, \u201c[cjertain stalking behavior, although disturbing to the victim and often indicative of potential future harm, may not rise to the level of criminal activity under traditional criminal statutes, or it may violate laws under which only minimal sanctions can be imposed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">It was against this backdrop of burgeoning interest in stalking legislation on the national front that the General Assembly took up the issue in 1993. Seven bills were introduced: Senate Bill (\u201cSB\u201d) 7, SB 177, SB 260 and SB 277, House Bill (\u201cHB\u201d) 6, HB 433 and HB 124. What eventually became the stalking statute originated as SB 7 and HB 433. As proposed, each of these bills differed markedly from the other, and both bills underwent significant amendment so that the identically worded bills that were enacted as 1993 Laws of Maryland, chs. 205 and 206, bear little resemblance to the originals.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The legislative history offers no guidance about the evolution of the bills\u2019 wording. Moreover, nothing in the history informs the General Assembly\u2019s decision to adopt the \u201capproaching or pursuing\u201d language we analyze here. What little we do know in this regard follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">SB 7, in its original form, defined stalking as meaning \u201cto harass or repeatedly follow another person in such a manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>as: (I) to cause that person to suffer substantial emotional distress; and (II) would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress.\u201d \u201cHarass\u201d was defined in the original SB 7 as \u201ca course of conduct directed at a specific person which would cause a reasonable person to fear bodily injury or death, including oral threats, written threats, vandalism, or nonconsensual physical contact.\u201d \u201cFollow,\u201d in turn, was defined as \u201cto maintain a visual or physical proximity over a period of time to a specific person in such a manner as would cause a reasonable person to fear bodily injury or death.\u201d As the bill moved through the Senate, the phrase \u201charass or repeatedly follow\u201d was dropped in favor of the language that was passed into law, and stalking became defined as a malicious course of conduct that includes the stalker\u2019s \u201capproaching or pursuing\u201d the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">HB 433 underwent a similar metamorphosis. As introduced, HB 433 provided that \u201ca person may not stalk another person,\u201d and defined \u201cstalk\u201d as meaning</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">to engage in a knowing and willful course of conduct that involves an express or implied threat to kill another person or to inflict bodily injury on another person that is made: (I) with the intent to place that person in fear of bodily injury or death; and (II) in any manner or context that causes that person to reasonably fear bodily injury or death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">HB 433 was eventually amended to delete this definition of \u201cstalk\u201d in favor of the amended definition in SB 7. <em>See </em>Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report, HB 433,1993 General Assembly (Md.1993) (\u201cFloor Report\u201d)(reporting HB 433 \u201cfavorably,\u201d with the adoption of one amendment that struck \u201cthe entire bill and substitute^] the language of Senate Bill 7\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">This history offers little guidance on the General Assembly\u2019s decision to settle on what became the definition of stalking. And it provides no indication of how or why the General Assembly chose to include the words \u201capproaching or pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>ing\u201d in defining the proscribed conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The history does shed light, however, on the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in enacting the stalking statute. As with similar legislation in other states, <em>see </em>CRS Report at 1-2, the General Assembly sought to fill a gap in the law. The BACKGROUND portion of the Floor Report reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">Under current law, two criminal offenses \u2014 assault and harassment \u2014 relate to threatening conduct. Neither, however, fully addresses the type of behavior that is the subject of this bill. Civil protective orders also are an avenue to obtain redress in stalking situations, but they offer a less effective remedy than a criminal statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">The crime of assault is not necessarily committed in a stalking situation because one element of the crime of assault is the present intention and capacity to inflict a battery. In stalking situations there is not always an \u201cimmediate\u201d threat of harm or injury. Rather, the stalker may be threatening, either expressly or implicitly, to harm a person at some time in the future. For example, a man who makes threatening telephone calls to his ex-wife several times a week would probably display the type of stalking behavior covered by the bill, he would not be guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>assault unless he showed the present intent and means to injure his ex-wife on the spot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report, HB 433,1993 General Assembly (Md.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The Floor Report also explained \u201cwhy [the] current crime of \u2018harassment\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was not an \u201cappropriate tool for dealing with stalkers\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">First, [harassment] include[s] elements that should not be included in the crime of stalking. For example, it is not always possible or feasible in [a] stalking situation for the victim to provide a reasonable warning or request to \u201cdesist\u201d. Second, because [harassment] is a misdemeanor and not a felony, a police officer may not arrest a person for [harassment] without a warrant unless the person actually commits the crime in the presence of, or within the view of, the officer.1<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> By making the crime of stalking a felony, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>bill permits a police officer to arrest an alleged stalker without a warrant when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed the crime of stalking, regardless of whether the crime has been committed in the officer\u2019s presence or view. Finally, the current penalties for harassment ... do not reflect the seriousness of the crime of stalking. [HB 433] imposes more severe penalties on a person who commits the crime of stalking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><em>Id. See also </em>Hearing on SB 7 Before the Senate Comm, on Judicial Proceedings, 1993 Gen. Assembly (Md.1993) (statement of Sen. Nancy Murphy, sponsor of SB 7) (noting that stalking situations do not always involve an immediate threat of harm or injury, and citing as an example of behavior covered by SB 7 a man who makes a series of threatening calls to his ex-wife); Hearing on HB 433 Before the House Comm, on the Judiciary, 1993 Gen. Assembly (Md.1993) (statement of Del. Joan B. Pitkin, co-sponsor of HB 433) (citing as an example of stalking a man\u2019s verbally harassing the victim by telephone and persistently following her at a distance).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">This history reflects that the General Assembly did not intend the stalking statute\u2019s requirement of a \u201cmalicious course of conduct that includes approaching or pursuing another person\u201d to be limited to conduct that is done in the victim\u2019s actual physical presence and with the victim\u2019s concurrent awareness. Indeed, the Floor Report (as well as the testimony of the bills\u2019 sponsors) cites as an example of the behavior intended to be covered by the statute a man\u2019s making threatening telephone calls several times a week to his ex-wife. Obviously, in that example, the malicious conduct does not occur in the victim\u2019s actual presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">We need not decide in this case the breadth of conduct that falls within the meaning of the stalking statute. It is suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>cient for resolution of this case that we decide whether appellant\u2019s conduct of placing threatening letters on Ms. P.\u2019s car windshield comes within the statute\u2019s prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We conclude that it does. Appellant delivered his frightening messages by placing them on Ms. P.\u2019s car, where she would be certain to see them. To do this, appellant had to approach the immediate environs of Ms. P.\u2019s home, where her car was parked. This conduct meets the statute\u2019s requirement of malicious conduct that involves \u201capproaching\u201d Ms. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">We come to the same conclusion about appellant\u2019s conduct in driving his car down the street in front of Ms. P.\u2019s home. We note that appellant did this at the same time of day as on the morning he assaulted Ms. P., permitting the inference that he hoped to encounter her. Moreover, as evidenced by the letters he left for Ms. P. and Adriana two days later, appellant was close enough to them at the time he was driving down the street to witness their flight into their home. Appellant\u2019s \u201cdrive-by\u201d qualifies as both \u201capproaching\u201d and \u201cpursuing\u201d Ms. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u201cCourse of Conduct\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Because we have concluded that each of these acts\u2014 the letter placements and the drive-by \u2014 satisfies the conduct proscribed by the stalking statute, it follows that we may consider each act in determining whether appellant engaged in the \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d required by the statute. The statute defines \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d as \u201ca persistent pattern of conduct, composed of a series of acts over a period of time, that evidences a continuity of purpose.\u201d \u00a7 124(a)(2). The evidence was legally sufficient to meet this element of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The jury heard evidence that over the course of several weeks appellant did the following: He assaulted Ms. P. and beat her with a handgun; twice over the next several weeks he delivered to Ms. P. and Adriana letters that harkened back to his assault upon Ms. P. and threatened imminent deadly harm to Ms. P. and her children; several days after the delivery of the second set of letters he again drove down the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>street in front of Ms. P.\u2019s home, causing her to retreat into her home in fear; then, two days after that, he delivered two more letters that expressed anger at Ms. P.\u2019s retreat to safety with her children, said that he had \u201cstarted to shoot [Ms. P.] right there,\u201d and threatened to shoot Ms. P. if she ever again told Adriana to run from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Bearing in mind that we review convictions for legal sufficiency by examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, <em>Harrison v. State, </em>382 Md. 477, 487, 855 A.2d 1220 (2004), we hold that the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction of stalking. We affirm that judgment, accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-13\">. The court granted appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the charges of intimidating a witness and theft of property valued at less than $500. The jury acquitted appellant of first degree assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence, and carrying a handgun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b32-13\">. The stalking statute has been recodified without substantive change and is now located at Maryland Code (2002), \u00a7\u00a7 3-801 to 3-802 of the Criminal Law Article.

We have reviewed the statutes of other jurisdictions that expressly proscribed \"stalking,\u201d and were on the books in the Spring of 1993, when the General Assembly was considering its stalking legislation.
