We shall remand for further administrative proceedings on Heller\u2019s Whistle Blower claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"A-q\">Challenges To DNR\u2019s Fiscal Practices</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">From October 1998 until April 2001, James Heller worked for DNR as the manager of Somers Cove Marina (SCM) in Crisfield. When he was hired, Heller was instructed to find out \u201cwhy the marina was running a $197,000 deficit\u201d and to \u201cmake the [m]arina profitable.\u201d From the outset of his tenure, Heller\u2019s review of DNR\u2019s data, accounting, budgeting, and spending practices revealed what he believed were fiscal improprieties that included violations of NR section 5-908.1. Specifically, after talking with his predecessor and reviewing DNR\u2019s monthly \u201cgreen sheets\u201d showing receipts and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>penses, Heller suspected that there were three related problems contributing to SCM\u2019s financial shortfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">First, Heller concluded that revenue generated by the marina (called \u201cattainment\u201d) was not being timely credited to the Fund as required by NR section 5-908.1. In turn, because the marina\u2019s operating budget was predicated on attainment figures in a previous fiscal year, the marina\u2019s budget was set far below what it should have been and what was reasonably necessary to operate the marina. Among the problems Heller initially pointed to was that $80,000 in marina revenue had not been credited to the SCM Fund. When Heller brought this to the attention of three successive DNR supervisors and DNR budgeting officials, they pointed to prior management\u2019s failure to submit requisite paperwork as the explanation for the discrepancy between the revenue taken in at the marina and the revenue reported in the budgeting process. The alleged lack of paperwork resulted in credit card revenue being held in escrow, which in turn resulted in the exclusion of that attainment from the year-end figures used to create SCM\u2019s budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Second, Heller asserted, funds that had been appropriated for the marina were being diverted to other uses, also in violation of section 5-908.1. Among the expenses Heller initially brought to the attention of his DNR superiors were that $40,000 from the SCM Fund had been paid for operations at the Great Hope Golf Course in Somerset County, that a $24,000 truck supposedly purchased for SCM was being used by DNR Regional Director Joseph Ward at Jane\u2019s Island State Park, and that other Fund moneys had been used for various projects and personnel outside SCM. DNR officials told Heller that there was a three-year contractual arrangement for the marina to purchase golf course passes for resale at the marina, but that few or none of the purchased passes had been resold. They also took the position that the truck, as well as SCM funds, could be transferred and used for the benefit of other DNR facilities and personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Third, Heller complained that funds appropriated for SCM were being set aside (\u201cencumbered\u201d) for non-marina purchases and personnel, or for other purposes that were not included in the marina\u2019s budget, in violation of section 5-908.1. As a result, money budgeted for the marina was not being spent on the marina. Again, DNR officials explained to Heller that they considered some such encumbrances permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Heller concluded that DNR had a policy and routine practice of using SCM as a \u201ccash cow\u201d to fund DNR facilities, equipment, and personnel, outside SCM. From the outset, he expressed his strong belief that any diversion of SCM\u2019s attainment; any use of the SCM Fund or money appropriated for SCM; and any encumbrances on SCM\u2019s budget for purposes other than SCM facilities, programs, and personnel violated NR section 5-908.1. Heller objected that these practices caused the marina to be \u201cshorted\u201d in the amount budgeted, the amount credited, and the amount actually spent for the benefit of the marina. He maintained that these were improper and illegal fiscal practices that lay at the root of deficits, inadequate budgets, marina price increases, and ultimately, diminished service to marina customers and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In 1998 and early 1999, Heller brought his observations and objections to the attention of Joseph Ward, his immediate DNR supervisor who also had direct management responsibility for Jane\u2019s Island State Park, and Daryl DeCesare, DNR\u2019s Regional Manager for the Eastern Shore division of the State Parks and Forest Service (SPFS). Both rejected Heller\u2019s concerns that these practices violated section 5-908.1, for the reasons summarized above.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Despite his supervisors\u2019 explanations and assurances, Heller continued to complain about what he viewed as ongoing misuse of revenue generated by the marina and funds appropriated for the marina. Heller\u2019s concerns eventually became a matter of public discussion. One letter dated September 14, 2000, from a long term marina user to then-Governor Parris Glendening states that he had \u201cbeen informed that some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the money collected for the [m]arina has been siphoned into areas other than the Somers Cove Improvement Fund as outlined in Article 5-908.1\u201d and \u201cask[s] the Attorney General Office to investigate this matter.\u201d A November 2, 2000 letter from another marina user to DNR\u2019s Assistant Superintendent for the SFPS inquires about the \u201cactual amounts credited to the Somers Cove Improvement Fund\u201d and the \u201cyearly expenditures from the Somers Cove Improvement Fund ... attributable to the intended purpose of the fund as directed by Comar [sic] 5-908.1[.]\u201d These and follow up letters were shared with \u201cslipholders of Somers Cove Marina\u201d as well as DNR managers, including Ward, DeCesare, and SFPS Superintendent Barton. In addition, copies were sent to political representatives, including U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski, State Senator Lowell Stoltzfus, and State Delegate Charles McClenahan.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">By early 2001, the General Assembly had begun to audit DNR to determine, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the agency had corrected fiscal practices that had been disapproved in a 1999 audit report. Among the previously disapproved practices was DNR\u2019s use of legislatively earmarked funds for non-earmarked purposes, though no specific funds were identified in that report.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Ward and DeCesare responded repeatedly to Heller\u2019s concerns and complaints, rejecting each one and attempting to focus Heller on staying within the marina\u2019s budget, regardless of its acknowledged flaws. But Heller remained unsatisfied and continued to object to what he viewed as the continuing misuse of marina revenue and appropriations. According to Heller, unable to silence him, Ward, DeCesare, and other senior DNR managers created an opportunity to remove him from his post at the marina. Heller alleges that, as pretextual justification for a retaliatory transfer and demotion to a \u201cgopher\u201d position at a nearby park, DNR \u201ccooked up\u201d a harassment complaint by his disgruntled assistant, who was then rewarded for her role.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The EEO Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Mary Taylor began working at the marina as office manager in January 1999. Although Taylor and Heller initially had a good working relationship, by the summer of 2000, Heller was dissatisfied with her performance. From Heller\u2019s perspective, Taylor became difficult after he began a personal relationship with Becky Lowe, an area resident who did some contract work for the marina.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In July 2000, after consulting with Ward and DeCesare, Heller attempted to reprimand Taylor for various job performance deficiencies. Among the workplace problems, he felt, were inappropriate attempts to \u201cromanticize\u201d their strictly professional relationship. This session did not go well, ending with an upset Taylor leaving the marina. According to Heller, Taylor threatened to resign and he invited her to do so. According to Taylor, Heller demanded that she resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Taylor immediately contacted Ward and DeCesare, who intervened in the dispute. Taylor returned to work, with Ward and DeCesare assuming some of the supervisory responsibilities over her that Heller previously held. Tension between Heller and Taylor continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In August 2000, Lowe lodged a complaint against Taylor, alleging that Taylor steered Lowe\u2019s customers away from her. The complaint was investigated; in early 2001, it was determined to be \u201cunfounded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Meanwhile, both Heller and Taylor continued to complain to Ward about the \u201chostile work environment\u201d that each thought the other was creating. Heller went so far as to send an August 26, 2000 memo notifying Ward and DeCesare that Taylor appeared to be taking steps to \u201cset up\u201d the DNR for a \u201chostile environment\u201d lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">On April 11, 2001, Taylor followed up her oral conversations with Ward with a letter \u201cto substantiate our conversation on May 9, 2001[sic] regarding my concerns at Somers Cove Marina.\u201d Taylor stated that she felt \u201cvery uncomfortable working at Somers Cove Marina alone with Mr. Heller\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>because, \u201cunder the circumstances of the previous investigation brought about by Mr. Heller\u2019s significant other, Ms. Becky Lowe, ... I am quite concerned of future persecution from either Mr. Heller or Ms. Lowe.\u201d Asserting that \u201c[w]orking alone with Mr. Heller makes [such persecution] inevitable[,]\u201d Taylor claimed that \u201c[t]he accusations from the investigation show that both individuals mentioned have misconceptions of my intentions as an employee of Somers Cove and in my opinion [border] on sexual harassment.\u201d She pointed out that, \u201c[i]f the accusations were true, I would think that Mr. Heller would be writing this letter to you to avoid working alone with me. Instead, I am pleading for your immediate attention to my working conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">By memo dated April 13, DeCesare responded to Taylor\u2019s letter by ordering Ward to \u201cassume direct management of the marina\u201d while \u201cinvestigations are conducted[.]\u201d The following day, Ward met with Heller to advise him of Taylor\u2019s charges and to reassign him to a lesser position at Pocomoke River State Park, while Taylor remained at her marina post. According to Heller, Ward told him that he, rather than Taylor, was being removed from the marina \u201c[b]ecause you\u2019re the one the charges were made against.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Denying Taylor\u2019s charges, Heller maintained that Taylor\u2019s complaint was encouraged by Ward and DeCesare in an effort to create a pretext for removing him as marina manager, in order to silence his complaints about the misuse of marina funds. In support, Heller contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that, as an immediate result of his transfer and demotion, Taylor received an unusual five grade promotion and raise, retroactive for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Probable Cause Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In a written decision dated May 30, 2001, DNR\u2019s Equal Opportunity Employment Officer found \u201csufficient information and evidence against [Heller] to support a <em>\u2018Finding of Probable Cause,\u2019 </em>in that [Heller] did discriminate against [Mary Taylor] based on her gender.\u201d On June 21, SFPS Superintendent Col. Rick Barton issued a written reprimand to Heller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>based on that investigation and finding. He made permanent the transfer to Pocomoke, demoted Heller\u2019s employment grade, mandated that he submit to sexual harassment training, and barred him from having any contact with Taylor and from visiting Somers Cove Marina.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Through counsel, Heller appealed the decision to DNR Secretary Sarah Taylor-Rogers on both substantive and procedural grounds. In a letter dated June 29, 2001, counsel asserted that \u201cthe disciplinary action undertaken against [Heller] was prompted by a disclosure of managerial and fiscal misconduct!.]\u201d When the DNR Secretary found the action \u201cappropriate\u201d given \u201cthe seriousness of the findings of probable cause of sex discrimination,\u201d Heller again appealed, while reserving his right to assert a Whistle Blower claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On August 22, 2001, Heller asserted a Whistle Blower claim to the Secretary of the Department of Management and Budget. The Director of Audit and Management Review investigated and found no merit to the claim. His report reviews only Heller\u2019s early complaints about the Great Hope Golf Course, the pickup truck, and DNR\u2019s delay in crediting all SCM receipts, and rejects each one as the result of Heller\u2019s misunderstanding of DNR\u2019s budget and financial practices. On February 12, 2002, Heller appealed the decision, asking for an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge appointed by the Office of Administrative Hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">A March 26, 2002 settlement thereafter resulted in the DNR removing the written reprimand from Heller\u2019s record and upgrading his position at Pocomoke. Per agreement that \u201cthis Settlement Agreement does not affect any claims or defenses by either party in the Petitioner\u2019s Whistleblower action appealed to the Office of Administrative Hearings on February 12, 2002,\u201d Heller was free to pursue his claim under Maryland\u2019s Whistle Blower Law. DNR acknowledged that \u201cnothing in this Agreement shall prejudice [Heller\u2019s] Whistle Blower Complaint or DNR\u2019s ability to defend against same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">At the administrative hearing on Heller\u2019s Whistle Blower claim, the SFPS Superintendent Col. Rick Barton testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>that the decision to remove Heller was his alone, and that it was based exclusively on the EEO Officer\u2019s probable cause determination concerning Taylor\u2019s sexual harassment claim. The ALJ refused to allow Heller to ask Barton about the substance of. Taylor\u2019s complaint or to challenge the probable cause determination, holding that Heller waived any right to do so when he settled for removal of the reprimand from his record.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Heller was permitted, however, to offer testimony by State Senator Lowell Stoltzfus and former House Delegate Charles McClenahan. Both legislators commended Heller\u2019s \u201cexcellent\u201d work in improving the marina and were immediately concerned about the impact of his departure. According to both, when Barton, Dunmyer, Taylor-Rogers, and DeCesare were asked why Heller had been removed, they received two different answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Sen. Stolzfus testified that as soon as he heard about Heller\u2019s transfer, he pressed DeCesare for \u201cmore information as to why you are releasing him,\u201d because he \u201cwas aware of harassment charges which, ... I heard both sides of that story and wasn\u2019t entirely satisfied that that was a reality.\u201d When Stoltzfus \u201cpushed him further,\u201d saying \u201cthere\u2019s got to be something else,\u201d DeCesare \u201csaid, well, there\u2019s been some financial mismanagement,\u201d but \u201crefused to detail me on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Del. McClenahan, who was also a marina slipholder, testified that he called Jim Dunmyer, the Assistant Superintendent of SFPS, and also met with Sec. Taylor-Rogers, along with other Lower Shore representatives. Each told him he could not \u201cdiscuss it with you because it\u2019s an EEO claim and I can\u2019t give you any information about that.\u201d McClenahan then arranged a June 28th meeting on the issue for local government leaders and marina slip holders. The day before, DeCe-sare informed him by telephone \u201cthat Mr. Heller has been removed permanently from Somers Cove and the reason is for budget management.\u201d At the meeting, however, Barton stated that \u201cthe reason was for an EEO claim.\u201d McClenahan \u201cspoke up,\u201d saying: \u201cYesterday I was told by Mr. DeCesare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>that it was fiscal problems and now you\u2019re telling me this. What is the truth?\u201d At that point, \u201cDeCesare interrupted\u201d McClenahan to say, \u201cI told you that in confidence.\u201d McClena-han responded that he just \u201cwant[ed] to know what the claim is here. So there were two sides of the story.\u201d At the end of the meeting, based on what they were told, \u201cwe all left there with a feeling it was an EEO claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The ALJ issued a written decision denying Heller Whistle Blower relief for three reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">(a) Heller \u201cfailed to show that he made a protected disclosure under the Whistle Blower statute;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">(b) Heller \u201cfailed to show he was transferred in reprisal for his alleged disclosures;\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">(c) Heller\u2019s \u201callegations of fiscal impropriety were without merit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Heller petitioned for judicial review. The Circuit Court for Somerset County affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">Heller filed this timely appeal, raising three issues for our review, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">I. Did Heller make a \u201cprotected disclosure\u201d within the purview of the Whistle Blower Law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-14\">II. Did the ALJ err in restricting cross-examination and excluding evidence offered by Heller to establish that the EEO finding was used as a pretext for removing him as SCM manager in retaliation for his continuing disclosures regarding violations of NR section 5-908.1?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-15\">III. Did the ALJ err in requiring Heller to prove that his disclosures regarding fiscal wrongdoing were \u201cwell-founded\u201d rather than merely \u201creasonably held\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">We answer yes to the first and second questions. Because we must vacate the judgment and remand for further administrative proceedings on Heller\u2019s Whistle Blower claim, we briefly address the standard of proof issue for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Maryland\u2019s Whistle Blower Law</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The General Assembly has made it clear that, to ensure that \u2018\u201cgovernment operates in accordance with the law and in avoidance of mismanagement, monetary waste, abuse of authority, and danger to public health and safety[,] .... it is essential that classified State employees be free to disclose impropriety in [the] exercise of their constitutional right of free speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery v.

According to Heller, he made many protected disclosures, both written and oral. He asserts that, even though the ALJ did not find Heller\u2019s allegations regarding his oral statements to be credible, she committed clear error in finding that none of the documents he offered qualified as a disclosure that he \u201creasonably believed\u201d would \u201cevidence\u201d \u201cviolations of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">First and foremost, Heller points to a January 13, 2000 memorandum that he and Taylor wrote to Joseph Ward, and copied to DNR\u2019s Regional Director, Daryl DeCesare. This memo responded to a December 16, 1999 memo from Ward concerning the marina budget and possible cutbacks that might be necessary to stay within it. In his memo, Heller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>claimed to repeat prior complaints about the deleterious effects of what he viewed as DNR\u2019s continuing policy and practice of treating SCM as a \u201ccash cow\u201d to fund other DNR facilities, equipment, and personnel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">We now appreciate why our customers were so vocal when we came onboard with their outcry, \u201cA MARINA IS NOT A PARK!\u201d It is very obvious that there is little understanding of what it takes to run Somers Cove Marina.

We feel that we are being told to turn our backs on the progress we have made and let it regress to its former state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">Your point is well taken that the present Marina Budget can not support the proper operation of the Marina, especially when we are used as a \u201cCASH COW\u201d.

Please do not expect to hold us accountable for this if it is found in an audit and we are questioned as to why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>we did not \u201cBlow The Whistle\u201d.

We are deeply concerned about the impact this will have on the Marina\u2019s performance and reputation due to the Office Hours, Office Closures, Guard Coverage and the unavailability of Fuel Service.... (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Heller argues this qualifies as a protected disclosure because it reports violations of NR section 5-908.1\u2019s restrictions on the use of funds generated by the marina and on the use of funds appropriated for the marina budget. In his view, the memo satisfies all \u201celements of a protected disclosure under Section 5-305.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The January 13, 2000 memo alleges that DNR is engaging in prohibited fiscal practices that collectively harm the public interest by misusing money the legislature has earmarked for the marina. It complains about $258,000 in appropriated funds \u201cremoved from the Somers Cove Fund,\u201d and an additional $218,000 in marina revenue (attainment) that allegedly was not timely credited to the Fund. It explicitly invokes NR section 5-908.1 and discusses a need to \u201cblow the whistle\u201d on such practices. Finally, it decries the harm to public services provided by the marina, and that \u201cthe abuse has not been corrected and in fact has escalated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">In her written decision, the ALJ acknowledged that this memo \u201ccontains an[ ] allegation ... that Somers Cove funds are being used improperly!?]\u201d She nonetheless concluded that this memo does not qualify as a protected disclosure because it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">does not contain any specific information as to where funds were allegedly improperly diverted. In addition, it does not identify to whom the Complainant allegedly made such disclosures during the last six months....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>An additional problem with the ... alleged disclosures is that they all appear to be made to Mr. Ward and Mr. DeCesare.... [I]f [Heller] is accusing someone, or more than one person, who works at DNR headquarters in Annapolis of improperly diverting funds, then reporting this to his immediate supervisor and his supervisor does not constitute blowing the whistle. The Complainant would have to make such disclosures to someone who is in a position to address the problem, such as a high ranking official at DNR or to an outside agency that could conduct an investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">Thus, I find that the Complainant has failed to show that he made a protected disclosure under the Whistleblower statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">We find logical and legal errors in this analysis. First, we do not agree that the memo should be disregarded because Heller failed to specify \u201cwhere funds had allegedly been diverted.\u201d Heller alleged that the funds were being used for purposes outside the marina, in violation of NR section 5-908.1. Since that is the only permissible use for marina funds, Heller did not have to trace the funds to another specific destination in Annapolis or elsewhere. In any event, DNR does not dispute that Heller attempted to identify where he believed certain funds had been diverted in previous and subsequent correspondence with DNR management. Indeed, DNR presented the testimony of SFPS Director Barton that he and other DNR managers personally spoke with Heller regarding his concerns about the matters he raised shortly after he came to work at the marina.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Nor should Heller\u2019s memo be disregarded on the ground that it failed to identify the persons to whom he reported his concerns during the \u201csix months\u201d prior to this memo. As noted, SFPS Director Barton testified on behalf of DNR that Heller spoke to him about his specific concerns early in his tenure at the marina. Further, even if Heller had not previously disclosed his concerns, it is enough that this memo alleging violations of law was sent to Ward and copied to DeCesare, the two DNR managers who supervised Heller, both of whom had some responsibility for fiscal policies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>practices affecting the marina, and both of whom later participated in the events that led to Heller\u2019s removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Finally, we disagree with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that this memo does not constitute blowing the whistle because it was directed to Ward and DeCesare. To be sure, \u201c[t]he purpose of the [Whistle Blower Law] is to encourage government personnel to disclose government wrongdoing to persons who may be in a position to remedy the problem without fearing retaliatory action by their supervisors or those who might be harmed by the disclosures.\u201d <em>Willis, </em>141 F.3d at 1143. For that reason, a disclosure \u201cdirected to the wrongdoers themselves is normally not viewable as whistleblowing.\u201d <em>Horton v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>66 F.3d 279, 282 (Fed.Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1176, 116 S.Ct. 1271, 134 L.Ed.2d 218 (1996). Nor are complaints to supervisors voicing mere dissatisfaction with a superior\u2019s decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">Discussion and even disagreement with supervisors over job-related activities is a normal part of most occupations. It is entirely ordinary for an employee to fairly and reasonably disagree with a supervisor who overturns the employee\u2019s decision. In complaining to his supervisors, [the alleged whistleblower] has done no more than voice his dissatisfaction with his superior\u2019s decision. He has taken no action to bring an issue to the attention of authorities in a position to correct ... illegal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\"><em>Willis, </em>141 F.3d at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">But Heller\u2019s complaints were not about wrongdoing by Ward and DeCesare; instead they addressed the policies and practices established by DNR budgeting authorities. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>are we aware of any requirement that whistle blowers must bypass their immediate supervisors in order to make protected disclosures. In this instance, Heller had good reason to make disclosures to Ward and DeCesare, just as he had also made them to SFPS Superintendent Barton and to DNR budget officials. As a factual matter, both Ward and DeCe-sare were \u201chigh[er] ranking officials at DNR,\u201d with management authority to pursue Heller\u2019s \u201ccash cow\u201d concerns \u201cup the chain\u201d at DNR. DeCesare managed SFPS facilities throughout the Eastern Shore; Ward managed two of those facilities. Neither one created the official DNR fiscal policies and practices that Heller challenged. Ward signaled that he would pursue the changes sought by Heller by assuring Heller that he agreed that changes in the budget and budgeting process should be made for the benefit of Somers Cove Marina, even if he ultimately did not view the challenged practices as violations of section 5-908.1. We conclude that both Ward and DeCesare were in a position either to correct some of the alleged violations of section 5-908.1, or to bring that special fund restriction to the attention of other DNR managers and/or outside authorities who might succeed in changing DNR\u2019s fiscal policy and practices with respect to the marina, as required under <em>Willis. </em>Indeed, both necessarily would be involved in any correction of the allegedly illegal DNR practices Heller challenged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>In this critical respect, Heller\u2019s disclosure differs from other supervisor disclosures that did not qualify as protected disclosures. For example, in <em>Willis, </em>a Department of Agriculture inspector complained to his supervisors about their decisions to reverse six of his findings that farms did not comply with USDA conservation plans. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held that \u201cWillis\u2019s complaints to supervisors are not disclosures of the type the WPA was designed to encourage and protect\u201d because they did \u201cno more than voice his dissatisfaction with his superiors\u2019 decision.\u201d <em>Willis, </em>141 F.3d at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In contrast to Willis, Heller did not write the January 13 memo in order to challenge a particular decision by Ward or DeCesare. Rather, his disclosures and complaints were part of a campaign \u201cto bring an issue to the attention of authorities in a position to correct fraudulent or illegal activity\u201d or otherwise \u201cto correct ... abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We read Heller\u2019s memo as an effort to disclose information that would persuade Ward and DeCesare to participate in \u201cblowing the whistle\u201d on the allegedly continuing violations of section 5-908.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">For similar reasons, Heller\u2019s memo differs from the unprotected disclosures addressed in <em>Horton. </em>There, a probationary Marine Corps librarian alleged that he was disciplined for complaining that his supervisor and co-workers slept on the job, were chronically tardy, failed to timely process more than 3,000 books, and falsified time cards. The Federal Circuit agreed that the employee\u2019s oral disclosures concerning these practices were not protected because \u201cthese criticisms were made directly to the persons about whose behavior Mr. Horton complained, ostensibly for disciplinary or corrective purposes.\u201d <em>Horton, </em>66 F.3d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>In contrast to Horton, Heller did not seek disciplinary measures against Ward or DeCesare; nor did he complain about a particular decision made by Ward or DeCesare. Rather, Heller sought to persuade and enlist both of his supervisors in correcting DNR accounting, budgeting, and appropriation policies and practices that none of them made unilaterally, but that all three together might collectively seek to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Another logical problem with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Heller did not make a protected disclosure stems from the ALJ overlooking other documents when she concluded that the January 13 memo is the \u201conly\u201d one in which Heller seeks to inform DNR management about the misuse of SCM funds. The record undisputedly shows that, in subsequent correspondence with various DNR managers, Heller provided additional information to support his contentions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u2022 On February 14, 2000, Heller wrote to DeCesare and Ward that \u201cit is time for a pay-back\u201d of the \u201c$223K [taken by DNR headquarters in Annapolis] from FY99\u2019s attainment which is 36% instead of the normal 12%\u201d reserved for DNR overhead.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\u2022 On February 18, 2000, Heller responded to a request for an update on the marina budget, providing figures that he asserted would support his complaint that DNR failed to give the marina appropriate credit for its revenue (attainment). In an effort to boost the FY 2001 and FY 2002 budgets, Heller advised Ward and DeCesare that SCM\u2019s FY99 budget was $448K and our attainment was $623K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">The budget for FY2000, prepared two years ago, is $405K. Our projected attainment is $710K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">\u2022 In a July 19, 2000 self-evaluation, which Heller was instructed to bring to his annual Performance and Planning Evaluation meeting for discussion with Ward, Heller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>responded to the question: \u201cWhat could be done or changed to help you do your job better?\u201d Heller wrote: \u201cinsure compliance with ... 5-908.1 SCM Improvement Fund at all levels.\u201d Ward signed the form, indicating that he had reviewed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u2022 On November 6, 2000, Heller sent Ward, DeCesare, and another DNR supervisor a memorandum challenging items listed on the \u201cgreen sheets\u201d that DNR uses to report revenue and expenses. E387. After itemizing specific expenditures and credits, Heller raised a number of \u201cquestions and concerns.\u201d For example, he i pointed to apparently duplicative encumbrances in the amount of $14,317 for a \u201cFord Pickup\u201d in both FY 2000 and FY 2001, as well as a separate encumbrance for $11,600 in \u201cmoney to repaint the Museum and the Office Building\u201d for which SCM was charged. Heller also claimed that he still had not been provided a copy of the \u201cactual budget\u201d four and a half months into the fiscal year, that he had not been \u201cincluded in the budget process,\u201d and that the \u201cvery comprehensive business plan\u201d prepared for and submitted to DNR was not being followed for budgeting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We hold that the January 13, 2000 memo and these documents, along with Barton\u2019s testimony about his discussions with Heller, collectively establish that Heller disclosed a \u201cviolation of law\u201d by identifying the lawbreaking conduct, the misuse of funds earmarked by the General Assembly for the use of Somers Cove Marina, to DNR managers who were in a position to correct the alleged violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">DNR does not dispute that Heller\u2019s complaints were motivated by his concerns for the marina and its patrons. Thus, Heller also established that he was \u201cmoved by a concern for the public well-being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">As to the final requirement for a Whistle Blower claim based on \u201cviolation of law\u201d disclosures, we find Heller showed that, at the time he was complaining to DNR managers, he had a reasonable belief that he was disclosing a violation of NR section 5-908.1. The \u201creasonable belief\u2019 stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>dard requires us to measure objectively what Heller knew and believed at the time he made these disclosures, rather than what DNR officials knew and believed, what Heller later learned, or what DNR and the AL J ultimately concluded. <em>See Montgomery, </em>377 Md. at 625, 835 A.2d 169; <em>Horton, </em>66 F.3d at 283. Thus, the fact that DNR officials considered Heller\u2019s complaints to be without merit does not prevent us from concluding that Heller had an objectively reasonable belief that he was disclosing violations of NR section 5-908.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On that mixed question of fact and law, the documents reviewed above clearly profess Heller\u2019s conviction that DNR violated section 5-908.1. The problems cited by Heller mirror the problems cited by the General Assembly\u2019s auditors, including the improper failure to credit certain DNR accounts and the prohibited transfer of special funds for non-restricted uses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> DNR\u2019s auditor testified that Heller\u2019s concerns, as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>later restated them in his August 2001 Whistle Blower complaint, were \u201c[v]ery good questions,\u201d even if, in his view, a technical investigation and explanation of DNR\u2019s funding, accounting, and budgeting process ultimately support DNR\u2019s position that there was no \u201cmilking\u201d of SCM Funds. The DNR investigator, the ALJ, and the circuit court all emphasized that Heller\u2019s complaints lacked merit, though we note that none explained why DNR could use funds earmarked for Somers Cove for personnel or property at other DNR facilities when section 5-908.1 prohibits that. Of significance to this appeal, however, is that none proceeded to consider the material question for purposes of assessing whether Heller\u2019s communications qualified as protected disclosures, <em>i.e., </em>whether Heller made them in a good faith belief that SCM funds were being used in violation of section 5-908.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">We hold that, through his January 13, 2000 memo, his discussions with DNR management, and his other written complaints to his DNR supervisors, Heller made protected disclosures alleging that DNR policies and practices with respect to revenue generated by Somers Cove Marina and funds appropriated for the marina were prohibited by NR section 5-908.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Heller Must Be Permitted To Challenge DNR\u2019s Probable Cause Determination To Show Pretext</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">As alternative grounds for judgment in favor of DNR, both the ALJ and the circuit court concluded that Heller failed to prove reprisal for any allegedly protected disclosure. This conclusion rests squarely on Col. Barton\u2019s testimony that the probable cause determination made by DNR\u2019s EEO Officer was the sole reason he removed Heller from his post at the marina.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Heller does not contest that Barton\u2019s testimony constitutes substantial evidence in support the ALJ\u2019s \u201cno reprisal\u201d finding. Instead, he argues that the ALJ denied him a meaningful opportunity to challenge Barton\u2019s testimony. In particular, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Heller contends that the ALJ erred in restricting his cross-examination of Barton and in excluding other evidence concerning Taylor\u2019s complaint and the ensuing investigation and probable cause determination. Heller complains that these impermissible restrictions prejudiced his ability to undermine Barton\u2019s credibility regarding the basis for his decision to transfer Heller, by preventing him from offering evidence that the probable cause determination rests on a questionable factual, procedural,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and legal foundation. We agree with Heller that he is entitled to question Barton and others, and to offer other relevant documents and testimony, in an effort to challenge Barton\u2019s testimony regarding his motive for the transfer decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In a retaliation case, after the employer offers evidence of a non-retaliatory reason for the challenged personnel action, the employee must be afforded an opportunity to present rebuttal evidence that the employer\u2019s asserted reason is pretextual. <em>See Nerenberg v. RICA of Southern Md., </em>131 Md.App. 646, 662, 750 A.2d 655, <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 275, 757 A.2d 810 (2000); <em>Killian v. Kinzer, </em>123 Md.App. 60, 68, 716 A.2d 1071, <em>cert. denied, </em>352 Md. 311, 721 A.2d 989 (1998). The employee\u2019s evidence of pretext is often circumstantial, as it is here.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">To prove retaliation for his whistle blowing disclosures, Heller had to show that the disclosures were \u201ca contributing factor\u201d in the decision to transfer him. <em>See Willis, </em>141 F.3d at 1143. In an effort to do that, Heller sought to challenge the credibility of Barton\u2019s \u201csole consideration\u201d testimony with evidence that Taylor\u2019s complaint was used as a pretext. We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s rulings denied Heller a meaningful opportunity to mount that challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>As a threshold matter, we shall hold that, in settling his grievance, Heller did not waive his right to challenge DNR\u2019s probable cause determination during the proceedings on his Whistle Blower claim. To the contrary, by explicitly preserving his right to pursue his Whistle Blower claim, which is necessarily premised on an allegation that Taylor\u2019s complaint was \u201ccooked up\u201d with the aid and/or approval of DNR management, Heller also preserved his right to offer evidence that the probable cause determination was an unjustified cover up for reprisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">At the heart of Heller\u2019s attempt to prove pretext is the credibility of Barton\u2019s testimony that he had sole responsibility for the decision and that the probable cause determination was the sole consideration in that decision. Thus, the circumstances surrounding Taylor\u2019s complaint and DNR\u2019s response to it are highly relevant to the critical issue of whether Heller\u2019s protected disclosures regarding violations of section 5-908.1 were a contributing factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The ALJ\u2019s restrictions on Col. Barton\u2019s cross-examination prevented Heller from challenging Barton\u2019s credibility by exploring the circumstances surrounding Taylor\u2019s complaint and DNR\u2019s response to it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although Heller was permitted to elicit from Barton that he had no \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d regarding Taylor\u2019s complaint or the DNR investigation, and to present testimony by Sen. Stoltzfus and Del. McClenahan that DeCesare personally acknowledged to them that Heller was removed for fiscal and budgeting reasons, the ALJ otherwise prevented counsel from challenging Barton\u2019s testimony that he alone made the decision to transfer Heller and that he made the decision to permanently transfer and demote Heller based \u201csolely\u201d on the May 30, 2001 probable cause determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>For example, Heller should have been permitted to question Barton about his role, if any, in the preliminary decision to transfer Heller prior to either the EEO investigation or the probable cause determination; a reasonable fact finder could view evidence that Barton participated, recommended, or supported this immediate action as evidence that the investigation and probable cause determination were merely <em>post hoc </em>\u201cwindow dressing.\u201d In addition, Heller was entitled to explore with Barton and other DNR officials whether, in light of DNR policy and past practices, the substance of Taylor\u2019s complaint merited the investigation and disciplinary action that was taken against Heller; for example, evidence that less drastic measures are preferred DNR policy or practice for complaints of \u201cdiscomfort\u201d due to fear that a complaint may be lodged in the future might support Heller\u2019s pretext claim. Similarly, Heller was entitled to question Barton and other DNR officials about why his reports alleging that Taylor was seeking a personal relationship or an opportunity to assert a hostile environment claim were apparently disregarded for months, whereas Taylor\u2019s complaint received immediate attention and action.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Such evidence is relevant to the extent it supports or refutes Heller\u2019s contention that DNR management encouraged and/or seized upon Taylor\u2019s complaint as an opportunity to silence Heller\u2019s persistent disclosures concerning violations of section 5-908.1, at a time when outside scrutiny on that issue was \u201cheating up\u201d in the public and legislative arenas. In concluding that Barton alone acted on the sole basis of the probable cause determination, the ALJ rejected Heller\u2019s pre-textual reprisal claim. Because the evidentiary record upon which the ALJ made her factual determination that there was no reprisal did not include relevant evidence that should have been considered in making that determination, we must remand for a <em>de novo </em>administrative hearing on the fundamental factual issues raised by Heller.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In doing so, we emphasize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that we do not express any view regarding the merits of Heller\u2019s Whistle Blower claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u201cReasonable Belief\u201d Standard For Whistle Blowers</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The ALJ found that Heller\u2019s \u201callegations of fiscal impropriety were without merit.\u201d Heller argues that this is the wrong standard for evaluating a Whistle Blower claim because the law protects not only employees who turn out to report true violations of the law, but also employees who disclose \u201cinformation that the employee reasonably believes evidences\u201d a violation of law. <em>See Fine v. Ryan Int\u2019l Airlines, </em>305 F.3d 746, 752 (7th Cir.2002)(employee alleging retaliation need not prove actual governmental abuse, only employee\u2019s reasonable belief that there was abuse). Thus, Heller asserts, he is not obligated to show that his allegations of impropriety and illegality are meritorious, but merely to show that, at the time he made them, they were \u201cwell-founded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">DNR agrees that the correct standard for a Whistle Blower claim is whether the employee had an objectively reasonable belief that his disclosure evidenced a violation. <em>See Montgomery, </em>377 Md. at 641, 835 A.2d 169. On remand, that standard must be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">JUDGMENT VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR SOMERSET COUNTY WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET FOR FURTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

This is a fundamental distinction between whistle blowing by government employees for tire benefit of the public at large and whistle blowing by private sector employees for the benefit of a discrete group of individuals. The language of SPP section 5-305 reflects the General Assembly\u2019s policy of encouraging state employees to report information that serves the public interest by exposing and eliminating governmental violations of the law. For that reason, state employees may make disclosures to any governmental authority who is in a position to correct the alleged illegality. <em>Cf. Willis, </em>141 F.3d at 1143. Although Maryland common law in some circumstances affords relief to whistle blowers in the private sector through a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, private whistle blowers who seek to report alleged violations of law must do so to law enforcement authorities. <em>See Wholey v. Sears Roebuck, </em>370 Md. 38, 803 A.2d 482, (2002) (Sears employee who was fired after internally reporting suspected criminal activity of another employee to co-workers and supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>sors did not have a wrongful discharge tort claim because public policy exception to employment at will doctrine applies only to private whistle blowers who report such wrongdoing to police or other law enforcement authorities); <em>King v. Marriott </em>Int'l, <em>Inc., </em>160 Md.App. 689, 866 A.2d 895, 2005 WL 170685, *6 (2005) (Maryland law governing wrongful discharge does not \"recognize a public policy in favor of [private] employees who reported corporate wrongdoing to internal authorities like supervisors\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\">. Special funds such as the SCM Fund may be charged with a pro rata share of departmental overhead expenses, pursuant to NR section 1-103(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\">. The first finding in the February 2002 report states that DNR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">improperly transferred fiscal year 2000 expenditures totaling approximately $2.8 million between programs, and in some cases between funding sources, because certain programs exceeded their budgeted appropriations and funding was available in the other programs to cover the shortfall. Instead, a budget amendment to transfer the related appropriations should have been requested. These transfers increased total expenditures charged against the General Fund by approximately $351,000. Adequate documentation was not available to support the propriety of the transfers between funding sources. Because many of the Department\u2019s special funds are restricted by law for specific purposes, indiscriminate transfers of expenditures could have resulted in special funds being used for inappropriate purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">Some of these conditions were commented upon in our two preceding audit reports. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Although DNR\u2019s auditor testified without objection that his superior in the Department orally advised him that these findings did not relate to SCM funds, there was no evidence to corroborate that hearsay, from either the superior or the independent author of these reports regarding the specific funds that had been misused. In any event, there was no evidence that Heller realized that the disapproved practices cited in the audits did not relate to Somers Cove Marina, so that, at the time Heller complained that SCM was being \u201cmilked\u201d as a \"cash cow,\u201d a fact finder might determine that he reasonably believed he was disclosing fiscal practices that had been criticized by auditors and prohibited by section 5-908.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\">. In challenging the reprimand, Heller asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that \"the disciplinary action taken was not in compliance with \u00a7 11-106 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, in that the appointing authority never met with him and considered mitigating circumstances prior to imposing discipline,\" and \u201cin that it was taken later than 30 days after the appointing authority had acquired knowledge of the alleged misconduct for which the disciplinary action is imposed.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\">. The ALJ's rulings did not preclude Heller from questioning DNR officials about other relevant matters, including (1) direct or indirect communications concerning Heller\u2019s complaints about violations of section 5-908.1; and (2) knowledge of either the public complaints regarding violations of section 5-908.1, the 1999 legislative audit, or the audit that was underway when Heller was removed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\">. We are not persuaded otherwise by the fact that the Whistle Blower Law does not prevent DNR from taking \u201ca personnel action that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>have been taken regardless of a disclosure of information/\u2019 or that an executive branch employee who violates State sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies may be disciplined. <em>See </em>SPP \u00a7 5-215; SPP \u00a7 5-302(b). These rules do not apply as a matter of law, at least as long as there are material disputes over whether Heller violated State discrimination policies and whether the untested probable cause determination was a legitimate justification for the transfer. As explained above, the dispute over whether any gender discrimination occurred was not finally litigated due to the settlement. As for whether the probable cause determination, by itself, is the sole and justified reason for Heller's transfer, Heller is entitled to a new administrative hearing on those questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
