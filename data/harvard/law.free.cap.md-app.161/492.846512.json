MOYLAN, JR., Judge (Retired, Specially Assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">As is frequently the plight of pro-se litigation, this case is a procedural mess. It may, however, with a touch of kindly forbearance, be salvageable.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>An Application for MPIA Disclosure</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The appellant, Victor Blythe, Jr., on August 20, 2002, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Harford County, asking that, under the provisions of the Maryland Public Information Act (MPIA), the Harford County Police Department be required to turn over to him for his inspection the file from his earlier prosecution for homicide. On February 27, 2004, a hearing was held, at the end of which the motion to compel the disclosure of the file was denied. This appeal, with a few inconsequential bumps and corrections of course, is from that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The file in issue was that of a seven-year-old homicide case against the appellant. That case was closed at the nisi prius level on August 15, 1997, when a Harford County jury convicted the appellant of two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of armed robbery, two counts of kidnapping, and a single count of conspiracy to commit murder. He was sentenced to two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. On October 6, 1998, this Court affirmed the convictions in an unreported decision. The Court of Appeals on December 24, 1998, denied the petition for a writ of certiorari. At that point, the criminal case against the appellant had been finally concluded. The significance of that closure will be a major factor in our subsequent analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The Application Denied</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">In July of 2000, the appellant first sought to have the Harford County police (or Sheriffs Department or State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office) furnish him with a copy of the file. On July 14, he was notified by the County Attorney\u2019s Office that his request was being denied. The letter from the Assistant County Attorney simply recited, without any supporting detail, the statutory laundry list of possible reasons for a denial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agx\"><em>The requested information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to Section 10-618(f)(2) of the State Government Article </em>of the Annotated Code of Maryland and the subsections contained therein. Specifically, disclosure of this in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>formation would interfere with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding; constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal property; disclose the identity of confidential sources; disclose investigative techniques and procedures; prejudice an investigation; and, endanger the life or physical safety of individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">In addition, any contemplated use of these materials in post-conviction proceedings would be precluded by <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County, et al., </em>299 Md. 498, 474 A.2d 880 (1984). Specifically, <em>whenever a defendant in a pending criminal proceeding seeks access to investigatory police repoHs, the Maryland Public Information Act does not require the disclosure </em>of said investigatory police reports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">On August 9, the appellant wrote back to the County Attorney\u2019s Office, seeking \u201cadministrative review\u201d of the July 14 denial of his request for the file. The Assistant County Attorney wrote back to the appellant on August 16, acknowledging the request for a review of the denial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">I am in receipt of your letter dated August 9, 2000. Your letter seeks administrative review in accordance with Section 10-622 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The County Attorney\u2019s Office responded by erecting a legal stone wall that is daunting enough for us to interpret and must have completely overawed a pro-se inmate of the House of Correction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">[T]he Sheriff of Harford County, the custodian of these records, is not a unit subject to Subtitle 2 of Title 10 in accordance with Section 10-622(b). Section 10-203(a)(4) specifically excludes an officer or unit not part of a principal department of state government that is created by or pursuant to the Maryland Constitution, operates in only one county and is funded wholly or partly from local funds. <em>See also, Rucker v. Harford County, </em>316 Md. 275, 558 A.2d 399 (1989). Because the Sheriff is not a unit subject to Subtitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>2 of Title 10 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, administrative review pursuant to Section 10-622 of the State Government Article is not available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">There was no further action in the case until the appellant, on August 20, 2002, filed in the Circuit Court a Motion for a Court Order Compelling MPIA Compliance. The court conducted a hearing on - the appellant\u2019s motion on February 27, 2004. The motion was denied and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The Procedural Glitches</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The appellee cites four reasons why the trial court\u2019s denial of the appellant\u2019s motion should be affirmed. The fourth is based upon the actual merits of the MPIA. The other three concern alleged procedural inadequacies of the appellant\u2019s case. The appellee argues that the trial court, rather than addressing the merits, should simply have dismissed the case as mistitled and misfiled. In its brief, the appellee refers, less than charitably, to the procedural lapses.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">The circuit court appropriately denied Blythe\u2019s motion to compel compliance with the MPIA, given [(1)] his failure to comply with the statutory procedure for judicial review, [(2)] his failure to provide notice to the county agency that denied his MPIA request, [and (3)] his failure to pursue judicial review within the applicable two-year limitations period set forth in Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The trial court, however, chose to reach the merits. So shall we. In the last analysis, the procedural sins were venial, not mortal.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">A. \u201cA Rose By Any Other Name ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">As the appellee quite correctly points out, the judicial review available pursuant to \u00a7 10-623(a) is by way of an original civil action. Section 10-623(a) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Whenever a person ... is denied inspection of a public record, the person ... may file a complaint with the circuit court for the county where:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">(2) the public record is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The appellant, laboring under the misapprehension that this case was but the latest chapter in the saga that had begun with his arrest in 1996, styled the action as <em>\u201cState of Maryland v. Victor Junior Blythe, </em>Case Number 12-K-96-000348 IN.\u201d That was the original number of the criminal case filed on \u201c04/23/1996\u201d with its then current status then listed as \u201cClosed/Inactive.\u201d The MPIA case now before us is, indeed, inaptly named. Is the mislabeling, however, such stuff as ultimate dismissal should be made of? An Order of this Court, filed on June 9, 2004, directing that the circuit court\u2019s judgment be formally entered and docketed, recognized the misnomer but had no difficulty in allowing the case to go forward:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">On August 22, 2002, the Circuit Court for Harford County received appellant\u2019s \u201cMotion for a Court Order Compelling MPIA Compliance,\u201d challenging Harford County\u2019s denial on July 14, 2000, of appellant\u2019s Public Information act request. <em>The action, though civil, was docketed in the instant criminal case </em>where appellant was convicted of murder on October 21, 1997. <em>For purposes of this Order, the aforesaid motion will be assumed to be a duly commenced civil action.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Another provision of that same Order indicated that, notwithstanding the inappropriate styling, the case was alive and well as it approached appellate review before us.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">ORDERED that <em>the record on appeal will remain in this Court </em>and, subject to further Order of this Court, <em>the briefing and argument schedule in this matter shall not be affected by this Order.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Neither was the circuit court deterred by the name of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>case from reaching its merits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But for the name, what is now before us as the case of <em>Blythe v. State </em>is indistinguishable from what would be before us had the case been named <em>Blythe v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County. </em>See, e.g., <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County, </em>299 Md. 493, 474 A.2d 880 (1984). We are not for a moment condoning slipshod labeling practices but, realistically, in terms of the extreme sanction sought by the appellee, we must conclude, with Juliet, \u201cWhat\u2019s in a name?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">B. Were the Proper Defendants Actually Left Without Notice?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The appellee\u2019s second attack on the appellant\u2019s pleading skills is scathing in its cataloging of the appellant\u2019s many procedural shortcomings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">As pertinent Maryland Rules further require, upon the filing of such a complaint for judicial review, a summons and complaint must be served upon the defendant agency or custodian of records that denied the MPIA request. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-lll(b) (plaintiffs obligations preliminary to issuance of summons); Md. Rule 2-112(a) (process \u2014 issuance of summons); Md. Rule 2-114 (process \u2014 content); Md. Rule 2-121 (process \u2014 service in personam).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">Here, it is undisputed that <em>Blythe did not file a complaint seeking judicial review in accordance with the requirement of \u00a7 10-623(a), </em>and that <em>summons and complaint were not served upon Harford County or its police department, </em>which was the agency that denied Blythe\u2019s MPIA request. <em>Nor is there any indication in the record that Blythe provided Harford County or its police department with notice of the Motion to Compel MPIA Compliance </em>filed in the criminal case. Under these circumstances, <em>the proceedings below did not even include the proper defendant </em>in an action for judicial review under \u00a7 10-623, which is the agency that denied the MPIA request. Only the State and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Blythe are parties in the criminal case; neither Harford County or its police department are parties in that proceeding. Therefore, the motion filed by Blythe could not possibly comply with the judicial review provision of the MPIA, and the circuit court properly denied the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Notwithstanding those dire forebodings, the proper defendants, by some wondrous necromancy, 1) were fully on top of the case from the moment of its filing; 2) were on station before the trial court, admirably prepared, on the scheduled hearing date; and 3) defended the case with consummate competence and skill. They suffered under no misapprehension that the case was a criminal one. They displayed intimate familiarity with the MPIA, and especially with \u00a7\u00a7 10-618(f)(2) and 10-623. They relied, with tactical adroitness, on <em>Faulk v. States Attorney for Harford County, supra. </em>The appellee does not suggest what more they might have done, had they been more formally notified and served.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In actuality, however, the proper defendants were fully notified. The appellant\u2019s initial request for his file was directed to the Harford County Police Department, as custodian of the file in issue. The letter was referred to the County Attorney\u2019s Office, which responded to the appellant on July 14, 2002, with copies of the reply being sent to both the Harford County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and the Harford County Sheriffs Office. The appellant\u2019s follow-up letter of August 9, 2000, was directed to the Sheriff for Harford County, as custodian of the file. It was the County Attorney\u2019s Office which, on August 16, answered the appellant\u2019s letter, again \u201ccopying\u201d the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and the Sheriffs Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The appellant initiated this court proceeding on August 22, 2002, by filing his Motion for a Court Order Compelling MPIA Compliance. The motion identified itself as one brought pursuant to the MPIA. Albeit entitled <em>\u201cBlythe v. State,\u201d </em>the document referred to the \u201cRespondent, the Harford County Police Department\u201d and described the respondent as \u201ca gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ernmental unit responsible for the custody, care and control of the records in question pertaining to the Petitioner.\u201d The relief sought by the appellant was a court order directed to the Harford County Police Department.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">WHEREFORE, <em>the Petitioner, </em>Victor Blythe, Pro se, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following and <em>prays that:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">A. <em>This </em>Honorable Court <em>enter an Order, Compelling the Harford County Police Department </em>to disclose and copy any and all records, documents, correspondence, reports, photographs, maps, files, tape recordings and all other discovery/documentary material <em>with redaction, </em>relating in any way to any police investigation involving Petitioner\u2019s alleged role in the murders of Dwight Nelson and Marlene Ellis, specifically including the production of the documents in Exhibit # 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The appellant\u2019s Certificate of Service asserted that copies of the motion had been sent to 1) the County Attorney\u2019s Office, 2) the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, and 3) the Sheriffs Office. The State\u2019s Response to Petitioner\u2019s Motion was promptly filed on September 16, 2002, by Vernon M. Gentile, an assistant state\u2019s attorney for Harford County. The response recognized that the appellant had misstyled his complaint by giving it the title and number of the original criminal case. Notwithstanding that, the response was fully alert as to what it was that the appellant was asking the court to do.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">That a <em>motion </em>such as petitioner\u2019s <em>is a request for judicial review under the State Government Article, Section 10-623, </em>and is a civil proceeding. <em>However, this motion has been filed pursuant to the original criminal proceeding, </em>as indicated in the captioned case number which this motion has been filed under.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The same assistant state\u2019s attorney represented the appel-lee at the hearing before the circuit court on February 27, 2004, and competently defended the case on the MPIA merits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>From the filing of this case on August 22, 2002, through its final disposition on February 27, 2004, all interested parties were on full actual notice of all developments. No one was left in the dark. By whatever modality, all parties were fully on notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">C. The Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In appellate brief, the appellee raises, for the first time, the defense that the appellant\u2019s motion to compel MPIA compliance was untimely filed. Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 5-110, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\"><em>An action </em>to enforce any criminal or civil liability created under \u00a7\u00a7 [10-611 through 10-628 of State Government Article] of this Code <em>may be brought within two years from the date on which the cause of action arises.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">It is the appellee\u2019s argument that the letter of August 16, 2000, in which the County Attorney\u2019s Office finally denied the appellant\u2019s request for his file, represented the date on which this cause of action accrued. That date, does, indeed, appear to be an accurate one for the accrual of the cause of action. As this Court noted in <em>Kline v. Fuller, </em>56 Md.App. 294, 306, 467 A.2d 786 (1983),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\"><em>The sheriffs denial </em>of Kline\u2019s request to inspect the two categories of documents at issue here <em>represented a final administrative action, which the circuit court was being asked to review. </em>Although both [\u00a7 10-623] and Kline\u2019s petition speak in terms of a mandatory injunction ordering the production of the records, in such a proceeding, the court would necessarily have to determine whether the records in question are subject to the Act and, if so, whether the sheriffs refusal to disclose them is justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">(Emphasis supplied). The filing of the appellant\u2019s complaint on August 22, 2002, did not come within the prescribed two years, but two years and six days later.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The short answer to the contention is that it has not been preserved for appellate review. In the appellee\u2019s answer of September 17, 2002 to the appellant\u2019s complaint, there was no mention made of a limitations problem. In the appellee\u2019s argument before the circuit court on February 27, 2004, there was no mention made of a limitations problem. The trial judge never made a ruling on limitations and was never called upon to make such a ruling. Accordingly, we will not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Just as the appellee is doing with the limitations issue in this case, the defendant/custodian of records in <em>City of Frederick v. Randall, </em>154 Md.App. 543, 841 A.2d 10 (2004), sought, at the appellate level, to justify non-disclosure on grounds that had not been specified in the initial letter denying the request for disclosure. Judge Salmon wrote for this Court in holding that such grounds were not cognizable either at the trial level or on appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">The City also claims that the denial of access was justified by exemptions contained in SG sections 10-615 and 10-617. The short and complete answer to that contention is that <em>the custodian of records is required under the MPIA to explain to the requester the reason for denial. Ms. Borden in her written response to the request never justified denial of access </em>based on sections 10-615 or 10-617; likewise, in her December 22, 2000, testimony, which was relied upon by both parties at the motions hearing, she never claimed that denial was based on those sections of the MPIA. <em>Under such circumstances, the motions judge did not err by failing to consider the provisions </em>of sections 10-615 or 10-617.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>154 Md.App. at 575, 841 A.2d 10 (emphasis supplied). See also <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Washington Post Co., </em>149 Md.App. 289, 317 n. 21, 332 n. 33, 815 A.2d 859 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Even in rejecting the contention, we cannot help but note the feeble character of Courts Article, \u00a7 5-110 as an effective statute of limitations. Ordinarily, the phenomenon being litigated is a discrete historic event \u2014 an accident, a breach of contract, an act of professional malpractice, a crime. If litigation is not commenced within a prescribed period of time, the right to litigate, and to recover, may be lost forever. In such a context, a statute of limitations has critical importance. The focus of the litigation, moreover, is on the significance of what the parties did back at the time of the triggering historic event, not on the current propriety of what they are doing, or are about to do, at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The focus of an MPIA disclosure hearing, by contrast, is totally different. The concern of the circuit court hearing of February 27, 2004, for instance, was not on the propriety of the County Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s denial of disclosure back on July 14 or August 16, 2000. It was on the propriety of Harford County\u2019s continuing denial of disclosure up to and including February 27, 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A law school professor could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>easily conjure up a scenario wherein non-disclosure back on August 16, 2000, might have been perfectly appropriate then, but wherein non-disclosure might have become inappropriate as of February 27, 2004. Such a scenario, however, would not be at all damaging to the disclosure petition at the hearing on which the focus will be on non-disclosure now, not on nondisclosure back then.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">July 14, 2000, and August 16, 2000, do not, in the context of this case, have the significance, as historic events, that a past tort or a past crime might have. They are but random points along a continuum of non-disclosure. The circuit court complaint, to be sure, does require a triggering event of a disclosure\u2019s having been sought and denied. If the letter of August 16, 2000, timely challenged, should have turned out to be too old to serve as the triggering event, however, the pursuit of disclosure, unlike the pursuit of damages for a whip-lash injury, would not have been forever compromised. The complainant would simply be put to the task of going out and manufacturing a fresh triggering event by making a fresh request for disclosure. Our point is that the \u00a7 5-110 statute of limitations, now being belatedly raised, is one of essentially minuscule significance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It has little more than nuisance value.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In any event, the procedural glitches in this case were merely bumps in the road. After a few bounces, we are prepared to address the MPIA merits. The appellant\u2019s request to inspect his criminal file was given very short shrift. It deserves more painstaking consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Maryland Public Information Act of 1970</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The archetype of public information acts was the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), originally enacted in 1966 by Pub. L. No. 89-487, 80 Stat. 250, and now codified as 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. In <em>Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 80, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973), the Supreme Court summarized the purpose of the FOIA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">Without question, <em>the Act is broadly conceived. It seeks to permit access to </em>official <em>information long shielded unnecessarily from public view </em>and attempts to create a judicially enforceable public right to secure such information from possibly unwilling official hands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Within four years of the passage of the FOIA in 1966, Maryland followed suit. By Chapter 698 of the Laws of 1970, the General Assembly enacted the Maryland Public Information Act (MPIA) and codified it initially as Article 76A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-5A. The provisions of the MPIA are almost verbatim those of the FOIA. As <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney of Harford County </em>explained, 299 Md. at 506, 474 A.2d 880, \u201cThe purpose of the Maryland Public Information Act ... is virtually identical to that of the FOIA.\u201d Following from that symmetry between the two acts, the Court of Appeals further observed that \u201c[wjhere the purpose and language of a federal statute are substantially the same as that of a later state statute, interpretations of the federal statute are ordinarily persuasive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But see <em>Office of the Governor v. Washington Post Co., </em>360 Md. 520, 759 A.2d 249 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\"><em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>299 Md. at 499, 474 A.2d 880, described the purpose of the FOIA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">Its purpose was to provide the public the right of access to government information. <em>Its basic policy was in favor of disclosure. It mandated disclosure </em>of certain records in the possession of certain agencies <em>unless the requested records were within the scope of a statutory exemption. </em>A person denied the right to inspect any record covered by the FOIA had the right to expedited judicial review. In such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>judicial proceeding, <em>the burden was on the public official denying the right to inspect to show that the requested records were within the scope of a statutory exemption.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In <em>A.S.

The types of possibly protected records include such categories as, e.g., interagency and intra-agency documents, examination questions, research projects, pre-purchase real property appraisals, site-specific locations of endangered species, inventions owned by State public institutions of higher learning, trade secrets, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Two characteristics should be noted that are common denominator features of the permissible denial of disclosure for all of the categories of records covered by \u00a7 10-618. One is that the denials of inspection that are permitted are not blanket denials for an entire record but are more narrowly focused denials of \u201ca part of a public record.\u201d The second critical requirement for discretionary denial is that the custodian of the record must believe, and ultimately demonstrate to a court, that the inspection of a certain part of the record \u201cwould be contrary to the public interest.\u201d Subsection (a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\"><em>In general. </em>\u2014 Unless otherwise provided by law, if a custodian believes that <em>inspection of a part of a public record </em>by the applicant would be contrary to the public interest, <em>the custodian may deny inspection </em>by the applicant <em>of that part, </em>as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Some discussion is appropriate of these two characteristics of a permissive denial of inspection under \u00a7 10-618 generally. They are the requirements of 1) the severance of that part of a public record deserving of non-disclosure from other parts of the record not so deserving and 2) the burden of proof that is allocated to the custodian of the record to justify non-disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Blanket Exemptions Versus Severability</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"> Even when one or more of the statutory exemptions from disclosure is clearly involved, the MPIA\u2019s strong bias in favor of disclosure dictates that the exemptions from disclosure must be applied narrowly. Even if some information in a contested file is exempted from disclosure, therefore, the exemption may not be blanketly invoked to shield an entire file if the shielding of only a part of the file would suffice to serve the purpose of the exemption. Just as \u00a7 10-618(a) provides for the permissible denial of inspection of \u201ca part of a public record,\u201d so too does \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) impose upon a custodian who denies an application for inspection the obligation to \u201cpermit inspection of any part of the record that is subject to inspection and is reasonably severable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In <em>Attorney General v. Gallagher, </em>359 Md. at 350, 753 A.2d 1036, the Court of Appeals pointed out how \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) imposes on the custodian the obligation to sever those parts of a record that are properly subject to disclosure from other parts of the record that may be shielded by an exemption.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayt\">The General Assembly mandated, in \u00a7 10 \u2014 614(b)(3)(iii) of the Act, that <em>a custodian should \u201cpermit inspection of any part of [a] record that is subject to inspection and is reasonably severable.\u201d </em>The limiting language of subsection (f)(2) has consistently been interpreted by this Court <em>as a limitation upon the custodian\u2019s authority to withhold an investigatory file in its entirety </em>when claiming an exemption under that subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In <em>Fioretti v. Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners, </em>351 Md. 66, 716 A.2d 258 (1998), the Board of Dental Examiners attempted to justify non-disclosure on the ground that the record was an \u201cinvestigatory file\u201d and that its disclosure would prejudice a pending investigation. Judge Cathell\u2019s opinion made clear at the outset that an entire record is not shielded from view simply because a part of it may be.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">[I]f the Dental Board could demonstrate to the trial court that disclosure would prejudice its investigation, it then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>must show to what extent disclosure would prejudice its investigation. To that end, <em>the government agency can withhold only such documents or portions thereof to the extent such harm would occur. </em>It is entirely possible, therefore, that <em>even though Dental Board files fit within the exemption, a substantial portion of those documents could be required to be disclosed </em>because release of only a small portion of the records would \u201cprejudice\u201d the government agency\u2019s investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">351 Md. at 74 n. 7, 716 A.2d 258 (emphasis supplied). Judge Cathell further explained that the modality for severing the disclosable from the non-disclosable may be a redaction of the protected information.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">[T]he circuit court can deny inspection <em>only to the extent </em>that disclosure would result in prejudice to the particular investigation. That is, if the Dental Board only could show that disclosure of the name of the person filing the complaint would have prejudiced its investigation, then <em>the files should have been disclosed to appellant with the complainant\u2019s name, </em>or any other information identifying the complainant, <em>redacted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">351 Md. at 87, 716 A.2d 258 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Chief Judge Wilner stated the same principle for this Court in <em>Maryland Committee Against the Gun Ban v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>91 Md.App. 251, 265, 603 A.2d 1364 (1992), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Baltimore v. Maryland Committee, </em>329 Md. 78, 617 A.2d 1040 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">The department seems to argue that, because some reports contain personal information that needs to be protected, it is necessary to shield <em>all </em>IID reports. But <em>the law does not allow such generic, sweeping protection. </em>It looks to the nature of the individual records actually sought, not that of other records compiled under different circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANvD\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Judge Rodowsky wrote for the Court of Appeals in <em>Cran-ford v. Montgomery County, </em>300 Md. 759, 777, 481 A.2d 221 (1984), in unequivocally declaring that generic exemptions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>not permitted and that the burden of justifying the nondisclosure of even part of a record is squarely cast upon the custodian of the record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">The Md. Act imposes <em>the burden on the records custodian </em>to make a careful and thoughtful examination of each document which fairly falls within the scope of the request in order for the custodian initially <em>to determine whether </em>the document or <em>any severable portion of the document meets all of the elements of an exemption. The General Assembly did not intend for custodians broadly to claim exemptions </em>and thereby routinely to pass to the courts the task of performing <em>in camera </em>inspections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">In <em>Office of the Governor v. Washington Post Co., </em>360 Md. 520, 545, 759 A.2d 249 (2000), Judge Eldridge pointed out that one possible modality for severing the diselosable from the non-disclosable may be an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the record by the trial judge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">An <em>in camera </em>inspection by the trial court, while not always necessary, may in some cases be \u201cneeded in order to make a responsible determination on claims of exemptions.\u201d In addition, <em>if parts of a record are exempt but other parts can be revealed, the Act favors severability.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">As a further aid to a court\u2019s determination as to what part of a record might be exempt from disclosure and what part might not, the court is empowered, under the MPIA, to order the custodian of a record to submit to the court a \u201cVaughn index\u201d of documents, identifying each document, briefly summarizing each, and stating the particular exemption that is claimed for each. As to the term \u201cVaughn index,\u201d <em>State Prosecutor v. Judicial Watch, </em>356 Md. 118, 121 n. 1, 737 A.2d 592 (1999), explained the origin of the phrase.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-11\">The reference is to <em>Vaughn v.

The letter of July 14, 2000 from the County Attorney\u2019s Office to the appellant was a plenary denial, with no reference made to the contents of any specific documents contained in the larger file. The State\u2019s Response to Petitioner\u2019s Motion, filed on September 16, 2002, similarly made no mention of severability, but claimed broadly that \u201c[s]aid information is not public information as contemplated by the Act.\u201d The unilluminating ruling of the trial court did not refer to the possibility of severability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">I\u2019ve reviewed the letter from Mr. Roberts in the County Law Department, dated July 14, 2000, which denied access and [this case is] also controlled by the case [of] <em>Faulk v.

This is, to be sure, a \u00a7 10-618(f) case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">As we zoom in on \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)\u00bb we initially observe the salient feature that it is divided into two parts. Subsection (f)(1) describes, generally, the coverage of this \u201cInvestigations\u201d category of permissible denials.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">(f) <em>Investigations. </em>\u2014 (1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, <em>a custodian may deny inspection of:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">(i) <em>records of investigations conducted by </em>the Attorney General, <em>a State\u2019s Attorney, </em>a city or county attorney, <em>a police department, or a sheriff;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-11\">(ii) an investigatory file compiled for any other law enforcement, judicial, correctional, or prosecution purpose; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-12\">(iii) records that contain intelligence information or security procedures of the Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, a city or county attorney, a police department, a State or local correctional facility, or a sheriff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">The murder file against the appellant is covered, by definition, by \u00a7 10-618(f), in that it is a record of the criminal investigation conducted by the Harford County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and/or the Harford County Sheriffs Office<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> linking the appellant to the murders of which he was convicted in 1997. The appellee then leaps uncritically from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the section\u2019s coverage of an investigatory file to an automatic exemption from disclosure. In the State\u2019s Response to Petitioner\u2019s Motion, it flatly claimed, in absolute terms, that the MPIA did not apply to a \u201ccriminal investigation file used to prosecute [a] criminal case.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">The petitioner apparently is seeking access to the criminal investigation file used to prosecute the criminal case against him. <em>The Maryland Public Information Act does not apply to parties in a criminal proceeding. </em>Said information is not public information as contemplated by the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">(Emphasis supplied). In its appellate brief, the appellee relied on a similarly expansive reading of \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\"><em>The denial was based on the investigations exemption </em>of the MPIA, Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-618(0.</p>\n<p id=\"Aif\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Under \u00a7 10-618(f), the custodian of an investigatory file possesses the discretion to deny its disclosure to applicants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>for inspection if, but only if, the custodian, pursuant to \u00a7 10-618(a), further believes that the disclosure \u201cwould be contrary to the public interest.\u201d In his concurring opinion in <em>Fioretti v. Board of Dental Examiners, </em>351 Md. at 100, 716 A.2d 258, Judge Wilner emphasized that a custodian cannot justify nondisclosure simply by invoking the mantra that disclosure would \u201cprejudice an investigation.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\"><em>An agency cannot satisfy its statutory burden </em>of \u201csustaining a decision to deny inspection of a public record\u201d <em>by simply asserting that all of the records sought would prejudice an investigation, </em>for, if it could do that, the Public Information Act would be meaningless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In such a situation the custodian still bears the burdens both 1) of exploring the feasibility of severing the record into disclosable and non-disclosable parts; and 2) of demonstrating, with particularity and not in purely conclusory terms, precisely why the disclosure \u201cwould be contrary to the public interest.\u201d The custodian in this case did not even attempt to shoulder either of those burdens.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Under \u00a7 10-618 generally, there was historically no distinction drawn between persons generally who sought to inspect an investigatory file and a person situated such as the appellant in this case. That was the state of the MPIA law until 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Subsection 10 \u2014 618(f)(2):</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The Favored Status Of a \u201cPerson in Interest\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">What is now subsection 10-618(f)(2) was added to the MPIA by Chapter 1006 of the Acts of 1978. It imposed, for the exclusive benefit of \u201ca person in interest,\u201d a stringently more severe limitation on the prerogative of a custodian to deny disclosure.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">(2) <em>A custodian may deny inspection by a person in interest only to the extent that </em>the inspection would:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>(i) interfere with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">(ii) deprive another person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">(iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">(iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">(v) disclose an investigative technique or procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">(vi) prejudice an investigation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">(vii) endanger the life or physical safety of an individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">The critical change in the law was the addition of the adverbial modifier \u201conly to the extent that.\u201d The limiting of denial by a custodian to the seven exempting circumstances enumerated in subsection (f)(2) essentially paralleled a similar constriction of the exemption for investigatory files under the FOIA, imposed in 1974. <em>National Labor Relations Board v. Robbins Tire and Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 221-22, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978), explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-13\"><em>Exemption 7 as originally enacted permitted nondisclosure of \u201cinvestigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes </em>except to the extent available by law to a private party.\u201d <em>In 197k, this exemption was reumtten to permit the nondisclosure of \u201cinvestigatory records </em>compiled for law \u00e9nforcement purposes,\u201d <em>but only to the extent that producing such records would involve one of six specified dangers.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0D\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">Six of the enumerated exemptions under \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) are essentially linguistic clones of the six enumerated dangers under Exemption 7 of the FOIA. Only \u00a7 10-618(f)(2)(vi) stands alone \u2014 the extent to which the inspection would \u201cprejudice an investigation.\u201d It would appear that that danger, probably included in the \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(2) catalogue out of an excess of caution, would be subsumed, both in Maryland and federally, by the enumerated danger that an inspection would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u201cinterfere with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding\u201d under (f)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford, County, </em>299 Md. 493, 501, 474 A.2d 880 (1984), made it clear that Maryland was following the federal lead and that material did not qualify for an automatic exemption simply \u201cbecause it was contained in an investigatory file.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">According to the Supreme Court, the purpose of Exemption 7(A) was to make clear that <em>Exemption 7 </em>as originally enacted <em>did not protect material simply because it was contained in an investigatory file.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\"><em>Baltimore v. Maryland Committee Against the Gun Ban, </em>329 Md. at 93, 617 A.2d 1040, examined the legislative history of \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) and pointed out that the new provision was intended to provide a broad grant of disclosure to the \u201cperson in interest,\u201d to wit, the actual subject of the investigative file, a right of disclosure far broader than that available to persons other than the \u201cperson in interest.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">[T]he Senate Committee \u201cdeemed it both necessary and preferable to provide for some type of outside vigilance wherein <em>citizens are afforded the right to view those materials in the possession of law enforcement agencies respecting them personally.\u201d </em>As a result, the Senate Committee recommended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the then Act be amended to provide \u201cthat <em>a \u2018person [in] interest\u2019 </em>as defined in the statute <em>may be denied the right to inspect records </em>referred to in subsection (b)(i) thereof <em>only to the extent that the production of such records would hamper or jeopardize valid law enforcement activities as particularly defined.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">That recommendation was incorporated into Chapter 1006 of the Acts of 1978. It added to former Art. 76A, \u00a7 3(b)(i), the proviso that <em>\u201cthe right of a person in interest to inspect the records may be denied only to the extent that the production of them would\u201d generate one of the circum</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>stances currently enumerated in subparagraphs (i) through (vii) of \u00a7 10-6180(2).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\"><em>Baltimore v. Maryland Committee, </em>329 Md. at 96-97, 617 A.2d 1040, went on to hold that the need to examine a file closely for the purpose of possible severability is particularly acute when the applicant for disclosure is \u201ca person in interest\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 10-618(f)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">Under paragraph (2), inspection may be denied to the person in interest \u201conly to the extent\u201d that the inspection would give rise to one of the seven enumerated circumstances. <em>That statutory mandate requires analyzing the investigation file material in order to distinguish between that which reflects one or more of the enumerated circumstances and that which does not. </em>In contrast, when the request to inspect is made by one other than a person in interest and paragraph (1) applies, the \u201ccustodian may deny inspection of ... records of investigations conducted by ... a police department.\u201d Permissible denial applies to the entire record, to the extent that inspection would be contrary to the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">In <em>Frederick v. Randall, </em>154 Md.App. 543, 561-62, 841 A.2d 10 (2004), Judge Salmon explained precisely how the \u201cmore favorable treatment\u201d extended to a person in interest would manifest itself.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">When a request for public documents is made by <em>a person in interest, </em>that person <em>is entitled to more favorable treatment under section 10-6180(2) of the MPIA than a requester who falls under section 10-6180(1).

In that opinion, Chief Judge Bell, 356 Md. at 136, 737 A.2d 592, explained the distinction in more detail.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">Section (f)(1) does refer to <em>Section (f)(2), </em>however, which <em>places restrictions on the custodian\u2019s right to deny inspection to a person in interest, i.e. </em>\u201ca person or governmental unit that is the subject of a public record or a designee of the person or governmental unit.\u201d \u00a7 10-611(e). <em>When a person in interest is involved,, Section (f)(2) contemplates inspection unless disclosure would have the enumerated consequences; </em>hence, it implicitly requires, in that circumstance, some explanation or justification for the decision to deny inspection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">(Emphasis supplied).

The custodian must point to precisely which of the seven circumstances enumerated by the rule would require the exemption and explain precisely why it would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">In <em>Maryland Committee v. Baltimore, </em>91 Md.App. at 264-65, 603 A.2d 1364, Chief Judge Wilner\u2019s analysis for this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>looked at the seven exempting circumstances, one by one, and concluded that, as to each, the custodian had failed to carry his burden of justification. Notwithstanding the fact that the Court of Appeals, in its <em>Baltimore v. Maryland Committee, supra, </em>reversed our holding that the Committee Against the Gun Ban was a party in interest, Judge Wilner\u2019s analysis, even as an <em>arguendo </em>hypothetical, remains as a model of how a court should assess a claim of exemption under \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(2). Note that with respect to each of the seven possible reasons for exemption, the burden of justification was on the custodian. More was required than a merely conclusory incantation of the exception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">This takes us, then, to the seven circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(2) that would justify non-disclosure, and, as to them, <em>we are at a loss to understand how the court could have rationally arrived at its announced findings, for there was no evidence whatever to support them. This investigation had been concluded </em>without further action at least a year before the request for access to the report was made, and <em>so there was no investigation to be prejudiced by disclosure ((f) (2) (vi)). </em>The department, through counsel, conceded at Major Blackwell\u2019s deposition that <em>there was no law enforcement proceeding with which disclosure could interfere. ((f)(2)(H). </em>The department also stipulated that, to its knowledge, <em>there was no impending trial or adjudication which disclosure could prejudice ((f)(2)(H)) </em>and that <em>disclosure would not cause danger to or imperil the life or safety of any individual ((f)(2)(vii)). </em>Major Blackwell conceded that no anonymous sources were used in the investigation, and so <em>disclosure would not reveal the identity of a confidential source ((j)(2)(iv)).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">The nub of the department\u2019s reliance on subsection (f) seemed to be the concern that, if confidentiality of IID investigations could not be assured, people would be reluctant to cooperate with the investigators and provide information. <em>To some extent, that implicates subsection (f)(2) (Hi) and (v) </em>\u2014 unwarranted <em>invasion of personal privacy and disclosure of an investigative technique or proce</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number><em>dure. </em>The problem as to the first of these is that <em>there was not even a suggestion, much less evidence, that disclosure of this report, would invade anyone\u2019s personal privacy.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>With respect to subsection (f)(2)(v), a,gain, the department produced no evidence that disclosure of the repoH would reveal an investigative technique or procedure.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">91 Md.App. at 264-65, 603 A.2d 1364 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">A Criminal Defendant Is a Quintessential \u201cPerson in Interest\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Who, then, is such \u201ca person in interest\u201d entitled to such favored status? <em>Baltimore v. Maryland, Committee, </em>329 Md. at 92, 617 A.2d 1040, clearly stated that a criminal defendant, as the person investigated, is a \u201cperson in interest\u201d with respect to that investigatory file. The opinion also made it clear that, although records of investigations by a police department once enjoyed broad protection, that protection was significantly narrowed by the 1978 amendment with respect to \u201ca person in interest.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">The Act\u2019s history covering reports of police investigations also makes clear that <em>the \u201cperson in interest\u201d </em>referred to in \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(2) <em>is the person who is investigated, ... </em>Section 3(b)(i) of <em>former Art. 76A </em>addressed records of investigations conducted by a police department, but it <em>did not contain, any special provisions concerning inspect,km, by a person in, interest. ... What is today paragraph (2) of \u00a7 10-618(f) came into the Act by Chapter 1006 of the Acts of 1978.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">Section 10-611(e) defines \u201cPerson in interest\u201d in the following pertinent terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\">\u201cPerson in interest\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\">(1) a person ... that is the subject of a public record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">The appellee, nonetheless, stubbornly insists that a criminal defendant is somehow ineligible to inspect his criminal file if his purpose is to assist himself in some future litigation. The appellee would thus transform the favored status of some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>persons in interest into an actually unfavored status. In the State\u2019s Response to Petitioner\u2019s Motion, it asked the court to rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">that said Motion be dismissed as <em>the Maryland Public Information Act does not apply to requests for records </em>of a criminal investigation, <em>in a matter wherein Petitioner was a party-defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">(Emphasis supplied). At the hearing before the circuit court, the assistant state\u2019s attorney continued to argue that the appellant\u2019s request for inspection of his file should be denied because \u201che\u2019s trying to prepare for a post-conviction proceeding, that\u2019s a criminal proceeding, and because he\u2019s either in the middle of a criminal proceeding or he\u2019s preparing for a criminal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The appellee is wrong. To the extent to which it is arguing that a desire or purpose by the appellant to discover a legal flaw in his murder convictions would be an improper or disqualifying motivation for invoking the MPIA, <em>Moberly v. Herboldsheimer, </em>276 Md. 211, 345 A.2d 855 (1975), is dispositive to the contrary. The Memorial Hospital Board of Governors had sought to forestall an MPIA inspection of records, alleging that the requested disclosure would do substantial injury to the public interest because it was sought with an improper motive, i.e., the desire to expose the Memorial Hospital and its superintendent to public ridicule. In refusing to sanction non-disclosure based on the appellant\u2019s motive, the Court of Appeals adopted the following reasoning of the trial court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\"><em>The Court does not find it necessary to decide motives. </em>If the hospital is a public institution, and the information sought does not come under one of the exceptions, the information sought should be made available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\"><em>The Court does not find that invidious or improper motives, </em>if any, <em>can bring information otherwise revealable </em>under the Act <em>into the classification </em>of Art. 76A 3.(f) <em>where disclosure would do \u201csubstantial injury to the public interest. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>276 Md. at 227-28, 345 A.2d 855 (emphasis supplied).

Unless the custodian can demonstrate to the court that one of the seven very specific reasons for an exemption applies, the person in interest is entitled to the information, with no questions asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We find persuasive 81 Opinions of the Attorney General (January 31, 1996).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That Opinion was in response to an inquiry from the Howard County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office concerning the obligation to satisfy numerous MPIA requests, \u201cmostly from convicted defendants seeking disclosure of the prosecutorial files maintained in their cases.\u201d The Opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\"><em>The PIA would require you to grant these requests unless you identify a basis in the law that authorizes you not to do </em>so-for example, that disclosure would interfere with a law enforcement proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">The reasoning of the Opinion was, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">The PIA was enacted to provide the public a broad right of access to records maintained by State and local governments. In furtherance of this purpose, <em>the PIA\u2019s rule of construction is \u201cin favor of permitting inspection </em>of a public record, with the least cost and least delay <em>to the person ... [who] requests the inspection. </em>\u201d ... Consistent with the broad right of access granted by the PIA, a requester has a right to judicial review of a custodian\u2019s denial of a request to inspect public records. In a judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>proceeding arising out of such a denial, the custodian bears the burden of establishing a valid basis for the denial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\"><em>[TJhe PIA effectively grants a special right of access to a \u201cperson in interest\u201d-that is, the subject of an investigatory file. </em>A person in interest may be denied the right to inspect pertinent investigatory and prosecutorial files of a State\u2019s Attorney only to the extent that inspection would: [cause . one of the seven adverse effects enumerated in \u00a7 10-618(f)(2)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\n<em>Absent one of these enumerated reasons or another PIA exemption, the custodian must permit inspection of the investigatory or prosecutorial file. ...</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">Therefore, <em>a State\u2019s Attorney may not have a blanket rule of denying PIA requests from inmates seeking documents in prosecutorial files.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The Opinion concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">In summary, it is our opinion that <em>a convicted defendant may obtain access to the prosecutorial file concerning the defendant unless one or more of the factors specified in SG \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) exists or some other PIA exemption applies.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Criminal defendants, of course, are classic examples of persons in interest within the contemplation of \u00a7 10-618(f)(2). The subsection was added to the law in 1978 with them in mind. The subsection, counterintuitive as it may seem to some, gives them the benefit of favored status under the MPIA. It is, moreover, highly unlikely that requests by criminals to inspect their investigatory files would ever be for the abstract purpose of sociological, genealogical, or journalistic research or even out of idle curiosity. It goes -without saying that these particular persons in interest are almost always hoping, desperately, to dig up something in the file that will help them to get out of jail. That does not- render them, however, MPIA pariahs.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The General Assembly was not unaware of this characteristic when it gave them the benefit of \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(2). With respect to access to an investigatory file, it is precisely one\u2019s status as the suspected criminal on whom the investigation focused that moves that suspect from the less benign conf\u00ednes of \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(1) into the more welcoming embrace of \u00a7 10-618(f)(2). This, then, is not simply a \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(1) case generally, it is a subsection 10-618(f)(2) case specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Reasons for a \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) Exemption That Were Not Shown</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The reason for an applicant\u2019s curiosity about a record is not for the courts to judge. The use to which a convicted criminal, such as the appellant, might wish to put the information contained in his investigatory file will not deny him access to that file. Access may be denied only if one of the enumerated reasons for a \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(2) exemption has been specifically shown. There are seven such possible reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">It is immediately apparent that there was no required showing by the custodian with respect to six of those reasons. There has been no suggestion that disclosure of the file would \u201cdeprive another person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication\u201d under (f)(2)(ii). There was no showing that disclosure would \u201cconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d under (f)(2)(iii). It was not argued that disclosure would \u201cdisclose the identity of a confidential source\u201d under (f)(2)(iv) or \u201cdisclose an investigative technique or procedure\u201d under (f)(2)(v). The case against the appellant had been closed for seven years and it was not even intimated that disclosure would \u201cprejudice an investigation\u201d under (f)(2)(vi). Nor was there so much as an allusion to a risk that disclosure might \u201cendanger the life or physical safety of an individual\u201d under (f)(2)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The appellee, to justify the denial of disclosure in this case, is left finally with a single possibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">(2) <em>A custodian may deny inspection </em>by a person in interest <em>only to the extent that the inspection would:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>(i) <em>interfere with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Section 10-618(f)(2) Inapplicable Versus \u00a7 10-618(f)(2)(i) Satisfied</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The issue before us has now been properly narrowed. It is important that it also be properly conceptualized. The appellee argues that the MPIA does not cover an investigatory file in a pending criminal case. That is definitely not so. The MPIA covers an investigatory file \u2014 in a pending criminal case and at all other times. When the applicant for inspection is a person in interest, moreover, subsection 10 \u2014 618(f)(2) covers an investigatory file \u2014 in a pending criminal case and at all other times.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Deferring for the moment the issue of what is \u201ca pending criminal case,\u201d the pendency of a criminal case does not relieve the custodian of the burden of showing that disclosure would \u201cinterfere with a ... law enforcement proceeding.\u201d It simply alters, and eases, the manner in which the custodian goes about showing that interference. It permits him, when a criminal case is pending, to show that disclosure would constitute interference generically, rather than having to show particularized interference on an <em>ad hoc, </em>case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The precise question, therefore, is not WHETHER the reason for a \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) exemption must be shown, even with respect to a pending criminal case. It must. The question, rather, is HOW may it be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">In this case, there was no particularized <em>ad hoc </em>showing that an inspection of the investigatory file would \u201cinterfere with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding.\u201d The appellee must cling, therefore, to the hope that some special circumstance relieved it of having to make an <em>ad hoc </em>showing and permitted it to rely upon a generic showing that, in the context of a pending criminal case, the disclosure of the file would automatically \u201cinterfere with a valid and proper law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>enforcement proceeding.\u201d Conceptually, if the appellee in this case is to prevail, it will be not because \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(2) is inapplicable, but because \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(2)(i) had been, generically, satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Generic Justification Versus <em>Ad Hoc </em>Justification For Non-Disclosure in a Pending Criminal Case: A Trilogy of Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">As far as Maryland is concerned, the notion that the premature disclosure of the contents of an investigatory file would represent, <em>per se, </em>an interference with a law enforcement proceeding is a product of three cases. In 1978, the Supreme Court handed down its opinion in <em>National Labor Relations Board v. Robbins Tire and Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978). The case dealt with an exemption from mandatory FOIA disclosure during the pendency of a law enforcement proceeding. In 1982, the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County, 52 </em>Md.App. 616, 451 A.2d 936 (1982), considered the implications of <em>NLRB v. Robbins </em>for a requested MPIA disclosure. We held that the pendency of a criminal case constituted a generic justification for non-disclosure for the reason that disclosure at such a time would be a presumptive interference \u201cwith a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding.\u201d In 1984, the Court of Appeals affirmed that decision with its opinion in <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County, </em>299 Md. 493, 474 A.2d 880 (1984). It is primarily the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Faulk </em>on which the appellee in this case relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">As we mark the progress of this idea from the Supreme Court through the Court of Special Appeals to the Court of Appeals, it will be convenient to analyze, simultaneously, both 1) the emergence of the idea of generic justification and 2) the temporal limits on the availability of generic justification. As the appellee correctly argues, there is such a generic justification sometimes available. Unfortunately for the appellee, this case is not one of those times.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>A. <em>NLRB v. Robbins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In the Supreme Court case, the NLRB had filed a number of complaints against the Robbins Company charging unfair labor practices. One week before the scheduled hearing on those complaints, Robbins invoked the provisions of the FOIA as it requested the NLRB to \u201cmake available for inspection and copying ... copies of all potential witnesses\u2019 statements collected during the Board\u2019s investigation.\u201d 437 U.S. at 216, 98 S.Ct. 2311. The custodian of the records dug in his heels and invoked Exemption 7A of the FOIA, even as the appellee here invokes the indistinguishable provisions of \u00a7 10-618(f)(2)(i).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">He placed particular reliance on Exemption 7(A), which provides that <em>disclosure is not required </em>of \u201cmatters that are investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, <em>but only to the extent that the production of such records would </em>... <em>interfere with enforcement proceedings.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">437 U.S. at 217, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The critical issue in <em>NLRB v. Robbins </em>was whether the NLRB had shown that disclosure would, indeed, interfere with law enforcement proceedings. The NLRB there, as the appel-lee here, had failed to make any particularized showing that disclosure would actually interfere with law enforcement proceedings. It was for that reason that the NLRB had not prevailed before either the United States District Court or the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 563 F.2d 724 (1977). The Supreme Court summarized the holding of the District Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeU\">The District Court held that, <em>since the Board did not claim that release </em>of the documents at issue <em>would pose any </em>unique or unusual <em>danger of interference </em>with this particular enforcement proceedings, <em>Exemption 7(A) did not apply.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">437 U.S. at 217, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied). The Court summarized the similar holding of the 5th Circuit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARl\">[The 5th Circuit] held that <em>the Board had failed to sustain its burden </em>of demonstrating the availability of Exemption 7(a), <em>because it had \u201cintroduced [no] evidence </em>tending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>show that this kind of [witness] intimidation\u201d was in fact likely to occur in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">437 U.S. at 218-19, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Granting certiorari to resolve a conflict among the circuit courts, the Supreme Court first noted that, in contrast to the holding of the 5th Circuit, several circuits, including the 2nd Circuit in <em>Title Guarantee Co. v. NLRB, </em>534 F.2d 484, 491 (1976), had permitted a generic showing of interference with law enforcement proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\"><em>Rejecting </em>the employer\u2019s contention that the Board must make <em>a particularized showing </em>of likely interference <em>in each individual case, the Second Circuit found that such interference would \u201c'necessarily\u201d result </em>from the production of the statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">437 U.S. at 220, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In choosing between the requirement of an <em>ad hoc </em>showing versus the permissibility of a generic showing, the Supreme Court noted, as we have done, that the issue is not WHETHER a showing must be made, but HOW it shall be made.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">[T]he mere fact that <em>the burden </em>is <em>on the Government </em>to justify nondisclosure <em>does not, </em>in our view, <em>aid the inquiry as to what kind of burden </em>the Government bears.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">437 U.S. at 224, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">In examining the reasons for the exemption from disclosure, the Supreme Court emphasized the temporal elements 1) of not harming a \u201ccase in court\u201d before the case gets to court and 2) of not permitting \u201cearlier access\u201d to investigatory files than the applicable discovery rules would allow.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">In originally enacting Exemption 7, Congress recognized that <em>law enforcement agencies had legitimate needs </em>to keep certain records confidential, <em>lest the agencies be hindered in their investigations or placed, at a disadvantage when it came time to present their case. </em>Foremost <em>among the purposes </em>of this Exemption <em>was to prevent \u201charm [to] the Government\u2019s ca,se in court,\u201d </em>by <em>not allowing litigants </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>\u201cearlier or greater access\u201d to </em>agency <em>investigatory files than they would otherwise have.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">437 U.S. at 224-25, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The Court went on to stress that the exemption\u2019s purpose was to protect against disclosure not permanently but PRIOR TO the scheduled hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">[T]he 1966 Act was expressly intended to <em>protect against </em>the mandatory <em>disclosure </em>through FOIA of witnesses\u2019 statements <em>prior to an unfair labor practice proceeding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">437 U.S. at 226, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied). The Supreme Court quoted with approval from circuit court cases holding that information was \u201cexempt from disclosure ... <em>prior to the hearing\u201d </em>and that \u201cthe exemption was necessary in order <em>to prevent premature disclosure </em>of an investigation so that the Board can present its strongest case in court.\u201d 437 U.S. at 226, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The next section of the <em>NLRB v. Robbins </em>opinion, explaining the Congressional intent behind the 1974 amendment to the FOIA\u2019s Exemption 7, which amendment presaged the 1978 Maryland amendment to the MPIA which added what is now \u00a7 10 \u2014 618(f)(2) to the law, shreds the appellee\u2019s argument in this case. When the MPIA hearing took place in this case, the criminal conviction of the appellant had been history for almost seven years. The appellee nonetheless argues that an investigatory file is forever shielded from MPIA disclosure. It argues, at the very least, that the possibility of a future post-conviction procedure petition somehow serves to reactivate the informational shield.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Those precise arguments, however, had been espoused by four decisions of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in 1973 and 1974. The Supreme Court pointed out that the 1974 amendment to the FOIA resulted from a strong Congressional reaction against those decisions, as the Congress made certain that the FOIA should not again be interpreted as those decisions had done. The first target of attack was <em>Weisberg v. United States Department of Justice, </em>160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>U.S.App. D.C. 71, 489 F.2d 1195 (1973). The Supreme Court summarized what that now rejected interpretation had been.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">Although the court acknowledged that <em>no enforcement proceedings were then pending or contemplated, </em>it held that <em>all the agency need, show to be entitled to withhold under Exemption 7 was that the records were investigatory in nature and, had been compiled for law enforcement purposes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">437 U.S. at 228, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The Supreme Court summarized the second rejected interpretation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">The court adhered to this holding in <em>Aspin v. Department of Defense, </em>160 U.S.App.D.C. 231, 237, 491 F.2d 24, 30 (1973), stating that <em>even \u201cafter the termination of investigation and enforcement proceedings,\u201d material found in an investigatory file is entirely exempt.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-9\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">The third rejected interpretation still finds eerie echoes in the appellee\u2019s position in the case now before us.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">In <em>Ditlow v. Brinegar, </em>161 U.S. App DC 154, 494 F.2d 1073 (1974), the court indicated that, after <em>Weisberg, the only question before it, was whether the requested material was found in an investigatory file </em>compiled for law enforcement purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-12\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">The Supreme Court concluded its review of the discredited positions that had led to the FOIA\u2019s 1974 amendment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-14\">Finally, in <em>Center for National Policy Review on Race and Urban Issues v. Weinberger, </em>163 U.S. App DC 368, 502 F.2d 370 (1974), the court held that <em>the investigatory file exemption was available even if an enforcement proceeding were neither imminent nor likely either at the Urns of the compilation or at, the time disclosure was sought. These four cases, </em>in Senator Hart\u2019s view, <em>erected, a, \u201cstone wall\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>against public access to any material in an investigatory file.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">437 U.S. at 228-29, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied). All four of those interpretations, granting plenary protection to investigatory files, were roundly repudiated, first by the Congress and then by <em>NLRB v. Robbins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Turning to the affirmative effects of the 1974 amendment, the Supreme Court stressed that its purpose was to \u201crectify [the] erroneous judicial interpretations and clarify Congress\u2019s original intent.\u201d 437 U.S. at 229, 98 S.Ct. 2311. The 1974 FOIA amendment, just as our own 1978 MPIA amendment, denied blanket protection to an investigatory file in perpetuity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\"><em>[I]t would </em>explicitly enumerate the purposes and objectives of the Exemption, and thus <em>require reviewing courts to \u201cloo[k] to the reasons\u201d for allowing withholding of investigatory files </em>before making their decisions. <em>The \u201cwoode[n] and meckanica[lj\u201d approach taken by the D.C. Circuit and disapproved by Congress would thereby be eliminated. ... </em>[T]he Senate amendment was needed <em>to address \u201crecent court decisions\u201d that had applied the exemptions to investigatory files \u201ceven if they ha[d] long since lost any requirement for secrecy. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">... [T]he thrust of congressional concern in its amendment of Exemption 7 was to make clear that <em>the Exemption did not endlessly protect material simply because it was in an investigatory file.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">437 U.S. at 230, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">In interpreting the amendment, the Court also quoted with approval from the proposal submitted by the Administrative Law Division of the American Bar Association, as it said, with references to an exemption for an investigatory file and with specific reference to what is and is not interference with law enforcement proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">\u201c[W]ith passage of time, ... <em>when the investigation is all over </em>and the purpose and point of it has expired, <em>it would </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>no longer be an interference </em>with enforcement proceedings and <em>there ought to be disclosure. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">437 U.S. at 232, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The Supreme Court was firm that there is no blanket exemption from disclosure for investigatory files and that there must be a showing, before exemption is permitted, that the disclosure would interfere with law enforcement proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">What Congress clearly did have in mind was that Exemption 7 permit nondisclosure only where the Government \u201cspecif[ies]\u201d that one of the six enumerated harms is present and the court, reviewing the question de novo, agrees that one of those six \u201creasons\u201d for nondisclosure applies. Thus, <em>where an agency fails to \u201cdemonstrate! that the documents [sought] relate to any on-going investigation or would jeopardize any future law enforcement proceedings, </em>\u201d <em>Exemption 7(a) would not provide protection </em>to the agency\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">437 U.S. at 235, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">While the justification for an exemption based on interference with law enforcement proceedings cannot be established generieally in most cases, it may be thus established, however, when a case is actually pending.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">While <em>the Court of Appeals was correct that </em>the amendment of <em>Exemption 7 was designed to eliminate \u201cblanket exemptions\u201d for </em>Government <em>records simply because they were found in investigatory files </em>compiled for law enforcement purposes, we think <em>it erred in concluding that no generic determinations of likely interference can ever be made. </em>We conclude that Congress did not intend to prevent the federal courts from determining that, with respect to particular kinds of enforcement proceedings, <em>disclosure of particular kinds of investigatory records while a case is pending would generally \u201cinterfere with enforcement proceedings.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ard\">437 U.S. at 236, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">In the case of the NLRB hearing then before it, the Supreme Court recognized the validity of a generic justification, but also recognized its finite shelf life.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>[WJitness statements </em>in pending unfair labor practice proceedings <em>are exempt </em>from FOIA disclosure <em>at least until completion of the Board\u2019s hearing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">What the exemption based on interference with law enforcement proceedings seeks to prevent is disclosure prior to the completion of the proceeding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">The tenor of this description of the statutory language clearly suggests that the release of information in investigatory files <em>prior to the completion of an actual, contemplated enforcement proceeding </em>was precisely the kind of interference that Congress continued to want to protect against.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">437 U.S. at 232, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">When a prosecution is actually pending, there is, in effect, a short form available to a custodian for showing that disclosure would likely interfere with such a proceeding. The option of utilizing that short form of justification, however, has a very definite expiration date. It expires when the law enforcement proceeding it was designed to protect expires.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">In pointing out why a broad generic justification for nondisclosure rather than an <em>ad hoc </em>showing of probable interference on a case-by-case basis is advisable when a law enforcement proceeding is actually pending, the Supreme Court listed two dangers posed by premature disclosure. The first is a significant disruption of the discovery procedures designed to cover the pretrial and trial phases of a case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">Historically, the NLRB has provided little prehearing discovery in unfair labor practice proceedings and has relied principally on statements such as those sought here to prove its case.... A profound alteration in the Board\u2019s trial strategy in unfair labor practice cases would thus be effectuated if the Board were required, in <em>every case in which witnesses\u2019 statements were sought under FOIA prior to an unfair labor practice proceeding, </em>to make a particularized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>showing that release of these statements would interfere with the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">437 U.S. at 236-37, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The second danger is that of undue trial delay. Whereas a denial of discovery is not appealable until after a trial has been completed, a denial of disclosure under the FOIA (or under the MPIA) generally is immediately appeal-able. The potential for interfering with (by delaying) the law enforcement proceeding is self-evident.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">Unlike ordinary discovery contests, where rulings are generally not appealable until the conclusion of the proceedings, <em>an agency\u2019s denial of a FOIA request is immediately reviewable in the district court, and the district court\u2019s decision can then be reviewed in the court of appeals. The potential for delay </em>and for restructuring of the NLRB\u2019s routine adjudications of unfair labor practice charges from requests like respondent\u2019s <em>is thus not insubstantial.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">437 U.S. at 238, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">When a case is pending, a premature disclosure of information, beyond that allowed by the discovery rules, is <em>per se </em>an interference with the proceeding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">[T]he dangers posed by <em>premature release of the statements </em>sought here would involve <em>precisely the kind of \u201cinterference </em>with enforcement proceedings\u201d <em>that Exemption 7(a) was designed to avoid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">437 U.S. at 239, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">As <em>NLRB v. Robbins </em>concluded its analysis, the opinion expressly articulated that the kind of disclosure that the generic justification for non-disclosure was designed to guard against was not disclosure generally, but prehearing disclosure specifically.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-13\">In short, <em>prehearing disclosure </em>of witnesses\u2019 statements would involve the kind of harm that Congress believed would constitute an \u201cinterference\u201d with NLRB enforcement proceedings: that of <em>giving a party litigant earlier and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>greater access </em>to the Board\u2019s case <em>than he would otherwise have.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">437 U.S. at 241, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s final word on the subject emphasized what a narrow window of enhanced non-disclosure was being contemplated. The relaxed burden on the custodian to justify non-disclosure was only being made available until the prosecution had \u201cpresented its case in court.\u201d FOIA disclosure was not being denied. It was only being deferred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">Since we are dealing here with the narrow question whether witnesses\u2019 statements must be released five days prior to an unfair labor practice hearing, <em>we cannot see how FOIA\u2019s purposes would be defeated by deferring disclosure until after the Government has \u201cpresented its case in court.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak2\">437 U.S. at 242, 98 S.Ct. 2311 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">B. <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney: </em>COSA</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Four years after <em>NLRB v. Robbins </em>was filed, a similar\u2019 issue arrived in Maryland as one of first impression. Curley Faulk was actually awaiting trial in Harford County on two separate charges of burglary. Under the Maryland Rule covering pretrial discovery, he sought copies of the police reports in his case. Such reports were not covered by the discovery rules and the request was denied. It was then that Faulk demanded the production of the records under the MPIA. The State\u2019s Attorney denied disclosure and the trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">On appeal, the framing of the issue by this Court in <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>52 Md.App. at 618, 451 A.2d 936, made it clear that we were dealing with a request for an investigatory file by a person in interest that was being resisted by the custodian on the ground that disclosure would \u201cinterfere with valid and proper law enforcement proceedings\u201d pursuant to what is now \u00a7 10-618(f)(2)(i).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">Section 3(a) of Article 76A provides generally that the custodian of any public records shall allow any person the right of inspection of such records. This general access is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>however, limited by, <em>inter alia, </em>the provisions of subsection (b). That subsection covers five broad categories of records that are exempt from general public access. <em>The first of those </em>five exempt <em>categories </em>is the one that <em>concerns us in this case.

The analysis stressed the fact that the information required to be disclosed to a criminal defendant in a pending criminal case is controlled by the discovery rules. The exploitation of the MPIA to outflank the built-in limitations on discovery was considered to be, <em>ipso facto, </em>an \u201cinterferfence] with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">[T]he utilization of the Maryland Public Information Act <em>to obtain disclosure </em>of investigatory police reports <em>not otherwise mandated </em>by [the discovery rules] <em>necessarily would \u201cinterfere with valid and proper law-enforcement proceedings. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">We are persuaded that the <em>disclosure of investigatory police reports to a defendant in a pending criminal proceeding </em>would substantially alter the substantive criminal discovery rules and cause substantial delays in the adjudication of a criminal proceeding. Consequently, <em>such disclosure necessarily would \u201cinterfere with valid and proper law-enforcement proceedings.\u201d </em>We are further persuaded that <em>the Maryland Public Information Act was not intended to be a device to enlarge the scope of discovery beyond </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>that provided by the Maryland Rules </em>or to delay ongoing litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">299 Md. at 510, 474 A.2d 880 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The Court of Appeals also recognized the other automatic interference posed by delay.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">Ordinarily, discovery rulings are not appealable until there is a final judgment. In contrast, <em>a public official\u2019s denial of a Maryland Public Information Act request is immediately reviewable in a circuit court, and the circuit court\u2019s decision can then be reviewed on appeal. </em>Consequently, <em>the utilization of the Maryland Public Information Act </em>to obtain disclosure of investigatory police reports not otherwise mandated <em>necessarily would \u201cinterfere with valid and proper law-enforcement proceedings. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">299 Md. at 509-10, 474 A.2d 880 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Those dangers of 1) unduly expanded discovery and 2) inordinate delay do not exist when there is no pending criminal case. Judge Davidson\u2019s opinion carefully qualified every mention of permitted non-disclosure or of the generic justification for non-disclosure with the temporal adverbial limitation \u201cin a pending criminal case.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">In our view, the disclosure of investigatory police reports to a defendant <em>in a pending criminal proceeding </em>would substantially alter the substantive criminal discovery rules.... [I]t would give a defendant <em>in a pending criminal proceeding </em>earlier or greater access to the State\u2019s case than would otherwise be available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">Moreover, the utilization of the Maryland Public Information Act to obtain disclosure of information for use <em>in a pending criminal proceeding </em>creates a substantial likelihood of delay in the adjudication of that criminal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">299 Md. at 509, 474 A.2d 880 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">The <em>Faulk </em>opinion, moreover, clearly contemplated that the permitted non-disclosure was not intended to be a permanent ban, but only a temporary postponement. It figured that no harm would be done by temporarily deferring the disclosure until the criminal prosecution had been concluded. The issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>was only one of timing. Once the criminal case has been terminated, disclosure will once again become the order of the day. The balancing of competing goals produces not a final resolution of disclosure denied, but only a compromise of disclosure deferred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">[W]e are not persuaded that the purpose of the Maryland Public Information Act would be defeated by <em>deferring the disclosure </em>of investigatory police reports <em>until the termination of a criminal proceeding. </em>Under these circumstances, we conclude that the strong presumption in favor of disclosure under the Maryland Public Information Act is outweighed by the likelihood that the disclosure of investigatory police reports to a defendant <em>in a pending criminal proceeding </em>would disturb the existing balance of relations in criminal proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">299 Md. at 510-11, 474 A.2d 880 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">As its final holding made eminently clear, the Court of Appeals would not even allow the notion of a generic determination of interference out in public, except when closely chaperoned by its limiting qualifier of \u201cin a pending criminal proceeding.\u201d Without the latter, the former does not exist.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aze-dedup-0\">[T]he State is not required to make a particularized showing that the disclosure of investigatory police reports compiled for law-enforcement purposes to a defendant <em>in a pending criminal proceeding </em>would interfere with <em>that pending criminal proceeding. </em>Rather, a generic determination of interference can be made whenever a defendant <em>in a, pending criminal proceeding </em>seeks access to investigatory police reports relating to <em>that pending criminal proceeding. </em>In short, the Maryland Public Information Act does not require the disclosure of investigatory police reports compiled for law-enforcement purposes to a defendant <em>in a pending criminal proceeding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">299 Md. at 511, 474 A.2d 880 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The Caselaw <em>Post-Faulk</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">In <em>Fioretti v.

There was no longer any danger that premature disclosure under the MPIA might give the appellant an edge at his homicide trial that the ordinary discovery rules would not have entitled him to. Nor was there any longer a danger that an MPIA review by the circuit court or an appeal from that circuit court review to this Court would delay the appellant\u2019s trial for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">The proceedings against the appellant had certainly once been a \u201cpending criminal case,\u201d through his sentencing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>August 15, 1997. Whether the case might be deemed to have been still \u201cpending\u201d during the appeal process is problematic, but that issue is not before us in this case.

As long as a convicted defendant is still serving a sentence or is on parole or probation, the possibility of filing a post-conviction petition or a writ of federal habeas corpus or a writ of coram nobis is always present. <em>Faulk\u2019s </em>language about there being no harm in temporarily deferring the disclosure \u201cuntil the termination of a criminal proceeding\u201d would be meaningless.

As Judge Wilner pointed out for this Court in <em>Kline v. Fuller, </em>56 Md.App. 294, 305, 467 A.2d 786 (1983), there was initially, under the MPIA, no right of judicial review for an applicant aggrieved by nondisclosure. That relief was only provided in 1978.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">When the public general law was first enacted in 1970, there was no provision in it for judicial review....In 1978, the Legislature rewrote \u00a7 5, providing, as additional enforcement mechanisms, (1) the right of administrative review under the \u201ccontested case\" sections of the Administrative Procedure Act, if the agency or official was otherwise subject 1o that Act, and (2) the right to seek judicial <em>review </em>\u2014 i.e., to seek a court order compelling the production of the requested document.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b547-15\">. Because the investigatory file was compiled by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office or the Sheriff\u2019s Office, it was not even necessary to show that the investigation was for a law enforcement or prosecution purpose.
