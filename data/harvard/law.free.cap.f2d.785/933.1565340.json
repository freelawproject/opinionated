The district court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, holding that plaintiffs had failed to meet the \u201cthreshold\u201d requirement of Fla.Stat., \u00a7 627.737(2) (1984)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because they had not produced evidence that James had suffered permanent injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-16\">Section 627.737(2) applies to actions in tort brought against \u201cthe owner, registrant, operator, or occupant of a motor vehicle with respect to which security has been provided ... or against any person or organization legally responsible for his acts or omissions\u201d and permits a plaintiff to recover damages in tort \u201cbecause of bodily injury ... arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, or use of such motor vehicle____\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 627.737(2). Section 627.737(2) does not apply in this case because the action is against the county for negligent maintenance of its roads; the action is not \u201cagainst the owner, registrant, operator or occupant of a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-18\">Because \u00a7 627.737(2) does not apply in this case, plaintiffs are not required to meet the \u201cthreshold\u201d requirement of proving permanent injury. <em>See Santiagoherrera v. Stout, </em>470 So.2d 718 (Fla. 5th D.C.A.1985) (\u201cthreshold\u201d requirement of Fla.Stat. \u00a7 627.737(2) need not be met because the statute does not apply in a suit in which injuries arose out of an accident involving a city bus).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-19\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>McKee v. City of Jacksonville, </em>395 So.2d 222 (Fla. 1st D.C.A.1981) is misplaced. The <em>McKee </em>court applied Fla.Stat. \u00a7 627.7372, a statute similar to \u00a7 627.737(2), in a suit against a city for alleged failure to maintain, replace, or erect a stop sign. The injuries in <em>McKee </em>arose out of a collision between a motorcycle and an automobile and therefore met the requirement of \u00a7 627.7372 that the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>jury \u201carise out of the ownership, operation, use, or maintenance of a motor vehicle.\u201d Section 627.7372 does not require that the defendant own, operate, use, or maintain the motor vehicle. Therefore, \u00a7 627.7372 properly applied in <em>McKee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Section 627.737(2) does not apply in this ease, where the injury allegedly arose out of defendant\u2019s negligent maintenance of its roads.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">. Section 627.737(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-14\">In any action of tort brought against the owner, registrant, operator, or occupant of a motor vehicle with respect to which security has been provided as required by \u00a7\u00a7 627.730-627.7405, or against any person or organization legally responsible for his acts or omissions, a plaintiff may recover damages in tort for pain, suffering, mental anguish, and inconvenience because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, or use of such motor vehicle only in the event that the injury or disease consists in whole or in part of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axsz\">(a) Significant and permanent loss of an important bodily function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHB\">(b) Permanent injury within a reasonable degree of medical probability, other than scarring or disfigurement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhY\">(c) Significant and permanent scarring or disfigurement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aox\">(d) Death.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1027-18\">. Defendant asserts that plaintiffs stipulated to the application of \u00a7 627.737(2) in this case. We can find no such stipulation in the record. In any case, parties may not stipulate the applicable law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
