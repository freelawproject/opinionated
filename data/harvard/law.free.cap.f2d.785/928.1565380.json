They advanced an arsenal of arguments, including violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution; that their wages are not income subject to tax but are a tax on property such as their labor; that only public servants are subject to tax liability; that withholding of tax from wages is a direct tax on the source of income without apportionment in violation of the Sixteenth Amendment; that withholding taxes violates equal protection; that they should be allowed to exclude from the amount of wages they receive the cost of maintaining their well-being. In a series of cases this court has held that claims such as these are frivolous. <em>U.S. v. Goetz, </em>746 F.2d 705 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Simanonok v. Commissioner, </em>731 F.2d 743, 744 (11th Cir.1984); <em>U.S. v. Vance, </em>730 F.2d 736, 738 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Melton v. Kurtz, </em>575 F.2d 547, 548 (5th Cir.1978). The order of the district court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-21\">This court has imposed sanctions against individuals raising claims such as these. <em>Waters v. Commissioner, </em>764 F.2d 1389 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Hobson v. Fischbeck, </em>758 F.2d 579 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Ricket v. U.S., </em>773 F.2d 1214 (11th Cir.1985). Accordingly we award double costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the government. The case is REMANDED to the district court for a determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the government for the cost of defending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-22\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
