Petitioner filed a notice of protest and a petition for rehearing. On March 11, 1963, after rehearing held on February 11, 1963, the Commission entered an order affirming the Commission\u2019s action of October 10, 1962. Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 23-951 the Commission\u2019s order of March 11, 1963, stated that any party aggrieved by the order might, within thirty (30) days after the rendition of the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u201capply to the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona for a Writ of Certiorari to review the lawfulness of said order * *</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Section A of A.R.S. \u00a7 23-951 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cWithin thirty days after an application for a rehearing is denied, or if the application is granted, within thirty days after rendition of the decision on a rehearing, any party affected thereby may apply to the supreme court for a writ of certiorari to review the lawfulness of the award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">On May 31, 1963 the petitioner filed a Petition and Application for Readjustment of Reopening of the Claim. On July 16, 1963 the Commission denied the reopening of the petitioner\u2019s claim. On July 25, 1963 petitioner filed a Notice of Protest and Petition and Application for a Rehearing. On August 9, 1963 the Commission issued an \u201cOrder Denying Rehearing and Affirming Previous Findings and Award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Petitioner filed his petition for writ of certiorari on August 29, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The Commission argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the petitioner\u2019s application for a writ of certiorari because the petitioner failed to file a petition for such writ within thirty days after the Commission\u2019s order of March 11, 1963, pursuant to the rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">We have repeatedly held that the thirty days limitation in A.R.S. \u00a7 23-951 for making application for a writ of certiorari is jurisdictional, and the petitioner\u2019s right to review in this Court is lost by failure to file within that time. Villanueva v. Phelps Dodge Corporation, 82 Ariz. 248, 311 P.2d 843; Harambasic v. Barrett &amp; Hilp &amp; Macco Corp., 58 Ariz. 319, 119 P.2d 932; Di Paolo v. Calumet &amp; Arizona Mining Co., 36 Ariz. 347, 285 P. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Petitioner\u2019s reply brief acknowledges that the decision upon rehearing by the Commission was dated March 11, 1963 and that that decision allowed thirty days from March 11, 1963 for an aggrieved party to apply to this Court for a writ of certiorari pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 23-951. However the petitioner claims that the Commission is es-topped from asserting the procedural bar created by A.R.S. \u00a7 23-951 against the petitioner because of a series of correspondence in 1963, initiated by the petitioner three days after the order of March 11, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">On March 14th petitioner\u2019s attorney wrote to the Commission, acknowledging receipt of the decision on rehearing, and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">\u201cI checked my file and if my records are correct, he is only claiming compensation from the date he was cut off, which I believe was August 15, 1962, till the date he went back to work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>which is February 8, 1963.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">\u201cIt seems like such a small amount to make a Supreme Court case out of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201cI respectfully request that you reconsider Dr, Cortner\u2019s testimony in relation to his actually being disabled during this period, and that the only treatment was no treatment at all. I believe the results speak for themselves. He is now able to earn a living, however, the five months that he did not work, has literally bankrupted him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">On April 8th the Commission by its Claims Compensation Supervisor responded to the letter of March 14th as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201cMr. Frank Contreras\u2019 case including your letter of March 14, 1963, was carefully reviewed. There is no justification from a medical point of view for payment of compensation from August 15, 1962 through February 8, 1963. Our records show that Dr. J. W. Cortner released Mr. Contreras for regular work on August 15, 1962 and the consultants who examined him on October 1, 1962 verified the fact that Mr. Contreras could remain on regular work status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201cFrom the testimony at the hearing held February 11, 1963, Doctor Cortner was of the opinion that Mr. Contreras was ready to return to work even though claimant felt he was not able.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">\u201cAt the request of the attending physician, group consultatin [sic] will be scheduled to determine <em>present </em>status of Mr. Contreras\u2019 back condition relating to his accident of June 25, 1962 and further handling of this case.\u201d (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">At no time between the period of March 11th when the order was handed down, and April 8th did the petitioner file a petition for writ of certiorari to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">On April 10th petitioner\u2019s attorney answered the Commission\u2019s letter of April 8th. This was on the thirtieth day after the Commission\u2019s order on rehearing, by which time, pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 23-951 the petition for writ of certiorari should have been filed with this court. This letter to the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">\u201cI am in receipt of your letter of April 8, 1963 and as a result of the last paragraph, I am assuming that there will be no necessity for me to abide by the last paragraph of the Order dated March 11, 1963 wherein I had thirty days to apply to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. I am assuming that the Commission is going to hold further hearings and consultation and that until such time as the consultations and further hearings are held that there will be no necessity to file anything further to keep the case alive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Seven days later, on April 17th the Commission responded to the petitioner as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">\u201cSo there will be no misunderstanding on the processing of Mr. Frank Contreras\u2019 case, we would like to review recent actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">\u201cAs you know, on October 11, 1962 the Commission issued its order terminating temporary compensation as of August 14, 1962 because Mr. Contreras was released to return to regular work by Dr. J. W. Cortner. Mr. Contreras filed petition and Application for rehearing on November 7, 1962, and subsequently hearing was held on February 11, 1963. On March 11, 1963 Decision Upon Rehearing and Order Affirming Previous Record of Commission\u2019s Action was issued. Since the thirty days set out have elapsed, we assume you have not applied to the Supreme Court for a Writ, of Certiorari.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201cGroup consultation is being scheduled to determine present status of Mr. Contreras\u2019 condition relating to his accident of June 25,1962; to determine further medical handling of this case; or, if condition is stationary, to determine final evaluation and disposition. The consultation is not being held to determine Mr. Contreras\u2019 working ability subsequent to August 14, 1962.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Again, on May 6th the Commission wrote to the petitioner\u2019s attorney stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">\u201cSince the thirty day period has elapsed we assume you have not applied to the Supreme Court for a Writ of Certiorari.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">\u201cWe have made arrangements for Mr. Frank Contreras to be seen in group consultation in Tucson on May 13, 1963.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">On May 8th the petitioner\u2019s attorney sent the following letter to the Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">\u201cPlease reread my letter of April 10, 1963, directed to you. Read it carefully, then please explain your letter to me of May 6, 1963. I\u2019m sure you are not attempting to confuse me but I assure you that you have.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">On May 10th the Commission responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-14\">\u201cWe wish to apologize if our recent letters were confusing. To review the case, Mr. Frank Contreras protested Record of Commission\u2019s Action issued October 11, 1962, in which payment of compensation for temporary disability was terminated as of August 14, 1962, because the attending physician felt he was able to return to regular work. Formal hearing was held for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-15\">\u201cSubsequently, on March 11, 1963, Decision Upon Rehearing and Order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Affirming Previous Record of Commission\u2019s Action was issued. Of course, this meant compensation for temporary disability is not payable subsequent to August 14, 1962.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">\u201cIt is to be noted that the Decision issued March 11, 1963 contained a thirty day clause, in which time any aggrieved party could apply to the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona for a Writ of Certiorari. Then we received your letter dated March 14, 1963.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">\u201cThe Commission again reviewed this case, and it was felt that compensation for the period set out in your letter, namely, from August 15, 1962 to February 8, 1963, is not payable, because the attending physician, Dr. J. W. Cortner, was of the opinion Mr. Contreras was ready to return to work even though he felt he was not able.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\u201cCoincidentally, we received a report from Doctor Cortner in which he recommended group consultation be held. Therefore, arrangements have been made for examination by a board of consultants on May 13, 1963. The consultation is being held to determine medical handling of the case and is not ordered to determine claimant\u2019s working ability from August 15, 1962 to February 8, 1963, or for anything to do with disposition of Mr. Contreras\u2019 petition for rehearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">\u201cIn my letter of April 18, [sic] 1963, mention was made of the group consultation merely on an information basis. It was not intended to infer that the consultation would in any way change the Commission\u2019s Decision Upon Rehearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">\u201cIf our explanation is not entirely clear, it is suggested that you contact our Legal Department, preferably Mr. Lorin Shelley.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">On May 14th the plaintiff\u2019s attorney replied as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">\u201cThank you for your letter of May 10, 1963.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">\u201cI agree with paragraph 3 of your letter that the Decision contained a 30 day clause. However, I point out to you that in your letter of April 8, 1963, to which I responded left little doubt in my mind that the case would be left open. I quote from your letter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">\u201c \u2018At the request of the attending physician, group consultation will be scheduled to determine present status of Mr. Contreras\u2019 back condition relating to his accident of June 25, 1962, and further handling of this case.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">\u201cThis is the position I shall have to take under the circumstances. Possibly the question will become moot after the consultation by a reopening of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u201cI want to correct a date in your next to last paragraph. The letter was dated April 8, 1963, not April 18, 1963.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">As long ago as 1935 in Lilly White v. Coleman, 46 Ariz. 523, 52 P.2d 1157 this court stated the elements of equitable estoppel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">\u201cThe essential elements of an equitable estoppel may be stated as follows: (1) There must be a false representation <em>or concealment of material facts; </em>(2) it must have been made with knowledge, actual or constructive, of the facts; (3) the party to whom it was made must have been without knowledge of or the duty of inquiring further as to the real facts; (4) it must have been m'\u00e1de with the intention it should be acted upon; and (5) the party to whom it was made must have relied on or acted on it to his prejudice. There can be no estoppel if any of these elements are absent.\u201d (Italics in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">See also Knight v. Rice, 83 Ariz. 379, 321 P.2d 1037; Valley National Bank v. Battles, 62 Ariz. 204, 156 P.2d 244; and City of Glendale v. Coquat, 46 Ariz. 478, 52 P.2d 1178, 102 A.L.R. 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In this case since the petition for writ of certiorari was filed more than five months after the March 11th order, and since there was no false representation or concealment of material facts by the Commission in any of the letters sent to the petitioner in response to the petitioner\u2019s original letter of March 14, 1963, in which the petitioner said that the whole matter seemed \u201clike such a small amount to make a Supreme Court case out of * * * \u201d, and since the petitioner cannot claim lack of knowledge of A.R.S. \u00a7 23-951 nor lack of knowledge that the order of March 11, 1963, contained the thirty day clause, the petitioner cannot assert the claim that all of the essentials of estoppel were present. The petitioner may not create an estoppel of the effect of the statute by his own delay in compliance therewith. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">For the above reasons we hold that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition for writ of certiorari. Order quashing writ of certiorari.</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-11\">UDALL and McFARLAND, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
