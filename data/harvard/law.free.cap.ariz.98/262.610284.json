Respondents demand production of \u201cthe books and records of the defendants concerning the financial operation of said defendant [Hospital] since the incorporation of said defendant.\u201d The statements contained in Industrial Commission v. Holohan, 97 Ariz. 122, 397 P.2d 624, are applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">\u201c * * * this Court is committed to the liberal view of designation by categories where under the circumstances records are voluminous and hence it may be impossible to specifically designate each document sought. Obviously categories may be narrow or broad. The essential factor is that the category itself be sufficiently defined to the end the parties and the court may understand with certainty the nature of the demand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">It is obvious from the demand of respondents that the category designated is the books, documents and records concerning all financial transactions of defendant Hospital for the period indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">It is ordered that the permanent writ of prohibition heretofore issued by the Court of Appeals (Division One) in this cause be dissolved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
