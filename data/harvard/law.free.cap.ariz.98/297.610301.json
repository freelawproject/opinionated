The force of the blow knocked him down. Immediately thereafter a size-able lump appeared upon the forehead of petitioner at the place where the injury occurred. The accident was reported to respondents\u2019 foreman immediately after it happened and it was observed by one Douglas Powell, a fellow employee. Immediately thereafter petitioner experienced a severe headache, which he claims was caused by the accident. Petitioner continued to work at his employment until the evening of November 2, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Petitioner returned to his home on November 3, 1962, and when he awoke on the morning of November 4 he was nearly blind in both eyes. For several days after the accident he had a severe headache in the area where his head struck the scaffolding. The testimony shows that from November 4th the sight of the left eye began to improve, and in the course of four or five days thereafter the vision of his left eye was restored to normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Thereafter petitioner filed a claim with the Commission and in due course the Commission made findings and award that petitioner\u2019s loss of vision in his right eye was noncompensable. Thereupon petitioner filed his notice of protest of award and made application for a rehearing. On November IS, 1963 a formal hearing was held and on November 22, 1963 the referee made his report affirming the findings and award of April 3, 1963. Objections to the referee\u2019s report were filed and the matter was submitted for review and decision. Again the Commission affirmed the previous award of April 2, 1963 denying peti- . tioner compensation for the loss of his right eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">It is the contention of petitioner that the evidence submitted by the petitioner at the hearing on November IS, 1963 showed that the loss of the sight of petitioner\u2019s right eye was the result of the injury sustained on October 30, 1962 during the regular course of petitioner\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The evidence is uncontradicted that on October 30, 1962, petitioner- \u2014 -while in the course of his employment \u2014 sustained an injury to his forehead as heretofore recited. It is also uncontradicted that immediately after the injury the petitioner suffered severe headaches which continued for several days thereafter. The petitioner testified that he had never had this type of headache before. The evidence also shows that on the morning of the 4th of November when petitioner awoke he found that he was nearly blind in both eyes; that some five days later the petitioner regained the sight of his left eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The principal and only question to be determined in the case is whether petitioner lost the sight of his right eye as a result of the injury, or whether the loss of his vision was caused by hardening of the arteries or a thrombosis which brought about an occlusion of the central retinal artery of petitioner\u2019s right eye.</p>\n<p id=\"A-J\">Respondents and the Commission contend that loss of the vision of petitioner\u2019s right eye was caused by hardening of the arteries. To substantiate their contention, Dr. Harry J. French, an ophthalmologist who examined the petitioner on February 2, 1963, testified that in his opinion there was a \u201cthrombosis of the central retinal artery\u201d or \u201cocclusion of the central retinal artery..\u201d \u201cBoth eyes exhibited a certain amount of attenuation.\u201d This is consistent with what is called hardening of the arteries or arterio-sclerosis. He did not attribute the bump as having caused all these profound changes in the eye. He testified \u201cthere is no possible way for a blow or trauma to produce such extensive damage in the eye.\u201d The only conclusion he could arrive at was that \u201cindigenous or metabolic changes within his own system could produce such profound and extensive changes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Dr. French also testified that the metabolic changes could have been caused by \u201chigh cholesterol, heredity, toxic poison in the system.\u201d He admitted that he made no tests to determine if there was high cholesterol in the petitioner\u2019s system, nor did he make any tests or inquiry to determine if petitioner had any toxic poison in his system at the time of the injury. Likewise, he did not make inquiry of petitioner to determine if heredity could have been a cause that brought about damage to the eye at the time of the alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The following questions were propounded to the doctor and answers made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\u201cQ He did tell you that since the injury he sustained until he lost the sight of his eye he was suffering continuously from headaches all that time, isn\u2019t that true ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">\u201cA Yes, I think he did but I don\u2019t see how the loss of vision of the eye could produce headaches. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>\u201cQ </em>You mention as part of the pathology he had exotropia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">\u201cQ How long does this generally take to produce?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>Usually from two to three months, to show itself. He also had optic atrophy which takes two to three months to show up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\"><em>\u201cQ </em>If a man was subjected to the type of trauma that Mr. Belshe suffered, could this exotrophia develop any quicker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">\u201cA No, the exothrophia was because he had no vision, and trauma played no part, in my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-12\">\u201cQ I believe in the comments you stated you found this optic atrophy was either a postoptic neuritis or the result of a vascular accident ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-13\"><em>\u201cA </em>Yes, thrombosis of the central retinal artery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-15\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-16\">\u201cQ You say it takes two or three months for this exotropia to present itself and also two or three months for this optic atrophy to present itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-17\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-18\">\u201cQ Your examination was on February 2, 1963, over three months after the injury had occurred. Isn\u2019t it possible that this injury had occurred and during the two or three months that the eye had turned out and the atrophy had presented itself and your examination was over three months after the date of the accident, isn\u2019t it possible this could have happened during the time before you examined him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-20\">\u201cA I will answer it this way: I can\u2019t . say that the accident was or there was enough changes within the eye, nontraumatic, to produce optic changes. I can\u2019t give an affirmative answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-21\">\u201cQ I am just a layman, Doctor, and let me ask you this way, if I may: Assuming there was an occlusion of this eye causing the sight to leave the right eye, that would cause disuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-22\">\u201cA That is right, that is the most probable sequence of events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-23\">\u201cQ From the disuse, the muscles wouldn\u2019t be functioning, which would weaken the muscles and it would turn out to be an extrophia which presented itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-24\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-25\">\u201cQ It would take about three months ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\u201cA That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\"><em>\u201cQ </em>If the accident happened on October 30, 1962, and you examined him on February 2, 1963, approximately three months after the accident, this exotrophia could have happened, since he went blind in his right eye, between that and the date you examined him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cA That is probably true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cQ Would your statement be the same as to the optic atrophy ? Could that also happen that way, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The doctor also testified that where blinded, as a result of hardening of the arteries, the blood supply has been cut off and where that occurs for any length of time it will die permanently. He testified in this case that the blindness in the right eye was permanent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">\u201cQ Assuming he woke up the same way, he woke up and couldn\u2019t see out of his right or left eye and later got back the complete sight in his left eye?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">\u201cA I would have to question that, myself, because if he had an occlusion in the other eye, it wouldn\u2019t come back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">\u201cQ If it was hardening of the arteries that caused that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-12\"><em>\u201cA </em>With all the manifestation he had it wouldn\u2019t come back that quick because I have here my refraction of 20/20, read small print with proper glasses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-13\">\u201cQ If he had hardening of the arteries which caused the loss of sight in his right eye and assuming if he lost the sight in his left eye at the same time, it would have to be hardening of the arteries of the left eye, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-14\"><em>\u201cA </em>Of course, there, again, I didn\u2019t look in his eye but he has evidence of hardening of the arteries in the other eye.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-15\">\u201cQ You say if he had hardening of the arteries in both eyes and lost the sight of both eyes due to that, he wouldn\u2019t get his sight back?-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-16\">\u201cA No, he wouldn\u2019t get it back; he might have gotten a little hysterical or pacicky.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-17\">\u201cQ If the testimony shows he was completely blind in both eyes when he woke ttp on Sunday morning and later got complete sight back in his left eye, that would not indicate hardening of the arteries?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-18\">\u201cA It would not? He has it in both eyes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-19\">\u201cQ You said that if he had hardening of the arteries he would lost the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>sight of his eye and it wouldn\u2019t come back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">\u2018A If he has got a complete occlusion, put it that way, occlusion of the main artery inside the eye.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u2018Q Mr. Belshe does have in his right eye a complete occlusion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u2018A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">\u201cQ He should not be able to see anything ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">\u2018A Nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">\u2018Q If he has hardening of the arteries which caused the occlusion which caused him to go blind, you are saying he can never get his sight back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">\u2018A That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">'Q If he can never get his eyesight back, he is completely blind in this eye?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-13\">\u2018A That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoZ\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-14\">\u2018Q At the time you examined him on . February 2d, he could see noth- . ing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-15\">\u2018A That is what he claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-16\">\u2018Q Your test showed he could see absolutely nothing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-17\">\u2018A That is right.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">Dr. Lorenzen, an ophthalmologist, who was called by the petitioner, testified that to determine whether a person has hardening of the arteries in the eye, one would have to have a \u201ccombined analysis of the small vessels of the eye and the blood chemistry and blood pressure and other general results of tests.\u201d The record shows that Dr. French did none of these things except to look into the eye of the petitioner. Dr. French was of the opinion that a blow or trauma such as petitioner sustained could not cause the loss of the sight of the eye, whereas Dr. Lorenzen testified that \u201coptic atrophy or blindness in a person\u2019s eye can be caused by \u2018trauma\u2019 so slight as a blow on the forehead with a potato\u201d, and \u201can incidental and apparently trivial fall into a hedge.\u201d Both Dr. Loren-zen and Dr. French agree that the \u201coptic atrophy\u201d or exotropia found in petitioner\u2019s right eye was caused by the shutting off of blood to the eye at the time of the occlusion. Dr. Lorenzen, however, is of the opinion that the occlusion could have been caused by \u201ctrauma,\u201d whereas Dr. French insists that the cause could not be trauma but that the occlusion was caused by arterial sclerosis. Dr. French is firm in his opinion that if the occlusion was caused, as he says it was in this case, by hardening of the arteries, then the petitioner has lost the sight of his right eye forever.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-19\">Counsel then asked the following question and received the following answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u201cQ If lie has sight in his right eye it wouldn\u2019t he hardening of the arteries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u201cA If he has it; hut he doesn\u2019t have it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The undisputed fact, however, is that on June 24, 1963, Dr. Lorenzen examined the petitioner and found that he could see out of his right eye and was able to count fingers. Further, at the time of the hearing before the Board on November 15, 1963, the petitioner, in the presence.of the referee, demonstrated that he could see out of his right eye. Therefore there is no competent testimony in the record showing that the partial loss of the right eye was not due to the accident of October 30, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Dr. Lorenzen explained how a blow on the forehead can cause blindness such as was sustained by the petitioner in his right eye. He testified it would take about five days from the time of the injury for the sight of the eye to be lost. He further testified that the severe headaches felt by the petitioner after October 30th would indicate that the blow was severe enough to cause hemorrhaging within the sheaf of the optic nerves, which would cause the occlusion. If the hemorrhaging caused the occlusion in the course of four or five days, that not only would account for the severe headaches experienced by the petitioner but would account for the atrophy and exotropia found in petitioner\u2019s eye when he was examined by Dr. French some three months after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">We have held that when there is no substantial evidence to support the crucial finding of the Commission, that said finding is clearly erroneous and the award of the Commission should be set aside. Jenkins v. Industrial Commission, <em>77 </em>Ariz. 377, 272 P.2d 601 (1954). There is no competent evidence in the record which shows that the loss of the sight of petitioner\u2019s right eye was caused by thrombosis of the central retinal artery and was the result of hardening of the arteries or \u201carterial sclerosis\u201d, since Dr. French admits that if that was the cause the sight would be permanently lost. Equivocal testimony cannot create a conflict in medical testimony. Rahar v. Industrial Commission, 94 Ariz. 170, 382 P.2d 656 (1963); Helmericks v. Airesearch Manufacturing Co. of Arizona, 88 Ariz. 413, 357 P.2d 152 (1960). On the other hand, the testimony of Dr. Lorenzen shows that a trauma could have caused the loss of the sight of the right eye. His testimony is corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Helmes since he admitted that it is possible for a head injury such as was sustained by the petitioner to cause blindness.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">We therefore conclude that the Commission had no credible medical evidence before it upon which to base its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>award of no compensation. ' Where this is the case the award will be set aside. Rahar v. Industrial Commission, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Award set aside.</p>\n<judges id=\"b324-5\">LOCKWOOD, C.
