The appellant has been released on bail pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">\u25a0 The record shows the pertinent facts to be as follows: On August 23, 1962, two state agents, Roberts and Klomparens, held a rendezvous with undercover agent J. L. Patrick in Winslow, Arizona. On that day Patrick was given ten dollars to purchase marijuana cigarettes from Joe Pacheco, a Winslow resident. Patrick drove to Pacheco\u2019s house and honked his horn. Pacheco came out of the house and walked up to Patrick\u2019s car. A conversation ensued relating to the purchase of the marijuana. The state officers, parked a block away, viewed the transaction through field glasses. They also listened by means of a \u201cFargo\u201d device. This device consists of a sending unit concealed on Patrick and a receiving unit in the officer\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">The arrangement was for Patrick to return to his home and await delivery of the marijuana since appellant did not have any marijuana at his house. Patrick then gave appellant ten dollars for the purchase. Shortly thereafter, a package of marijuana was delivered to Patrick\u2019s house by Danny Apodaca. Apodaca testified Pacheco gave the package to him to deliver to Patrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\"><em>The </em>attorney who represented' the appellant at his trial filed a notice of appeal on May 16, 1963. On July 12, 1963, he made application for the release of the appellant on bail. This was granted. The reporter\u2019s transcript and record on appeal has been on file with this Court since February, 1964. A.formal stipulation extended time to file an opening brief to April 1, 1965.
