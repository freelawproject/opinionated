After trial by jury defendant was convicted. The facts necessary for this appeal are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-16\">Jesse Caldera Saenz, Jr., not related to the defendant, and hereafter referred to as the informer, was an informer employed by the Narcotics Division of the Arizona Liquor Control Office. He testified that on the evening of April 19, 1963, he was working with Roy Charles Madrid, an undercover narcotics agent when at about 8:00 P.M. he and Officer Madrid parked in Madrid\u2019s automobile on Third Street and Jefferson, in Phoenix. The informer saw and greeted the defendant. The defendant asked the informer if he desired to buy some marijuana. The informer responded that he did not, but \u201cmaybe my friend Mike would.\u201d Officer Madrid was going under the name \u201cMike\u201d. After a short conversation between Officer Madrid and the defendant, the defendant agreed to sell Madrid six marijuana cigarettes for four dollars. The informer, Madrid, the defendant, Tony Armenia and two others drove in Madrid\u2019s car to the defendant\u2019s apartment. The defendant delivered six cigarettes to Madrid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Officer Madrid also testified for the prosecution. His testimony was essentially the same as the informer\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The defense witness, Tony Armenia, testified, contrary to the informer and Officer Madrid, that when the defendant approached Madrid\u2019s car, the informer asked the defendant if the defendant wanted to buy anything and the defendant answered, \u201cno.\u201d The informer said he then asked the defendant if the defendant had anything to sell and the defendant answered in the negative. The defendant\u2019s testimony was similar to Armenta\u2019s. Both the defendant and Armenta testified that Officer Madrid and the informer drove them to the defendant\u2019s home in the \u201cLibrary Apartments\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">During cross examination of narcotics Officer Madrid the defense counsel asked Officer Madrid whether anything was said by anybody in the car on the way to the \u201cLibrary Apartments\u201d, to which Officer Madrid answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">\u201cQ. Well, what was said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">[Prosecutor]: \u201cMay we have a foundation as to where we are now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">[Defense Counsel] : \u201cI told him at that time in the car. I mentioned that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Going from Third Street to 12th Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-14\">[Defense Counsel] : \u201cYes, that\u2019s cor- . rect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-15\">\u201cA. The conversation that was taking place during the time we was in the car was about Mr. Jesse Saenz the Defendant, and he was talking about a case that he had been acquitted on on narcotics by a jury prior to this, which was in 1962. And he was talking about \u25a0 \u2014 I will repeat this\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-16\">[Defense Counsel]: \u201cYour Honor, I object to conversations of that kind. I think we are entitled to a mistrial at this time, and I think it\u2019s highly prejudicial before a jury that he makes statements of that kind. He knows better than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Counsel, you asked him what the conversation was and he answered you what the conversation was. The motion for a mistrial is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-18\">[Defense Counsel]: \u201cHighly prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, counsel asked for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-21\">[Defense Counsel]: \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s what he told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-23\">\u201cA. I am very sure, sir. I am under oath, and I am positive that was the conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-24\">\u201cQ. Did you have any knowledge of that before ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-25\">\u201cA. No, sir. Oh, no, sir, I did not have any knowledge. \u25a0 \u25a0 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u201cQ. That he was acquitted ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">\u201cA. Well, sir, that\u2019s what he mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">\u201cQ. He told you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">\u201cA. That\u2019s the only thing, sir, that I know is what the gentleman told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">\u201cQ. And you didn\u2019t check on it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3f\">[Prosecutor] : \u201cIf the Court please, I think that is immaterial. It goes into collateral matters that have nothing to do with this particular proceedings. It\u2019s in the form of hearsay if he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">\u201cTHE COURT': I think he may answer. He asked for the conversation. He asked if he checked on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t check on the record. I did inquire about it, Mr. Levy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALn\">[Defense Counsel] : \u201cYou found out it was true ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. I believe you told me that it was true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-11\">\u201cQ. Who told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-12\">\u201cA. You did. One day I was talking to you outside the- courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-13\">\u201cQ. How long ago was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-14\">\u201cA. Not too'long ago, sir. About two months ago, three months ago. I don\u2019t recall off hand. I believe you was telling Agent Barrios and myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-15\">\u201cQ. Who was present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Agent Barrios and I\u2019m not sure, sir, but at that time I know I have discussed it with you and you have mentioned it to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-18\">The defendant contends that the court below erred by refusing to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-19\">As pointed out above Madrid was an officer of the narcotics division. We said in State v. Kellington, 93 Ariz. 396, 381 P. 2d 215 that officers testifying for the State should know or be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-20\">\u201c * * * admonished by the prosecutor, that a mention of a prior conviction under such circumstances [similar to that in the instant case] was highly improper. Had counsel for defendant made an objection in the presence of the jury, and had the trial judge admonished the jury to strike such testimony from their minds, it would have served no real purpose. * * * Defendant\u2019s counsel brought this matter to the attention of the trial court in his request for a mistrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-21\">The answers of Officer Madrid on cross examination in this case would tend to show to the jury that the defendant had been arrested, informed against and tried for another crime. Even though there was an acquittal in that case, it may have prejudiced the defendant in the minds of the jurors here.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-22\">We note that the same narcotics agent, Officer Madrid, on cross examination in State v. Ybarra, 97 Ariz. 200, 398 P.2d 905 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>used language which tended to link the defendant to a different crime from that charged. We found this insufficient in that case to constitute reversible error because no objection or motion to strike was made. However, it is noteworthy that this veteran officer, by continuing to testify to matters which could be properly subject to objection as inadmissible and highly prejudicial, has failed to heed the admonition given in Kellington. Such conduct, if persisted in, may well result in reversible error where none would otherwise exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">It cannot clearly be said that when the defense counsel, during the cross examination of Officer Madrid, asked whether there was a conversation in the automobile, that the defense counsel was soliciting from Officer Madrid information that the legal authorities, at a prior time and for a separate crime, had made a case against the defendant herein. Not only did Officer Madrid improperly volunteer this information but he added \u201cAnd he was talking about \u2014 I will repeat this \u2014 \u201d. Apparently he was going to repeat this improper information about the defendant. The defense counsel objected and moved for \u00e1 mistrial immediately after Officer Madrid\u2019s improper response. The court below should have granted the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Defendant also claims that the' court below committed reversible error when it \u25a0allowed E. E. Rekos, a Chief in the Narcotics Division of the State Liquor Office and an investigating officer herein to remain in the courtroom at the request of the prosecutor after the court had excluded witnesses from the courtroom. The defendant claims that although Rekos was not called to the witness stand, he had the opportunity to relate to the state witnesses any testimony of witnesses who did testify. However there is no evidence that he did so. Defendant\u2019s claim is without merit. It was a matter of discretion for the trial court. State v. Armenia, 98 Ariz. 152, 402 P.2d 571 (June 9, 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The defendant also claims that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict at the close of the state\u2019s case, charging that the evidence demonstrated that the defendant was entrapped by the government officers. The defendant improperly places reliance on Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (.1958) to support this proposition. Although under the peculiar f\u00e1cts of that cas\u00e9, the United States Supreme Court found there was entrapment the court said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">\u201c * * * the fact that government agents \u2018merely afford' opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense does not\u2019 constitute entrapment. Entrapment occurs only when the criminal conduct was \u2018the product of the <em>creative </em>activity\u2019 of, law-enforcement officials.\u201d (Italics in the'original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>In State v. Hernandez, 96 Ariz. 28, 391 P.2d 586 we said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">\u201c * * * a crucial element of the defense of entrapment is that the intent to commit the crime must not arise in the mind of the accused. * * * the defense of entrapment does not arise where one is ready to commit the offense given the opportunity, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The court was correct in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">However for the reasons above stated judgment reversed and remanded for new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-7\">STRUCKMEYER, V.
