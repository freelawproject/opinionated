The trial court directed a verdict of not guilty of first degree murder and the jury returned a verdict of murder in the second degree on his plea of not guilty. From the judgment and sentence thereon he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">On March 24, 1962, defendant and his wife resided at 1440 South 41st Place in the City of Phoenix. At about the hour of 12:30 a. m. several neighbors were awakened by Mrs. Schantz screaming. They looked into the kitchen window of the Schantz\u2019 residence and saw the defendant and his wife struggling over a butcher knife held by the defendant. The deceased in the course of the struggle fell to the floor and defendant was observed stabbing her repeatedly in the back and neck. Thereafter, defendant seized a ten-inch cast-iron skillet and beat deceased about the head and body. When the police arrived, they found the deceased on the floor, cut and bleeding, and the skillet broken into pieces. At that time, defendant\u2019s demeanor was described as calm and a little talkative. Defendant pleaded not guilty and subsequently, pursuant to Rule 192, Rules of Criminal Procedure, 17 A.R.S., served a written notice of his intention to show in evidence that at the time of the offense he was insane or mentally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Doctor Maier Tuchler, a psychiatrist, was called by defendant and he testified that he had examined defendant on numerous occasions since the offense and gave as his opinion that defendant at the time of the offense did not know the nature and significance of his acts and did not know right from wrong. He further testified that defendant had total amnesia for the events related to the homicide and that his efforts to bring back defendant\u2019s memory were unsuccessful; that an amnesia state exists where the emotional state predominates without the conscious awareness of the individual; that actions in such a state are outside the person\u2019s deliberate volitional conscious awareness. .... . \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>At the conclusion of the evidence, defendant moved that the jury be directed to return a verdict of acquittal. The motion was granted as to the charge of first degree murder and denied as to second degree and manslaughter. The issues of deliberation and premeditation arising out of the charge of first degree murder could have been submitted to the jury since the jury was not compelled to accept the uncontradicted opinion testimony of an expert, Sapp v. Lifrand, 44 Ariz. 321, 36 P.2d 794, and see Commonwealth v. Carroll, 412 Pa. 525, 194 A.2d 911, nor the uncorroborated testimony of a party to an action, Rowe v. Goldberg Film Delivery Lines, Inc., 50 Ariz. 349, 72 P.2d 432. However, where the trial judge has a conscientious conviction that all the elements of an offense have not been established beyond a reasonable doubt, e. g., premeditation or deliberation, he has not only the right but the duty to direct a verdict of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The defendant then proposed that there be submitted to the jury his requested instruction No. 30<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which the trial court refused. Defendant thus raises the question whether the evidence of Dr. Tuchler, that the defendant\u2019s acts were without his deliberate volitional conscious awareness, may be considered by the jury to negate malice aforethought. The issue presented requires a somewhat extended examination of the law of homicide as it exists in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">The legislature has prescribed a simple and complete system of laws for the handling of homicides in Arizona. It presents no paradoxes or dilemmas although the application of the facts to the law is not always simple or easy. By A.R.S. \u00a7 13-451 et seq., the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought is murder. The killing is unlawful if it is not excused by \u00a7 13-460 or justified under \u00a7\u00a7 13^161 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>13-462.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Malice aforethought is mor\u00e9 than ill will, hatred or revenge. It means the intent to kill without legal justification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> State v. Hudson, 85 Ariz. <em>77, </em>331 P.2d 1092; Bennett v. State, 15 Ariz. 58, 136 P. 276.</p>\n<p id=\"AGT\">If the killing is wilful, deliberate and premeditated or committed during the perpetration of certain specified crimes, 1. e., robbery, it is of the first degree. If the. unlawful killing lacks wilfulness, deliberation or premeditation and is not in the commission of one of the specified crimes but if accompanied by malice aforethought, it is murder of the second degree. If an unlawful killing lacks the element of malice aforethought, it is still the lesser offense known as manslaughter which if committed upon\u2019 a sudden quarrel or heat of passion is known as voluntary manslaughter. It may be \u2019 here observed that, while technically manslaughter is not a degree of murder, in' substance they, are different degrees of the single crime of criminal homicide, Chisley v. State, 202 Md. 87, 95 A.2d 577; State v. Hutter, 145 Neb. 798, 18 N.W.2d 203; and see Rhea v. Territory, 3 Okl.Cr. 230, 105 P. 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u25a0 Murder of the first degree is punishable by death or imprisonment in the State Prison for life at the discretion of the jury trying the person charged or the judge upon a plea of guilty. Murder in the second degree is punishable by imprisonment in the State Prison for not less than ten years, and a conviction for manslaughter subjects the accused to imprisonment in the State Prison for not to exceed ten years. A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-452, 13-154 and 13-456.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">In the past, Arizona has uniformly; adhered to what is known as the Rule of M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case as the test for criminal insanity. State v. Preis, 89 Ariz. 336, 362 P.2d 660, cert. den. 368 U.S. 934, 82 S.Ct. 372, 7 L.Ed.2d 196; State v. Crose, 88 Ariz. 389, 357 P.2d 136; State v. Coey, 82 Ariz. 133, 309 P.2d 260; State v. Eisenstein, 72. Ariz. 320, 235 P.2d 1011; State v. Macias, 60 Ariz. 93, 131 P.2d 810; Burgunder v. State, 55 Ariz. 411, 103 P.2d 256; Judd v. State, 41 Ariz. 176, 16 P.2d 720; Foster v. State, 37 Ariz. 281, 294 P. 268; Lauterio v. State, 23 Ariz. 15, 201 P. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">In 1843, in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, one Daniel M\u2019Naghten killed a man with a shot intend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ed for Sir Robert Peel. M\u2019Naghten was tried for murder. The Queen v. M\u2019Naghten, 4 St.Tr.(N.S-) 847. It was established that he was laboring under an insane delusion and in a seriously disordered mental condition. He was found not guilty under an instruction which told the jury to acquit him if he \u201chad not the use of his understanding, so as to know he was doing a wrong or wicked act.\u201d The House of Lords, 10 Clark &amp; Fin. 200, 8 Eng. Reprint 718, put certain questions to the judges who answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">\u201c[T]o establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the acf-, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the' act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.\u201d 8 Eng. Reprint at p. 722.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">This was in substance the test of legal insanity as it was known to the common law of England. See Rex v. Arnold, 16 Howell St.Tr. 695, 764 (1724).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">This test of legal insanity has two elements. An accused must have had at the time of the commission of the criminal act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">(1) Such a defect of reason as not to know the nature and quality of the act, <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">(2) If he did know, that he did' not know he was doing what was wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">; Where insanity is an issue, the' burden of the State is to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the converse; that is,-that the defendant knew the nature and quality of his act <em>and </em>that he knew that what he was doing was wrong. Whereas the M\u2019Naghten test for criminal responsibility involves a defect in perception or cognition, the requested instruction permits the jury to find the defendant not guilty of second degree murder if he was suffering from a mental .impairment, defect, disorder, or deficiency so as to be incapable of entertaining malice .aforethought, the intent to kill. This adds a third element, defect in volition.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">The defendant states that the principle embodied in the requested instruction \u201chas been variously referred to as the \u2018doctrine of diminished responsibility,\u2019 \u2018doctrine of partial responsibility,\u2019 \u2018partial insanity,\u2019 and otherwise.\u201d But whatever name may be used, in this appeal we take it to mean mental derangement distinguishable from the cognitive insanity as understood in the common law and contemplated by the rule of M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case. The practical result is that in the case of first degree murder the jury could consider defects in the volitional processes to determine the lack of deliberation and premeditation and, as here, in the case of second degree murder, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>lack of malice aforethought necessary to establish the unlawful killing as murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Defendant urges that the Model Penal Code of the American Law Institute, by \u00a7 4.02(1), Proposed Official Draft, May 1962, supports his position. That section provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u201cEvidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect is admissible whenever it is relevant to prove that the defendant did or did not have a state of mind which is an element of the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">To determine the propriety of the evidence introduced \u00a7 4.02(1) must be examined in the light of \u00a7 4.01, \u201cMental Disease or Defect Excluding Responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsW\">\u201c(1) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct <em>or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">Section 4.01 provides, as its first condition, that there is no criminal responsibility where the defendant lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. This is essentially a restatement of the second condition recognized by the Rule of M\u2019Naghten, that the accused did not know he was doing what was wrong. It is the italicized portion of the Model Penal Code which adds a new element heretofore not found in this state; that is, if, because of a mental' disease or defect, an accused lacks the capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, he is relieved of criminal responsibility. This test relieves an accused of criminal responsibility for disease or defects in the volitional processes of the human mind whereas M\u2019Naghten relieves of criminal responsibility only if there are defects in the perceptive or cognitive proc\u00e9sses.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">This is another of the various formulation's of the irresistible impulse rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u25a0 We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>note that originally an alternative formulation to \u00a7 4.01 was submitted in this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\"><em>\u201cA </em>person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct * * * he * * * is in such state that the prospect of conviction and punishment cannot constitute a significant restraining influence upon him.\u201d Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft 1956, Article 4, p. 27.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In the comment to Section 4.01, Tentative Draft of 1956, also is found this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\u201c3. The draft accepts the view that any effort to exclude the non-deterrables from strictly penal sanctions must take account of the impairment of volitional capacity no less than of impairment of cognition; and that this result should be achieved directly in the formulation of the test, rather than left to mitigation in the application of M\u2019Naghten. It also accepts the criticism of the \u2018irresistible impulse\u2019 formulation as inept in so far at it may be impliedly restricted to sudden, spontaneous acts as distinguished from insane propulsions that are accompanied by brooding or reflection. See e. g., Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, Report (1953) par. 314, p. 110.\u201d American Law Institute, Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft 1956, p. 157.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">This Court rejected the irresistible impulse rule in State v. Macias,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> supra. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">\u201cThe great majority of the states accept the principles laid down in th\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>M\u2019Naghten case, supra, as being correct. * * <em>* </em>The majority of the jurisdictions which have adopted a contrary rule apparently base it upon the hypothesis', unworkable practically even if plausible in theory, that the accused may have no power to <em>act </em>as between right and wrong, even though he may have <em>knowledge </em>thereof.\u201d 60 Ariz. 93, 98, 131 P.2d 810, 812.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The defendant urges that the principle enunciated in the Model Penal Code has been accepted by our neighboring state of New Mexico, in State v. Padilla, 66 N.M. 289, 347 P.2d 312, 78 A.L.R.2d 908, and indeed it has. However, New Mexico, prior to Padilla, had committed itself to the irresistible impulse rule. See State v. White, 58 N.M. 324, 270 P.2d 727. Defendant also points to the recent decisions in the State of California which he urges supports his views. See People v. Gorshen, 51 Cal.2d 716, 336 P.2d 492, and People v. Wells, 33 Cal.2d 330, 202 P.2d 53, cert. den. 338 U.S. 836, 70 S.Ct. 43, 94 .L.Ed. 510. California permits the introduction of psychiatric opinion that the accused was suffering from a mental disease or defect negativing a state of mind. It, however, has refused to adopt the formulation of the Model Penal Code, \u00a7 4.01, adhering to the M\u2019Naghten Rule as the test for criminal responsibility because of insanity, People v. Nash, 52 Cal.2d 36, 338 P.2d 416, and approving their former opinions holding that if M\u2019Naghten is to be changed the arguments should be made to the legislature rather than the courts. Whatever may he the theoretical merits in the medical evaluation of the volitional aspects of the human mind, we, like California, do not accept \u00a7 4.01 of the Model Penal Code as the test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>for criminal responsibility in this state. This brings us to the reasons we reject the defendant\u2019s requested instruction No. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">As stated, the legislature has laid down a complete system to determine the unlawfulness of a killing and punishment dependent upon the circumstances surrounding the commission of the act. The defendant argues that if the jury had been instructed in accordance with his requested instruction, it could have appropriately reduced the offense of second degree murder to that of manslaughter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By A.R.S. \u00a7 13-451, where the killing is unlawful, malice is express \u201cwhen there is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature\u201d and <em>\u201cIt is implied when no considerable provocation appears </em>or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Malice may even be implied where an actual intent not to kill exists; as for example, where a shot is fired into another\u2019s leg with the intent to do bodily harm. If the person dies, as from blood poisoning, and there was no adequate provocation for the shot, it is murder. So it has been held that one who chokes another with no in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>tention to kill is guilty of second degree murder where death unintentionally results. Commonwealth v. Marshall, 287 Pa. 512, 135 A. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The legislature has provided that malice shall be implied where there is an unlawful killing with no considerable provocation. It has not recognized a disease or defect of mind in which volition does not exist \u2014 even if some psychiatrists do \u2014 -as a defense to a prosecution for murder. Volition, the ability to determine or choose a course of action, is implied and the killing can be manslaughter only if it is established that the will not to kill has been overcome by adequate provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">To instruct as defendant proposes would present conscientious jurors with an almost unresolvable dilemma. If they found the facts to be that there was no considerable provocation sufficient to reduce the crime to manslaughter, they would, under the law of this state, be required to find malice and return a verdict of guilty of second degree murder, but the evidence is from credible medical experts that defendant cannot be guilty of second degree murder because there was in fact no malice. (Nor could the jury return a verdict of manslaughter because the circumstances of the killing did not present adequate provocation.) Jurors are thus put to this choice: Either to violate their oaths as jurors and disregard the law returning a verdict of not guilty; or close their minds to the evidence of the accused\u2019s principal and perhaps only defense, evidence they may honestly believe, and return a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Section 4.02(1), relied on by the defendant as the basis for his requested instruction No. 30 is part of a comprehensive scheme established by Article 4 of the Model Penal Code (Proposed Official Draft, May, 1962). The code reflects the considered judgment of some of the best informed men of this country. Among other things, Article 4 provides that whenever the defendant has filed a notice of intention to rely on the defense of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility, the court shall appoint at least one qualified psychiatrist to examine and report upon the mental condition of the defendant and to that end he may be committed to a hospital for the purpose of the examination for a period up to sixty days. See \u00a7 4.05. By .\u00a7 4.08, when a defendant is acquitted on the ground of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility, the court shall order him committed to custody in an appropriate institution for care and treatment from which he may only be released when he is without danger to himself or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">We are satisfied that Article 4 represents a desirable approach to the handling of mental defectives with criminal tendencies but it is obvious that this Court does not have the authority under the Constitution.of the state to promulgate it as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the law of this jurisdiction. We are hesitant about adopting portions piecemeal. As is illustrated by the problem arising in this case: If we accept defendant\u2019s proposal and decide that psychiatric evidence of a mental disease or defect is relevant to prove that a defendant did not have a state of mind which is an element of the offense, the jury would be put to the compulsion of releasing upon society many dangerous criminals who obviously should be placed under confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">We conclude the court below did not err in refusing the defendant\u2019s requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Defendant assigns as error the admission of testimony of one Dr. Paul Bindelglas, a psychiatrist. Prior to the trial, the State made a motion requesting the court to allow two state psychiatrists to examine the defendant. On the day set for the hearing of the motion, the county attorney withdrew it apparently recognizing that there was no authority for such action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the same day, Dr. Bindelglas was sent to the defendant\u2019s home by the county attorney without notice to the defendant or his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Thereafter, he was called as a witness at the trial on rebuttal and testified as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">\u201cQ BY [PROSECUTING ATTORNEY] : You went for the purpose of performing a psychiatric examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">\u201cQ Did you ask him to take a psychiatric examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">\u201cQ And did you tell him you were from the County Attorney\u2019s office ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-14\">\u201cA Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-15\">\u201cQ And did he agree to a psychiatric examination ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-16\">\u201cA He did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-17\">The defendant objected to the testimony of Dr. Bindelglas \u201con the basis that the refusal by the defendant to permit the examination is immaterial, irrelevant to any issue in this case, that it does not tend to prove or disprove any fact or issue in this case, * * Defendant continues here to argue that the refusal of the psychiatric examination has no possible materiality or relevancy to the issue of sanity, but we think otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-19\">There is an inference arising out of the failure of the State to call expert medical witnesses in rebuttal that the defendant\u2019s evidence as to insanity is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>because uncontradicted. We are of the view that where a defendant files a notice of reliance on insanity and thereafter offers expert testimony based upon an examination to which he submittted himself the refusal of an examination by competent medical experts representing the State may be shown to negative that inference. In holding this was not error, we do not wish to approve the tactics of the county attorney in sending a psychiatrist to the defendant\u2019s residence unknown to defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\">Defendant further urges, assuming that the foregoing evidence was properly admitted, that he should have been allowed to rebut it. Defendant proposed to establish on surrebuttal by recalling Dr. Tuchler that two doctors, qualified medical experts in the field of psychiatry, were present in the courtroom when the defendant testified on direct examination, cross-examination and during his examination. It is defendant\u2019s position that this testimony should have been admitted for the limited purpose of refuting the inference of Dr. Bindelglas\u2019s testimony that the State was not afforded the opportunity of examining the defendant in order to refute Dr. Tuchler\u2019s testimony. We presume at this point that the State was attempting to follow the procedures found acceptable in State v. Burgunder, supra. There the State\u2019s medical expert sat in the courtroom and then testified that he was able to conclude the defendant was sane at the time of the commission of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The inference sought to be drawn from the presence of two doctors, psychiatrists, in the courtroom is highly speculative. It is within the discretion of the trial court to refuse to admit the proposed evidence from which the inference is sought to be drawn. A statement of the proper rule is appropriately set forth in Smitherman v. State, 33 Ala.App. 316, 33 So.2d 396, where the court approved the quotation from an earlier Alabama case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201c \u2018As a general rule, facts are deemed relevant which logically tend to prove or disprove the fact in issue, or which afford a reasonable inference or shed light upon the matter contested; and facts bearing so remotely upon or collaterally to the issue that they afford merely conjectural inference concerning the facts in issue should not be admitted in evidence.\u2019 \u201d 33 So.2d 396, 398.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The proposed testimony of Dr. Tuchler would, at most, raise only conjectural inference of the facts sought to be established. The proper method would have been to call as witnesses the two doctors to testify whether they did or did not have a sufficient opportunity to form an opinion concerning the defendant\u2019s mental capacity at the time of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Finally, defendant argues that the court below should have granted a mistrial based on improper arguments of the deputy county attorney. Defendant first points to this argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">\u201cAnd I ask you on behalf of the people of the State of Arizona to return a verdict of guilty of second degree, murder in the second degree, <em>because you, ladies and gentlemen, establish the standard in this community by which we shall live.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\u201cIt is not the lawyers. It is not the judges. It is not the police. The police just get the evidence. It is not the law. The law is just a book, it is on paper. The law never comes alive and becomes applicable until you take and apply it.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">At this point, counsel for defendant objected, assigning as his reason, that the jury \u201cis not to set a standard in the community\u201d and the court sustained the objection. This, of course, in effect, told the jury that the deputy county attorney was incorrect in his argument on the point to which the court sustained the objection. Immediately thereafter, counsel concluded his argument with this statement, thereby plainly clarifying and limiting the meaning of his prior statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, it is not the police that enforce the law. They make the investigations. It is not the lawyers. It is not the judges.

It is the general rule that heat of passion, induced by provocation sufficient to arouse the passion of a reasonable man, will reduce a homicide from murder to voluntary manslaughter. This rule, unlike the one just discussed, is truly a rule of mitigation. Heat of passion reduces the crime because \u2018the law, out of indulgence to the frailty of human nature, or rather, in recognition of the laws upon which human nature is constituted, very properly regards the offense as of a less heinous character than murder, and gives it the designation of manslaughter.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">\u201cIt has been suggested that the heat of passion rule should be liberalized so as to take account of the abnormal irritability of neurotic and other disordered offenders wlio are not so insane as to be irresponsible. In other words, the adequacy of the provoking circumstances should be judged not merely by an objective standard of reasonableness, but also by the subjective reaction of the individual to those circumstances, so that the same objective irritation which may not be sufficient to provoke a reasonable man may nevertheless be held sufficient in the case of certain psychotic or neurotic individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">\u201cThis theory has been accepted in Tennessee, but it has been rejected elsewhere in the United States and in England.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-13\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-14\">\u201cThe reason courts have given for refusing to take into consideration abnormal irritability and passion, caused by mental disorder, is that the standard by which the law judges the adequacy of the provocation, is wholly objective.
