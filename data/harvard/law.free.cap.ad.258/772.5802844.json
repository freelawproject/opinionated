Memorandum: Plaintiff sued defendants for legal services. Defendants answered admitting liability and offering judgment for a certain amount. Thereafter, plaintiff served an amended complaint wherein he demanded only equitable relief. Upon defendants\u2019 motion made before answer, an order was granted which dismissed the amended complaint upon the ground that it failed to state <em>&amp; </em>cause of action. The order contained no provision for leave to plead anew. Prior to the entry of this order, plaintiff \u2014 upon motion brought on by an order to show cause \u2014 obtained, over defendants\u2019 objection, an order resettling the previous order by adding thereto a provision that the dismissal was on condition that the original pleadings stand as the pleadings in the action and that the cause retain its place upon the trial calendar. The defendants appeal from the order of resettlement. The Civil Practice Act does not authorize the attaching of such conditions where a pleading is dismissed for insufficiency. The judge, however, could have resettled his order of dismissal by inserting therein a provision permitting plaintff to serve a further amended complaint. All concur. (The portion of the order appealed from provides that the dismissal of plaintiff's complaint be upon condition that the cause remain at issue, in an action to recover for legal services.) Present \u2014 Crosby, Lewis, Cunningham, Taylor and Dowling, JJ. [170 Misc. 32.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
