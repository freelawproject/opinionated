Prichard, the respondent, a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, in which it was alleged that he violated Rules 1.15 (Safekeeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Property);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 8.4 (Misconduct),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Appendix: Rules of Professional Conduct of the Maryland Rules, Maryland Rule 16-812, Maryland Rules 16-603 (Duty to Maintain Account)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; 16-604 (Trust Account \u2014 Required De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>posit)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Maryland Code (1989, 2000 Replacement Volume) \u00a7\u00a7 10-802(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 10-306<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. We referred the matter, pursuant to Rule 16-752(a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to the Honorable Pamela L. North of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, for hearing pursuant to Rule 16-757(c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The respondent, having failed to respond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>to the Petition, an order of default, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2\u2014613(b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> setting a trial date more than thirty days subsequently, was entered against him. Although notified, as required by Rule 2-613(c),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that the order of default had been entered, the respondent did not move to vacate the order, as required by Rule 2-613(d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On the day set for the hearing, the hearing judge conducted a hearing, after which she issued a Memorandum Of Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law, making findings of fact and drawing conclusions of law in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-757(c),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u201cThe Respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar on June 17, 1976. Pursuant to an Order of the Court of Appeals filed May 27, 2003, he was indefinitely suspended by consent from practicing law in this State, retroactive to May 1, 2003. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Prichard, </em>375 Md. 1, 824 A.2d 966 (2003). The Respondent has not petitioned for reinstatement from the previously entered indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u201cThe legal representation that is the subject of the current disciplinary action began in September 2001, when Kenneth and Melissa Garrison (husband and wife) retained the Respondent to represent them in connection with personal injury claims related to a motor vehicle accident in which the Garrisons had been involved on September 6, 2001. On September 11, 2001, Mr. and Mrs. Garrison signed retainer agreements employing the Respondent on a contingent fee basis. The retainer agreements signed by the Garrisons provided for the Respondent to receive an attorney\u2019s fee equal to thirty-three and one-third (33 1/3) percent of any gross recovery or settlement in each client\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u201cAllstate Insurance Company (Allstate) was the insurance carrier for the party against whom the Garrisons asserted personal injury claims. In the spring of 2002, settlements of the Garrisons\u2019 claims were reached in the following amounts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnY\">Kenneth Garrison $9,300.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ara\">Melissa Garrison $9,000.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">On May 14, 2002, Allstate issued separate settlement checks to Mr. and Mrs. Garrison in the above amounts. Each settlement check was made payable jointly to the claimant and the Respondent. Allstate mailed the checks to the Respondent, along with releases to be executed by the Garrisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u201cAt the time of settlement, Mr. and Mrs. Garrison each had unpaid bills for medical treatment associated with injuries they sustained in the September 6, 2001 accident. Kenneth Garrison had outstanding balances due to the following entities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>1. North Arundel Hospital $ 479.19</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">2. Cohen and Pushkin, M.D., P.A. $ 750.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">3. Atlantic Rehab, Inc. $3,475.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Melissa Garrison similarly had outstanding balances due in the following amounts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">1. North Arundel Hospital $ 315.89</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">2. Cohen and Pushkin, M.D., P.A. $ 1,775.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">3. Atlantic Rehab, Inc. $ 1,665.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">\u201cUpon receipt of the Garrisons\u2019 settlement checks, the Respondent arranged for Melissa Garrison to meet him and to accompany him to a liquor store which also offered a check cashing service. Mrs. Garrison and the Respondent endorsed the back of her settlement check and cashed it on or about May 16, 2002. The Respondent prepared a handwritten distribution sheet for Melissa Garrison, listing how the cash proceeds from her settlement check were to be allocated. The distribution sheet prepared by the Respondent indicates he received an attorney\u2019s fee of $2,500.00 (\u201creduced $500.00\u201d). The Respondent listed the amounts of Mrs. Garrison\u2019s outstanding medical bills. He retained a sufficient amount of cash to pay off each of those bills in full. The Respondent retained cash in the amount of $3,338.89 from the proceeds of Melissa Garrison\u2019s settlement check and represented to Mrs. Garrison that such funds would be used to pay the medical bills listed on the handwritten distribution sheet. The distribution sheet reflects a net balance of $3,161.11 to be distributed to the client. Mrs. Garrison acknowledges she received cash in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">\u201cKenneth Garrison endorsed the back of his settlement check and turned the check over to the Respondent. On or about June 15, 2002, Mr. Garrison\u2019s check was negotiated at a branch of The Bank of Glen Burnie. The Respondent prepared a typed distribution sheet which was provided to Mr. Garrison. The distribution sheet indicates the Respondent received an attorney\u2019s fee of $2,500.00 (\u201creduced $600.00\u201d)'. As on Mrs. Garrison\u2019s distribution sheet, the Respondent listed the amounts of Kenneth Garrison\u2019s outstanding medical bills as deductions from the \u201cgross proceeds\u201d of $9,300.00. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Respondent retained funds in the amount of $4,704.19 from the proceeds of Kenneth Garrison\u2019s settlement check for the stated purpose of paying off the medical bills listed on Mr. Garrison\u2019s distribution sheet. The distribution sheet reflects a net balance of $2,095.81 to be distributed to the client. Mr. Garrison acknowledges he received cash in that amount from the Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u201cThe Respondent did not issue any payment to Cohen and Pushkin, M.D., P.A., to satisfy two separate account balances in the amounts of $1,000.00 and $775.00 owed by Melissa Garrison, despite retaining $1,775.00 from Mrs. Garrison\u2019s settlement proceeds for that purpose. Similarly, the Respondent did not pay off Kenneth Garrison\u2019s account balance of $750.00 to Cohen and Pushkin, M.D., P.A., despite retaining funds in that amount from Mr. Garrison\u2019s settlement proceeds for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u201cThe Respondent did not issue any payment to Atlantic Rehab, Inc. to satisfy Melissa Garrison\u2019s outstanding account balance of $1,665.00, despite retaining funds (listed in the amount of $1,248.00) from Mrs. Garrison\u2019s settlement proceeds for that purpose. Similarly, the Respondent did not issue any payment to Atlantic Rehab, Inc. to satisfy Kenneth Garrison\u2019s account balance of $3,475.00, despite retaining funds in that amount from Mr. Garrison\u2019s settlement proceeds for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u201cMrs. Garrison testified she has been unable to determine whether the amounts she and her husband owed to North Arundel Hospital, for which the Respondent also withheld funds from their settlements, have been paid. As of the date of the hearing in this Court, North Arundel Hospital had not initiated any collection efforts against the Garrisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u201cThroughout the time he represented the Garrisons, the Respondent did not maintain an attorney trust account, as defined in Maryland Rule 16-602c, for the deposit of funds he received as an attorney for the intended benefit of clients and/or third persons. Having no such account, the Respondent did not deposit all or any portion of the Garrisons\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>settlement proceeds in an attorney trust account at an approved financial institution when he received such proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u201cOn April 2, 2003, Bar Counsel received a written complaint from Melissa Garrison setting forth the underlying facts supporting the professional misconduct charges in this case. By a letter to the Respondent dated April 16, 2003, mailed to the Respondent\u2019s only known address, the office of Bar Counsel forwarded a copy of Mrs. Garrison\u2019s complaint to the Respondent and requested that the Respondent respond in writing to that complaint within ten days. The Respondent did not respond at all to Bar Counsel\u2019s lawful demand for information.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u201cBy receiving and accepting the Garrisons\u2019 settlement funds, which were intended in whole or in part for the benefit of a client or third person, when he did not maintain any attorney trust account, the Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-603. It follows therefrom that the funds, including cash, the Respondent received and accepted to be delivered in whole or in part to a client or third person were not deposited in an attorney trust account at an approved financial institution. The Respondent therefore violated Maryland Rule 16-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u201cThe funds withheld by the Respondent from the settlement proceeds of Kenneth and Melissa Garrison for payment to third party medical providers constituted \u201ctrust money\u201d as that term is defined in the Maryland Code, Business Occupations and Professions Article, \u00a7 10\u2014301(d). By accepting trust money when he did not maintain an attorney trust account for the deposit of such money, the Respondent violated \u00a7 10-302(a) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. Furthermore, the Respondent knowingly and willfully used such trust money for a purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money was entrusted to him. By doing so, he violated \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u201cThe Respondent failed to hold property of clients or third persons that was in his possession in connection with a representation separate from his own property, including monetary funds which were not kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules. The Respondent thus violated Rule 1.15(a) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC). By failing to deliver funds that the Garrisons\u2019 third party medical providers were entitled to receive, the Respondent also violated MRPC 1.15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u201cThe Respondent fraudulently and willfully appropriated or secreted money held in a fiduciary capacity contrary to the requirements of his trust responsibility. In so doing, the Respondent engaged in criminal conduct including, but not necessarily limited to, the offense of \u201cEmbezzlement \u2014 Fraudulent misappropriation by fiduciary,\u201d as set forth in the Maryland Code, Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 7-113. The Respondent\u2019s dishonest and fraudulent actions with respect to the Garrisons\u2019 settlement funds represent professional misconduct that violated MRPC 8.4(b) &amp; (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u201cFinally, the Respondent violated MRPC 8.1(b) by failing to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority (Bar Counsel\u2019s April 16, 2003 letter seeking a response to Melissa Garrison\u2019s complaint). Although not a basis for the MRPC 8.1(b) violation, this Court also notes that the Respondent has not responded in any fashion to the disciplinary charges contained in the petition filed by the Attorney Grievance Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The petitioner has not taken any exceptions to the hearing court\u2019s findings and conclusions. In its Petitioner\u2019s Recommendation for Sanction, it urges disbarment as the appropriate sanction. In support of that recommendation, the petitioner reminds the Court of the respondent\u2019s rather recent, May 27, 2003, and continuing, indefinite suspension; the finding by the hearing court that the respondent \u201cengaged in serious professional misconduct involving misappropriation of trust money that should have been paid to third party medical providers out of the proceeds of the Garrisons\u2019 personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>settlements;\u201d that the respondent did not maintain an attorney trust account for the deposit of the funds retained; and that the respondent was found to have used, knowingly and willfully, trust funds for a purpose other than that for which the funds were entrusted to him. In addition, the respondent did not respond to the petitioner\u2019s lawful demand for information.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">As indicated, the respondent neither responded to the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action nor appeared at any time in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We accept the petitioner\u2019s recommendation. The respondent has misappropriated trust funds, \u201can act infected with deceit and dishonesty,\u201d and he has not presented, nor even attempted to present, \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances,\u201d that would, or could, justify a sanction more lenient than disbarment. Disbarment, therefore, inexorably must follow. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Daskalopoulos, </em>383 Md. 375, 384-85, 859 A.2d 653, 658 (2004); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
