As Officer Williams, who was dressed in plain clothes, walked toward the group, one group member, a man wearing a gray sweat suit with a red stripe and later identified as Jesse Spain, Jr. (referred to as \u201cSpain\u201d or Petitioner subsequently), approached the officer and asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Interpreting this remark as ah inquiry about the possible sale of illegal narcotics, Officer Williams, trained and experienced in matters involving street level narcotics distribution, responded, \u201cWhat do you have?\u201d Spain responded, \u201cPve got some pills.\u201d Officer Williams interpreted this statement to indicate that Spain was offering for sale heroin in gel cap form.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Spain then tapped the shoulder of another man in the group (later identified as Petitioner\u2019s father, Jesse Spain, Sr.), who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>advised Spain, \u201cI\u2019m going to take [Officer Williams] up the street.\u201d As Officer Williams and Spain, Sr. walked northbound on Monroe Street towards the 1900 block of West Fairmount Avenue, Spain, Sr. stated that he had \u201ca kid on a bike, who\u2019s got some pills on him.\u201d After walking approximately 90 feet further, Spain, Sr. \u201cwhistled out.\u201d A young man on a bicycle approached them. Officer Williams recognized the young man on the bicycle as Juan Wilson, whom Officer Williams previously had arrested for street level narcotics distribution. Wilson stopped his bicycle in front of Officer Williams and removed from his pocket a clear plastic bag that contained several gel caps filled with what was later stipulated to be heroin powder. Wilson, at this point, recognized Officer Williams and began to ride slowly away.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Officer Williams identified himself as a police officer and arrested Wilson. Meanwhile, Spain, Sr. fled through an alley on West Fairmount Avenue. When a patrol car and wagon responded to the scene of the narcotics transaction, the original group of men on the corner of West Baltimore Street and North Monroe Street dispersed. As Officer Williams was arresting Wilson, he observed Spain walk westbound on West Baltimore Street out of his sight. A few minutes later, as he was riding in a police wagon, Officer Williams arrested Spain, whom he found standing on the front steps of a residence on West Baltimore Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">By criminal information filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Spain was charged with various violations relating to his role in the drug transaction on 3 February involving Officer Williams.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At Spain\u2019s jury trial, the State\u2019s sole wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ness was Officer Williams,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who testified as both a fact witness and an expert on the packaging, identification, and distribution of street level narcotics in Baltimore City. The defense consisted of only one witness, Spain\u2019s sister, Dawn Spain, who testified that she spoke with Spain earlier on 3 February and he told her that he planned to attend a Super Bowl party later that evening at his grandfather\u2019s house, which happened to be near the scene of the narcotics transaction. Spain\u2019s defense at trial appeared to hinge on the contentions that Officer Williams was mistaken as to the encounter between himself and Officer Williams and that he was in no way involved in the narcotics transaction that followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Against this backdrop, the State\u2019s Attorney advocated during closing argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: The second point I wanted to make to you is that the Officer in this case \u2014 the Defense\u2019s argument is that Mr. Spain was outside his house. He was going to attend a Superbowl party and was buying beer. Part of what you have to determine is the credibility of the witnesses. The defense put on a witness who testified, and the State put on one witness, the Officer in this case. You have to weigh the credibility of each individual. Who has a motive to tell you the truth. The Officer in this case would have to engage in a lot of lying, in a lot of deception and a conspiracy of his own to come in here and tell you that what happened was not true. He would have to risk everything he has worked for. He would have to perjure himself on the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">THE COURT: Basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Reference to the Officer perjuring himself your Honor. It\u2019s as far as credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">THE COURT: Okay, well the jury understand^] that this of course is closing argument, and that they will [consider the statements to be] lawyers\u2019 arguments. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: So basically you have to determine who has the credibility. Who\u2019s telling you the truth. Is the Officer coming here and making up a story? What\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>his incentive to lie and frame Mr. Spain? The reality is that this Officer \u2014 they attempted to sell this Officer drugs on the street. They didn\u2019t know he was a police officer. He was out there trying to enforce the law. But, you have to understand that Officer Williams has no motive to lie, because he has everything to risk in this case. Because he doesn\u2019t have to go out and make up drug arrests. Because he has plenty of legitimate drug arrests. There\u2019s absolutely no incentive for him to come in here and tell a story about Mr. Spain. So is Mr. Spain the victim of circumstance? He was just taken up in front of his house, trying to attend a Superbowl party? That\u2019s the defense\u2019s theory in the case. You will ultimately have to decide who you want to believe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atl\">On 6 March 2003, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Spain timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed his conviction in an unreported opinion. He then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted, 383 Md. 256, 858 A.2d 1017 (2004), in order to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">Did the trial court properly exercise discretion in regulating the scope of closing argument when it allowed the State\u2019s Attorney to argue that the police officer in this case had no motive to lie and would risk his career by testifying falsely?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 722 A.2d 887 (1999), we outlined the \u201cgreat leeway\u201d attorneys are afforded in presenting closing arguments to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">The prosecutor is allowed liberal freedom of speech and may make any comment that is warranted by the evidence or inferences reasonably drawn therefrom. In this regard, [generally, ... the prosecuting attorney is as free to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ment legitimately and to speak fully, although harshly, on the accused\u2019s action and conduct if the evidence supports his comments, as is accused\u2019s counsel to comment on the nature of the evidence and the character of witnesses which the [prosecution] produces.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">While arguments of counsel are required to be confined to the issues in the cases on trial, the evidence and fair and reasonable deductions therefrom, and to arguments of opposing counsel, generally speaking, liberal freedom of speech should be allowed. There are no hard-and-fast limitations within which the argument of earnest counsel must be confined \u2014 no well-defined bounds beyond which the eloquence of an advocate shall not soar. He may discuss the facts proved or admitted in the pleadings, assess the conduct of the parties, and attack the credibility of witnesses. He may indulge in oratorical conceit or flourish and in illustrations and metaphorical allusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 429-80, 722 A.2d at 901-902 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Despite this lack of \u201chard-and-fast limitations\u201d on closing arguments, one technique in closing argument that consistently has garnered our disapproval, as infringing on a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, is when a prosecutor \u201cvouches\u201d for (or against) the credibility of a witness. <em>See, e.g., Walker v. State, </em>373 Md. 360, 403-04, 818 A.2d 1078, 1103-04 (2003) (finding improper vouching to have occurred where a prosecutor made assertions, based on personal knowledge, that a witness was lying). Vouching typically occurs when a prosecutor \u201cplacets] the prestige of the government behind a witness through personal assurances of the witness\u2019s veracity ... or suggests] that information not presented to the jury supports the witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Daas, </em>198 F.3d 1167, 1178 (9th Cir.1999) (citations omitted). The Supreme Court recognizes that prosecutorial vouching presents two primary dangers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">[S]uch comments can convey the impression that evidence not presented to the jury, but known to the prosecutor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>supports the charges against the defendant and can thus jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to be tried solely on the basis of the evidence presented to the jury; and the prosecutor\u2019s opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the Government and may induce the jury to trust the Government\u2019s judgment rather than its own view of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\"><em>U.S. v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 18-19, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1048, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In the present case, Spain argues that the prosecutor, during his closing argument, improperly vouched for the credibility of the State\u2019s sole witness, Officer Williams, by implying that the officer 1) did not have a motive to testify falsely, and 2) in fact had a motive to testify truthfully because to testify falsely would expose him to the penalties of perjury and lead to adverse consequences to his career as a police officer. Although we agree that the latter of the prosecutor\u2019s comments transcended the boundaries of proper argument, we conclude ultimately that those statements did not mislead or influence the jury unduly to the prejudice of Spain, and therefore constituted harmless error. <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 430-31, 722 A.2d at 902 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">No one likely would quarrel with the notion that assessing the credibility of witnesses during a criminal trial is often a transcendent factor in the factfinder\u2019s decision whether to convict or acquit a defendant. During opening and closing arguments, therefore, it is common and permissible generally for the prosecutor and defense counsel to comment on, or attack, the credibility of the witnesses presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Part of the analysis of credibility involves determining whether a witness has a motive or incentive not to tell the truth. <em>Cf. Pantazes v. State, </em>376 Md. 661, 680, 831 A.2d 432, 443 (2003) (describing as important the right to cross-examination because it allows a defendant to demonstrate to the factfinder a witness\u2019s bias, interest, or motive to testify falsely); <em>see also </em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u00a7 3:10 (MICPEL 2003).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Attorneys therefore feel compelled frequently to comment on the motives, or absence thereof, that a witness may have for testifying in a particular way, so long as those conclusions may be inferred from the evidence introduced and admitted at trial. <em>See, e.g., U.S. v. Walker, </em>155 F.3d 180, 187 (3rd Cir.1998) (finding that \u201cwhere a prosecutor argues that a witness is being truthful based on the testimony given at trial, and does not assure the jury that the credibility of the witness based on his own personal knowledge, the prosecutor is engaging in proper argument and is not vouching\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments about Officer Williams\u2019s absence of a motive to lie did not implicate any information that was outside the evidence presented at trial. When a prosecutor argues that a particular police officer lacks a motive to testify falsely, such comments do not bear directly on a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, but are merely an allusion to a lack of evidence presented by the defendant that the officer in this case possessed any motive to lie or devise a story implicating the defendant in criminal conduct. <em>See Walker, </em>155 F.3d at 187 (finding that \u201cprosecutorial comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that points to a lack of evidence in the record which supports a defendant\u2019s argument that the witness is not credible is proper so long as the comment does not constitute an assurance by the prosecutor that the witness is credible\u201d). The prosecutor\u2019s invitation for the jury to consider whether the officer had a motive to lie did not amount to improper vouching because the comments did not express any personal belief or assurance on the part of the prosecutor as to the credibility of the officer. <em>See, e.g., Reyes v. State, </em>700 So.2d 458, 460-61 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1997) (finding that statements such as, \u201cDid it appear as though [the police officer] was trying to lie?\u201d did not \u201cconstitute an expression of the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion as to the credibility of the witness\u201d). Nor did such comments, in isolation, explicitly invoke the prestige or office of the State or the particular police department or unit involved. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The prosecutor continued during closing argument that Officer Williams did not testify falsely because, if he were to do so, he would suffer adverse consequences to his career as a police officer. These comments were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Courts consistently have deemed improper comments made during closing argument that invite the jury to draw inferences from information that was not admitted at trial. <em>See Hill v. State, </em>355 Md. 206, 222, 734 A.2d 199, 208 (1999); <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 433, 722 A.2d at 903. Although the notion of adverse personnel implications flowing from perjured testimony by a police officer resonates at a common sense level, at no time during the trial scrutinized in the present case did the State introduce evidence from which it could be inferred ineluctably that Officer Williams risked his career or any of its benefits if he were to testify falsely. <em>See, e.g., U.S. v. Gallardo-Trapero, </em>185 F.3d 307, 320 (5th Cir.1999) (finding that a prosecutor\u2019s argument that agents of the federal government would not risk their careers by testifying falsely was improper because it referred to evidence not in the record); <em>U.S. v. Martinez, </em>981 F.2d 867, 871 (6th Cir.1992) (same); <em>U.S. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>Pungitore, </em>910 F.2d 1084, 1125 (3rd Cir.1990) (finding improper vouching and bolstering where there was \u201cno evidence backing the prosecutor\u2019s comments that the U.S. Attorneys and law enforcement officers could not have behaved as unscrupulously as defense counsel alleged without violating their oaths of office and jeopardizing their careers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Even if evidence had been admitted from which it could be inferred that a police officer would face serious employment consequences as a result of testifying falsely, we nonetheless would conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument constituted improper vouching because they also implied improperly that the witness\u2019s status as a police officer entitled him to greater credibility in the jury\u2019s eyes than any other category of witness about which the same might have been argued.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the State is free to highlight the incentive, or lack of incentive, of a witness to testify truthfully, courts consistently have held that it is improper to argue that a police officer may be deemed more credible simply because he or she is a police officer. See, <em>e.g., Fultz v. Whittaker, </em>187 F.Supp.2d. 695, 706 n. 5 (W.D.Ky. 2001); <em>Reyes, </em>700 So.2d at 461; <em>see also People v. Clark, </em>186 Ill.App.3d 109, 134 Ill.Dec. 138, 542 N.E.2d 138, 142-43 (1989) (stating that \u201c[i]t is established that a prosecutor may not argue that a witness is more credible because of his status as a police officer\u201d). By invoking unspecified, but assumed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>punitive consequences or sanctions that might result if a police officer testifies falsely, a prosecutor\u2019s arguments imply that a police officer has a greater reason to testify truthfully than any other witness with a different type of job. Although the factfinder generally is made aware that a witness who is a police officer is testifying as to events witnessed while on duty as a police officer, a prosecutor must be careful not to insinuate that the credibility of statements made in this capacity may be assessed at a level of scrutiny other than that given to all witnesses. <em>U.S. v. Boyd, </em>54 F.3d 868, 872 (D.C.Cir.1995); <em>see also People v. Allan, </em>192 A.D.2d 433, 596 N.Y.S.2d 793, 795 (N.Y.App.Div.1993) (holding that a \u201ctrial court\u2019s instruction that the jurors could take into account a witness\u2019s job, education, and status in the community in assessing credibility diluted its charge that the testimony of a police officer should be evaluated in the same way as that of any other witness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Although we find that the prosecutor\u2019s latter comments in this case improperly implied that a police officer be viewed by the factfinder as being more credible as a result of his or her status as a police officer, our inquiry does not end there. When statements made during closing argument stray beyond the outer realm of the latitude afforded prosecutors, we must inquire into the extent of any prejudice suffered by the defendant. As this Court in <em>Degren </em>stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">Not every improper remark [made by a prosecutor during closing argument], however, necessarily mandates reversal, and \u201c[w]hat exceeds the limits of permissible comment depends on the facts in each case.\u201d We have said that \u201c[reversal is only required where it appears that the remarks of the prosecutor actually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u201d This determination of whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments were prejudicial or simply rhetorical flourish lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. On review, an appellate court should not reverse the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>court unless that court clearly abused the exercise of its discretion and prejudiced the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">352 Md. at 430-31, 722 A.2d at 902 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">When assessing whether reversible error occurs when improper statements are made during closing argument, a reviewing court may consider several factors, including the severity of the remarks, the measures taken to cure any potential prejudice, and the weight of the evidence against the accused. <em>U.S. v. Melendez, </em>57 F.3d 238, 241 (2nd Cir.1995); <em>see also Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 232, 596 A.2d 1024, 1038 (1991) (finding that \u201c[i]n determining whether reversible error occurred, an appellate court must take into account \u2018(1) the closeness of the case, 2) the centrality of the issue affected by the error, and 3) the steps taken to mitigate the effects of the error\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to potential consequences to Officer Williams\u2019s career was an isolated event that did not pervade the entire trial. <em>See Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 425-26, 326 A.2d 707, 721 (1974) (rejecting the notion that one improper comment by the prosecutor during closing argument \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Mazile v. State, </em>798 So.2d 833, 834-35 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2001). We note also the likely diminution of prejudice from the prosecutor\u2019s comments as a result of the trial judge\u2019s contemporaneous reminder that they were only an attorney\u2019s argument, not evidence, as well as the pertinent instructions that the trial judge gave to the jury before sending it to deliberate. In response to the objection by defense counsel, the trial judge stated, \u201cOkay, well the jury understand^] that this of course is closing argument, and that they will [consider the statements to be] lawyers\u2019 arguments. Overruled.\u201d Although the trial judge did not acknowledge the comments as improper, nor did he explicitly instruct the jury to disregard the comments, he reminded the jury that the prosecutor\u2019s statements only should be considered as argument, not evidence. By emphasizing the argumentative nature of closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>arguments contemporaneously with the improper comments, the judge took some effort to eliminate the jury\u2019s potential confusion about what it just heard and therefore ameliorated any prejudice to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">More importantly, however, before jury deliberations began, the trial judge gave, among others, a jury instruction, based on Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions \u00a7 3:10, that emphasized the argumentative nature of closing arguments, and explicitly instructed the jurors as to relevant factors to consider and their roles as the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses presented at trial. Maryland courts long have subscribed to the presumption that juries are able to follow the instructions given to them by the trial judge, particularly where the record reveals no overt act on the jury\u2019s part to the contrary. <em>Wilson v. </em>State, 261 Md. 551, 570, 276 A.2d 214, 223-24 (1971); <em>Brooks v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 355, 360-61, 584 A.2d 82, 85 (1991). The jury in this case was instructed that it could reject or accept any testimony, and was to subject the credibility of all witnesses to an equivalent level of scrutiny. With these instructions in mind, we are confident that a reasonable jury would be able to fulfill properly its role and discern argument from evidence without undue prejudice to the defendant. <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 425-26, 445, 326 A.2d at 721-22, 732; <em>see also Young v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 121, 136-37, 510 A.2d 599, 607 (1986) (finding that jury instructions such as those in this case were sufficient to apprise the jury of its duty to weigh testimony of police officers under the same scrutiny as other witnesses). We could find in the record no indicia, nor did Petitioner identify any, of the jury\u2019s inability or refusal to follow these explicit instructions given by the trial court. <em>See Brooks, </em>85 Md.App. at 360-61, 584 A.2d at 85 (finding that when a defendant fails to demonstrate any evidence of the jury\u2019s inability or refusal to heed court\u2019s instruction, mere speculation that the \u201cjury could not possibly have discharged [its] task appropriately ... is totally insufficient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Many courts finding improper similar comments during closing arguments also have found jury instructions, such as the one in this case, to be ameliorative of any prejudice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>resulted from the improper comments. <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 434-35, 722 A.2d at 903-04; <em>Henry, </em>324 Md. at 232, 596 A.2d at 1038; <em>Boyd, </em>54 F.3d at 872; <em>Martinez, </em>981 F.2d at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Courts considering the prejudicial impact of improper prosecutorial comments also have examined the weight of evidence of the accused\u2019s guilt. <em>See Wilhelm, 272 </em>Md. at 427, 326 A.2d at 722 (finding that \u201c[ajnother important and significant factor where prejudicial remarks might have been made is whether or not the judgment of conviction was \u2018substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 or where the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was \u2018overwhelming\u2019 \u201d). We find this factor, however, to be of somewhat less weight in this case. Although the record contains adequate evidence of Spain\u2019s guilt to support the convictions under a sufficiency analysis, we cannot say that the evidence of Spain\u2019s guilt is truly overwhelming. Nonetheless, we find that the relative lack of severity of the improper remarks, the lack of potential impact of the erroneous argument (greater veracity of police officer due to adverse employment consequences if he lied) on the defense\u2019s theory that Officer Williams\u2019 had a faulty memory (not that he lied), and the instruction given by the judge lead us to the conclusion that Spain did not suffer undue prejudice, as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments during closing argument, sufficient to warrant reversal of his convictions. We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in no way influenced the verdict. <em>Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609 (2005); <em>Dorsey v.

Spain was charged with using a minor for distribution of a CDS because Wilson's birthday was 1 June 1985, making him under the age of 18 at the time of the narcotics transaction. At the close of the State's case, Spain moved for judgment of acquittal on Count I relating to the charge of distribution of a CDS, which the trial court granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\">. The defendant stipulated that the substance in the gel caps was heroin, excusing the need for the State to call a witness to testify as to the identity of suspected CDS. Spain also did not object to the admission of the State\u2019s documentary exhibits offered through Officer Williams.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">. The Dissent would have us believe that the thrust of Spain's defense at trial focused on urging the jury to disbelieve Officer Williams because he lied about Spain's involvement (\"Thus, notwithstanding the majority's \u2018mistake\u2019 characterization, the credibility of Officer Williams was placed at issue by the petitioner. Indeed, the petitioner's objection to the State's closing argument referenced Officer Williams' 'perjuring himself and his 'credibility'.\" Dissent at 1). To believe so would be wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Although the defense at trial surely wanted the jury to believe its sole defense witness (Spain\u2019s sister) and its theory that Spain, while in transit to a Super Bowl party at his grandfather\u2019s home, was caught up in a drug transaction conducted by others, it\u2019s rationale offered in closing argument for reaching that view was that Officer Williams\u2019 memory was unreliable due to passage of time and mental commingling of similar events, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">And let's remember again, this case happened over a year ago. The officer that is testifying-officers, like any other people who testily can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>make mistakes. Does he remember exactly what was said to him a year ago? I would submit to you ladies and gentlemen, that probably since that incident, Officer Williams has probably had hundreds of arrests. He\u2019s an expert in drugs activity. He's working on the street. Does he remember, verbatim exactly what my client said to him that day? It is enough that he [Spain] may have directed the officer to where drugs were being sold, to find if he was working with these people in an agreement. It is not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Trial transcript, 6 March 2003, Page 35, lines 9-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">Consistently, Spam\u2019s appellate counsel argued before us that Officer Williams\u2019 \u201cveracity\u201d was not challenged, rather the \"accuracy\u201d of his memory was at issue. We were informed that the \u201cdefense from the minute of opening all the way through the end was he may have made a mistake.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\">. The trial judge sentenced Spain to 10 years imprisonment for the conviction of using a minor to distribute, and 10 years imprisonment, to run concurrently, for the conviction of possession with intent to distribute.

Before sending the jury to deliberate, the trial judge in Spam\u2019s trial gave, among others, the following jury instruction, which, for the most part, mirrors Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions \u00a7 3:10:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYf\">You are the sole judges of whether a witness should be believed. In making this decision, you may apply your own common sense and everyday experiences. In determining whether a witness should be believed, you should carefully judge all the testimony and evidence and the circumstances under which the witness testified. You should consider such things as: the witness\u2019 behavior on the stand and manner of testifying; did the witness appear to be telling the truth; the witness\u2019 opportunity to see or hear the things about which testimony was given; the accuracy of the witness\u2019 memory; does the witness have a motive not to tell the truth; does the witness have an interest in the outcome of the case; was the witness\u2019 testimony consistent; was the witness\u2019 testimony supported or contradicted by evidence that you believe and whether and the extent to which the witness\u2019 testimony in the Court was different from any statement the witness made on any previous occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">You need not believe any witness, even if the testimony is uncontradicted. You may believe all, part or none of the testimony of any witness.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b187-6\">. We reserve for another day whether comments such as those made in this case would be allowed under the \u201cinvited response doctrine\u201d as a response to a direct and specific attack on a police officer witness\u2019s veracity. The \"invited response doctrine\u201d suggests that \"where a prosecutorial argument has been made in reasonable response to improper attacks by defense counsel, the unfair prejudice flowing from the two arguments may balance each other out, thus obviating the need for a new trial.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>155 F.3d at 186 n. 5 (citations omitted); <em>see also Degren, </em>352 Md. at 431-32, 722 A.2d at 902 (finding comments by the prosecution during closing argument, though \"unprofessional and injudicious,\u201d to be nonetheless acceptable when \u201cmade in response to the defense counsel's comments during closing argument that the jury should not believe the State\u2019s witnesses because they had various motives to lie\u201d). In this case, the defendant made no such specific and direct attack on Officer Williams's veracity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Dissenting Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Aqc\">BELL, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Jesse Spain, Jr., the petitioner, was convicted, after a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, of various offenses involving a controlled dangerous substance, including the offense of using a minor for the purpose of distributing it. The sole witness for the State at the trial, and through whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>all of the State\u2019s exhibits were introduced, was Officer Cornelius Williams, who, at the time of the commission of the alleged offenses was working a plain-clothes assignment. Although the petitioner did not testify, his defense, confirmed by his only witness, his sister, was that he did not commit the offenses alleged and, in fact, was not present when they were committed. The majority acknowledges that this was the focus of the petitioner\u2019s defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">\u201cSpain\u2019s defense at trial appeared to hinge on the contentions that Officer Williams was mistaken as to the encounter between himself and Officer Williams and that he was in no way involved in the narcotics transaction that followed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbL\">886 Md. 145, 150, 872 A.2d 25, 28 (2005). Thus, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d characterization, the credibility of Officer Williams was placed at issue by the petitioner.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, the petitioner\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s closing argument referenced Officer Williams\u2019 \u201cperjuring himself\u201d and his \u201ccredibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The State certainly understood that to be the case, even before the objection. There is no other logical reason or basis for the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s closing argument to have included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u201cThe second point I wanted to make to you is that the Officer in this case \u2014 the Defense\u2019s argument is that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Spain was outside his house. He was going to attend a Superbowl party and was buying beer. Part of what you have to determine is the credibility of the witnesses. The defense put on a witness who testified, and the State put on one witness, the Officer in this case. You have to weigh the credibility of each individual. Who has a motive to tell you the truth. The Officer in this case would have to engage in a lot of lying, in a lot of deception and a conspiracy of his own to come in here and tell you that what happened was not true. He would have to risk everything he has worked for. He would have to perjure himself on the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">\u201cSo basically you have to determine who has the credibility. Who\u2019s telling you the truth. Is the Officer coming here and making up a story? What\u2019s his incentive to lie and frame Mr. Spain? The reality is that this Officer \u2014 they attempted to sell this Officer drugs on the street. They didn\u2019t know he was a police officer. He was out there trying to enforce the law. But, you have to understand that Officer Williams has no motive to lie, because he has everything to risk in this case. Because he doesn\u2019t have to go out and make up drug arrests. Because he has plenty of legitimate drug arrests. There\u2019s absolutely no incentive for him to come in here and tell a story about Mr. Spain. So is Mr. Spain the victim of circumstance? He was just taken up in front of his house, trying to attend a Superbowl party? That\u2019s the defense\u2019s theory in the case. You will ultimately have to decide who you want to believe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 151-52, 872 A.2d at 28-29. As indicated, the petitioner objected. The trial court overruled the objection, observing parenthetically, \u201cOkay, well the jury understand^] that this of course is closing argument, and that they will [consider the statements to be] lawyers\u2019 arguments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The majority agrees with the petitioner that the State\u2019s argument that Officer Williams \u201chad a motive to testify truthfully because to testify falsely would expose him to the penalties of perjury and lead to adverse consequences to his career <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>as a police officer,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 386 Md. at 153, 872 A.2d at 29-30, was improper, because it \u201c \u2018vouches,\u2019 \u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201c \u2018placets] the prestige of the government behind a witness through personal assurances of the witness\u2019s veracity ... or suggests] that information not presented to the jury supports the witness\u2019s testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153-54, 872 A.2d at 30, quoting <em>U.S. v. Daas, </em>198 F.3d 1167, 1178 (9th Cir.1999). Therefore, it holds that the trial court erred in overruling the petitioner\u2019s objection and, thus, allowing the prosecutor improperly to vouch for Officer Williams\u2019 credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 156-58, 872 A.2d at 31-32. Nevertheless, concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s statements concerning the officer\u2019s motive to testify truthfully \u201cdid not mislead or influence the jury unduly to the prejudice of [the petitioner],\u201d the majority also holds that the error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 153-54, 872 A.2d at 30, citing <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 430-31, 722 A.2d 887, 902 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>I agree that the State improperly vouched for Officer Williams\u2019 credibility and that the trial court erred in permitting the State to do so. I do not agree that the court\u2019s error was harmless. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">To be sure, as this Court observed in <em>Degren, supra, </em>352 Md. at 432, 722 A.2d at 903 (quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 653, 350 A.2d 665, 674 (1976)), \u201cthe determinative factor [when the issue is whether an error is prejudicial or harmless] ... has been whether or not the erroneous ruling, in relation to the totality of the evidence, played a significant role in influencing the rendition of the verdict, to the prejudice of the [defendant].\u201d With regard to prosecutorial closing arguments, in particular, we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">\u201c[T]he mere fact that a remark made by the prosecutor to the jury was improper does not necessarily require a conviction to be set aside. Reversal is only required where it appears that the remarks of the prosecutor actually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\"><em>Evans v. State, </em>333 Md. 660, 679, 637 A.2d 117, 126 (1994), quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 580, 530 A.2d 743, 748 (1987), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>486 U.S. 1050, 108 S.Ct. 2815, 100 L.Ed.2d 916, <em>sentence vacated on remand on other grounds, </em>314 Md. 111, 549 A.2d 17 (1988). The test for assessing that \u201cdeterminative factor,\u201d where closing argument is at issue, for determining whether a remark requires reversal, is also well settled. As enunciated in <em>Dorsey, supra, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678, it is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">\u201cwhen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Lest there be any doubt about it, we made clear in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>325 Md. 511, 521, 601 A.2d 1093, 1097-98 (1992) that harmless error analysis, as applied in <em>Dorsey, </em>applied equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>to \u201carguments of counsel to the jury as part of the usual and ordinary procedures of a criminal trial,\u201d and, indeed, that <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 326 A.2d 707 (1974), the leading case addressing the limits of argument by counsel to the jury, and <em>Dorsey </em>\u201care consistent in the philosophy prompting them, comparable in the rationale underlying them, and similar in the test set out in them. Both are concerned primarily with error and the prejudice arising therefrom.\u201d <em>See Brown v. State, </em>339 Md. 385, 397, 663 A.2d 583, 589 (1995). In fact, concluding that <em>\u201cDorsey </em>aimed at providing one standard to measure an error,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we have specifically rejected the State\u2019s argument urging a contrary position, \u201cthat the <em>Dorsey </em>test \u2018is meant to apply to those errors affecting an accused\u2019s constitutional rights and those other evidentiary, or procedural, errors which may have been committed during a trial\u2019\u201d and not arguments of counsel, which \u201care not evidence and have no binding force or effect.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>325 Md. at 521, 601 A.2d at 1097-98. There simply is no incompatibility, then, between reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling as to the propriety of remarks made during closing arguments for abuse of discretion and applying the <em>Dorsey </em>test when an abuse has been found. As <em>Wilhelm </em>makes clear, there is no error \u201cunless there has been an <em>abuse of discretion </em>by the trial judge of a character likely to have injured the complaining party.\u201d 272 Md. at 413, 326 A.2d at 714-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Moreover, the credibility of witnesses is a matter to be resolved by the trier of fact, in a jury trial, the jury. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287, 313-314, 730 A.2d 181, 195 (1999). Thus, in a jury trial, only the jury determines whether to believe any witnesses, and which witnesses to believe. <em>See Bohnert v. State, </em>312 Md. 266, 278-79, 539 A.2d 657, 663 (1988); <em>Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 210, 214, 522 A.2d 1338, 1341, 1343 (1987); <em>Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 685, 414 A.2d 1266, 1271 (1980); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 566, 276 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>214, 221 (1971); <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>238 Md. 648, 650, 210 A.2d 722, 723-24 (1965). <em>See </em>also <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 224, 571 A.2d 1251, 1260 (1990) (requiring the court to \u201cinstruct the jury that it is the sole judge of the facts, the weight of the evidence, and the credibility of the witnesses\u201d); Maryland Rule 4-325(d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The majority does not appear to have applied the <em>Dorsey </em>test; although it cites Dorsey and its requirement that the appellate court be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the error played no role in the verdict, it does so only at the end of the opinion. 386 Md. at 161, 872 A.2d at 34-35. Rather it appears to have reverted to the <em>Wilhelm </em>standard, guided, however, by the analysis in <em>Deyren. </em>The latter case cited <em>Dorsey, </em>but not for the \u201charmless error\u201d test. The Court referenced the <em>Dorsey </em>language identifying the \u201cdeterminative factor\u201d to be considered in deciding whether any error is harmless or prejudicial, 352 Md. at 432, 722 A.2d at 902, and not the <em>Dorsey </em>Court\u2019s pronouncement of the level of certainty required to declare an error, once found, to be harmless. The Court\u2019s focus, in short, as is the majority\u2019s in this case, was on the <em>Wilhelm </em>formulation of what is required to be shown to render arguments of counsel improper and, therefore, a basis for reversal. <em>See Degren, </em>352 Md. at 432-33, 722 A.2d at 902-03. In that regard, it emphasized the instructions given the jury that were ameliorative of any error or mistatement, whether recognized by the trial court as such, or not. <em>Id. </em>at 433-414, 722 A.2d at 903-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The test for prejudice that the <em>Wilhelm </em>Court identified as applicable was \u201cwhether we can say, \u2018with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u2019\u201d 272 Md. at 416, 326 A.2d at 716, quoting <em>Gaither v. United States, </em>413 F.2d 1061, 1079 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>(D.C.Cir.1969) Citing <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557, 1566-67 (1946). It identified, as well, factors it determined to be decisive on the issue: the closeness of the case, <em>id., </em>citing <em>Cross v. United States, </em>353 F.2d 454, 456 (D.C.Cir.1965); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>338 F.2d 553, 554 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.1964); the centrality of the issue affected by the error, <em>id. </em>citing <em>King v. United States, </em>372 F.2d 383, 395 (D.C.Cir.1967); and the steps taken by the court to mitigate the effects of the error. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Gaither v. United States, supra., </em>413 F.2d at 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In support of its conclusion that the error was harmless, the majority, pointing out that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s reference to potential consequences to Officer Williams\u2019s career was an isolated event that did not pervade the entire trial,\u201d 386 Md. at 159, 872 A.2d at 33, a factor that <em>Wilhelm </em>also recognized as important, 272 Md. at 425-26, 326 A.2d at 721, focuses on, and finds solace from, the trial court\u2019s comment, made contemporaneously with the petitioner\u2019s objection, that the jury understood that it was closing argument and would consider the prosecutor\u2019s statements as such, and the pre-argument instructions given the jury. <em>See </em>386 Md. at 159-60, 872 A.2d at 33-34. These, it claims, ameliorated the error. To be sure, it cursorily addresses the closeness and centrality factors, conceding, as to the former, that the evidence was not \u201ctruly overwhelming,\u201d 386 Md. at 160-61, 872 A.2d at 34, but relying on the \u201crelative lack of severity of the improper remarks, the lack of potential impact of the erroneous argument (greater veracity of police officer due to adverse employment consequences if he lied) on the defense\u2019s theory that Officer Williams\u2019 had a faulty memory (not that he lied)and the instruction given by the judge,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 161, 872 A.2d at 34-35, concludes that the petitioner was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">First, as indicated, it appears that the majority has applied the wrong standard: in addition to citing <em>Dorsey </em>seemingly only in passing, the cases on which it seems principally to have relied, either are not apposite, <em>see Degren, supra, </em>352 Md. 400, 722 A.2d 887; <em>Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 232, 596 A.2d 1024, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>1038 (1991), or applied the wrong standard of review, <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>54 F.3d 868, 872 (D.C.Cir.1995) and <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>981 F.2d 867, 871 (6th Cir.1992). For the error to be deemed \u201charmless, the Court, upon its own independent review of the record, must be able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. It simply is not sufficient to be \u201cconfident that a reasonable jury would be able to properly fulfill its role and discern argument from evidence without undue prejudice to the defendant;\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 386 Md. at 160, 872 A.2d at 34, the Court has to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury did fulfill its role and discern argument from evidence without prejudicing the defendant. Nor is it sufficient merely to state that \u201c[w]e could find in the record no indicia, nor did Petitioner identify any, of the jury\u2019s inability or refusal to follow these explicit instructions given by the trial court.\u201d 386 Md. 160, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>872 A.2d 34 \u201cOnce error is established, the burden is on the State to show that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. 646, 658-59, 837 A.2d 944, 952 (2003). Harmless error cannot be established on an ambiguous record. <em>Taylor v. State, </em>352 Md. 338, 351, 722 A.2d 65, 71 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In any event, <em>Brooks v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 355, 360-361, 584 A.2d 82, 85 (1991) is inapposite. That case involved the propriety of the denial of a motion for mistrial \u201cwhen curative instructions are given, [which] it is presumed ... the jury can and will follow....\u201d <em>Id. </em>360, 584 A.2d at 85, quoting <em>Brooks v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 604, 613, 515 A.2d 225 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 Md. 382, 519 A.2d 1283 (1987). Affirming the denial, the Court of Special Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201cThere is no doubt but that the court fully apprised the jury of its obligation not to use the co-conspirators\u2019 testimony to support a guilty verdict. It did so on more than one occasion and, on each occasion, in a detailed fashion. There is, moreover, nothing in the verdict itself which suggests that the court\u2019s instructions were not heeded. Indeed, appellant does not point to any concrete evidence to that effect; he merely speculates, given the complexity of the task with which it was charged, that the jury could not possibly have discharged that task appropriately. That, of course, is totally insufficient. On the contrary, when one considers that the jury is presumed to be able to, and in fact will, follow curative instructions, it becomes manifest that there was no error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">There is absolutely no resemblance between that case and this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In support of its holding that the error in this case is harmless, the majority cites, in addition to <em>Degren, supra, </em>352 Md. at 434-35, 722 A.2d at 903-04, <em>Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 232, 596 A.2d 1024, 1038 (1991); <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>54 F.3d 868, 872 (D.C.Cir.1995) and <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>981 F.2d 867, 871 (6th Cir.1992). None of those cases provides the needed support.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>In <em>Degren, </em>the defendant argued that the prosecutor\u2019s comments that \u201c[t]he number one reason why you should not believe what Sharon Degren says is nobody, nobody in this country has more reason to lie than a defendant in a criminal trial\u201d and \u201cthis defendant has every reason to lie. She is a defendant\u201d were erroneously allowed because, by referring to defendants in general and their motives to lie, rather than his motives, they effectively undermined the presumption of innocence, with which every defendant is clothed until proven guilty. 352 Md. at 431, 722 A.2d at 902. We rejected that argument, concluding, on the contrary, that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial and for a curative instruction. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s comment that criminal defendants have a motive to lie did not bear directly on petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence. Rather, the comment was made in response to the defense counsel\u2019s comments during closing argument that the jury should not believe the State\u2019s witnesses because they had various motives to lie. The prosecutor went on, after she made her remarks at issue, to argue other motives petitioner might have to lie. This Court has held that, under certain circumstances, a prosecutor\u2019s argument during rebuttal and in response to comments made by the defense during its closing are proper. <em>See Blackwell v. State, </em>278 Md. 466, 481, 365 A.2d 545, 553-54 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 918, 97 S.Ct. 2183, 53 L.Ed.2d 229 (1977). <em>But see Johnson v. State, </em>325 Md. 511, 517, 601 A.2d 1093, 1096 (1992). The trial court evidently determined that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not improper, at least to the extent that they did not subvert the presumption of innocence, the only ground for mistrial argued by petitioner\u2019s counsel. Given the broad discretion afforded trial courts in making such determinations, we do not believe it abused this discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motions for mistrial and for a curative instruction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 431-32, 722 A.2d at 902. Later, to be sure, but only in dicta did the Court comment on the effect of the jury instructions given in the case on the presumption of innocence, concluding that the instructions so \u201cclearly defined the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>role, the presumptions afforded the defendant, how to consider comments by the attorneys, and how to judge witness testimony,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 722 A.2d at 904, as to result in the prosecutor\u2019s comments, even if inappropriate, having no effect.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0u\"><em>Henry </em>is to like effect. The challenged argument was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I didn\u2019t make up a theory out of thin air and present it about ballistics. [Defense Counsel], if you don\u2019t like my theory and you come up with a theory, then let\u2019s see how it flies. Let\u2019s put our theories before these good people and let them decide. I didn\u2019t hear his theory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201cI put a theory before you, ladies and gentlemen, based upon the evidence in this case, and I am willing to let you examine it and stand here and stand by it. If you reject my theory, fine, so be it, but I put it up here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201cI submit to you that it is based upon the evidence in this case. It is not something that was dreamed up. If they have a theory I\u2019m more than willing to hear it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">324 Md. at 229, 596 A.2d at 1036-37. The challenge was that the argument created the impression that the defense had some obligation to prove a \u201ctheory\u201d of the case and, thus, its effect was \u201cto indicate that the defense carries a burden which the law does not impose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 596 A.2d at 1038. Upholding the trial court\u2019s overruling of the defendant\u2019s objection, the Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">\u201cWe do not find that the prosecutor suggested that Henry had the burden to prove any element of the charges against him. The court thoroughly instructed the jury on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>State\u2019s burden of proof and told them that their verdicts should be based on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">\u201cWhen viewed in its entire context, the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal in the instant case does not warrant a finding of reversible error. The State\u2019s Attorney was responding directly to remarks made by defense counsel in closing argument and was asking the jury to accept his theory of the case. <em>See Denny v. State, </em>404 So.2d 824, 826 (Fla.App.1981). The judge properly instructed the jury on the applicable law, including the State\u2019s burden of proof. The prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal remarks could not have misled or prejudicially influenced the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\"><em>Boyd </em>is particularly inapposite. There, although the defendant objected to the Government\u2019s closing argument, he did not state the specific ground. Therefore, concluding that \u201cnothing in the context of defense counsel\u2019s unexplained objection made obvious the ground therefor,\u201d the court applied the plain error standard of review. Id. at 54 F.3d at 872. Certainly, that standard does not apply here. Similarly, a different standard than the <em>Dorsey </em>standard, required in Maryland, whether the \u201cprosecutorial impropriety\u201d \u201cwas so \u2018gross as probably to prejudice the defendant,\u2019 \u201d was applied in <em>Martinez. </em>981 F.2d at 871, quoting <em>United States v. Ashworth, </em>836 F.2d 260, 267 (6th Cir.1988). Applying that standard, noting that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was simply an isolated misstatement, the court stated its belief that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u201cIt is unlikely that it prejudiced [the defendant].... Any possible prejudice that [the defendant] might have suffered was ameliorated by the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that \u2018the lawyers\u2019 statements ... and their arguments are not evidence.\u2019... This instruction was sufficient to neutralize the prosecutor\u2019s slight impropriety.... Therefore, we conclude that the district court\u2019s ruling was not reversible error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The factors identified by <em>Wilhelm, </em>the closeness of the case, the centrality of the issue affected by the error and the steps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>taken to mitigate its effect, all militate against a finding of harmless error. There was only one witness who testified for the State and against the petitioner and it was through that witness that all of the evidentiary exhibits were introduced against the petitioner. The State\u2019s only witness did not go unchallenged; indeed, the thrust of the petitioner\u2019s defense was that the witness was not credible with respect to the petitioner\u2019s involvement in the crimes with which he was charged. The only issue in the case, in short, was whether the jury should believe Officer Williams\u2019s testimony. That issue is also the issue affected by the State\u2019s improper argument; it was the purpose of the argument to buttress the credibility of the Officer. And, as the majority concedes, the court never acknowledged that the argument was error; consequently, the court did absolutely nothing to mitigate the effect of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We have stated frequently that where credibility is an issue and, thus, the jury\u2019s assessment of who is telling the truth is critical, an error affecting the jury\u2019s ability to assess a witness\u2019s credibility is not harmless error. <em>Martin v. State, </em>364 Md. 692, 703, 775 A.2d 385, 391 (2001) (denial of opportunity to establish the bias or pecuniary interest of the witness); <em>Howard v. State, </em>324 Md. 505, 517, 597 A.2d 964, 970 (1991) (\u201cIn a case that largely turned on whom the jury was going to believe, the improperly admitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction may have been the weight which caused the jurors to accept one version rather than the other\u201d); <em>State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 185, 468 A.2d 319, 324-25 (1983) (error not harmless where, although some corroborating physical evidence, the prosecution\u2019s case was based on the testimony of the victim, on the basis of which, if shown not to be credible, the jury might not have been able to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt). <em>See Newman v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 85, 98, 499 A.2d 492 (1985) ( when the State\u2019s case depends virtually exclusively on the credibility of a witness, the bolstering of the witness\u2019s credibility by prior consistent statements cannot be harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">This is so because the court reviewing the trial court error for prejudice plays a significantly different role and has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>function distinct from that of the trier of fact. I addressed that distinction, <em>albeit </em>in dissent, in <em>Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 716-17, 759 A.2d 764, 799 (2000) (Bell, C.J., dissenting):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alf\">\u201cOnce it has been determined that error was committed, reversal is required unless the error did not influence the verdict; the error is harmless only if it did not play any role in the jury\u2019s verdict. The reviewing court must exclude that possibility \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">\u201cMoreover, an appellate court reviewing a trial court verdict must apply the harmless error rule consistently with its role; it should not take on the role of the trier of fact and substitute its judgment for that of the jury or the trial court whose verdict is under review. That would be to usurp the function of the trier of fact and that is not allowed.... <em>See, e.g., Daniels v. State, </em>24 Md.App. 1, 7, 329 A.2d 712, 716 (1974) (\u2018We may not usurp the function of the jury by holding that the eyewitnesses should be believed over the alibi evidence.\u2019). <em>See also Shelton v. State, </em>198 Md. 405, 412, 84 A.2d 76, 80 (1951) (\u2018This Court will not inquire into or measure the weight of the evidence, and will not reverse the judgment if there is any proper evidence before the jury on which to sustain a conviction.\u2019); <em>Alexander v. Tingle, </em>181 Md. 464, 467, 30 A.2d 737, 738 (1943) (\u2018The Court had not the authority to direct the jury that the evidence established a certain fact even though the evidence was uncontradicted and highly persuasive. The Court could not thus usurp the function of the jury to weigh the credibility of the evidence.\u2019); <em>Collins v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 674, 679, 288 A.2d 221, 224 (1972) (\u2018The weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are matters within the realm of the jury.\u2019); <em>Wilkins v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 113, 127, 273 A.2d 236, 243 (1971) (\u2018The weight of evidence and the credibility of the witnesses [are] for the jury.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">(Footnote omitted). In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cNo matter how strong a case for conviction the State may present, even when the defense presents no evidence, the court may not direct a verdict for the State. See Maryland Rule 4-324, which, while providing that a defendant may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>move for judgment of acquittal, Rule 4-324(a), ... and the court may direct the entry of judgment in his or her favor if there is insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, Rule 4-324(b), makes no provision for the making of a motion for judgment by the State. Compare Maryland Rule 2-519, ... the civil counterpart. <em>[State v. Lyles], </em>308 Md. 129, 135, 517 A.2d 761, 764 (1986). This is so because it is the trier of fact, whether the court or a jury, that must determine if the State has met its burden of proof. To make that determination, the trier of fact is required to find the facts and when, as is usually the case, there are credibility issues, to resolve them. That, in turn, involves weighing the evidence. Appellate courts do not find facts or weigh evidence, \u2018what evidence to believe, what weight to be given it, and what facts flow from that evidence are for the jury ... to determine.\u2019 <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 224, 571 A.2d 1251, 1260-[6]1 (1990). <em>See Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 214, 522 A.2d 1338, 1341 (1987); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 566, 276 A.2d 214, 221 (1971); <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>238 Md. 648, 650, 210 A.2d 722, 723-[2]4 (1965). Even when an appellate court assesses the sufficiency of the evidence, it does not weigh it, <em>see Clemson v. Butler Aviation-Friendship, </em>266 Md. 666, 671, 296 A.2d 419, 422 (1972); <em>Gray v. Director, Patuxent Institution, </em>245 Md. 80, 84, 224 A.2d 879, 881 (1966), it only determines if any evidence exists, on the basis of which a rational trier of fact could find the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573 (1979); <em>Bloodsworth v. State, </em>307 Md. 164, 167, 512 A.2d 1056, 1057 (1986). There is no reason that a harmless error analysis should permit it to do more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\"><em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 596-97, 602 A.2d 677, 698-99 (1992) (Bell, J., dissenting) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">All of what the majority points to, and on which it relies, occurred prior to the error occurring. I confess to having difficulty understanding how instructions given with the expectation that there will be compliance and no error can moderate an error subsequently made. More difficult to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>accept, or even understand, is the majority\u2019s reliance on the court\u2019s comment, made when the petitioner objected, stating the obvious, that the State\u2019s argument vouching for the State witness\u2019s credibility was argument of counsel and that the jury would take it as such. Argument of counsel may be proper or it may be, as in this case, improper. There is, or should be, a consequence when a party engages in improper argument; when it is a jury trial and the jury may well have been misled, that consequence is to order a new trial. That the jury is told that argument is not evidence does not address the effect that the improper argument may have had on the jury. This is of particular significance where, as in the case of a jury, it is impossible to determine whether and, if so, how, particular arguments affect, or may have affected, the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">I have often questioned this Court\u2019s application of the \u201charmless error\u201d rule, believing both that it is over-used and misused. On the prior occasions, there has been evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt in addition to the testimony, admitted or excluded, being challenged. <em>E.g., Rubin, </em>825 Md. at 578-580, 589-590, 602 A.2d 677 (evidence so overwhelming that excluding the offending evidence would have made no difference in verdict); <em>Jensen v. State, </em>355 Md. 692, 716, 736 A.2d 307, 320 (1999)(indicating, among other references to the evidence, that \u201cfour individuals testified that Jensen told them, or that they overheard him, either revealing the details or bragging about the killing\u201d); <em>Ware, </em>360 Md. at 679, 759 A.2d at 779 (in addition to the holding that the \u201cform of the evidence reduced [the] prejudicial impact\u201d of an erroneously admitted statement of a State\u2019s witness, there was considerable other evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s guilt). I had thought, until now, that, where the only issue was credibility and it had to be resolved by the jury believing one witness over another, \u201charmless error\u201d would not, and indeed, could not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Applying the <em>Dorsey </em>test to the facts in this case, there simply is no logical basis on which any rational reviewing court could be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the State\u2019s improper closing argument, vouching, as it does, for the credibility of Officer Williams, the State\u2019s only witness, whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>credibility was challenged, did not contribute to the guilty verdict returned against the petitioner. It was not harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\">. Credibility is implicated however and in whatever manner it is argued that a witness's testimony ought not be credited; it may be a matter of academic interest or affect only the reprehensibility of the action, but to the factfinder, it matters not whether the basis of the unreliability of the witness's testimony is mistake or intentional fabrication. Either way, as indicated, the testimony is unreliable, lacks credibility. Moreover, in this case, it does not matter how the petitioner characterized Officer Williams' testimony, or why, whether diplomatic, perhaps tactical, given the position of the State's only witness. The State was clear in its closing argument that it perceived the issue to be a credibility issue \u2014 it told the jury, \"You have to weigh the credibility of each individual,\" it had to \"determine who has the credibility. Who\u2019s telling you the truth.\u201d It was the State\u2019s intention, and it had the desired effect, I submit, to enhance the Officer\u2019s credibility and to do so by emphasizing his position and, thus, vouching for the Officer. How effective it was, the impact it had on the jury, is a matter to be determined by the jury, not by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b194-5\">. The petitioner argued that the State vouched for the credibility of its only witness, Officer Williams, in two ways: one, by arguing that Officer Williams had no motive to testify falsely, and two, that he, on the contrary, had a motive to testify truthfully by virtue of what he stood to lose, <em>i.e., </em>\"he would have to risk everything he has worked for. He would have to perjure himself on the stand.\u201d The majority rejects the former, observing that \"[t]he prosecutor\u2019s comments about Officer Williams\u2019s absence of a motive to lie did not implicate any information that was outside the evidence presented at trial,\u201d 386 Md. at 155-56, 872 A.2d at 31, and, therefore, were not error. As we have seen, it concluded otherwise with respect to the comments referencing the officer's motive to testify truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">I am not at all convinced that the majority is correct as to the absence of a motive to lie comments. The support that <em>Reyes v. State, </em>700 So.2d 458, 460-61 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1997) and <em>U.S. v. Walker, </em>155 F.3d 180, 187 (3rd Cir.1998) provide in that regard is tenuous, at best. <em>Reyes, </em>in fact, condemned the very conduct engaged in in this case and <em>Walker\u2019s </em>analysis was largely semantic, essentially turning on the meaning of the phrase, \"I submit to you.\u201d The real question is, whether the two kinds of comments may be parsed, as the majority has done, so that those that do not offend, when considered in context and with the instructions, so overshadow the offending ones that it can be said, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the offending comments had no effect on the verdict. It is simply inconceivable that any objective reviewer could. That is especially the case where the reviewer\u2019s function is not to weigh the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">. In <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 658, 350 A.2d 665, 677 (1976), we said: \"Regardless of the generic nature of the error, we believe that upon appellate review, a uniform test should be applied in all criminal cases to determine the effect the error may have had on the verdict.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">. Maryland Rule 4-325(d) permits the trial court, in instructing the jury, to \u201crefer to or summarize the evidence in order to present clearly the issues to be decided,\u201d but \"[i]n that event, the court shall instruct the jury that it is the sole judge of the facts, the weight of the evidence, and the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b199-5\">. The majority cites for this proposition <em>Young v.

At the outset, it is important to note that the <em>Young </em>court did not find harmless error. For the benefit of the trial court on remand, however, the intermediate appellate court considered the correctness of jury instructions concerning the evaluation of the credibility of police officers. The defendant wanted the court to endorse the following instruction and, in fact, argued that the instruction was required to be given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201cA police officer\u2019s testimony should be considered by you just as any other evidence in this case, and in evaluating his credibility, you should use the same guidelines which you apply to the testimony of any other witness.

The Court of Special Appeals did not agree. Instead, it endorsed a portion of the instruction the trial court had given: \u201cYou are the sole judges of whether a witness should be believed, and in making this decision, you should apply your own common sense and everyday experiences in life. In determining whether a witness should be believed and what weight to give the testimony of that witness, you should carefully judge all the testimony and evidence and circumstances under which each witness has testified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 136-37, 510 A.2d at 607.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\">. The Court had earlier commented in a footnote that it harbored concern about the appropriateness of the prosecutor's remarks:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">\u201cIn so holding, we, like the Court of Special Appeals, believe this comment may have been inappropriate. Under the facts of this particular case, the issue of motive to lie had been brought up first by the defense. We do not believe the State's Attorney's intent in stating criminal defendants have a motive to lie was nefarious. Nonetheless, it was an unprofessional and injudicious remark.
