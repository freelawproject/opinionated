The trial court granted the petition and terminated the parental rights of Victor A.\u2019s parents, Mr. A. and Ms. A. We have been asked to consider whether the Court of Special Appeals, in its remand, applied a different standard to determine the best interests of children with special needs, than is applied to children without such needs in a termination of parental rights proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Victor A. was born on March 26, 2000, to Ms. A. and Mr. A. He tested positive for cocaine and amphetamines at birth and was diagnosed with severe mental and physical disabilities, including Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation, Dysphagia, Myopia, Reflux, Global Developmental Impairment Microcephaly, Encephalopathy, and Failure to Thrive. As a result, Victor A. is severely spastic and is unable to control any of his extremities; he is unable to speak or walk and has a swallowing disorder requiring that he be fed through a gastronomy tube. He must use a wheelchair and braces to keep his legs straight and other supports for his body; he also takes several medications to alleviate his discomfort and to help his breathing. As part of his care, Victor A. requires 16 hours a day of in-home nursing services and has numerous doctors to help manage his disabilities, including a pediatrician, gastrologist, orthopedist, pulmonologist, and an ophthalmologist. He also receives speech therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy to prevent further deterioration that may result from his disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">At the time of Victor A.\u2019s birth, Ms. A. was an active drug user, and Mr. A. also was undergoing assessment as a substance abuser; neither could care for Victor A., who, after birth, remained in the hospital for approximately three months. On July 8, 2000, the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services (PGDSS), filed an emergency shelter care petition in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Division of Juvenile Causes, after which a hearing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was held and temporary custody of Victor A. was awarded to PGDSS with instructions to place him with a relative, who PGDSS identified as his maternal aunt. The court allowed Ms. A. to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>have supervised visitation with Victor A. if she participated in a drug treatment program and remained drug free for three months; Mr. A. was permitted liberal unsupervised visitation unless he was found to have a substance abuse problem, which eventually turned out to be unsubstantiated. Thereafter, Victor A. was declared a child in need of assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was released from the hospital. He resided with his aunt until October of 2000, when Ms. A. alleged that Victor A. had been sexually abused by his aunt\u2019s son. While the allegations of abuse were being investigated, PGDSS placed Victor A. in foster care, during which time Mr. A. visited Victor A. several times a week. The allegations of abuse were never corroborated, but when Victor A.\u2019s aunt was asked to resume caring for him, she declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On January 25, 2001, the Circuit Court conducted a review hearing, during which the judge established a permanency plan<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of reunification and awarded full custody to Mr. A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Three months later, PGDSS filed a petition alleging that Victor A.\u2019s medical needs were not being met, and during a hearing on the matter, the trial court rescinded Mr. A.\u2019s custody, declared Victor A. to be a child in need of assistance for a second time, and placed him in foster care, but allowed Mr. A. and Ms. A. to have daily unsupervised visitation. In order to regain custody of Victor A., Mr. A. signed service agreements to complete parenting skills classes, to participate in a support group for parents of special needs children, and to obtain adequate housing. Ms. A. also agreed to undergo psychological evaluations, to participate in parenting skills classes, and to continue her drug treatment under a service agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Thereafter, on May 28, 2002, the judge changed the permanency plan from reunification with Mr. A. to adoption, after PGDSS had reported that both parents had failed to meet some of the conditions set forth in the various service agreements. PGDSS then petitioned the court for a termination of the parental rights of Mr. A. and Ms. A., and on December 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>2002, the court granted PGDSS limited guardianship and reduced each parent\u2019s visits to once per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Subsequently, on July 18, 2003, the court conducted a two-day termination of parental rights hearing, during which PGDSS sought guardianship of Victor A. for the purpose of having him placed for adoption. The judge assessed Victor A.\u2019s needs in terms of his medical care and each parent\u2019s ability to care for him. Although the judge determined that both parents, for the most part, had complied with the service agreements by attending the parenting classes, he also found that Ms. A. had participated in the drug treatment program, submitted to psychological evaluations, and regularly visited Victor A. The court, however, concluded that Ms. A. was unable to care for Victor A. because she had an ongoing substance abuse problem and held that, \u201cthe return of Victor, Jr., to his mom does pose an unacceptable risk to [his] future safety[.]\u201d While the judge expressed satisfaction as to Mr. A\u2019s compliance with the service agreements and noted that Mr. A. maintained regular contact with and provided for Victor A. financially, he found unacceptable that Mr. A. had failed to secure adequate housing to accommodate Victor A.\u2019s needs, despite Mr. A.\u2019s assurances that he would find appropriate housing if Victor A. were returned to his care.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge stated that he was \u201cclearly convinced that the County [was] a better parent and that it [was] in the better interests of [Victor A.]. But whether it [was] in the best interests to terminate his parents\u2019 rights [he was] not sure.\u201d Thus, the judge reserved ruling on the matter to consider the evidence presented during the hearing regarding the available placement options for Victor A. and whether Mr. A. and Ms. A. could maintain visitation rights if their parental rights were terminated. After the hearing, the court made the following findings in an order issued on September 23, 2003:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">This matter, having been brought before this Court by the Prince George\u2019s County Office of Law on a Petition for Termination of Parental Rights which was hereby held before this Court for trial on July 18, 2003 and further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>hearing held on August 14, 2003, and having heard testimony and having weighed the relevant factors in this matter, it is on this 23rd day of September 10, 2003, by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, hereby</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASZ\">ORDERED, that this Court concludes that it is in the best interests of Victor [A.] for termination of his natural parents rights;[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] and is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">ORDERED, that this Court hereby grants the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services\u2019 (hereinafter referred as \u201cDepartment\u201d) petition to be granted guardianship of Victor [A.], with the right to consent to adoption and/or long term care, and further the right to make application to this Court for a change of name; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">ORDERED, that the Court also finds that until such time as the \u201cDepartment\u201d identifies such adoptive or long-term resource, that it is in the best interests of Victor [A.] to continue visitation with [Ms. A.] and [Mr. A.] under the supervision of the \u201cDepartment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">ORDERED, that the above-captioned cases are hereby closed statistically.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Mr. A. and Ms. A. appealed the judgment terminating their parental rights to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that PGDSS had failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that termination of their parental rights was in Victor A.\u2019s best interests. The intermediate appellate court agreed with Victor A.\u2019s parents in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Victor A., </em>157 Md.App. 412, 852 A.2d 976 (2004), and held that the trial court did not make adequate factual findings to support a termination of their parental rights. In reaching its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>decision, the Court of Special Appeals opined that the trial court \u201cdid not explain its mixed conclusion of fact and law that termination of the As\u2019 parental rights [was] in Victor [A.]\u2019s best interest\u201d in light of the numerous findings in favor of preserving the parental rights and that it had failed to determine how continuation of parental rights would harm or diminish Victor A.\u2019s prospects for adoption, pursuant to Maryland Code, Section 5-813(a)(3)(iv) of the Family Law Article (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the judgment terminating Mr. A. and Ms. A\u2019s parental rights and remanded the case to the trial court to assess all the available permanent placement options for Victor A. in deciding whether termination of parental rights would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">PGDSS filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court and the Public Justice Center filed a Petition and Memorandum in Support<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> thereof and asked to participate as amici curiae. We granted both petitions and issued the writ of certiorari<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to consider the following questions, which we have renumbered to clarify the issues in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in reaching and deciding the question of the completeness of the trial court\u2019s findings, when that question, which does not pertain to the jurisdiction of either the trial court or the appellate court, was not raised by the appellants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that a different standard applies to determining whether adoption or long-term foster care is in the best interest of disabled children than applies to nondisabled children, in contravention of the American with Disabilities Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>and the strong legislative policy, recognized and approved by this Court\u2019s binding precedent, favoring permanency for all children?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals vacating the order terminating both parent\u2019s parental rights and remanding the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We utilize three interrelated standards to review a trial court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights, as set forth in <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">[W]e point out three distinct aspects of review in child custody disputes. When the appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard of [Rule 8-131(c) ] applies. [Second,] [i]f it appears that the [court] erred as to matters of law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless. Finally, when the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the [court] founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the [court\u2019s] decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1P\"><em>Id. </em>at 586, 819 A.2d at 1051, quoting <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 122-26, 372 A.2d 231, 232-34 (1977); <em>see also Robinson v. Robinson, </em>328 Md. 507, 513, 615 A.2d 1190, 1193 (1992); <em>McCready v. McCready, </em>323 Md. 476, 484, 593 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">PGDSS contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred by enunciating a different standard for assessing the best interests of children with special needs or circumstances than is applied to children without such needs. In PGDSS\u2019s view, the statutory time lines for achieving permanence were intended to apply to all children without regard to a child\u2019s disabilities. PGDSS also asserts that the Court of Special Appeals decided an issue that was not before the court when it addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>whether the trial court had made all of the requisite findings needed to terminate parental rights. According to PGDSS, Mr. A. and Ms. A. raised only two claims in the intermediate appellate court: \u201cthat [Victor A.\u2019s] disabilities make it more appropriate to leave him indefinitely in foster care than to free him for adoption and that the trial court had erred in finding that neither of them [Mr. A. and Ms. A.] will become able to care for [Victor A.] in the reasonably foreseeable future,\u201d which did not include a determination about the trial court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">To the contrary, Mr. A. and Ms. A. maintain that the Court of Special Appeals did not apply a different standard to determine the best interests of children with disabilities than that is applied to children without special needs. Victor A.\u2019s parents contend that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s explanation of the applicable statutes did not distinguish between disabled and nondisabled children and that the holding was limited to the trial court\u2019s findings in terminating their parental rights. Mr. A. and Ms. A. further assert that the trial court\u2019s findings were properly raised because the Court of Special Appeals was asked to determine whether the trial court had erred in terminating their parental rights and within this inquiry was whether the trial court\u2019s findings adequately supported the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In this case we are presented with a unique issue of whether children with special needs in the child welfare system are subject to a different legal standard in the determination of the \u201cbest interests standard\u201d than is applied to children without such needs. The fundamental problem presented by this case warrants discussion of the child welfare system\u2019s purpose and principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">A. Fundamental Rights of Parents</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The appropriate starting point in our analysis when the State intervenes in family relations is the fundamental rights of a parent. Certain fundamental rights are protected by the United States Constitution, and among those rights are a parent\u2019s right to raise his or her children without undue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>interference by the State. <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 565, 819 A.2d at 1039; <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. J9610436 and J9711031, </em>368 Md. 666, 692, 796 A.2d 778, 793 (2002); <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 705, 782 A.2d 332, 342 (2001). The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that a parent has a constitutionally protected fundamental right to raise his or her children. <em>See In re Yve S, </em>373 Md. at 566-67, 819 A.2d at 1039; <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 705, 782 A.2d at 342-43; <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10911, </em>335 Md. 99, 112-13, 642 A.2d 201, 208 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Most recently, in <em>In re Yve S., </em>we affirmed this principle and stated that a parent\u2019s interest \u201coccupies a unique place in our legal culture, given the centrality of family life as the focus for personal meaning and responsibility. \u2018[F]ar more precious .. . than property rights,\u2019 parental rights have been deemed to be among those \u2018essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 819 A.2d at 1039, quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10911, </em>335 Md. at 113, 642 A.2d at 208, in turn quoting <em>Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981); <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 705, 782 A.2d at 342-43. Likewise, in <em>In re Mark M., </em>we emphasized the importance of parenting as a fundamental right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">A parent\u2019s interest in raising a child is, no doubt, a fundamental right, recognized by the United States Supreme Court and this Court. The United States Supreme Court has long avowed the basic civil right encompassed by child rearing and family life. <em>See Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49, 57 (2000) (stating that \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children\u201d); <em>See also Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1394-95, 71 L.Ed.2d 599, 606 (1982) (discussing \u201cthe fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child\u201d); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1212-13, 31 L.Ed.2d 551, 558-59 (1972) (stating that \u201c[t]he rights to conceive and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>raise one\u2019s children have been deemed \u2018essential,\u2019 \u2019\u2019and that \u201c[t]he integrity of the family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ... the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ... and the Ninth Amendment....\u201d) (internal citations omitted). Maryland, too, has declared a parent\u2019s interest in raising a child to be so fundamental that it \u201ccannot be taken away unless clearly justified.\u201d <em>Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 218, 721 A.2d 662, 669 (1998)(citing <em>In re Adoption No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 112, 642 A.2d 201 (1994)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 705, 782 A.2d at 342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In termination of parental rights proceedings where the State has intervened through the exercise of its generally recognized power to protect the child by reason of the natural parent\u2019s unfitness, the standard is based upon the best interests of the child, <em>see McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 869 A.2d 751 (2005); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 112, 642 A.2d at 208, and there is a strong presumption in favor of maintaining parental rights to serve the child\u2019s best interests. <em>See In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 571, 819 A.2d at 1042; <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 112, 642 A.2d at 208; <em>In re Adoption /Guardianship Nos. J9610436 and J9711031, </em>368 Md. at 692, 796 A.2d at 793. We explained this presumption in <em>In re Yve S.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">The best interests of the child standard embraces a strong presumption that the child\u2019s best interests are served by maintaining parental rights. If it were otherwise, the most disadvantaged of our adult citizens always would be at greater risk of losing custody of their children than those more fortunate. Those of our citizens coping with emotional or mental difficulties could be faced with such discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 571, 819 A.2d at 1042 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">A parent\u2019s right to raise his or her children, however, is not beyond limitation, and there may be countervailing considerations that the State, pursuant to its <em>parens patriae </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>authority, must protect. We emphasized these considerations in <em>In re Mark M.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">That fundamental interest [in raising a child], however, is not absolute and does not exclude other important considerations. Pursuant to the doctrine of <em>parens patriae, </em>the State of Maryland has an interest in caring for those, such as minors, who cannot care for themselves. <em>See Boswell, </em>352 Md. at 218-19, 721 A.2d at 669. We have held that \u201cthe best interests of the child may take precedence over the parent\u2019s liberty interest in the course of a custody, visitation, or adoption dispute.\u201d <em>Boswell, 352 </em>Md. at 219, 721 A.2d at 669; <em>see also In re Adoption No. 1094-1, </em>335 Md. at 113, 642 A.2d at 208 (stating that \u201cthe controlling factor ... is ... what best serves the interests] of the child\u201d). That which will best promote the child\u2019s welfare becomes particularly consequential where the interests of a child are in jeopardy, as is often the case in situations involving sexual, physical, or emotional abuse by a parent. As we stated in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. A91-71A, </em>334 Md. 538, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994), the child\u2019s welfare is \u201ca consideration that is of \u2018transcendent importance\u2019 \u201d when the child might otherwise be in jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at 561, 640 A.2d at 1096 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">We have recognized that in cases where abuse or neglect is evidenced, particularly in a CINA case, the court\u2019s role is necessarily more pro-active. <em>See In re Justin D., </em>357 Md. at 448, 745 A.2d at 417.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">A trial court, acting under the State\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>authority, is in the unique position to marshal the applicable facts, assess the situation, and determine the correct means of fulfilling a child\u2019s best interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 705-06, 782 A.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">B. The Child Welfare System</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">The fundamental right of parents to raise their children is not only well settled in our common law, but also is reflected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>in federal and Maryland legislation. The role of federal and Maryland statutes relating to the child welfare system was explained in <em>In re Yve S., </em>quoting from Judge Karwacki in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>385 Md. 99, 103-06, 642 A.2d 201, 203-05 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">The Maryland General Assembly has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme to address those situations where a child is at risk because of his or her parents\u2019 inability or unwillingness to care for him or her. Title 5 of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol.) (Hereinafter \u201cF.L.\u201d) governs the custody, guardianship, adoption and general protection of children who because of abuse or neglect come within the purview of the Department of Human Resources....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">During the 1970\u2019s, nationwide concern grew regarding the large number of children who remained out of the homes of their biological parents throughout their childhood, frequently moved from one foster care situation to another, thereby reaching majority without belonging to a permanent family. This phenomenon became known as \u201cfoster care drift\u201d and resulted in the enactment by Congress of Public Law 96-272, the \u201cAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980,\u201d codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 610-679 (1988). One of the important purposes of this law was to eliminate foster care drift by requiring states to adopt statutes to facilitate permanent placement for children as a condition to receiving federal funding for their foster care and adoption assistance programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">Under the federal act, a state is required, among other things, to provide a written case plan for each child for whom the state claims federal foster care maintenance payments. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(16).

The purpose of the judicial review is to \u201cdetermine the future status of the child\u201d including whether the child should be returned to its biological parents, continued in foster care for a specified period, placed for adoption, or because of the child\u2019s special needs or circumstances, continued in foster case on a long term basis. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">Maryland receives considerable federal funds pursuant to this Act.

If the circuit court finds by clear and convincing evidence, after considering the statutorily enumerated factors, that it is in the best interests of a child previously adjudicated a CINA for parental rights to be terminated, the circuit court has authority to grant the department\u2019s petition for guardianship.

Thus, Title 5 of the Family Law Article seeks to prevent the need for removal of a child from its home, to return a child to its home when possible, and where returning home is not possible, to place the child in another permanent placement that has legal status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 573-76, 819 A.2d at 1043-45; <em>see also In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos.

Termination of Parental Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We have explained that the \u201cadoption statutes of Family Law Subtitle 3 and the child welfare statutes of Family Law Subtitle 5 are to be read in relation to one another, [Maryland Code, Section 5-304 of the Family Law Article], [and] termination of parental rights and adoption come into play when called for by the permanency plan.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 121, 642 A.2d at 212. In cases where a child has been declared in need of the court\u2019s assistance, the decision leading to a termination of parental rights is necessarily part of a continuous process to determine the child\u2019s best interests and to place the child in a permanent and stable environment. The overlapping consideration that is reflected throughout the permanency planning stage of the process to the termination of parental rights is the safety and health of the child, which is of paramount importance. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-525(e)(1)(i)-(iii) of the Family Law Article; Md.Code (1984, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-823(h)(2)(v) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article; Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-313(c)(1) and (2)(iii) of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">To prevent children from languishing in foster care the General Assembly established certain time frames to which DSS and the courts must adhere. In instances where the child\u2019s placement in foster care is voluntary, the placement should not last for more than six months. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-525(a)(1) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>For children who have been in foster care during 15 of the most recent 22 months, DSS must initiate a termination of parental rights within 120 days. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1987, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-525.1(a)-(b) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the petition to terminate parental rights is filed, the \u201clocal department shall identify, recruit, process, and seek to approve a qualified family for adoption, guardianship, or other permanent placement.\u201d Md.Code (1987, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-525.1(c) of the Family Law Article. If DSS determines that adoption is the appropriate permanency plan for a child, a petition for guardianship <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> may be filed by the child\u2019s placement agency, absent consent by the biological parents, to enable the child to be adopted. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1987, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-525.1(a), (b) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>There may be instances, however, where adoption is not the appropriate permanency goal and placement on a long-term basis is more appropriate.

The plain language of Section 5-313(a), however, indicates that once the trial judge had determined that Victor A. was a CINA, he need not have addressed any of the additional circumstances construed in Section 5-313(a)(3), but should have proceeded to the required findings under Sections 5-313(c) and (d). <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 112, 642 A.2d at 208; <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 87A262, </em>323 Md. 12, 18, 590 A.2d 165, 168 (1991). We, therefore, conclude that trial court in this instance was not required to assess whether Victor A.\u2019s chances for permanent placement with a family would be diminished by continuation of Mr. A. and Ms. A.\u2019s parental rights under Section 5-313(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We have held, heretofore, that a child\u2019s prospects for adoption must be a consideration independent from the termination of parental rights, <em>see Cecil County Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Goodyear, </em>263 Md. 611, 615, 284 A.2d 426, 428 (1971), in that \u201c[t]he facts should first be considered as if the State were taking the child from the parent for some indefinite placement and upon that determination open the question of the suitability of the proposed adoption and its relation to the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616-17, 284 A.2d at 428; <em>see also Winter v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Director, Dept. of Public Welfare of Baltimore City, </em>217 Md. 391, 394, 143 A.2d 81, 83 (1958), <em>cert. denied </em>358 U.S. 912, 79 S.Ct. 242, 3 L.Ed.2d 233 (1958) (holding that adoption may be considered only \u201cafter a hearing the court finds that such consent or consents [to adoption] are withheld contrary to the best interests of the child.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Whether children with special needs are subject to a different legal standard in the determination of their best interests is the next question we address and conclude that none of the relevant statutes defining the child welfare system nor cases interpreting those sections suggests that a different standard should apply for the placement of children with special needs or for the decision concerning whether the rights of their parents should be terminated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although Section 3-823(e) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article permits children with special needs or circumstances to remain in long-term placement on a permanent basis, no analogous provision regarding special needs exists in the termination of parental rights statute. Stated otherwise, while the trial judge may consider long-term placement options for children with special needs, the existence of special needs does not independently enter into the court\u2019s decision whether to terminate parental rights.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To the extent that the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals states otherwise, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In the present case, in the absence of sufficient findings, the Court of Special Appeals ordered a remand of the case to have the trial court explain why termination of Mr. A. and Ms. A.\u2019s parental rights would be in Victor A.\u2019s best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>interests and thereby, to make the requisite findings in support of any decision to terminate Mr. A. and Ms. A.\u2019s rights based upon Sections 5-313(c) and (d) of the Family Law Article in the best interests of Victor A.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We agree. Upon remand, the trial court must address each of the required considerations of Sections 513(c) and (d) and make specific findings as to each of the factors identified in the statute prior to a decision whether to terminate the parental rights of Mr. and Ms. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS MODIFIED TO PROVIDE THAT THE CASE IS RE</em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>\n<em>MANDED TO T\u00c9E CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION, AND, AS MODIFIED, THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS AFFIRMED.
