Petitioner, in its attempt to persuade us to change the law, relies in part on the assertion that the doctrine of ademption is in conflict with Md.Code (2001), \u00a7 3-106 of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article, the Restatement (Third) of the Law of Property (Wills and Other Donative Transfers) \u00a7 5.4 (1999), and the Uniform Probate Code \u00a7 2-609 (amended 1990). In addition, petitioner assails the decision of the intermediate appellate court, <em>YIVO Institute for Jewish Research v. Zaleski, </em>156 Md.App. 527, 847 A.2d 510 (2004), and contends that the Court of Special Appeals misapplied the law of ademption in its review of the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court. For reasons to follow in this opinion, we decline the invitation to rewrite the law of ademption and affirm the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">On September 25, 2002, the Orphans\u2019 Court for Montgomery County<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied petitioner\u2019s, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research (\u201cYIVO\u201d), request to receive distribution of a bequest in the Will of Jan Karski (\u201cDr. Karski\u201d). The Orphans\u2019 Court concluded that Dr. Karski\u2019s <em>inter vivos </em>gifts to YIVO were intended by Dr. Karski as a fulfillment of the legacy under his will. The petition was opposed by respondents, the personal representative of Dr. Karski\u2019s estate and two residuary legatees under Dr. Karski\u2019s Will \u2014 the American Center of Polish Culture and the Kosciusko Foundation. YIVO appealed to the Court of Special Appeals seeking reversal of the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>YIVO argued in the Court of Special Appeals, as they do here, that the specific bequest to YIVO in the will was not adeemed by the lifetime gifts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> YIVO also contends that the Orphans\u2019 Court erred in admitting the testimony of Dr. Hanna Kaya Ploss (\u201cDr. Ploss\u201d) as to oral statements made by Dr. Karski after satisfaction of Dr. Karski\u2019s pledge to YIVO. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court stating that the Orphans\u2019 Court was not clearly erroneous in its conclusion that Dr. Karski intended for his bequest to YIVO to act only as security for his obligation to the organization. It also affirmed the admission of Dr. Ploss\u2019s testimony deferring to the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and factual findings. <em>YIVO, </em>156 Md.App. 527, 847 A.2d 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">By petition for writ of certiorari to this Court, YIVO challenges the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals asserting that the lower courts erred in failing to require written evidence of intent to adeem, misapplied the presumptions of prior case law regarding ademption by satisfaction, and improperly admitted and/or credited Dr. Ploss\u2019s testimony. We granted <em>certiorari </em>to consider YIVO\u2019s contentions. <em>YIVO v. Zaleski, </em>382 Md. 688, 856 A.2d 724 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Dr. Karski was a hero of the Polish underground during World War II. He reported to Allied powers on the events transpiring in Poland until he was captured by the Nazis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During his confinement he was tortured and suffered greatly. Alter attempting suicide to avoid disclosures that could have endangered the underground movement, Dr. Karski was taken to a Nazi-controlled hospital in critical condition. He was rescued from the hospital by members of the underground movement. Several lives were lost during the rescue effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>and one rescuer, Zofia Hanuszkiewicz (\u201cZofia\u201d), spent several years in a German prison camp for her involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">After the war, Dr. Karski emigrated to the United States and settled in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Dr. Karski remained committed to Polish culture until his death, developing ties with several Polish organizations, including The Kosciusko Foundation (\u201cFoundation\u201d) and The American Center of Polish Culture (\u201cCenter\u201d). He spent much of his life attempting to mend the relationship between Jewish and non-Jewish Poles which had been fractured by events occurring in Poland during WW II. Following the death of his wife, Pola Nirenska, Dr. Karski developed a plan to memorialize both of them by creating an award to acknowledge Jewish authors of Polish origin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1992, Dr. Karski entered into an agreement with YIVO to establish an endowment fund to provide an annual award of $5,000 to authors whose works focused on or otherwise described contributions to Polish culture and Polish science by Poles of Jewish origin. Dr. Karski formalized his pledge in a letter dated November 25, 1992 (\u201cLetter Agreement\u201d). The Letter Agreement provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVW\">The endowment will consist of a gift of $100,000.00 in cash to be made by me to YIVO in my will, or in cash and/or marketable securities of the same total market value during my lifetime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">A second letter, identical to the November 25,1992, letter, was signed February 25, 1993. It is unclear from the record, however, why the second letter was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">On October 25, 1993, eight months after writing the second Letter Agreement, Dr. Karski executed his will. Article SECOND of the will provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">I hereby give and bequeath to YIVO \u2014 Institute for Jewish Research (tax exempt organization Dr. Lucjan Dobroszycki and Dr. Ludwik Seidenman) \u2014 all my shares of Northern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>States Power (N.St.Pw.) of which 400 share certificates are located in Riggs National Bank, Friendship Branch (4249 block of Wisconsin Avenue), Safe Deposit Box 240, and the rest approximately 1,780 shares, is held by Northern States Power as automatic reinvestment. All these shares (approximately 2,180) should be transferred (not sold) to YIVO.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALE\">At the time the will was executed, Northern States Power Company shares had a value of about $100,000. At the time of Dr. Karski\u2019s death the shares were worth $113, 527.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">In addition, pursuant to the Third Clause of the will, stock in two other utilities, New York State Gas &amp; Electric and Ohio Edison, was left to the Washington Performing Arts Society (\u201cWPAS\u201d). Most of the remaining estate was bequeathed in equal shares to the Foundation, the Center, three of Dr. Karski\u2019s elderly relatives in Poland, and Zofia, the woman who had helped rescue him from the hands of the Nazis.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">During the period November 28, 1995, to January 22, 1996, Dr. Karski made a series of lifetime gifts of utility stocks to YIVO consisting of 1,809 shares of New York State Electric &amp; Gas Corporation, 2,300 shares of Ohio Edison Company, and cash.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The value of these stock gifts totaled $99,997.69. On February 7, 1996, Dr. Karski made a further gift of $2.31, bringing the total value of the gifts to YIVO to exactly $100,000. Dr. Karski did not amend his will to reflect the <em>inter vivos </em>transfer of utility stock and cash to YIVO.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Dr. Karski died on July 12, 2000. At that time, the shares of Northern States Power Company remained an asset of his estate. Paul Zaleski, who qualified as personal representative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>denied YIVO\u2019s request for payment of the bequest on the basis that Dr. Karski\u2019s earlier gift satisfied the legacy. As a result, YIVO filed a Petition for Order Directing Distribution of Specific Bequest.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The Orphans\u2019 Court conducted an evidentiary hearing and rendered an oral opinion finding that Dr. Karski intended for his lifetime gifts to YIVO to satisfy the legacy under the will. Following the entry of final judgment, YIVO appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which affirmed the judgment of the Orphans\u2019 Court. We granted YIVO\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The standard of review in this action is summarized in Maryland Rule 8-131:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">(c) Action tried without a jury. When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Md. Rule 8-131 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">We recently discussed our review pursuant to Md. Rule 8-131. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">\u201c[T]he appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d The deference shown to the trial court\u2019s factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard does not, of course, apply to legal conclusions. When the trial court\u2019s [decision] \u201cinvolves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number><em>Nesbit v. Government Employees Insurance Company, </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879, 883 (2004) (internal citations omitted). If there is any competent material evidence to support the factual findings of the trial court, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous. <em>Solomon v. Solomon, </em>383 Md. 176, 202, 857 A.2d 1109, 1123 (2004). Furthermore, an appellate court may affirm a trial court\u2019s decision on any ground adequately shown by the record even though the ground was not relied upon by the trial court or the parties. <em>Offutt v. Montgomery Co. Bd. of Edu., </em>285 Md. 557, 563 n. 3, 404 A.2d 281, 285 n. 3 (1979) (citing <em>Robeson v. State, 285 </em>Md. 498, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">At the outset, we find it important to determine the precise meaning of \u201cademption.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cademption\u201d as \u201cthe destruction or extinction of a testamentary gift by reason of a bequeathed asset\u2019s ceasing to be a part of the estate at the time of the testator\u2019s death.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 42 (8th ed., 2004). We have said that ademption is defined as a \u201crevocation, recalling, or cancellation, of a legacy, according to the apparent intention of the testator, implied by law from acts done by him in his life, though such acts do not amount to an express revocation of it.\u201d <em>Von Steinner v. Sorrell, </em>259 Md. 228, 230, 269 A.2d 604, 605 (1970) (citations omitted). The Tennessee Supreme Court discussed the doctrine of ademption and stated that, \u201cademption is generally defined as \u2018the extinction, alienation, withdrawal, or satisfaction of the legacy by some act of the testator by which an intention to revoke is indicated: the doing of some act with regard to the subject-matter which interferes with the operation of the will.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Estate of Hume, </em>984 S.W.2d 602, 604 (Tenn.1999) (quoting <em>American Trust &amp; Banking Co. v. Balfour, </em>138 Tenn. 385, 198 S.W. 70, 71 (1917)).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">As the definitions above demonstrate, there are two distinct types of ademption. The first occurs when \u201cthe unique property that is the subject of the specific bequest has been sold, given away, or destroyed, or is not otherwise in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>existence at the time of the testator\u2019s death.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 42 (8th ed., 2004). This is referred to as ademption by extinction. Ademption by extinction results because of \u201cthe doing of some act with regard to the subject-matter which interferes with the operation of the will.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Hume, </em>984 S.W.2d at 604 (citing <em>American Trust &amp; Banking Co., </em>198 S.W. at 71).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By comparison the other type of ademption occurs when the testator, while alive, has already given something of value to the beneficiary in lieu of the legacy. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 42 (8th ed.2004). This is known as ademption by satisfaction. The doctrine of ademption by satisfaction \u201crefers to the situation in which the testator gives in his lifetime to a legatee what he had left him in his will.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Hume, </em>984 S.W.2d at 604 (citing <em>Rhodes v. Kebke, </em>179 Tenn. 480, 167 S.W.2d 345, 348 (1943)).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In the case before us there is no claim of ademption by extinction. The question here is whether there was an ademption by satisfaction and whether it has occurred is most certainly a matter of testator intent. Murphy\u2019s Will Clauses \u00a7 C1, 14-54 (Matthew Bender). Under the doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ademption by satisfaction, the intent of the testator is \u201crelevant to determine whether the testator\u2019s actions regarding the legatee amounts to a withdrawal of the gift from the operation of the will.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Estate of Hume, </em>984 S.W.2d at 604. The law is established in this State that, \u201cwhen a testator in his lifetime pays to a legatee the amount of money given by the will, and such payment is intended to be in satisfaction of the legacy, the legacy is thereby adeemed.\u201d <em>Rhein v. Wheltle, </em>206 Md. 1, 6, 109 A.2d 923, 925 (1954) (citing <em>Gallagher v. Martin, </em>102 Md. 115, 118, 62 A. 247, 248 (1905)). Thus the question whether a legacy is adeemed by a gift made by a testator to a legatee after execution of the will depends upon the intention of the testator. <em>Rhein, </em>206 Md. at 6, 109 A.2d at 925. Therefore, if a testator intended that an <em>inter vivos </em>gift should abrogate the legacy, the legacy is adeemed either in whole or in part; but if a testator intended that the legatee should receive both the testamentary gift and the <em>inter vivos </em>benefit, the legacy is not adeemed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"> It is a general rule that \u201cwhere a testator is the parent of the legatee or in <em>loco parentis, </em>and after executing his will makes a gift to the same child, it will be presumed that the gift was intended to be in satisfaction of the legacy.\u201d <em>Rhein, </em>206 Md. at 6, 109 A.2d at 926. The legacy will be considered adeemed unless the presumption is rebutted. <em>Id. </em>This principle was founded upon the equitable presumption that a parent, who has the natural obligation to provide for his children, after executing a will establishing the portion of his estate that each child should receive, would not give one of his children a double portion of his estate to the detriment of the others. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Selby v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>188 Md. 192, 51 A.2d 822 (1947); <em>Wallace v. Dubois, </em>65 Md. 153, 159, 4 A. 402, 403 (1886); <em>Richardson v. Eveland, </em>126 111. 37, 18 N.E. 308 (1888); <em>Carmichael v. Lathrop, </em>108 Mich. 473, 66 N.W. 350 (1896)). On the other hand, it is accepted as a general rule that where a testator is not the parent of the legatee or does not stand in <em>loco parentis, </em>it will be presumed that the subsequent gift did not adeem the legacy by satisfaction. <em>Rhein, </em>206 Md. at 7, 109 A.2d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>In <em>Associated Professors of Loyola College v. Dugan, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">[T]hat if the bequest is for a particular purpose, a subsequent gift to the legatee by the testator in his lifetime for the same purpose operates as a satisfaction of the legacy to the amount of the gift. This statement of the rule is subject to the qualification that the gift <em>inter vivos </em>must not be substantially different in kind from the legacy.... The rule we have stated is uniformly recognized and applied where the conditions make it appropriate. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar0\"><em>Associated Professors of Loyola College v. Dugan, </em>137 Md. 545, 550, 113 A. 81, 83 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In <em>Colley v. Britton, </em>we reaffirmed the law of ademption by satisfaction. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">It is also established law in this State that when in his lifetime a testator pays to a legatee the amount of money given by a will, and such payment is intended to be in satisfaction of the legacy, the legacy is thereby adeemed. The question of whether a legacy is adeemed by a gift made by a testator to the legatee after the will was executed <em>depends upon the intention of the testator.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-8\"><em>Colley v. Britton, </em>210 Md. 237, 246, 123 A.2d 296, 301 (1956) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Petitioner argues that a subsequent writing is necessary to show a clear intention of satisfaction. YIYO relies upon revisions to Maryland\u2019s law in 1968 concerning advancements and intestate estates which resulted from the Governor\u2019s Commission to Review the Testamentary Law of Maryland (\u201cThe Henderson Commission\u201d). The Henderson Commission recommended, and the Maryland Code now reflects, that for an <em>inter vivos </em>gift to be treated as an advancement, there must be written evidence of such an intent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner posits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>that there is no reason to \u201cmaintain standards for ademption of a legacy by satisfaction that differ from those applicable to advancement of an intestate share.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In our view, principles governing advancement and intestate shares do not help resolve the issues in this case. In the present case, the decedent did not die intestate, he died with a will. The laws of intestate succession concern disposition of property by operation of law under circumstances where the decedent failed to declare his or her intention with regard to the disposition of his or her property at the time of death. The law of ademption by satisfaction, however, is concerned with the intention of the testator at the time the <em>inter vivos </em>gift was made. <em>See Colley, </em>210 Md. at 246, 123 A.2d at 301. Second, petitioner\u2019s reliance upon the Henderson Commission Report is of no avail because that Commission did not recommend any changes to the common law of ademption by satisfaction. In fact, there is no mention of any discussion in the Report with regard to the general law of ademption.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>reasonable to infer from the Commission\u2019s recommendations about advancements to lineal descendants and its silence about ademption that it did not see a need to modify the common law of ademption by satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Petitioner next draws from language in <em>Selby v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>188 Md. 192, 199, 51 A.2d 822, 825 (1947), to suggest that a writing of the testator is required to show that an <em>inter vivos </em>gift is intended as a substitution for the legacy provided in the will. This was not our holding in <em>Selby </em>and no other reported decision of this Court has interpreted <em>Selby </em>for that proposition. <em>See Colley, </em>210 Md. 237, 123 A.2d 296; <em>Rhein, </em>206 Md. 1, 109 A.2d 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The issue in <em>Selby </em>was whether payments in the form of securities and cash to Fidelity Trust Company by the testator, during his lifetime and after execution of his will, adeemed a bequest in his will to the Trust Company. We held that the <em>inter vivos </em>transfers to the trust were ambulatory and revocable during the testator\u2019s lifetime and did not constitute' an outright irrevocable gift to a third party. <em>Selby, </em>188 Md. at 202, 51 A.2d at 826. Hence, the transfers to the trust did not adeem the testamentary trust established under Mr. Selby\u2019s Will. In that case, the evidence was not sufficient to show that the testator\u2019s intention was to substitute the transfers in trust for the bequest under his will. Specifically, we said that the question of whether a gift is an advancement may \u201cturn on the provisions of a will, or on a writing of the testator showing he intended the advancement to be in substitution for the legacy provided in the will.\u201d <em>Selby, </em>188 Md. at 199, 51 A.2d at 825. We never said, in <em>Selby, </em>that a will or writing are the only methods of proving ademption by satisfaction. Furthermore, we pointed to several examples of situations where parol evidence was admissible to show that the testator intended an outright gift as a substitution for the bequest in a will. For example, we said that parol evidence is admissible on the question of \u201cwhether a bequest was intended in payment of a debt owed the devisee by the testator ...\u201d or \u201cto show that an advancement was to be applied to the specific purpose of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>bequest in the will to be used for the building of a church.\u201d <em>Selby, </em>188 Md. at 202, 51 A.2d at 826 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In addition, petitioner contends we should adopt the view of 1 Restatement (Third) of the Law of Property (Wills and Other Donative Transfers) \u00a7 5.4 (1999) (hereinafter, \u201cRestatement\u201d) and the Uniform Probate Code \u00a7 2-609 (amended 1990), 8 U.L.A. 179 (1998) (hereinafter, \u201cUPC\u201d). Section 5.4 of the Restatement Ademption by Satisfaction provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">An <em>inter vivos </em>gift made by a testator to a devisee or to a member of the devisee\u2019s family adeems the devise by satisfaction, in whole or in part, if the testator indicated in a contemporaneous writing, or if the devisee acknowledged in writing, that the gift was so to operate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Under the Revised UPC, \u00a7 2-609 Ademption by Satisfaction, the required evidence of intent can take one of three forms: (I) a statement in the will itself providing for deduction of the gift or any future gifts, (ii) a written statement of the testator in a contemporaneous writing indicating that the gift is in full or partial satisfaction of the devise, or (iii) a written statement of the devisee acknowledging that the gift is in full partial satisfaction of the devise.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Maryland, however, has neither expressly adopted the Restatement \u00a7 5.4 nor the UPC. Both provisions require a writing to prove that an <em>inter vivos </em>gift operates as an ademption by satisfaction. We are not persuaded, however, to adopt either view. We are guided by the long-standing rule that the intention of the testator at the time of the <em>inter vivos </em>gift is the heart of ademption by satisfaction. <em>See Colley, </em>210 Md. 237, 123 A.2d 296; <em>Rhein, </em>206 Md. 1, 109 A.2d 923; <em>Wallace, </em>65 Md. 153, 4 A. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>The doctrine of ademption by satisfaction is an intent-effecting doctrine. The doctrine operates to prevent the legatee from receiving a double gift against the testator\u2019s wishes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The question is one wholly of intention, and the burden is upon those who assert that the <em>inter vivos </em>gift was intended to satisfy the legacy. <em>See Colley, </em>210 Md. at 246, 123 A.2d at 301. As noted above, there are, however, certain circumstances where the intent to adeem will be presumed. For example, \u201cin the case of a legacy to one towards whom the testator does not stand in <em>loco parentis, </em>the rule is that if the bequests are for a particular purpose, a subsequent gift to the legatee by the testator in his lifetime for the same purpose operates as a satisfaction of the legacy to the amount of the gift.\u201d <em>Loyola College, </em>137 Md. at 550, 113 A. at 83. The rule, however, is subject to the qualification that the <em>inter vivos </em>gift must not be substantially different in kind from the legacy. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, it is well established that \u201cif a testator has given a legacy in order to accomplish a certain purpose, and he subsequently accomplishes that purpose himself, the legacy is presumed to be adeemed.\u201d <em>Rhein, </em>206 Md. at 7, 109 A.2d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In reaching its conclusion that Dr. Karski\u2019s lifetime gifts of $100,000 to YIVO were given to adeem the legacy of approximately $100,000, the Orphans\u2019 Court first needed to determine the purpose of the legacy in the will. The Court deemed it reasonable in assessing the purpose of the legacy to look to the facts surrounding it, the commitment Dr. Karski made to YIVO, and the Letter Agreement. In this context, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Court found, as a matter of fact, that the purpose of the legacy was to fulfill or otherwise provide security for the commitment that Dr. Karski made to YIVO. Petitioner claims that the Orphans\u2019 Court erred in this determination and that the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the lower court\u2019s findings because no specific purpose was attached to the bequest. We disagree. Despite the fact that no specific purpose is explicitly stated in Dr. Karski\u2019s Will, the Orphans\u2019 Court was correct in its conclusion because it arrived at its findings after it considered the bequest in the context of Dr. Karski\u2019s relationship with YIVO. Dr. Karski had no continuing charitable relationship with YIVO. We cannot say that the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s factual determination \u2014 that Dr. Karski\u2019s relationship \u25a0with YIVO was limited to the terms of the Letter Agreement and that the bequest to YIVO was intended to secure the terms of the Letter Agreement in the event that he was unable to fund the endowment during his lifetime \u2014 was clearly erroneous. We hold that the Orphans\u2019 Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding, as it did, the purpose of the legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Once it was determined that the purpose of the legacy was security, the Orphans\u2019 Court could properly find, based upon the evidence in the record, that the lifetime gifts had a purpose identical to that of the legacy. Dr. Karski gave the lifetime gifts to secure his promise in the Letter Agreement to provide a bequest of $100,000 to YIVO. This finding of a same purpose operates as a satisfaction of the legacy, unless the lifetime gift was substantially different in kind. <em>See Colley, </em>210 Md. 237, 244, 123 A.2d 296, 300; <em>Loyola College, </em>137 Md. at 550-51, 113 A. at 83. Dr. Karski bequeathed shares of Northern States Power to YIVO. At the time Dr. Karski drafted his will these shares were worth approximately $100,000. Dr. Karski\u2019s lifetime gift to YIVO consisted of shares of New York State Gas &amp; Electric, shares of Ohio Edison, and cash in the amount of $2.31, thus bringing the total value of the gifts to $100,000. While the stock given to YIVO during Dr. Karski\u2019s life were shares from a different company than that named in the will, we agree with the Orphans\u2019 Court and the intermediate appellate court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>there was no evidence that'the stock in the legacy had any particular significance. Dr. Karski\u2019s own Letter Agreement referred to \u201ccash and/or marketable securities,\u201d evidencing that Dr. Karski treated the shares as equivalent to cash. The Orphans\u2019 Court correctly found that Dr. Karski intended that the different company shares and the cash were identical to one another: Thus, the shares were not substantially different in kind. Further, we find that the Orphans\u2019 Court neither erred in its conclusion nor abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Having established that the <em>inter vivos </em>gifts to YIVO were the same in purpose and in kind as the bequest to YIVO in Dr. Karski\u2019s Will, the Orphans\u2019 Court found a presumption of ademption. Where a presumption of ademption arises \u201cit is one of fact and not of law and may be rebutted by competent evidence.\u201d <em>Trustees of Baker University, </em>564 P.2d at 480. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he question is one for the trier of facts'.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The petitioner did not offer any competent evidence to rebut the presumption of ademption and, absent such evidence, the Orphans\u2019 Court was correct to find that it was Dr. Karski\u2019s intention to adeem the legacy with his lifetime gifts to YIVO. Accordingly, the bequest to YIVO was satisfied and, as such, YIVO is not entitled to an additional gift. It has been stated that, \u201cif a testator has given a legacy in order to accomplish a certain purpose, and if he subsequently accomplishes that purpose himself, the legacy is presumed to be adeemed, whether or not a presumption of ademption would have arisen otherwise.\u201d <em>Loyola College, </em>137 Md. at 550, 113 A. at 83. Such is the case here. We therefore hold that the. Orphans\u2019 Court was not clearly erroneous in its factual findings regarding a presumption of intention to adeem by satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Parol Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">We next turn to petitioner\u2019s last claim of error with respect to the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s ruling on the admission of the testimony of Dr. Hanna-Kaya Ploss, Executive Director of the American Center of Polish Culture and a friend of Dr. Karski\u2019s, regarding statements made by Dr. Karski in 1998 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>the years preceding his death. Specifically, Dr. Ploss testified that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">I don\u2019t know what was in that will, but Dr. Karski was not a compulsive man who would pound on something over and over, but from time to time he said, \u201cYou know, maybe I should change my will just in case the YIVO Institute will come and ask once more for the money when I already have given it to them,\u201d and then he always answered his own question, \u201cNo. They are much too decent to do such [a] thing. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">He was absolutely sure they will not come a second time and ask for the money when I have already given it to them, that is something that sticks in my mind, \u201cI have already given them the money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We find that the court did not err in allowing the testimony. The \u201cintention of a testator as to whether a gift should adeem or satisfy a legacy may be shown by extrinsic or parol evidence, including [a testator\u2019s] conduct after the execution of the will.\u201d <em>Trustees of Baker University, </em>564 P.2d at 481 (citing 96 C.J.S. Wills \u00a7 1178(5)(a) p. 1012). The Kansas court noted in support of this contention that Page on Wills provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">In most cases testator\u2019s intention with reference to ademption does not appear upon the face of the will, and, if it does, it relates to the future, and it is possible that a testator may change it. Accordingly, it is generally held that extrinsic evidence is admissible to show the intention which the testator had when he [or she] made the payment in question. This includes parol evidence of testator\u2019s declarations, evidence of the surrounding facts and circumstances from which his [or her] intent may be inferred and evidence of testator\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-8\"><em>Trustees of Baker University, </em>564 P.2d at 481 (citing 6 Page on Wills (Bowe-Parker Revision), Ademption, \u00a7 54.27, p. 283).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">In recognizing this rule, we acknowledge that \u201cordinarily the burden of proof as to the testator\u2019s intention falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>on the party who claims that a payment operates as an ademption of a legacy.\u201d <em>Trustees of Baker University, </em>564 P.2d at 481. Actual intention may be proven by competent evidence that a subsequent gift is to satisfy a legacy and such intention should be enforced. <em>Id. </em>All relevant evidence is admissible to prove intent, subject to objections of unfair prejudice, confusion, etc. Md. Rule 5-402. Under Md. Rule 5-803(b)(3) a statement of intent, offered to prove the declarant\u2019s future action, is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. And the attorney-client privilege is not a bar to the admission of testimony by the lawyer-draftsman as to what the client intended in his will. <em>Benzinger v. Hemler, </em>134 Md. 581, 107 A. 355 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">YIVO argues that the evidence should not have been admitted because the statements made by Dr. Karski to Dr. Ploss were made two years after the lifetime gifts were given to YIVO and, thus, were too far removed to be relevant. As the Kansas court recognized in <em>Trustees of Baker University, </em>however, the \u201cbetter reasoned authorities allow evidence of declarations made long after the <em>inter vivos </em>payment admissible for the purpose of showing a testator\u2019s intention in making a gift even if made subsequent to the gift, the matter of time merely going to the weight to be accorded such evidence rather than its admissibility.\u201d <em>Trustees of Baker University, </em>564 P.2d at 481 (citations omitted). Furthermore, YIVO offered no case law to justify its position on this point. The Orphans\u2019 Court found that the testimony was relevant and admissible. As extrinsic evidence is admissible for purposes of showing the testator\u2019s intent in ademption cases, we affirm the decision to admit Dr. Ploss\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Because the New York State Gas &amp; Electric and Ohio Edison shares that were given to YIVO during Dr. Karski\u2019s lifetime were the same stock as bequeathed to WPAS in the will, the bequest to WPAS was treated by the Personal Representative as adeemed by extinguishment. Ademption by extinguishment generally applies to specific legacies and occurs because the unique property that is the subject of a specific bequest has been sold, given away, or destroyed, or is not otherwise in existence at the time of the testator's death. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 42 (8th ed., 2004). In this case, the shares bequeathed to WPAS were given away and, thus, not in existence at the time of Dr. Karski\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\">. It is a general rule that ademption by extinction is not a matter of intent and therefore evidence of a testator\u2019s purpose in effecting an extinction of a legacy is irrelevant. <em>Matter of Nakoneczny, </em>456 Pa. 320, 323-324, 319 A.2d 893 (1974). In the case of <em>In re Brann, </em>219 N.Y. 263, 114 N.E. 404 (1916), the New York Court of Appeals asserted that, while the law of ademption may once have been dependent upon intention, the courts now look \"to the fact of change\u201d and once that is ascertained does not \"trouble itself about the reason for the change.\u201d <em>In re Brann, </em>114 N.E. at 405. Following this rule, in 1925 this Court held that ademption \u201cis to be sought for in the facts of destruction or loss of the thing specified in the legacy, or loss of its identity, rather than in change of intention on the part of the testator.\u201d <em>Elwyn v. DeGarmendia, </em>148 Md. 109, 112, 128 A. 913, 914 (1925). Those cases, however, all involved the theory of ademption by extinction because the specific legacies were extinguished, lost, or destroyed. Accordingly, \u201d[t]he rule [of ademption by extinction] prevails without regard to the intention of the testator or the hardship of the case, and is predicated upon the principle that the subject of the gift is annihilated or its condition so altered that nothing remains to which the terms of the bequest can apply.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Hume, </em>984 S.W.2d at 604 (quoting <em>Wiggins v.
