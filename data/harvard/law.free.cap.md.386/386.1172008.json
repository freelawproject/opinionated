Thompson of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, for hearing pursuant to Rule 16-757(a).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After conducting a hearing, the hearing judge issued Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law, making findings of fact and drawing conclusions of law in accordance with Maryland Rule 16\u2014757(c),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201cUpon the testimony heard and the exhibits admitted, this Court, by clear and convincing evidence, makes the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">\u201c1. The Respondent was admitted to practice in Maryland in 1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\n<em>The Adeyosoye Matter</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The Respondent undertook the representation of Olusolape Michelle Adeyosoye in connection with her personal injury automobile accident claim arising from an accident occurring on July 3, 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">\u201c3. In January 2002, the Respondent settled the Adeyosoye claim with the defendant, USA Truck for $3,547.28. On January 29, 2002, at the behest of the Respondent, Adeyosoye executed the release of all claims. The Respondent, by letter dated January 30, 2002 to USA Truck, confirmed and accepted the offer of settlement in the above amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\u201c4. After January 29, 2002, Adeyosoye spoke to the Respondent on several occasions by telephone. The calls from Adeyosoye were for the purpose of checking the status of the settlement. Not only did the Respondent fail to advise that the settlement proceeds check had been received and deposited, but the Respondent falsely advised Adeyosope that the proceeds check had not been received and that it might become necessary to go to court to resolve the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">\u201c5. That at all times pertinent to this matter, the Respondent did not maintain a trust or escrow account and testified that he was unaware that he needed to have such an account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">\u201c6. The Respondent, in fact, had received the proceeds check and had deposited the check in his law firm\u2019s operating account on or about February 12, 2002. The deposited check required endorsement by Adeyosoye. Ms. Adeyosoye denied endorsing any check for deposit and this Court accepts the testimony of Ms. Adeyosoye <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>as fully credible. At the time of the check deposit, both Alma Lopez-Martin and Scott, partners of the Respondent, had left the firm. The Respondent or someone acting at his direction endorsed and deposited the proceeds check in the operating account. The Respondent denies forging Adeyosoye\u2019s name to the check and generally denies stealing the money. Respondent suggests that if the endorsement was false, it was the work of one Rodney Lee, who was a long time friend of the Respondent who was helping the Respondent with office matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">7. Thereafter, the Respondent appropriated the funds that had been deposited, for his personal or business purposes, including the purchase of a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">8. Adeyosoye never received any monies from the Respondent or the law firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">9. A[d]eyosoye eventually contacted USA Truck and learned that a check had been sent to the Respondent and negotiated through a bank. Eventually Adeyosoye made a claim against USA Truck and the bank and settled the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">10. The Respondent moved his office and changed his phone number and never informed Adeyosoye of the truth of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">11. When contacted by Bar Counsel, Respondent repeatedly gave false and misleading statements about the matter, claiming that Adeyosoye[\u2019s] assertions were \u2018preposterous and clear attempts on her behalf to extort or otherwise secure monies from [the Respondent] not due her.\u2019 The Respondent further claimed that neither he nor anyone in his office had forged Ms. Adeyosoye\u2019s signature on the proceeds check and that he \u201censured\u201d that the check was signed by the client. All of these statements repeatedly made to Bar Counsel were false and completely contrary to the evidence before this Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201c12. The Respondent was unable to produce any documentation or files on the Adeyosoye matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\n<em>Ayala Matter</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u201c13. In March 2001, Carla V. Ayala, an immigrant from Bolivia working as a dental assistant, contacted Alma Lopez-Mitchell at the Respondent\u2019s office, for the purpose of having an attorney represent her in connection with an immigration matter. Lopez-Mitchell was the Respondent\u2019s wife. Lopez-Mitchell was a law graduate, but was not admitted to the bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">\u201c14. Ayala contacted Lopez-Mitchell because Lopez-Mitchell was a patient of the dental practice where Ayala was employed. Ayala had been given a business card by Lopez-Mitchell. The business card shows Lopez-Mitchell\u2019s name followed by \u201cJ.D.\u201d and the Respondent\u2019s name followed by \u201cEsq.\u201d. Ayala believed that Lopez-Mitchell was an attorney who was going to represent her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">\u201c15. Ayala made an appointment to meet with Lopez-Mitchell. Ayala decided to go to Lopez-Mitchell because Lopez-Mitchell was fluent in Spanish. At the appointed time, she came to the Respondent\u2019s law office where she discussed the change of her immigration status with Lopez-Mitchell in her separate office and presented her with paperwork from Bolivia. While at the office, Ayala signed a contract with Lopez-Mitchell, which bore no other signatures. Ayala was never told that Lopez-Mitchell was not an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">\u201c16. Ayala paid a total fee of $3,000.00 by making monthly payments of $500.00. Her payments were timely made. She was told the immigration matter would be completed in one year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">\u201c17. Due to a lack of progress in her matter, Ayala called the office on several occasions and was advised by Lopez-Mitchell that she was working on the matter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Ayala wanted to see the paperwork that was being prepared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-4\">\u201c18. Ayala eventually came to the office and met with the Respondent in early 2001. The Respondent advised her that Lopez-Mitchell was no longer employed with the firm. Ayala asked for her paperwork and Respondent promised to gather it and send it to Ayala.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201c19. When she did not receive the promised paperwork, Ayala called the Respondent\u2019s office several times a month. She did not receive any return calls and eventually no one answered the phone. Ayala then went to the location of Respondent\u2019s office and found that it was closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">\u201c20. Ayala located the Respondent at a Lanham, Maryland address in 2002. She went twice to the location and both times did not find anyone at the office and subsequently left a note under the door. Ayala wanted to obtain a receipt for the fee payments she had made. As a result, Ayala finally reached the Respondent who agreed to meet with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">\u201c21. At their meeting, Ayala was told by the Respondent that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization was intending to close her case without action. Ayala states [that] Respondent told her the U.S. Department of Labor was to blame for the delays. Thereafter, Ayala had no further contact with the Respondent until after disciplinary proceedings had been initiated. Respondent testified that he does not remember this meeting and says he was not even in Lanham at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">\u201c22. Ayala\u2019s signature appears on some of the immigration paperwork, but Ayala testified that it was not signed by her and bears an incorrect address. Ayala\u2019s testimony is fully credible. Respondent acknowledged that Ayala was not properly represented and many mistakes were made and that there was a lack of communication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\n<em>Firm Ownership and Management</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">\u201c23. The Respondent testified that his law firm was created on January 1, 2001 under the name of Lopez, Mitchell &amp; Scott, L.L.C. The Respondent did the necessary legal work to create the limited liability, corporation. He and Lopez-Mitchell controlled two-thirds of the firm\u2019s equity. At the time of the creation of the firm, Lopez-Mitchell was not an attorney nor is there any evidence that she has ever been an attorney, only a law school graduate. At the time of the hearing before this Court, the Respondent was unable to produce any of the organizing documents for the firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">\u201c24. Scott left the firm in September or October 2001. The Respondent\u2019s wife stopped working at the firm in March 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">\u201c25. The only income to the firm came from legal fees. Lopez-Mitchell shared in the division of the fees with the Respondent and Scott. The Respondent did not understand at the time of the creation of the firm that non-lawyers could not own an equity interest in the firm. Instead, the Respondent felt that Lopez-Mitchell was working in the same \u2018industry\u2019 and that the ownership prohibition applied to ownership combinations involving persons of other professions. The Respondent did not consult the Rules of Professional Conduct prior to the creation of the law firm. The Respondent states that the business cards originally did not have anything following Lopez-Mitchell\u2019s name, but were changed to include the \u2018J.D.\u2019 designation to protect Lopez-Mitchell from liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\n<em>\u201cOther Matters</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\u201c26. The Respondent and Lopez-Mitchell experienced marital difficulties and separated in March 2001. They are currently reconciled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u201c27. The Respondent acknowledged that he has suffered from substance abuse in the past, but asserts he is dealing with the issue at present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u201c... <em>Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u201cWhat undoubtedly commenced as a hopeful enterprise by the Respondent and others, was doomed from the start when viewed from ethical considerations. The actual operation of the law firm for which the Respondent was responsible further violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, which was followed by a period of inaction and avoidance of responsibility to clients and the profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\n<em>\u201cMaryland Rules for Professional Conduct 54(a) and (d)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u201cRespondent erred when he agreed with a non-lawyer to form a law firm and to share fees with the non-lawyer. The excuse for the violation, that of ignorance of the limitation of the participation in this manner with non-lawyers, is to be viewed with the participation of Lopez-Mitehell in the operation of the firm as well in the context of other rule violations. The organizational structure of the firm, which was created by the Respondent, constitutes a- violation of Rules 5.4(a) and (d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u201cThe Petitioner alleges the sharing of legal fees by LopezMitehell and the Respondent, but the specific fees were not identified. The proof in this case is derivative of the co-ownership, but there was no evidence that any fee was divided between an attorney and a non-attorney. This is due in no small measure to the paucity of records retained and produced by the Respondent. It is the finding by this Court that Petitioner has not sustained its burden on this specific allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">\n<em>\u201cMaryland Rules of Professional Conduct 7.1 and 84(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">\u201cThe Petitioner alleges that by permitting Lopez-Mitehell to hold herself out as an attorney, the Petitioner was a part of making false and misleading communications about the legal services being rendered. In this case, the Respondent\u2019s culpa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>bility lies with permitting Lopez-Mitchell to relate to the client, Ms. Ayala, without an attorney being present and by implying to clients that Ms. Lopez-Mitchell was an attorney. The proof in the case is that Lopez-Mitchell conducted the Ayala legal matter until she left the firm in March 2001. This included giving the firm business card to Ayala, with Lopez^Mitchell\u2019s name without any indication of status, and later using a card indicating \u2018J.D.\u2019 Lopez-Mitchell did not testify either by deposition or directly in court. However, there was no rebuttal to Ms. Ayala\u2019s testimony that until Lopez-Mitchell left the firm, she was the only person with whom Ayala had contact, the person who gave advice and handled conferences in her own office within the firm location, set the fee, and executed the retainer agreement. The evidence before the Court is clear and convincing that the Respondent knew, and in fact, sponsored the arrangement undertaken in the Ayala case. Only when Lopez-Mitchell left, did the Respondent become involved in the matter, [in] which [his] involvement was also problematic. The use of the business card, the retainer agreement and the fee setting was a violation of Rules 7.1 and 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\n<em>\u201cMaryland Rules 16-603 and 16-604; Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.15(a) and (b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u201cThe Adeyosoye matter presents glaring examples of misconduct. By his own admission, the Respondent acknowledged that he failed to establish and maintain an attorney trust or escrow account. When the proceeds payable in settlement for the USA Truck case were sent to the Respondent, they were deposited in the firm\u2019s operating account. The failure to establish a proper trust account and the failure to use such an account as the depository for the recovery proceeds constitutes violations of Maryland Rules 16-603 and 16-604. The Respondent\u2019s actions also constitute a violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(a) and (b) by the failure to safeguard the property of others entrusted to the Respondent and the failure by the Respondent to notify Ms. Adeyosoye of the receipt of the settlement proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\n<em>\u201cMaryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 and 14(a), and 84(a) and (c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u201cThe Respondent could not have been less diligent in the Adeyosoye matter. Not only did the Respondent not inform his client properly as stated above, he closed his firm\u2019s location, took the totality of the assets, and did not give any notice or indication as to where he could be found. The fact that Ms. Adeyosoye was not further damaged in this matter is due solely to Ms. Adeyosoye and her resourcefulness in eventually holding others to account for her loss. None of that redounds to the Respondent\u2019s credit whose actions made a bad situation worse. The proof was irrefutable that the Respondent took the proceeds for his own use, thereby denying to Adeyosoye that which was justly hers. In short, the Respondent stole his client\u2019s money.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u201cThe Respondent\u2019s actions are clear violations of Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 and 1.4(a). The theft constitutes a violation of Maryland Rule 8.4(a) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\n<em>\u201cMaryland Rules of Professional Conduct 8.1 and 84(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqU\">\u201cDuring the course of the investigation and at the time of trial, the Respondent asserted that the complaint and testimony of Ms. Adeyosoye was preposterous and false. He even went so far as to suggest that Ms. Adeyosoye was perpetrating a scam to obtain double recovery and that she was attempting to extort funds from the Respondent when she knew she had been paid. These statements were made when the Respondent had full knowledge that he had taken the monies for his own use in buying a motor vehicle, had not properly accounted to the client, and tried to avoid any responsibility in the matter. The Respondent\u2019s alternative theory is that a nonlawyer, childhood friend who was helping out in the office probably was responsible for the mishandling of the monies. Given the powerful proof elicited by Bar Counsel, such statements are pure nonsense and were made out of desperation and to obfuscate the investigation and the trial. Accordingly, the Respondent violated Maryland Rules of Disciplinary Conduct 8.1 and 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\n<em>Mitigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u201cNo evidence in mitigation was offered by the Respondent in explanation of his acts other than ignorance and confusion. In fact, the Respondent denied many of the allegations made against him. However, it is the belief of this Court that the Respondent was then and may still be suffering from the effects of substance abuse. The evidence that this circumstance might be involved came to light only with the Court\u2019s specific questions and was not volunteered. Because there was so little evidence on this point other than a candid admission by the Respondent in his testimony, not much more can be said on the point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The petitioner has filed a Recommendation for Sanction, in which it urges disbarment as the appropriate sanction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> To support that recommendation, the petitioner emphasizes that the hearing court \u201cdetermined that there was clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent stole his client\u2019s money,\u201d that \u201c[t]he proof was irrefutable that the Respondent took proceeds of his client\u2019s case for his own use, thereby denying his client that which was justly hers,\u201d and that the respondent made misrepresentations to Bar Counsel in an effort to thwart the investigation. Thus, it submits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMR\">\u201cThis Court has stated that \u2018absent compelling extenuating circumstances, misappropriation by an attorney is an act infected with deceit and dishonesty and ordinarily will result in disbarment.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v.
