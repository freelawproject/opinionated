Medley was sentenced by the trial judge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">I hereby sentence you to fourteen days St. Mary\u2019s County Detention Center, give you credit for fourteen days served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\">In addition to that, you have to pay a fine of a thousand dollars, plus $125 court costs. Fine and costs are due today. And the Court is going to see to it in these fine cases that they are paid, because after all, the jury has to be paid.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-15\">On 7 March 2003, Medley filed a motion to correct illegal sentence, to wit, the $1,000 fine. That motion was denied. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment in an unreported opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b35-16\">We granted certiorari, <em>Medley v. State, </em>383 Md. 569, 861 A.2d 60 (2004), to consider whether the trial judge erred in imposing the $1,000 fine \u201cbecause after all, the jury has to be paid.\u201d Lacking an ability on this record to attribute a connotation to the trial judge\u2019s remark other than its plain meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>denotation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we hold that Medley\u2019s fine was an illegal sentence and reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">A sentencing judge has wide discretion in achieving the principal objectives of sentencing \u2014 punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>364 Md. 192, 199, 772 A.2d 273, 277 (2001) (citing <em>Poe v. State, </em>341 Md. 523, 531, 671 A.2d, 501, 505 (1996); <em>State v. Dopkomki, </em>325 Md. 671, 679, 602 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1992)) (some citations omitted). We may overturn a sentence, however, if we conclude that either: 1) it violates constitutional standards; 2) the sentencing judge was motivated by ill-will, prejudice or impermissible considerations; or 3) the sentence exceeds statutory limits. <em>Jackson, </em>364 Md. at 200, 772 A.2d at 277 (quoting <em>Gary v. State, </em>341 Md. 513, 516, 671 A.2d 495, 496 (1996) (some citations omitted)). In the present case, we are confronted with a record where, taken at face value, the judge linked or justified the thousand dollar fine to reimbursement for jury costs. This objective falls outside the sentencing judge\u2019s statutory authority under then \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, &amp; 4(b) of Article 38 of the Maryland Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00a7 8-106 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Arti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ele,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Maryland Rules 2-509<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 4-353.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"> In reviewing the sentencing judge\u2019s actions, we are mindful that, absent a misstatement of law or conduct inconsistent with the law, a \u201c \u2018[tjrial [judge is] presumed to know the law and apply it properly.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Chaney, 375 </em>Md. 168, 179, 825 A.2d 452, 459 (2003) (quoting <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 206, 699 A.2d 1170, 1194 (1997)). In <em>Chaney, </em>we explained that this foundational principle of law is deeply rooted in a strong presumption that judges perform their legal duties properly. <em>Id. </em>at 181, 825 A.2d at 459 (citing <em>Bank of the United States v. Dandridge, </em>12 Wheat. 64, 25 U.S. 64, 69-70, 6 L.Ed. 552 (1827); <em>Sehowgurow v. State, </em>240 Md. 121, 126, 213 A.2d 475, 479 (1965); <em>Albrecht v. State, </em>132 Md. 150, 156, 103 A. 443, 445 (1918)). Equally important is the companion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>presumption that judges know the law. <em>Id. </em>at 181-82, 825 A.2d at 459-60 (quoting <em>Samson v. State, </em>27 Md.App. 326, 334, 341 A.2d 817, 823 (1975)); <em>Grumbine v. State, </em>60 Md. 355, 356 (1883). Because of these potent presumptions, we are reluctant to find error, opining that the judge misperceives the law, unless persuaded from the record that a judge made a misstatement of the law or acted in a manner inconsistent with the law. <em>Perry v. State, </em>381 Md. 138, 154 n. 8, 848 A.2d 631, 641 n. 8 (2004) (holding that a judge\u2019s comment that he did not have to hold a hearing outside the presence of a jury did not indicate that the judge did not know his legal duty to determine a child\u2019s competency prior to testifying); <em>Chaney, </em>375 Md. at 184, 825 A.2d at 461-62 (holding that judge properly knew and applied the law because he did not misstate the law); <em>Davis v. State, </em>344 Md. 331, 339, 686 A.2d 1083, 1086 (1996) (holding that absent an express ruling to the contrary, a judge is presumed to know and apply correctly the law); <em>John O. v. Jane O., </em>90 Md.App. 406, 429, 601 A.2d 149, 160 (1992) (holding that, \u201c[ujnless it is clear\u201d in the record that a trial judge does not know the law, the presumption remains that the judge knows and applies correctly the law) (citing <em>Lapides v. Lapides, </em>50 Md.App. 248, 252, 437 A.2d 251, 254 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"><em>Chaney </em>reviewed whether a sentencing judge interpreted properly a sentencing statute (former \u00a7 413 of Article 27 of the Maryland Code) for first degree murder, after its death penalty provisions had been excised in <em>Bartholomey v. State, </em>267 Md. 175, 297 A.2d 696 (1972), when the judge did not acknowledge expressly his statutorily-granted discretion to suspend all or a portion of the sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Chaney, </em>375 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>178, 825 A.2d at 457-58. In that case, the judge observed that the only portion of the sentencing statute (\u00a7 413) surviving <em>Bartholomey </em>provided for a life sentence, without mention of the potential of a suspended sentence. He ordered a life sentence without mention of suspension of any part. On appeal to the intermediate appellate court, Chaney successfully argued that the judge ignored case law interpreting other statutory provisions (\u00a7 641 A) allowing a sentencing judge to exercise his (or her) discretion to order a suspended sentence for first degree murder. <em>Id. </em>at 177, 825 A.2d at 457. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that the judge rendered an illegal sentence because he impermissibly did not consider a suspended sentence as being within his judicial discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In reversing the Court of Special Appeals and affirming the original sentence, we held that the sentencing judge was presumed to have acted properly because he did not misstate the law. <em>Id. </em>at 184, 825 A.2d at 461. Absent an express misstatement of the law, the judge was presumed to know the law that allowed him the discretion (under then- \u00a7 641A) to order a suspended sentence \u2014 even though \u00a7 413 was silent as to that. We agreed with the Court of Special Appeals that the judge properly interpreted and stated the provisions of \u00a7 413 of Article 27. We reversed the intermediate appellate court\u2019s judgment, however, because the judge said nothing on the record that evinced he was not aware of his discretion to suspend the sentence under \u00a7 641A. Unlike the Court of Special Appeals, we presumed that he was aware of his discretion under \u00a7 641A and chose not to exercise that discretion to suspend all or any part of the life sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 184-85, 825 A.2d at 461-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">It is clear, after reviewing the statutory provisions relevant to the present case, that the Circuit Court lacked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>authority to levy or set a f\u00edne premised, in whole or in part, on paying for or reimbursing jury costs that may have been incurred because Medley did not waive his jury election until the day of trial. A sentencing judge may assess court costs to a defendant in a criminal trial but, under \u00a7 4 of Article 38, those costs \u201cshall not constitute a part of any fine.\u201d Although Rule 4-353 allows a sentencing judge to levy costs to the defendant, only those sentencing judges sitting in the First, Second, or Fourth Circuits may impose jury costs \u2014 St. Mary\u2019s County lies within the Seventh Judicial Circuit. Md. Rule 2-509. Furthermore, the jury costs permitted by Rule 2-509 are permissible only in <em>civil </em>cases. <em>Gantt v. State, </em>109 Md.App. 590, 598, 675 A.2d 581, 585 (1996). Lastly, jury <em>per diem </em>costs are paid by the State of Maryland, not by St. Mary\u2019s County. Md.Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 8-106. The County would receive the payment of any lawful fine in this case. \u00a7 2, Art. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Unlike in <em>Chaney, </em>the sentencing judge\u2019s statement, \u201cbecause after all, the jury has to be paid,\u201d taken at face value, evinced an incorrect understanding of the relevant law. There is no plausible statutory authority that would allow a judge in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County to order a fine, or set the amount thereof, to pay wholly or in part the cost of a jury. The State maintains before us (having convinced the Court of Special Appeals) that the sentencing judge\u2019s comments should not be taken literally, but rather should be construed as being akin to a glib rendition of the metaphor, \u201cthe piper must be paid.\u201d In essence, the State asks us to perceive a connotation not apparent from the context of this record or to attribute to the remark a legally benign motive found only in some assumed judicial consciousness shared by the trial judge and us. Typically, we will not attribute to the words of a lower court\u2019s opinion or order a sense beyond the plain meaning of language appearing in the record, unless the context supports a different reading. <em>See Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 53 n. 7, 862 A.2d 419, 422 n. 7 (2004) (resolving a conflict between an apparent typographical error in transcribing the oral opinion of the sentencing judge in ordering probation by examining the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>language in the probation order). Acquiescence in the State\u2019s argument is not possible in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Prior to entering a guilty plea, Medley elected a jury trial. The judge, in querying Medley at the plea proceedings regarding the rights he would be waiving, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-18\">Most importantly, Mr. Medley, the Court has available today for you a jury.
