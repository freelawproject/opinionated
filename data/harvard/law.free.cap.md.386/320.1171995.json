For the reasons stated herein, we hold that a person convicted of second degree assault is not required to register as an offender under the Registration of Offenders statute, unless the elements of the crime contain reference to a sexual offense against a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">On July 29, 2002, Richard Wilburn Cain was arrested and charged in the Circuit Court for Calvert County with one count of child abuse,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> two counts of third degree sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>offense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one count of second degree assault.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a proceeding before the Circuit Court, Cain pled guilty on March 11, 2008, solely to the second degree assault charge, upon terms explained by his attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>[CAIN\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Mr. Cain has agreed to enter a plea of guilty to the fourth count of the indictment,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] second degree assault. We would ask the Court to take judicial notice of the charging document within the file. The agreed upon sentence will be a cap of 18 months executed time, backup time and probation in the Court\u2019s discretion, that Mr. Cain will be evaluated to see if any counseling is necessary prior to sentencing, and that the State will be asking that he register under the registration statute, and that we are free to allocute that it does not apply in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">THE COURT: And my understanding is that we are going to have a brief statement of facts in just a minute,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] but let me just make sure that you understand \u2014 or that I understand that you are pleading guilty to second degree assault, which is an unpermitted touching, and that you are pleading guilty to that because you are in fact guilty; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgR\">[CAIN]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">After lengthy deliberation about the date of sentencing, the court confirmed the terms of the agreement and discussed additional terms sought by the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">THE COURT: \u2014 Mr. Cain, I [need to make] sure you understand that the State is going to ask that you register as an offender under the appropriate category and that you have no contact with the victim or the victim\u2019s family. That\u2019s in addition to your standard conditions of probation. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>[CAIN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">THE COURT: Do you also understand that if the Court finds that you have violated your con \u2014 any of the conditions of probation, you could face going to jail for the balance of whatever the sentence was? So worst case scenario if a 10 year sentence was imposed and you are found in violation, the balance of that 10 year sentence could be reimposed. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">[CAIN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">On June 24, 2003, the Circuit Court conducted a sentencing hearing during which Cain\u2019s attorney requested that Cain receive probation and asked \u201cthat Mr. Cain not be made to attend either a sexual offender treatment program or to register as a sexual offender.\u201d With regard to the registration, his attorney argued that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">The registry statute that went into place that the State is attempting to have Mr. Cain register under was really to put people on notice as to pedophiles and sexual offenders\u2014 excuse me, sexual predators. That is not the case that we have here and that is why it is not appropriate in Mr. Cain\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">Mr. Cain has tested with a forensic psychologist who has found him not to register [sic]; and I believe that the portion of the Statute that the State is attempting to register him under should not apply to a case of second degree assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">In addition, your Honor, I think that with the expert opinion testimony weighing so heavily against registering Mr. Cain and the intent of the Statute, and you put those two together, and I do not think registry is appropriate in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">In response, the State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">This issue as to whether he should register in this particular case is under ll-701(d)(7)[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark><em>] </em>as a sexual offender. That</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>[Cain] has been convicted of a crime that involves conduct that, by its nature, is a sexual offense against a person under the age of eighteen years. That falls squarely on this case</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">Yes, this was an Alford plea[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and we agreed that [Cain] could plead under Alford so that he could say \u2014 you know, he could plead to the fact that he touched her thigh and it was unpermitted touching. But that \u2014 even if you take it from the Defense\u2019s perspective, that is still sexual touching of a child under the age of eighteen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The trial judge imposed a five-year sentence for second degree assault with all but one day suspended for time that Cain previously had served and imposed five years of supervised probation with various conditions, including that Cain \u201csubmit to evaluation, attend and successfully complete mental health treatment as directed by [his] supervising agent,\u201d have no contact with the victim or her family, and that he serve \u201ca period of home confinement with the Home Confinement Services, Inc. for a period of six months.\u201d After hearing further argument about the offender registration statute, the Court also ordered Cain to register as an \u201coffender\u201d as a condition of his probation. At the completion of the sentencing hearing, the State then entered a nolle prosequi on the remaining counts of child abuse and third degree sex offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">On December 22, 2003, Cain filed a Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence, contending that the second degree assault conviction did not fall within the definition of \u201coffender\u201d under Section 11-701(d)(7) of the Criminal Procedure Article, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>required registration; the Circuit Court denied the motion. Cain noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court issued, on its own initiative, a writ of certiorari, <em>Cain v. State, </em>384 Md. 157, 862 A.2d 993 (2004), prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court. Cain\u2019s brief presented the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Whether [Cain\u2019s] guilty plea to assault in the second degree was insufficient to justify the judge\u2019s order that he register as an \u201coffender.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">We conclude that Cain does not have to register as an \u201coffender\u201d under Section 11-701(d)(7) of the Criminal Procedure Article and reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s order denying Cain\u2019s Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">When considering who must register as an offender under Section 11-701(d)(7) of the Criminal Procedure Article, an examination of the statute is essential, and we review the trial court\u2019s actions <em>de novo. </em>This Court has often stated that our goal in interpreting statutes is to \u201cidentify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue.\u201d <em>Serio v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 373, 863 A.2d 952, 962 (2004), quoting <em>Drew v. First Guaranty Mortgage Corp., </em>379 Md. 318, 327, 842 A.2d 1, 6 (2003), in turn quoting <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000); <em>Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 57-58, 862 A.2d 419, 425 (2004); <em>Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 346, 772 A.2d 1225, 1235 (2001). As we have stated, the best source of legislative intent is the statute\u2019s plain language and when the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there. <em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 373, 863 A.2d at 962; <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 57-58, 862 A.2d at 425; <em>Drew, </em>379 Md. at 327, 842 A.2d at 6; <em>Beyer v. Morgan State Univ., </em>369 Md. 335, 349, 800 A.2d 707, 715 (2002); <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347, 1350 (1995). Although the plain language of the statute guides our understanding of legislative intent, we do not read the language in a vacuum. <em>See Serio, </em>384 Md. at 373, 863 A.2d at 962; <em>Drew, </em>379 Md. at 327, 842 A.2d at 6; <em>Derry, </em>358 Md. at 336, 748 A.2d at 483-84. Rather, we read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>statutory language within the context of the statutory scheme, considering the \u201cpurpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u201d <em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 373, 863 A.2d at 962; <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 57-58, 862 A.2d at 425; <em>Drew, </em>379 Md. at 327, 842 A.2d at 6; <em>Beyer, </em>369 Md. at 350, 800 A.2d at 715; <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 711, 782 A.2d 332, 346 (2001)(quoting <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590, 594 (1992)). When interpreting the language of a statute, \u201cwe assign the words their ordinary and natural meaning.\u201d <em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 373, 863 A.2d at 962; <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 57-58, 862 A.2d at 425; <em>O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore County, </em>382 Md. 102, 114, 854 A.2d 1191, 1198 (2004); <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1998). We will \u201cneither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in a forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 373, 863 A.2d at 962; <em>Pete, </em>384 Md. at 57-58, 862 A.2d at 425; <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>382 Md. at 114, 854 A.2d at 1198 (quoting <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, </em>365 Md. 166, 181, 776 A.2d 645, 654 (2001)). Thus, the provisions must be read in \u201ca commonsensical perspective to avoid a farfetched interpretation.\u201d <em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 373, 863 A.2d at 962; <em>Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 346, 772 A.2d 1225, 1235 (2001); <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994); <em>Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. 163, 171, 596 A.2d 648, 652 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In this case, Cain argues that the trial court erred by requiring him to register as an \u201coffender\u201d under Md.Code (1957, 2001), \u00a7 11-701(d)(7) of the Criminal Procedure Article. In Cain\u2019s view, his conviction for second degree assault does not fall within this definition of \u201coffender\u201d because assault is not an enumerated offense requiring registration, the elements of assault do not mandate registration and the factual predicate to which he pled guilty, do not establish a violation of the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The State concedes that second degree as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>sault is not a crime enumerated in the statute, but maintains that Cain should be required to register as an offender because the underlying facts establishing the assault were sexual in nature, mandating registration, rather than the elements of the offense. Essentially, Cain argues that the elements of the crime of assault for which he was convicted negate the registration requirement, while the State asserts that the underlying facts to which Cain pled guilty mandate registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The General Assembly originally considered Maryland\u2019s offender registration laws in response to the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Program (\u201cWetterling Act\u201d), which was enacted as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796 (1994), codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071 (2000), to address \u201ccrimes of violence and molestation committed against children in the United States.\u201d H.R.Rep. No 103-392, at 3 (1993). The Wetterling Act directs the United States Attorney General to establish guidelines for registering sex offenders and providing notification of individuals convicted of sexually violent offenses, criminal offenses against minors, or those determined to be sexually violent predators. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071. Each state had until September 13, 1997, to enact legislation implementing a sex offender registration statute in conformity with the federal guidelines or face the loss of certain federal funds apportioned to the states to deter crime. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071(g)(2)(A). In May, 1996, Congress amended the Wetterling Act by renaming it Megan\u2019s Law and required states to add language to their statutes mandating the release of relevant sex offender registrant information necessary to protect the public. <em>See </em>H.R. 2137, 104th Cong. (1996), reprinted in 110 Stat. 1345 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>(1996). The federal act, as interpreted by the Department of Justice, specified that the registration requirements \u201cconstitute a floor for state registration systems, not a ceiling,\u201d and States were afforded great latitude in designing their sex offender registration statutes and the criteria for which a person may be classified as an offender. <em>See </em>Final Guidelines, 61 Fed.Reg. 15110, 15112, <em>as amended, </em>64 Fed.Reg. 572 (1999). To date, all fifty states have adopted some form of sex offender registration program.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In an effort to comply with the federal statute, the General Assembly enacted a statute, entitled \u201cRegistration of Offend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ers,\u201d which provided that sexual offenders, upon release from prison, must notify local law enforcement of his or her presence in the county where he or she intended to live. <em>See </em>1995 Md. Laws, Chap. 142. The Maryland statute defined a \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d as a person who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">(2)(i) Has been convicted of violating \u00a7 35C of this article for an offense involving sexual abuse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">(ii) Has been convicted of violating any of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 462 through 464B of this article for an offense involving an individual under the age of 15 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">(iii) Has been granted probation before judgment after being found guilty of any of the offenses listed in items (i) and (ii) of this paragraph and has been ordered by the court, as a condition of probation, to comply with the requirements of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">(iv) Has been convicted of, or granted probation before judgment after being found guilty of, violating \u00a7 464C of this article and has been ordered by the court, as a part of a sentence or condition of probation, to comply with the requirements of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">(v) Has been found not criminally responsible for any of the offenses listed in items (i) and (ii) of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">(vi) Has been convicted in another state of an offense that, if committed in this state, would constitute one of the offenses listed in items (i) and (ii) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">In 1997, Senate Bill 605 was enacted to expand the sexual offender registration statute to comply with the 1996 amendments to the Federal Wetterling Act, and established additional classifications of offenders subject to the statutory registration requirements, codified in Article 27, Section 792 of the Maryland Code, effective on May 22, 1997. <em>See </em>1997 Md. Laws, Chap. 754. In addition to child sexual offenders, the new registration provisions made Section 792 applicable to \u201coffenders,\u201d \u201csexually violent offenders,\u201d and \u201csexually violent predators,\u201d which were defined individually by category. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>1997 Md.

In addition, the Department is to make the registration statements or information about registration statements available to the public, including posting a current listing of each registrant\u2019s name, crime and other identifying information on the internet. <em>See </em>Md.Code, \u00a7 11-717 of the Criminal Procedure Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The term of an individual\u2019s registration varies based upon that person\u2019s classification under the statute. Sexually violent predators are subject to the harshest mandated registration period and must register every ninety days for life. <em>See </em>Md.Code, \u00a7 11\u2014707(a)(1)(3)\u2014(4) of the Criminal Procedure Article. Whereas, offenders, child sexual offenders and sexually violent offenders must register annually for ten years. <em>See </em>Md.Code, \u00a7 11-707(a)(2) of the Criminal Procedure Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In the present case, second degree assault to which Cain pled guilty and was convicted is not one of the enumerated crimes in the statute requiring registration, such as rape, kidnaping, false imprisonment, or violations of the child pornography statute. <em>See </em>Md.Code, \u00a7 11-701(b)(2) and (d)(1)-(5) of the Criminal Procedure Article. The State asserts, nevertheless, that Cain should be required to register because the facts contained in the statement of facts underlying the assault by their nature constituted a sexual offense under Section 11-701(d)(7). The State\u2019s argument suggests that the facts supporting the statement of charges should trigger the registration requirement under 11\u2014701(d)(7), even if the elements of the charged offense do not establish that the crime involves conduct that is a sexual offense against a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Beyond the enumerated crimes, should the elements of the crime for which Cain pled and stands convicted or the facts that constitute the original charging document prior to indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ment be used to determine the requirement to register under Section 11\u2014701(d)(7) of the Criminal Procedure Article? In formulating the language of Section 11\u2014701(d)(7), the General Assembly chose the words to define an \u201coffender\u201d as one \u201cconvicted of a crime that involves conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense\u201d against a minor. Use of this language suggests that the elements of the crime for which one stands convicted is that to which we must look to determine whether registration is appropriate. To determine otherwise, would be to read the word \u201ccrime\u201d out of the definition and rely solely on the offender\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">This interpretation of the plain meaning of the definition at issue finds support in the statute\u2019s legislative history informed by the federal act\u2019s interpretation. The Maryland Offender Registration Act was first introduced as Senate Bill 605 and originally did not contain a specific category of \u201coffenders.\u201d <em>See </em>1st Reading, S.B.605 (Jan. 31, 1997). The DPSCS submitted a letter to the Senate stating that Senate Bill 605 \u201cwould not bring Maryland into full compliance with the Wetterling Act and subsequent U.S. Department of Justice guidelines ... due, in part, to the bill\u2019s deficiency in specifying all of the crimes against minors covered by Wetterling.\u201d <em>See </em>DPSCS Comments on S.B. 605 (1997) (Feb. 27,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Included among the offenses in the Wetterling Act that Senate Bill 605 did not contain was a <em>crime consisting of any conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against a minor. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071(a)(3)(A)(vii) (2004 Supp.), as amended by Pub.L. 104-145, \u00a7 2, 110 Stat. 1345 (1996); Pub.L. 104-236, \u00a7\u00a7 3-7, 110 Stat. 3096, 3097 (1996) (emphasis added). On April 4, 1996, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) promulgated guidelines interpreting the definition of criminal offenses that consist of conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against a minor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">Clause (vii) covers <em>offenses </em>consisting of any conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against a minor. <em>This clause is intended to insure uniform coverage of convictions under statutes defining sex offenses in which the status of the victim as a minor is an element of an offense, such as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>specially defined child molestation offenses, and other offenses prohibiting sexual activity with underage persons. </em>States can comply with this clause by including convictions under these statutes uniformly in the registration requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"><em>See </em>DOJ, Final Guidelines for the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act (\u201cFinal Guidelines\u201d), 61 Fed.Reg. 15110 (1996), <em>amended by </em>62 Fed.Reg. 572 (Jan. 5, 1999) (emphasis added). Therefore, the <em>elements </em>of the offense were the gravamen of the interpretive guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In an effort to bring Maryland\u2019s registration act in compliance with the Wetterling Act, the House adopted a companion bill, House Bill 343, to broaden the scope of the registration law by changing the term \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d to \u201coffender.\u201d <em>See </em>Floor Report, H.B. 343 (1997). The bill file for House Bill 343 contains copies of both the Wetterling Act and the DOJ\u2019s Final Guidelines, indicating the General Assembly\u2019s awareness of both in drafting the amendments to Maryland\u2019s registration laws. <em>See </em>Bill File, H.B. 343 (1997). The Floor Report for House Bill 343 stated, \u201c[t]his bill is designed to bring the State into compliance with that part of the [Wetter-ling Act] dealing with [child offenders and] sex offender ... [and] expand[s] the types of offenders required to register to include offenders convicted of ... <em>crimefs] that involvef ] conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against an individual under the age of 18 years.\u201d </em>Floor Report, H.B. 343 (emphasis added). On April 5, 1997, House Bill 343 was adopted and set forth the types of crimes that required an offender to register. <em>See </em>H.B. 343. Subsequently, on April 7, 1997, Senate Bill 605 was amended to include the category of \u201coffenders\u201d as provided by the final adopted version of House Bill 343. <em>See </em>Amendment to S.B. 605 (1997). Ultimately, the Governor signed Senate Bill 605 with the new amendments and vetoed the House Bill version as redundant, while noting that both accomplished the same purpose of compliance with federal guidelines. <em>See </em>Letter from the Honorable Paris N. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Glendening, Governor, to the Honorable Casper R. Taylor, Jr., Speaker of the House (May 22,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Obviously, the definition of \u201coffender\u201d in the Maryland statute is derived from the corresponding definition in the Wetterling Act. As explained <em>supra, </em>the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Final Guidelines explained that the Wetterling Act\u2019s provision relating to crimes involving conduct that is inherently a sexual offense was intended to insure uniform coverage of convictions under statutes defining sex offenses and was based upon the elements of the offense. <em>See </em>Final Guidelines, 61 Fed.Reg. at 15112.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In the present case, the elements of second degree assault for which Cain was convicted do not contain reference to a sexual offense against a minor. The statutory crime of assault in the second degree consists of the common law offenses of assault, assault and battery, and battery,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> unless aggravated to the greater offense of first degree assault by the use of a firearm or intent to cause serious physical injury. <em>See Robinson v. State, </em>353 Md. 683, 695-96, 728 A.2d 698, 703-04 (1999). These elements alone do not, necessarily and solely, contemplate conduct that by its nature involves a sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In order to qualify a person as an offender pursuant to Section 11\u2014701(d)(7), there must be something more than an assault. The statute requires that sexual conduct that involves an underage person also must be presented within the crime charged and which the person stands convicted. To hold otherwise would expose individuals to possible registration that have been convicted of crimes that do not include elements related to sexual conduct with a minor, and would interpret the statute in a manner inconsistent -with the General Assembly\u2019s intended coverage of qualified \u201coffenders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Consistent with this view, other state courts have held that individuals convicted of crimes of which the elements do not inherently and facially prohibit conduct constituting a sexual offense, are not required to register as a sex offender. In <em>State v. Chun, </em>102 Hawai\u2019i 383, 76 P.3d 935, 936 (2003), the defendant pled no contest to a charge of indecent exposure for which the trial court ordered him to register as a sex offender under Hawaii\u2019s registration statute pertaining to criminal offenses comprising sexual conduct toward a minor. <em>Id. </em>at 936-37.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant appealed and the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that the crime of indecent exposure did not constitute a sexual offense against a minor requiring the defendant to register as a sex offender. <em>Id. </em>at 942. In reaching its conclusion, the Hawaii Court explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsN\">an offense comprises \u201ccriminal sexual conduct toward a minor\u201d if, and only if the <em>elements of the offense </em>generically describe \u201ccriminal sexual conduct toward a minor.\u201d Accordingly, if a person\u2019s actions entail criminal sexual conduct toward a minor, the prosecution should charge the person with an offense that includes criminal sexual conduct among its elements if it wishes to implicate the provisions of [the state sex offender registration statute].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 942 (emphasis added). The Court further noted that the \u201celements of indecent exposure likewise [did] not entail \u2018conduct that by its nature is a sexual offense against a minor\u2019 \u201d because the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Final Guidelines interpreting the Wetterling Act, upon which the Hawaii statute was taken verbatim, stated that the provision applied to offenses where the victim\u2019s status as a minor was an element of the offense, which indecent exposure did not include. <em>Id. </em>at 942 n. 13 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Likewise, in <em>Sequeira v. State, </em>243 Ga.App. 718, 534 S.E.2d 166 (2000), the defendant pled guilty to two counts of simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>battery, one count of affray<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and one count of public intoxication. <em>Id. </em>at 166. The trial court ordered the defendant to register as a sex offender under Georgia\u2019s registration statute <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> because one of the simple battery convictions involved the defendant placing his hand on the breasts and between the legs of a fifteen year old girl. <em>Id. </em>The defendant appealed and the appellate court held that the \u201ctrial court [had] erred in ordering [the defendant] to register as a sexual offender\u201d because the underlying facts of the battery charge could not be used to establish a conviction for a sexual offense because battery itself was not an inherently sexual offense. <em>Id. See also State v. Goins, </em>151 Wash.2d 728, 92 P.3d 181, 185 (2004) (holding that \u201cbecause the legislature did not classify second degree assault with the intent to commit indecent liberties as a sex offense, the legislature did not see fit to require <em>every </em>person convicted of that general crime to register as a sex offender upon release.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial judge acknowledged that Cain had agreed to plead guilty to second degree assault, which the judge described as an \u201cunpermitted touching.\u201d The State entered a nolle prosequi on the other charges against Cain, relating to child abuse and a sexual offense which left only the elements of second degree assault, i.e. the unlawful application of force to another person, remaining without implication of sexual conduct involving a minor. Accordingly, based upon the circumstances of this case, the Circuit Court erred in denying Cain\u2019s Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence, and that condition of probation requiring Cain to register as an offender under Section 11\u2014701(d)(7) of the Criminal Procedure Article is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO VACATE THE CONDITION OF PROBATION THAT REQUIRES THE PETITIONER TO REGISTER AS AN \u201cOFFENDER \u201d PURSUANT TO MD.
