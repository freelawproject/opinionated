The answer is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">In January, 2003, appellants Dewitt Thomas (Thomas) and his wife, Mallissa, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (City), the Baltimore City Police Department (Department), and Keith Gladstone, a Baltimore City Police Officer, to recover damages arising from an incident in which Thomas was allegedly accosted, assaulted, and arrested by Officer Gladstone, all without legal justification. The initial complaint contained eleven counts, as follows: Count I (Local Government Tort Claims Act); Count II (negligence on the part of Gladstone); Count III (negligent supervision, training, and maintenance of personnel by the City and the Department); Count IV (malicious prosecution); Count V (false arrest and false imprisonment); Count VI (loss of consortium); Count VII (abuse of process); Count VIII (assault); Count IX (battery); Count X (defamation); and Count XI (invasion of privacy).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The alleged facts underlying all of those counts were that, as he was leaving his mother\u2019s home on November 6, 2002, Thomas was stopped by Gladstone, forced to put his hands against the wall, beaten with a stick, handcuffed, arrested, and incarcerated for two hours. In \u00b6 20 of the complaint, which was part of Count I \u2014 the claim under the Local Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Tort Claims Act \u2014 Thomas alleged that Gladstone\u2019s conduct deprived him \u201cof his rights, privileges and immunities <em>under the laws of Maryland.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). In \u00b6 21, he added, in relevant part, that he was deprived \u201cof his right to be secure in his person and was deprived of his rights to be free of punishment and/or other deprivation of liberty without due process of law, to the equal protection under the law <em>as guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Those were the only references in the complaint to any Constitutional violations or to the violation of any rights under Federal law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Conceiving that the allegations contained in \u00b6 21 may have sufficed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the defendants removed the case to the United States District Court and filed a motion in that court to dismiss the action. Appellants responded with a motion for leave to file an amended complaint and a motion to remand the matter to the Circuit Court. Upon the granting of leave, appellants filed an amended complaint in which, in addition to dropping the City as a defendant, they deleted all averments of violations of due process of law, equal protection of the law, and the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Paragraph 20 alleged that Gladstone\u2019s conduct \u201coperated to deprive [Thomas] of his rights, privileges and immunities <em>under the laws of Maryland,\u201d </em>and \u00b6 21 was revised to allege, in relevant part, only a \u201cdeprivation of his right to be secure in his person and he was deprived of his rights.\u201d (Emphasis added). The purely State law claims remained the same, except that, in \u00b6 27, the reference to any duty to train police officers with respect to Federal Constitutional regulations was deleted. The new \u00b6 27 alleged a duty to train officers \u201cin connection with local and state regulations.\u201d On April 9, 2003, the Federal court entered an order granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>the motion to remand, noting in its order that the amended complaint \u201cremoves all federal claims.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Upon the remand, appellants dropped the Department as a defendant and proceeded only against Gladstone. During the trial, the court granted summary judgment to Gladstone on all counts other than Counts I (Local Government Tort Claims Act), IV (malicious prosecution), V (false arrest and imprisonment), VI (loss of consortium), VII (abuse of process), VIII (assault), and IX (battery). The jury found for Gladstone on all of the remaining counts submitted to it except Count VII (abuse of process). On that count, it found for Thomas and awarded damages of $2,500 for past medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Within ten days after the entry of judgment on the verdict, appellants filed a motion to revise in which they sought $35,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees, which they later increased to a request of $41,000. They acknowledged in the motion that their amended complaint was based on Thomas\u2019s \u201cdeprivation of rights, privileges and immunities under the laws of Maryland,\u201d but claimed that, because Article 2 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights makes Federal law \u201cthe Supreme Law of the state,\u201d they were entitled, having prevailed \u201con the state common law ground of abuse of process by a police officer, operating under color of state law,\u201d to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). The court denied that motion, appellants noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and we granted <em>certiorari </em>on our own initiative, prior to any adjudication by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">The question actually raised by appellants is whether the Supremacy Clause in the Maryland Declaration of Rights effectively makes \u00a7 1988(b) a State law. In an argument that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>omitting the mere quotation of \u00a7 1988 in a footnote, consumes less than one page of their brief, they suggest that Article 2 of the Declaration of Rights \u201cadopts Federal law.\u201d It is an interesting question, but one that is not really presented in this case. Appellants cannot prevail because, even under Federal law, \u00a7 1988(b) is inapplicable. Whether that statute has been somehow \u201cadopted\u201d or incorporated into State law by virtue of Article 2 is therefore irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Under the common law \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d applied in Maryland, the prevailing party in a lawsuit may not recover attorneys\u2019 fees as an element of damages or costs unless (1) the parties to a contract have an agreement to that effect, (2) there is a statute that allows the imposition of such fees, (3) the wrongful conduct of a defendant forces a plaintiff into litigation with a third party, or (4) a plaintiff is forced to defend against a malicious prosecution. <em>See St. Luke Evangelical Lutheran Church v. Smith, </em>318 Md. 337, 345-46, 568 A.2d 35, 38-39 (1990); <em>Caffrey v. Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>370 Md. 272, 292-93, 805 A.2d 268, 280 (2002). The only circumstance at issue here is the second \u2014 whether \u00a7 1988(b) allows the court to award counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Section 1988(b) of title 42 provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of ... [section 1983] ... of this title ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 1983, in turn, provides, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\u201c[e]very person who, under color of any statute ... of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Because \u00a7 1983 creates a cause of action only for violations of Federal law that occur under color of State law, <em>Suessmann v. Lamone, </em>383 Md. 697, 710, 862 A.2d 1, 8-9 (2004), to state a claim under that section, the plaintiff must allege that (1) there was a violation of a right secured by Federal law, and (2) the violation was committed by someone acting under color of State law. <em>West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 2254-55, 101 L.Ed.2d 40, 48-49 (1988); <em>Adamson v. Correctional Medical, </em>359 Md. 238, 270, 753 A.2d 501, 518 (2000); <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 193-94, 757 A.2d 118, 135-36 (2000). In the absence of those necessary allegations, the action is not one to enforce a provision of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The closest that the United States Supreme Court or this Court has come to appellants\u2019 position is where a plaintiff has alleged both an action under \u00a7 1983 (or one of the other ten statutes listed in \u00a7 1988(b)) and an alternative State law claim based on the same conduct and has prevailed on the State law claim, with no decision being reached on the \u00a7 1983 claim. As we pointed out in <em>County Exec. of Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Doe, </em>300 Md. 445, 456, 479 A.2d 352, 358 (1984), citing <em>Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984) and <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201c[I]t is undisputed that where a plaintiff asserts alternate grounds for the same relief, one under \u00a7 1983 and the other under state law or a provision of federal law carrying no authorization for attorney\u2019s fees, where he prevails upon the latter ground, and where there is no decision on the \u00a7 1983 ground, federal law ordinarily entitles him to an attorney\u2019s fee award if the \u00a7 1983 ground was substantial and grew out of the same facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">We explained that, in that circumstance, the attorneys\u2019 fee is awarded not because the plaintiff was successful on the State law ground but rather because he/she raised a substantial civil rights issue under \u00a7 1983. Again citing <em>Smith v. Robinson, </em>we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>\u201cConsistent with its desire to promote private enforcement of federal civil rights, \u2018Congress\u2019 purpose in authorizing a fee award for an unaddressed constitutional claim was to avoid penalizing a litigant for the fact that courts are properly reluctant to resolve a constitutional question if a nonconstitutional claim is dispositive.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><em>County Exec. of Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Doe, supra, </em>300 Md. at 457, 479 A.2d at 358 (quoting <em>Smith v. Robinson, supra, </em>468 U.S. at 1007, 104 S.Ct. at 3466, 82 L.Ed.2d at 762).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The rationale for allowing an attorneys\u2019 fee in that situation is entirely lacking when a \u00a7 1983 claim is not even pled. The plaintiff is not then being penalized by the inability to obtain a fee award after proving conduct that would justify such an award under \u00a7 1983, for he/she has failed to present a claim that even potentially could have properly led to one.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">In their initial complaint, appellants alleged conduct which, if proved, could have resulted in an award under \u00a7 1983, and therefore under \u00a7 1988(b) as well. When the case was removed to Federal court, however, they filed an amended complaint that effectively deleted all allegations that rights under Federal law were violated and thereby withdrew any cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983. Their apparent motive was to remove any basis of Federal jurisdiction so that the action could be remanded to the Circuit Court for trial on the State law claims. The consequence of that decision was to give up a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 1988(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> Appellants seek to avoid that result by insisting that the abuse of process claim amounted to a \u201cconstitutional tort\u201d \u2014 a violation of Thomas\u2019s \u201cconstitutional civil rights\u201d under Maryland law. There are two problems with that argument. The first is that abuse of process is a common law, not a constitutional, tort. We have defined abuse of process as occurring \u201cwhen a party has wilfully misused criminal or civil process after it has issued in order to obtain a result not contemplated by law.\u201d <em>Krashes v. White, </em>275 Md. 549, 555, 341 A.2d 798, 802 (1975); <em>1000 Fleet Limited Partnership v. Guerriero, </em>346 Md. 29, 38, 694 A.2d 952, 956 (1997). As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>pointed out in <em>Walker v. American Security &amp; Trust Co. of Washington, D.C., </em>287 Md. 80, 87, 205 A.2d 302, 306 (1964), unlike the tort of malicious prosecution, abuse of process \u201cis concerned with the improper use of criminal or civil process in a manner not contemplated by law after it has been issued, without the necessity of showing lack of probable cause.\u201d Thus, the legality of Gladstone\u2019s conduct in arresting Thomas and taking him into custody \u2014 whether any of Thomas\u2019s State Constitutional rights were violated in that encounter \u2014 is not an element of this common law tort. Thomas has not demonstrated how the misuse of the process, after its issuance, violates the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The second problem with appellants\u2019 argument is that, even if the abuse of process claim did amount to a Maryland Constitutional tort, it would support only a common law action for damages, not a recovery under \u00a7 1983 which, as noted, provides redress only for violations of Federal law. A \u00a7 1983 claim may not be based solely on a violation of State law. <em>Screws v. United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 108-09, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 1038-39, 89 L.Ed. 1495, 1506-07 (1945); <em>Clark v. Link, </em>855 F.2d 156, 161-63 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\">. In \u00b6 27, which was part of the Count III negligent supervision claim, appellants alleged that the City and the Department owed them, and breached, a duty to adequately train and educate police officers \"in connection with Federal Constitutional and regulations.\u201d The alleged breach was of that duty to train and supervise, not of any Federal Constitutional right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\">. It is not clear whether appellants actually filed their amended complaint in the Federal court or merely informed the court of what they intended to file and later filed the amended complaint in the Circuit Court after the remand. The ambiguity is unimportant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\">. Section 1988(b) permits an award of attorneys' fees in actions to enforce any of eleven Federal statutes, one of which is \u00a7 1983. Because we are concerned here only with that section, we shall limit our discussion to that provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
