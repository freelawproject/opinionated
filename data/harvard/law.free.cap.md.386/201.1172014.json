Previously, the personal representative successfully defended against the beneficiaries\u2019 attempt to remove and surcharge him. In this case, we must decide, pursuant to Md.Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol., 2004 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 7-603 of the Estates and Trusts Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> whether the personal representative is entitled to pay counsel fees incurred in that defense from the corpus of the estate. We shall answer this question affirmatively and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Appellants Brian Goldman, personal representative of the estate of Sigmund Stanley Hartz, and Piper Rudnick LLP,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> counsel to Goldman, appeal the denial of their petition for attorney\u2019s fees by the Orphans\u2019 Court for Frederick County. Appellees Carol Hartz, Barbara Hartz Habermann, and Benjamin Hartz (\u201cthe beneficiaries\u201d) are Mr. Hartz\u2019s children and beneficiaries of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Sigmund Stanley Hartz died on April 22, 1996, leaving an estate of approximately $4,456,783. Hartz\u2019s will named as beneficiaries his children and his wife, Natalie Hartz.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The major assets of the estate were: (1) a one-third interest in the common stock of Hartz &amp; Company, Inc. (\u201cCompany\u201d), amounting to a one-half interest in the voting stock; and (2) a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>one-half interest in the Hughes Ford General Partnership (\u201cPartnership\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Hartz\u2019s will named Brian Goldman as his personal representative. Goldman served as Hartz\u2019s personal attorney for twenty-five years. In addition, Goldman served as counsel to the Company, Partnership, and Abraham Cohen, Hartz\u2019s business partner. In naming Goldman as his personal representative, Hartz was aware that Cohen also had named Goldman as his personal representative. Hartz expressly waived any potential conflicts of interest that could arise from Goldman\u2019s representation of his estate, Cohen\u2019s estate, the Company, and the Partnership. The will granted to Goldman, as fiduciary, the power to appoint attorneys without court approval. Section 7.1 of the will provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cI hereby grant to my Fiduciaries ... the following powers, without the need to apply for or obtain any order, ratification or approval of any court, for the exercise thereof, in addition to those conferred by common law, statute, or rule of court: ... To appoint agents to act on behalf of my Fiduciaries, including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants and investment counsel, and to delegate discretionary power to such agents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Following Hartz\u2019s death, Goldman functioned as personal representative of Hartz\u2019s estate. Goldman regularly wrote to the beneficiaries about the estate\u2019s assets and liabilities. Between Hartz\u2019s death and July 1999, Goldman filed six administration accounts, three inventories, and a number of petitions for attorney\u2019s fees in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Frederick County. The beneficiaries did not file exceptions to any of these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">By August 1999, the relationship between Goldman and the beneficiaries had become acrimonious. The beneficiaries were critical of Goldman\u2019s role in the estate\u2019s efforts to enforce a Stockholder\u2019s Agreement, which stipulated that the Company would repurchase Hartz\u2019s stock. After a dispute developed between the Company and Hartz\u2019s estate, one of the Company\u2019s attorneys expressed his concern over Goldman\u2019s conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>of interest. In response, in June 1996, Goldman notified the beneficiaries that he would not represent the estate in the stock repurchase negotiations. The beneficiaries did not object, and they requested that the estate retain Alan Sachs to represent the estate in the negotiations. Over the next three years, Sachs negotiated interim and final stock redemption agreements with the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The beneficiaries\u2019 recriminations against Goldman arose from his efforts as the Company and Cohen\u2019s attorney to transfer ownership of Cohen\u2019s life insurance policy from the Company to an insurance trust. This transfer was necessary to avoid adverse tax consequences. Since 1991, Hartz and Cohen had been aware that the survivor would have to restructure his life insurance policy to avoid these consequences. Goldman executed the insurance trust on April 12, 1999, one month after Sachs executed the final stock redemption agreement. Sachs and the beneficiaries accused Goldman of harming the estate by not informing Sachs of the plan to create the trust and the priority of paying beneficiaries under the trust\u2019s terms. According to Sachs and the Hartz beneficiaries, the trust harmed Hartz\u2019s estate by, among other things, placing the estate at the bottom of the distribution list for Cohen\u2019s life insurance. Goldman asserted that he was precluded by attorney-client privilege from informing Sachs and the beneficiaries of his plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The other source of acrimony was the estate\u2019s Partnership assets. Goldman urged Cohen to exercise his option to purchase the estate\u2019s Partnership interest. Cohen ultimately defaulted on this option, because he could not negotiate a suitable financing agreement. In addition, Goldman repeatedly pressured the Company to pay rent, back rent, and interest it owed the Hartz estate. With Goldman\u2019s consent, Sachs negotiated with the Company to pay the back rent. Later, these negotiations expanded to include an offer by the Company to purchase the estate\u2019s interest in the Partnership. On September 23, 1999, Sachs informed Goldman that the beneficiaries did not want Goldman to participate in the negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The growing rancor culminated in a showdown before the Orphans\u2019 Court. On November 22, 1999, Goldman filed a seventh administration account and a petition for termination of the estate and discharge from liability. The beneficiaries filed exceptions to Goldman\u2019s petition, requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court deny the petition to close the estate, remove Goldman as personal representative, appoint Carol Hartz in his stead, and surcharge Goldman and/or his law firm for damages caused by his alleged breach of his fiduciary duty. Specifically, the beneficiaries requested that Goldman and his firm be surcharged the amount of their fees from March 1 to October 31, 1999. In support of their exceptions, the beneficiaries cited concerns involving the Partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The Orphans\u2019 Court held a hearing on March 13, 2000 and issued an order on March 15, 2000. The court ordered Goldman removed as personal representative, disapproved his seventh accounting, and denied his petition for termination of the estate and discharge of liability. At the same time, the court appointed Goldman special administrator and granted his petition for allowance of interim counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Goldman appealed to the Circuit Court for Frederick County, and the beneficiaries cross-appealed from the denial of the surcharge petition. The Circuit Court found that Hartz was aware when he named Goldman personal representative that there were possible conflicts of interest. The court stated, however, that the level of conflicts eventually \u201crose to a level that Hartz could not have reasonably contemplated or foreseen\u201d and \u201crose to a point where Goldman could not function effectively as Personal Representative for the Estate.\u201d Accordingly, the court ordered Goldman removed as personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The Circuit Court held a hearing to consider the beneficiaries\u2019 request that Goldman and his firm be surcharged. The court denied the surcharge request, because: (1) the Orphans\u2019 Court had approved the fee petitions, indicating that it had found that Goldman\u2019s actions were \u201cfor the benefit of the estate,\u201d and (2) Goldman\u2019s conflict of interest did not consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tute bad faith or gross negligence. The court removed Goldman as special administrator and named Carol Hartz as personal representative of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Goldman appealed his removal to the Court of Special Appeals, and the beneficiaries cross-appealed, challenging the denial of the surcharge request. On July 28, 2003, in an unreported opinion <em>(\u201cGoldman I </em>\u201d), the Court of Special Appeals held that removal of Goldman \u201cwas neither necessary nor appropriate because the record before us indicates that the estate was ready to be closed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the denial of the surcharge request, agreeing with the Circuit Court that Goldman had not acted in bad faith or gross negligence. The court based this holding on two factors. First, it stated, \u201cWe discern no facts recounted, and no findings made, that remotely suggest bad faith on the part of Goldman.\u201d Second, the court concluded that the beneficiaries failed \u201cto show any measurable damages caused either by Goldman\u2019s personal profit from the conflicts of interest or monetary loss to the estate.\u201d The beneficiaries appealed, and we denied their petition for a Writ of Certiorari on December 16, 2003. 378 Md. 615, 837 A.2d 926 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In August 1999, faced with the beneficiaries\u2019 hostility, Goldman retained Piper Rudnick. On November 30, 2001, Piper Rudnick filed a petition for its fees in the Orphans\u2019 Court pursuant to \u00a7 7-602. Goldman signed the petition and, paraphrasing \u00a7 7-603, asserted that he was \u201centitled to receive his necessary expenses and disbursements from the Estate, including attorneys fees.\u201d This fee petition covered Piper Rudnick\u2019s work from August 1999 until June 2001, when the Circuit Court issued its opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The fees amounted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>$589,441.28, based on attorney and paralegal fees of $568,914.00 and expenses of $20,527.28. According to Piper Rudnick, \u201c[o]ver 95%\u201d of the fees were incurred in the firm\u2019s \u201cpreparation for and trial of the case\u201d in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Carol Hartz opposed the fee petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Orphans\u2019 Court held a hearing and denied the fee petition. The court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">\u201cThe check and balance of the Orphans\u2019 Court is that we\u2019re in total agreement that any person in any matter may hire any attorney. Check and balance has always been in the Orphans\u2019 Court since time immemorial, is that the court decides how much that attorney that has been hired gets paid. It is a fair check and balance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">\u201cThe court, in reviewing this matter, also noted that there are no prior attorney fees petitions filed by [Piper Rudnick and Goldman] prior to the one before the court at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u201cNow, in reviewing the matters, defense argued before the court as to whether or not something is \u2014 has a right to appeal, the court does not question anyone\u2019s right to appeal. And it was argued, both sides, very well, that one \u2014 and the court has been faced with the many times; people will not even want to serve as personal representative if, in fact, they are (inaudible) by hostile legatees or hostile family members who want them removed just for the mere pleasure of removing them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cAlso argued well by [Piper Rudnick and Goldman] is that a hostile personal representative is certainly a breach \u2014 or hurt the estate by expenditures of money, thinking that they are right. And I think each case is, of course, obviously, judged on its merit. In that respect, the court has decided that the position for allowances for attorney fees in this matter are hereby denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Piper Rudnick and Goldman appealed the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s denial of Piper Rudnick\u2019s fees directly to the Court of Special Appeals, pursuant to Md.Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2004 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 12-501 (a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (permitting a party to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from a final judgment by an orphans\u2019 court). On September 30, 2003, the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion <em>(\u201cGoldman II </em>\u201d), held that in order for an orphans\u2019 court to decide whether to approve fees incurred by the personal representative in prosecuting or defending proceedings, the orphans\u2019 court must first determine whether the litigation was \u201cfor the protection or benefit of the estate.\u201d Next, the orphans\u2019 court must determine whether the prosecution or defense was \u201cin good faith and with just cause.\u201d Concluding that the Orphans\u2019 Court had not considered whether Goldman\u2019s defense of the beneficiaries\u2019 attempts to remove him met the first prong of this test, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the order and remanded the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">On January 7, 2004, the Court of Special Appeals denied Piper Rudnick and Goldman\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration and Reargument. The court, in relevant part, ordered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u201cORDERED, in keeping with the opinion of this Court, that the Orphans\u2019 Court for Frederick County shall convene a hearing at which counsel for the parties may be heard and present evidence on the question of whether the litigation expenses and fees at issue \u2018were for the protection or benefit of the estate\u2019 of Sigmund Hartz. It is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARV\">\u201cORDERED that when the Orphans\u2019 Court has decided this issue, either party aggrieved by that order may seek appropriate relief in conformity with applicable Maryland rules of civil procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The Orphans\u2019 Court held a hearing on March 24, 2004. At the hearing, Goldman testified that the \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d was his adherence to Hartz\u2019s testamentary intent for Goldman to serve as his personal representative. The court responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201cYeah, but your arguments don\u2019t hold because of those\u2014 well, we\u2019re not going to get into that because the question I asked, you have answered. And I think you\u2019re correct in saying that the wishes of the testator, I think you\u2019re 100 percent correct. And I think, just as a comment from the bench, that you have a responsibility, a fiduciary role to protect the assets so that distribution and awards can be made, I think that you have that responsibility as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The Orphans\u2019 Court denied the petition of Piper Rudnick, stating that \u201cthis Court has determined that the litigation expenses incurred were <em>not </em>for the protection or benefit of the Estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Piper Rudnick and Goldman noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before that court considered the issues, we granted certiorari on our own initiative. 383 Md. 256, 858 A.2d 1017 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The Court of Special Appeals held in <em>Goldman II </em>that \u00a7 7-603 applies only when the personal representative\u2019s defense or prosecution of a proceeding is \u201cfor the protection or benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the estate.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On remand, the Orphans\u2019 Court applied the test set out by the Court of Special Appeal and did not authorize Goldman to pay Piper Rudnick\u2019s fees from the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Before this Court, Piper Rudnick and Goldman make two arguments. First, they maintain that there is no requirement that the defense be \u201cfor the protection or benefit of the estate.\u201d Instead, according to Piper Rudnick and Goldman, \u00a7 7-603 entitles a personal representative to reimbursement as long as the personal representative defends a proceeding \u201cin good faith and with just cause.\u201d In addition, Piper Rudnick and Goldman advocate a <em>per se </em>rule that a personal representative\u2019s successful defense of a removal and surcharge petition meets the requirements of \u00a7 7-603.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In the alternative, Piper Rudnick and Goldman argue that Goldman\u2019s defense benefitted the estate. They advocate a similar <em>per se </em>rule that legal fees incurred in a successful defense against an attempted removal of a fiduciary when the personal representative was not found to have done anything wrong are incurred for the benefit of the estate. The benefit in such situations is that the personal representative has fulfilled the testator\u2019s intent to have him or her serve as the personal representative. According to Piper Rudnick and Goldman, a contrary result would encourage many personal representatives to resign whenever a beneficiary files a petition to remove, because personal representatives would not risk financial responsibility for defending the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The beneficiaries argue that the Orphans\u2019 Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Piper Rudnick\u2019s fee and that the court should be affirmed. They assert that the Orphans\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Court has the authority to award attorney fees that are \u201cfair and reasonable in light of all the circumstances to be considered,\u201d \u00a7 7-602(b), including fees incurred by the personal representative who prosecutes or defends a proceeding \u201cin good faith and with just cause,\u201d \u00a7 7-603, <em>provided </em>that the personal representative engaged in such action \u201cfor the protection or benefit of the estate.\u201d \u00a7 7-401(y).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The beneficiaries reject Piper Rudnick and Goldman\u2019s <em>per se </em>benefit to the estate rule and argue that an orphans\u2019 court\u2019s decision about whether to allow counsel fees is discretionary. They contend that the Orphans\u2019 Court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Goldman\u2019s decision to appeal his removal did not benefit the estate. To support their contention, the beneficiaries makes two arguments. First, Goldman\u2019s success in appealing his removal does not exonerate him from wrongdoing. Goldman had conflicts of interest that the testator could not have contemplated. Second, Goldman\u2019s decisions resulted in the large attorney\u2019s fees. Specifically, the beneficiaries fault Goldman for: (1) not seeking the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s approval prior to hiring Piper Rudnick; (2) not resigning, when he had noted that terminating the estate was in the estate\u2019s best interest and when he offered to resign in return for a release from the beneficiaries\u2019 claims against him; and (3) appealing to the Circuit Court for an extensive <em>de novo </em>trial, rather than appealing directly to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">An orphans\u2019 court is a tribunal of special limited jurisdiction and can exercise only the authority and power expressly provided to it by law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2\u2014102(a); Radc<em>liff v. Vance, </em>360 Md. 277, 286, 757 A.2d 812, 816 (2000); <em>Mudge v. Mudge, </em>155 Md. 1, 3, 141 A. 396, 397 (1928). As such, an orphans\u2019 court has the power to direct the allowance of counsel fees out of the estate only when authorized by statute. <em>Clark v. Rolfe, </em>279 Md. 301, 305, 368 A.2d 463, 466 (1977); <em>Lusby v. Nethken, </em>262 Md. 584, 585, 278 A.2d 552, 553 (1971); <em>Mudge, </em>155 Md. at 3, 141 A. at 397. An orphans\u2019 court must exercise sound judgment and discretion in determining whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>award counsel fees. <em>Wolfe v. Turner, </em>267 Md. 646, 653, 299 A.2d 106, 109 (1973); <em>Lusby, </em>262 Md. at 586, 278 A.2d at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Two statutes authorize the orphans\u2019 court to allow attorney\u2019s fees from the estate: \u00a7\u00a7 7-602 and 7-603.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At issue in this case is \u00a7 7-603, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201cWhen a personal representative or person nominated as personal representative defends or prosecutes a proceeding in good faith and with just cause, he shall be entitled to receive his necessary expenses and disbursements from the estate regardless of the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">We first consider whether a \u201cfor the protection or benefit of the estate\u201d rule is a separate requirement under \u00a7 7-603.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that \u00a7 7-603 requires only that the personal representative acted \u201cin good faith and with just cause.\u201d We hold that Goldman was entitled to receive Piper Rudnick\u2019s fees from Hartz\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">We first address Piper Rudnick\u2019s argument that \u00a7 7-603 does not contain a \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d requirement. We agree with Piper Rudnick that there is no statutory <em>independent </em>or <em>separate </em>requirement contained within \u00a7 7-603 that the personal representative benefit the estate. Our conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>is based upon the plain language of \u00a7 7-603, as well as the legislative history of \u00a7 7-603 and the case law of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Comptroller v. Phillips, </em>384 Md. 583, 591, 865 A.2d 590, 594 (2005); <em>Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 688, 861 A.2d 727, 730 (2004). In ascertaining legislative intent, we first examine the plain language of the statute. <em>Phillips, </em>384 Md. at 591, 865 A.2d at 594. We do not examine the plain language in isolation. Rather, we consider the particular and broad objectives of the legislation and the overall purpose of the statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>If the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, we give effect to the statute as it is written. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">We find that the language of \u00a7 7-603 is plain and unambiguous and does not include an independent \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d requirement. We hold that in order for the personal representative to receive attorney\u2019s fees, the statute requires only that an action by the personal representative be in good faith and with just cause. The statute contains only two limitations: (1) the defense or prosecution must be \u201cin good faith and with just cause,\u201d and (2) the expenses and disbursements must be \u201cnecessary.\u201d <em>See Fields v. Mersack, </em>83 Md.App. 649, 654, 577 A.2d 376, 379 (1990) (noting that \u201cThe plain language of the statute [\u00a7 7-603] makes clear ... that a personal representative may not receive \u2018necessary expenses and disbursements from the estate\u2019 unless he or she \u2018defends or prosecutes a proceeding in good faith and with just cause\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The Court of Special Appeals, in concluding that \u00a7 7-603 requires a \u201cbenefit to the estate,\u201d in effect added language to \u00a7 7-603. We have held that the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 7-603 was to state broadly that a personal representative\u2019s defense of a will was to be at the expense of the estate. <em>See Webster v.

Section 7-401(a)(1) empowers a personal representative, when authorized by a statute or the will, to act without approval by the orphans\u2019 court.

Eisenberg, </em>194 Md. 193, 199, 70 A.2d 40, 42 (1949). Instead, the Code, in a provision detailing disbursements to be included in the administration account, authorized allowance of an administrator\u2019s \u201ccosts and extraordinary expenses (not personal) which the Court may think proper to allow, laid out in the recovery or security of any part of the estate.\u201d Md.Code (1924, 1935 Cum.Supp.), Art. 93 \u00a7 5. This provision dated from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the original 1798 Maryland codification of testamentary law, with only minor stylistic changes. 1798 Md.

Gans, <em>Sources of Maryland Testamentary Law, in </em>18 <em>Transactions: Maryland State Bar Association </em>193 (1913) (discussing the history of the 1798 codification). We construed this section narrowly, holding that an attorney\u2019s fees could be allowed only when the attorney worked to augment the estate or protect it from spoliation. <em>See Gradman v.

In 1969, pursuant to the Henderson Commission\u2019s recommendations, the General Assembly repealed most of Article 93, moved the remainder to a new Article 93A, and enacted a replacement Article 93. <em>See </em>1969 Md.

The Henderson Commission\u2019s Comment to \u00a7 7-602 states that the \u201climited statutory law on this subject is contained in \u00a7 10(Md.). The Commission has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>expanded the procedure, and the reasons, for granting compensation in the form of a counsel fee.\u201d Henderson Commission Report at 119. Article 93 \u00a7 49A is \u201cthe statutory progenitor of \u00a7 7-603.\u201d <em>Webster v. Larmore, </em>268 Md. 153, 170, 299 A.2d 814, 823 (1973). Additionally, as discussed <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7-603 is nearly identical to Unif. Probate Code \u00a7 3-720 (amended 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Over the past century, this Court has articulated a \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d rule in determining whether an orphans\u2019 court could allow counsel fees from an estate,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> although our past opinions do not explain the source of applying such a rule in this context. Indeed, some of this Court\u2019s early opinions articulated a \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d rule without reference to a statutory provision. <em>See, e.g., Knapp v. Knapp, </em>151 Md. 126, 130, 134 A. 24, 25 (1926) (holding, without citation to any statute, that \u201cThe rule in such cases may be stated generally to be that parties intrusted with the administration of an estate may employ counsel to defend any action brought against them, the decision of which might adversely affect the estate, or may employ counsel to institute proceedings for the benefit of the estate, provided there was reasonable ground for instituting or defending the proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">A review of this Court\u2019s decisions prior to 1939 indicates that our predecessors\u2019 use of \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d was rooted deeply in the requirement in Article 93 \u00a7 5 that the attorney\u2019s service was \u201cin the recovery or security of any part of the estate.\u201d Indeed, the term \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d appears to have been an explication of \u201cin the recovery or security of any part of the estate.\u201d For example, in <em>Mudge v. Mudge, </em>155 Md. 1, 141 A. 396 (1928), we held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\u201cWhether an estate should be charged with counsel fees for services rendered in litigation of this general character must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>be determined largely from the circumstances of each particular case, having due regard for the provisions of the statute ... authorizing the allowance of counsel fees where the services are rendered in the recovery or security of the whole or some part of the estate. To be allowable, the services of the attorney, for whom a fee is asked, should, in some way, be beneficial to the estate, either by the enlargement or the protection of it, and not where the only question to be decided is to whom the estate, or any part of it, shall go and in what proportions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 3-4, 141 A. at 397; <em>see also Horton v. Horton, </em>158 Md. 626, 634, 149 A. 552, 555 (1930) (stating that \u201cCounsel fees can only be allowed for services rendered for the \u2018recovery and security of the estate.\u2019 <em>Ex parte Young, </em>[8 Gill 285 (1849)]; Code, art. 93, \u00a7 5. And it is not apparent how services rendered in defending letters of administration, which were ultimately revoked because they were prematurely or improvidently issued, can be said to be for the benefit of the estate\u201d); <em>Koenig v. Ward, </em>104 Md. 564, 566, 65 A. 345, 346 (1906) (holding that counsel fees were not incurred to benefit the estate and explaining that the purpose of the proceeding was not \u201cto recover the estate, or to protect it from spoliation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">With the 1939 amendment to Article 93 \u00a7 5, the statutory basis for \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d appears to have shifted from \u201cin the recovery or security ... of the estate\u201d to \u201clegal services rendered ... to an estate.\u201d The amendment to \u00a7 5 expanded the scope of services for which attorney\u2019s fees could be allowed from \u201cin the recovery or security\u201d to \u201cin the administration or distribution of the estate or in the recovery or security of any part thereof.\u201d 1939 Md. Laws, Chap. 511. With this change, the rooting of benefit to the estate in \u201crecovery or security of any part of an estate\u201d appears to have ceased. Nonetheless, the benefit to the estate rule seems to have migrated to another part of \u00a7 5. Along with the 1939 amendment to \u00a7 5, the coincident enactment of \u00a7 7 appears to have stimulated the rule\u2019s movement. The language of \u00a7 7, \u201clegal services rendered ... to an estate,\u201d became the other statutory support for the benefit to the estate rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The move from \u201cin the recovery or security ... of the estate\u201d to \u201clegal services rendered ... to an estate\u201d is reflected in this Court\u2019s cases from the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s. In <em>Gradman v. Brown, </em>188 Md. 634, 39 A.2d 808 (1944), a guardian and next friend of the legatees sought attorneys\u2019 fees from the estate to pay for the lawyers he employed to except to the executor\u2019s administration account and to appeal the denial of the exception. We reviewed the amendment to \u00a7 5, concluding that the Legislature had changed our rule articulated in <em>Mudge, </em>155 Md. at 4, 141 A. at 397, and <em>Link, </em>174 Md. at 117, 197 A. at 804, that fees could not be allowed for services in the administration or distribution of the estate. <em>See Gradman, </em>183 Md. at 638-39, 39 A.2d at 811. We then turned our attention to the use of the terms \u201clegal services rendered\u201d in Article 93 \u00a7 5 and \u201clegal services rendered ... to an estate\u201d in Article 93 \u00a7 7. We held that as the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred for the legatees\u2019 interests were services \u201cnot rendered to the estate, the Orphans\u2019 Court was without power to allow them a fee.\u201d <em>Gradman, </em>183 Md. at 641, 39 A.2d at 812; <em>see also American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee v. Eisenberg, </em>194 Md. 193, 199, 70 A.2d 40, 42 (1949) (reviewing the amendment to \u00a7 5 and the enactment of \u00a7 7 and stating that \u201cit cannot be supposed that the Legislature, if it had the power, intended that counsel fees shall be allowed for services not rendered to the estate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">While neither <em>Gradman </em>nor <em>Eisenberg </em>used the term \u201cbenefit to the estate,\u201d this Court employed a \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d standard based on \u201clegal services rendered\u201d in <em>Sullivan v. Doyle, </em>193 Md. 421, 67 A.2d 246 (1949). In that case, this Court considered whether an administrator who misled a person into renouncing her right to administer the estate could be allowed attorney\u2019s fees for an unsuccessful defense against removal. In holding that attorney\u2019s fees could not be allowed, we explained that \u201clegal services rendered by an attorney in defending letters of administration which are revoked cannot be said to be for the benefit of the estate.\u201d 193 Md. at 432, 67 A.2d at 251. We then addressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>amendment to \u00a7 5 and the enactment of \u00a7 7 and stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">\u201cThe explicit purpose of this section [\u00a7 7], obviously intended for the protection of attorneys, is to authorize the Court to allow counsel fees only for legal services \u2018rendered to an estate.\u2019 In the case before us the attorney, in defending respondent, did not render any legal services to the estate. He did not either add to or protect the estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><em>Id.; see also Colley v. Britton, </em>210 Md. 237, 250, 123 A.2d 296, 303 (1956) (citing <em>Gradman, Eisenberg, </em>and <em>Sullivan </em>and holding that the attorney\u2019s fee should not have been allowed because no service was rendered to the estate). Thus, by the time of <em>Sullivan, </em>the benefit to the estate rule, formally rooted in the \u201cin the recovery or security of any part of the estate\u201d clause of \u00a7 5, appears to have been grafted firmly onto the \u201clegal services rendered\u201d and \u201clegal services rendered ... to an estate\u201d clauses of \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 7 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">This conception that a \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d was required from the statutory use of \u201clegal services rendered\u201d endured through the 1969 revision of Article 93 in \u00a7 7-602\u2014but not in \u00a7 7-603. As noted <em>supra, </em>Article 93 \u00a7 7, which subsequently became Article 93 \u00a7 10, was the progenitor of \u00a7 7-602. In relevant part, \u00a7 7-602 contains very similar language to \u00a7 7. <em>Compare </em>Art. 93 \u00a7 7 (providing that \u201cFor legal services rendered by an attorney at law to an estate, the Orphans\u2019 Court may ... allow ... such sums as it may deem reasonable\u201d) <em>with </em>\u00a7 7-602 (providing that \u201cAn attorney is entitled to reasonable compensation for legal services rendered by him to the estate and/or the personal representative\u201d). <em>See Clark v. Rolfe, </em>279 Md. 301, 306-07, 368 A.2d 463, 467 (1977) (noting that language from Article 93 \u00a7 10 was \u201ccarried over\u201d into \u00a7 7-602, and, relying upon <em>Gradman, </em>holding that the orphans\u2019 courts may in rare cases allow attorney\u2019s fees to an individual who brings an action against the personal representative \u201cfor the benefit of the estate as a whole\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Contrary to \u00a7 7-602, \u00a7 7-603 does not contain a \u201clegal service rendered ... to an estate\u201d clause, and no decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>this Court has held that the \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d rule was carried over to \u00a7 7-603.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Our conclusion that there is no \u201cfor the protection or benefit of the estate\u201d requirement in \u00a7 7-603 is consistent with the decisions of other state courts interpreting similar statutory language. Although Maryland has not adopted the Uniform Probate Code, \u00a7 7-603 is almost identical to \u00a7 3-720 of the Uniform Probate Code. The Uniform Code provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201cIf any personal representative or person nominated as personal representative defends or prosecutes any proceeding in good faith, whether successful or not he is entitled to receive from the estate his necessary expenses and disbursements including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqK\">Unif. Probate Code \u00a7 3-720 (amended 1993). The only substantive difference between \u00a7 7-603 and the Uniform Probate Code \u00a7 3-720 is that \u00a7 7-603 contains a \u201cjust cause\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Several of <em>our </em>sister states that have adopted the Uniform Probate Code have held that the probate statute does not contain a separate \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d requirement. <em>See Enders v.

Other states have held that \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d is an additional necessary condition along with \u201cgood faith.\u201d <em>See In re Estate of Kolouch, </em>128 Idaho 186, 911 P.2d 779, 786 (1996); <em>In re Estate of Wulf </em>526 N.W.2d 154, 156-57 (Iowa 1994); <em>In re Estate of Flaherty, </em>484 N.W.2d 515, 518 (N.D.1992); <em>In re Estate of Klauzer, </em>604 N.W.2d 474, 481 (S.D.2000). None of these states, however, explain how they derive this requirement from the statute. <em>See Gordon, </em>87 P.3d at 92 (rejecting those cases that hold that \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d is a requirement because \u201cnone explains how or why the benefit to the estate requirement became part of their statutory reimbursement formula, other than to cite to similarly unenlightening precedents, some of which predate that jurisdiction\u2019s adoption of the Uniform Probate Code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Under \u00a7 7-603, a personal representative is entitled to receive necessary expenses and disbursements from the estate when the personal representative defends or prosecutes a proceeding <em>in good faith and with just cause. </em>It is the personal representative\u2019s burden to establish good faith and just cause. <em>See Wulf, </em>526 N.W.2d at 156; <em>In re Estate of Petersen, 570 </em>N.W.2d 463, 466 (Iowa Ct.App.1997); <em>In re Estate of Odineal, 220 </em>Neb. 168, 368 N.W.2d 800, 801 (1985).

For example, \u201cgood faith\u201d has been defined as honesty in fact. In <em>Watkins, </em>the Nebraska Supreme Court defined good faith for the purpose of its probate statute as \u201chonesty in fact concerning conduct or a transaction\u201d and noted that the term \u201cis distinguished from mere negligence or an honest mistake.\u201d 501 N.W.2d at 296 (citations omitted). In <em>Gordon, </em>the Arizona Court of Appeals stated that good faith \u201cgenerally connotes honesty-in-fact accompanied by honorable intentions.\u201d 87 P.3d at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">As we have indicated, <em>supra, </em>the Maryland statute requires \u201cjust cause,\u201d in addition to \u201cgood faith.\u201d Although the Uniform Probate Code does not contain a \u201cjust cause\u201d requirement, several other states have included in their statutes a \u201cjust cause\u201d requirement. <em>See </em>Ind.Code \u00a7 29-1-10-14 (1976, 2000 Repl.Vol., 2004 Cum.Supp.); Iowa Code \u00a7 633.315 (1992, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>2004 Cum.Supp.). <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>235 (8th ed.2004) defines \u201cjust cause\u201d as a \u201clegally sufficient reason.\u201d In <em>In re Estate of Goldman, </em>813 N.E.2d 784 (Ind.App.2004), the intermediate appellate court concluded that \u201c[w]here, as here, the party contesting the validity of a will wins the trial on the merits, the will contest presumably was brought with \u2018just cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The concepts of \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201cjust cause\u201d are intertwined. In <em>Management Personnel Serv. v. Sandefur, </em>300 Md. 332, 478 A.2d 310 (1984), an employment case, we quoted <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>775 (5th ed.1979), which defined just cause in part as a \u201ccause outside legal cause, which must be based on reasonable grounds, and there must be a fair and honest cause or reason, regulated by good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340, 478 A.2d at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">While we hold that \u00a7 7-603 does not contain an independent \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d requirement, we consider whether \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d is a relevant factor for an orphans\u2019 court\u2019s determination of good faith and just cause. An Arizona intermediate appellate court has concluded that while the Arizona probate statute contains no benefit to the estate requirement, whether one <em>acts </em>to benefit the estate is a factor to be considered in assessing good faith. In <em>In re Estate of Gordon, </em>207 Ariz. 401, 87 P.3d 89 (2004), the court discussed the significance of the benefit to the estate concept. Concluding that the determination of \u201cgood faith\u201d is an objective inquiry as opposed to a subjective one, the court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201cAn objective determination of the state of mind possessed by an actor in connection with his conduct is usually accomplished by examining all the circumstances surrounding the conduct. From these circumstances the fact-finder can infer the relevant state of mind which, as regards \u00a7 14-3720 good faith, would be the motive and purposes of the personal representative in conducting litigation and whether she was honest in her dealings. And it is important to note that among the circumstances to be considered would be any subjective expressions by the personal representation re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>garding her motives, purposes, or honesty-in-fact. While not controlling, these expressions are relevant and must also be included for consideration when conducting an objective inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">\u201cIt is in this objective inquiry setting that we find a place for the benefit to the estate concept. An objective method of determining good faith includes considering all relevant surrounding circumstances. Benefit to the estate is one such circumstance that can assist in determining the motivation with which litigation was conducted. Together with all other relevant circumstances, whether the litigation constituted a benefit will help the fact-finder ascertain whether a personal representative litigated in good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201cWe emphasize that the presence or absence of a benefit to the estate merely tends to establish the existence or not of good faith and is only one factor to be considered. It would be inappropriate to treat the concept as an independent requirement that alone could resolve the issue. According it such conclusive effect would constitute engrafting onto the statute an element that the legislature did not include. Our effort, consequently, is to demonstrate that benefit to the estate is merely a helpful investigative aid to a court charged with objectively determining the existence of good faith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 94 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">We agree and conclude that while \u00a7 7-603 does not contain an independent \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d requirement, that concept is a factor to be considered in the objective inquiry into whether the personal representative acted in good faith and with just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">A personal representative whose expenses are incurred in pursuit of his personal interest, rather than a substantial estate interest, is not acting to benefit the estate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The concept of benefit to the estate is not limited to monetary benefits. A personal representative acts to benefit the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>when he or she seeks to effectuate the testator\u2019s intent. In <em>In re Estate of Flaherty, </em>484 N.W.2d 515 (1992), the North Dakota Supreme Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">\u201cA \u2018benefit\u2019 to an estate certainly includes services that bring about an enhancement in value or an increase in the assets of the estate. However, we believe that a \u2018benefit\u2019 to the estate is not to be measured solely in monetary terms, but can also include a personal representative\u2019s good faith attempts to effectuate the testamentary intention set forth in a facially valid will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 518 (citations omitted); <em>accord Gordon, </em>87 P.3d at 94; <em>In re Estate of Hass, </em>643 N.W.2d 713, 720 (N.D.2002); <em>In re Estate of Peterson, </em>561 N.W.2d 618, 624 (N.D.1997); <em>see also In re Estate of Lewis, </em>442 So.2d 290, 292 (1983) (stating that benefit \u201calso includes services that are successful in simply effectuating the testamentary intentions set forth in the will\u201d); <em>Wulf </em>526 N.W.2d at 157 (stating that an action may benefit an estate \u201cif it determines or represents the decedent\u2019s desires and intentions as expressed in the will\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">That a personal representative must defend and prosecute proceedings in order to effectuate the testator\u2019s intent is rooted deeply in Maryland law. We long have held that a personal representative is obligated to defend suits seeking to remove him and that he should not incur the expenses from the litigation. In <em>Ex parte Young, 8 </em>Gill 285 (1849), we addressed whether an administrator who defends against an action to replace her may claim counsel fees from the estate. We analogized the administrator to an executor defending a will, noting that \u201cthe practice of allowing to executors the counsel fees expended in the successful defense of a will ... is well established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We described an executor and administrator as bound by the \u201ctrust and confidence\u201d of the testator and law respectively. <em>Id. </em>286. We then stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u201cWhere this right is contested, what is the party entitled, under the law, to do? His relation to the estate, binds him to defend it. But, in the view of the respondents, he must either engage in the controversy at his own personal cost, or abandon the right. An obstinate and pertinacious claimant thus presenting himself, may drive every legitimate party from the contest, and defeat the whole policy of the law in its selection of the proper person to administer. The prospect of an expensive litigation, may thus avail upon a spurious pretext, to secure to a stranger the administration of an estate to which he can have no claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 286-87. In other words, if courts would not allow personal representatives to pay their litigation expenses from the estate, then a dedicated usurper could initiate litigation and force the rightful personal representative to step down. We then addressed directly the contention that the personal representative\u2019s defense of his position invokes a personal right, rather than a binding obligation. We stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201cThere is no force in the objection, that it is a mere personal right, and the party may elect to claim or abandon it. His election is worthless to him, when you take from him the proper means to assert it. Before he can execute the office with which the law clothes him, he must establish his right to exercise it. If the right is controverted, on grounds over which he has no control, and not occasioned by his own default, and he succeeds in maintaining it when litigated, he is entitled to such costs and expenses as the Court may find he has reasonably incurred; and the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, dismissing the petition, is, therefore, reversed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 287. Thus, we described a personal representative who successfully defended an attempt to remove him as \u201centitled\u201d to his litigation costs, subject to the orphans\u2019 court determination of reasonableness of the expenditures. <em>Id.; accord Sullivan v. Doyle, </em>193 Md. 421, 431, 67 A.2d 246, 250 (1949) (citing <em>Ex parte Young </em>and stating that \u201cThe rule has long been established that where a person has the right to administer upon an estate he is entitled to pay out of the estate reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>able counsel fees incurred in the successful defense of that right\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">It is clear that a personal representative who defends successfully an attempt to remove him or her is acting out of duty. The personal representative is not acting out of personal interest, but rather is acting to benefit of the estate. To hold otherwise, as we stated in <em>Ex parte Young, </em>most often would put the personal representative in an impossible situation, between the obligation to protect the testator or court\u2019s intent and a personal financial predicament. As such, it matters not that Goldman articulated his desire to clear his name as a motivation for his efforts to defend against removal. Goldman was bound as personal representative to protect Hartz\u2019s interest, as Hartz stated in his will, for Goldman to serve as personal representative. Goldman acted to benefit the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We have held <em>supra </em>that \u201cbenefit to the estate\u201d is a factor in the \u201cin good faith and with just cause\u201d requirement. We conclude that Goldman acted in good faith and with just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The beneficiaries argue that Goldman acted in bad faith based on his conflicts of interests. This issue was litigated and decided by the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Goldman I. </em>In denying the beneficiaries\u2019 surcharge request, the Circuit Court found that Goldman\u2019s conflicts of interest did not arise to bad faith. The Court of Special Appeals agreed. The court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding the beneficiaries\u2019 protest to the contrary, we are not at all convinced that the court erred, much less clearly so. We have carefully reviewed the court\u2019s twenty-three page opinion deciding the removal issue. We discern no facts recounted, and no findings made, that remotely suggest bad faith on the part of Goldman. Nor was there offered at trial any undisputed evidence of Goldman\u2019s acting in bad faith, as that term is employed in this context.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxN\">The beneficiaries next advance three arguments for the proposition that Goldman acted in bad faith in pursuing the litigation. We reject each of the beneficiaries\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>First, the beneficiaries assert that Goldman should have sought the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s approval prior to hiring Piper Rudnick. This contention ignores the express language of Hartz\u2019s will, which granted Goldman the power to appoint attorneys without the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s authorization. <em>See </em>section 7.1 of the will granting \u201cFiduciaries\u201d the power to \u201cappoint agents to act on behalf of my Fiduciaries, including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants and investment counsel, and to delegate discretionary power to such agents.\u201d Section 7-401(a) provides that \u201ca personal representative may exercise all of the power or authority conferred upon the personal representative by statute or in the will, without application to, the approval of, or ratification by the court.\u201d Goldman did not need the approval of the Orphans\u2019 Court before retaining counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Second, the beneficiaries argue that Goldman should have resigned rather than defend against removal. They support this argument by citing Goldman\u2019s petition to close the estate, which they claim indicates that there was no need to litigate the removal. They also point to Goldman\u2019s settlement offer, which included an offer to resign. Goldman cannot be faulted for refusing to resign. In pointing to Goldman\u2019s desire to close the estate, the beneficiaries ignore their opposition to closing the estate and the Orphans\u2019 Court decision not to close the estate. Similarly, in pointing to Goldman\u2019s offer to resign as part of a settlement, the beneficiaries ignore the fact that this offer was contingent upon the beneficiaries releasing Goldman from their claims against him. The beneficiaries did not accept this offer and continued their attempts to surcharge Goldman. More importantly, as discussed <em>supra, </em>our aim in <em>Ex parte Young </em>was to <em>prevent </em>beneficiaries from compelling personal representatives to resign; there we were concerned that an \u201cobstinate and pertinacious claimant thus presenting himself, may drive every legitimate party from the contest.\u201d 8 Gill at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Third, the beneficiaries argue that Goldman should have appealed his removal directly to the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Appeals, rather than to the Circuit Court. The beneficiaries contend that this choice resulted in a long eleven day <em>de novo </em>trial and the attorney\u2019s fees. Md.Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2004 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 12-501 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article permits a party to appeal directly to the Court of Special Appeals from a final judgment of an orphans\u2019 court. Section 12-502 authorizes a party to appeal to the circuit court, instead of directly appealing to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Goldman did not act in bad faith by proceeding in a manner authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The other requirement under \u00a7 7-603 is that the \u201cexpenses and disbursements\u201d be \u201cnecessary.\u201d Hartz\u2019s counsel represented at oral argument before this Court that Piper Rudnick\u2019s fees were reasonable and that the amount of the fees was not an issue on appeal. Accordingly, we do not address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY REVERSED.

In the period after Piper Rudnick filed its fee petition, the Orphans\u2019 Court repeatedly approved attorney\u2019s fees for the attorneys the beneficiaries hired to oppose Goldman\u2019s appeals. On January 8, 2002, Carol Hartz, acting as successor personal representative, petitioned the Orphans' Court, noting that Martin, Snyder &amp; Bernstein, P.A. had represented the beneficiaries in opposing Goldman's appeal of his removal and requesting authorization for the firm to continue in that capacity.

On April 25, 2002, November 13, 2002, May 5, 2003, and October 28, 2003, Carol Hartz petitioned the Orphans' Court for allowance of interim attorney\u2019s fees for Martin, Snyder &amp; Bernstein, P.A.

Dobler, </em>97 Md. 555, 558, 560, 55 A. 704, 705-06 (1903).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\">. At the end of this review of this Court\u2019s case law on the \"benefit to the estate\u201d rule, we note four cases that apply a \"benefit to the estate\u201d rule, but apparently outside the statutory concept we have discussed <em>supra. </em>In these four cases, this Court held that a personal representative must pay court costs because the appeal did not benefit the estate and the awarding of costs is discretionary. <em>See Alston v. Gray, </em>303 Md. 163, 169, 492 A.2d 900, 903 (1985); <em>Webster v. Larmore, </em>270 Md. 351, 354, 311 A.2d 405, 406-07 (1973); <em>Hayman v. Messick, </em>252 Md. 384, 393, 249 A.2d 695, 700 (1969); <em>Watkins v. Barnes, </em>203 Md. 518, 526, 102 A.2d 295, 299 (1954). We do not consider these cases persuasive in our determination of the applicability of a \"benefit to the estate\u201d rule to \u00a7 7-603, because these cases do not cite to any authority for their employment of a \"benefit to the estate\u201d rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\">. As originally enacted, Article 93 \u00a7 7-603 contained the Uniform Probate Code's phrase \u201cwhether successful or not.\u201d 1966 Md. Laws, Chap. 200, \u00a7 1. When the Legislature repealed Article 93 and reenacted it as the Estates and Trusts Article, the Legislature changed \"whether successful or not\u201d to \u201cregardless of the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d 1974 Md. Laws, Chap. 11, \u00a7 2. The Revisor's Note indicates that the only changes to the statute were stylistic and linguistic. Md.Code (1974), \u00a7 7-603 of the Estates and Trusts Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\">. For example, we have held that an executor claiming money or property from an estate may not be allowed attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Hayden v. Stevens, </em>179 Md. 16, 19, 16 A.2d 922, 923 (1940) (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>under Md.Code (1939), Art. 93 \u00a7 5, that the executor advancing his own personal claim against the estate was not acting \u201cfor and on behalf of the estate\u201d). We also have held that administrators who are aware that their letters of administration were granted prematurely or improvidently are not entitled to counsel fees from the estate, because they pursued their personal interests and did not benefit the estate. <em>See Sullivan v. Doyle, </em>193 Md. 421, 431-32, 67 A.2d 246, 249-51 (1949) (holding that the letters of administration granted to a person who misled decedent's daughter into renouncing her right to administer the estate should have been revoked and that counsel fees should not have been allowed); <em>Horton v. Horton, </em>158 Md. 626, 633-35, 149 A. 552, 554-56 (1930) (affirming the revocation of a person\u2019s appointment and holding under Article 93 \u00a7 5 that she was not entitled to counsel fees, because she knew that the other potential administrators had not received notice of her application for letters of administration).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Other state courts have held that a personal representative who incurs counsel fees in pursuit of his or her personal interest does not benefit the estate. <em>See In re Estate of Estes, </em>134 Ariz. 70, 654 P.2d 4, 14 (1982); <em>In re Estate of Stephens, </em>117 Ariz. 579, 574 P.2d 67, 73 (1978); <em>In re Estate of Painter, </em>671 P.2d 1331, 1334 (Colo.App.1983); <em>In re Estate of Eliasen, </em>105 Idaho 234, 668 P.2d 110, 117 (1983); <em>In re Estate of Kolouch, </em>128 Idaho 186, 911 P.2d 779, 786 (1996); <em>In re Estate of Wulf, </em>526 N.W.2d 154, 156-57 (Iowa 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The Comment accompanying the Henderson Commission\u2019s proposed \u00a7 7-603 supports the position that personal representatives acting in pursuit of their personal interest are not acting to benefit the estate and are unlikely to be acting in good faith. The Henderson Commission's Comment stated, \u201cLitigation prosecuted by a personal representative for the primary purpose of enhancing his prospects for compensation would not be in good faith. This follows [\u00a7 3-720 of the Uniform Probate Code] and represents the Maryland law. See \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 49A (Md.).\u201d Henderson Commission Report at 120. Section 6 was the former Article 93 \u00a7 5 cited in <em>Hayden, Horton, </em>and <em>Sullivan. See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol.), Art. 93 \u00a7 6. The first sentence of the Henderson Commission\u2019s Comment is a verbatim quote from the Editorial Board Comment to \u00a7 3-720 of the Uniform Probate Code. Other states have cited the Uniform Probate Code\u2019s Comment in holding that a personal representative who pursued his personal interest did not act in good faith. <em>See In re Estate of Odineal, </em>220 Neb. 168, 368 N.W.2d 800, 801, 804 (1985) (citing the Uniform Probate Code's Comment as quoted in Nebraska's statute and holding that the trial court could determine that a personal representative did not act in good faith when the legal work was aimed only at generating a fee); <em>Oliver v. City of Larimore, </em>540 N.W.2d 630, 634 (N.D.1995) (relying on the Uniform <em>\u2019 </em>Probate Code\u2019s Comment and holding that a personal representative was not entitled to counsel fees for one of the law firms he hired, because that law firm pursued his personal interest in increasing his commissions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\">.
