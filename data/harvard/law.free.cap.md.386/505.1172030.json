The third amended complaint, seeking compensatory damages only, alleged simple negligence on the parts of at least seven individuals employed in various capacities by the Frederick County Department of Parks and Recreation. The defendants included: Paul Dial, Director of Parks; \u201cBob\u201d Failor, Capital Improvement Administrator; Deborah Spalding, Recreation Superintendent; Earl Eyler, Park Superintendent; and James Gist, Safety Inspector (collectively referred to here as \u201cAppellees\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellees moved to dismiss, or for summary judgment. One of the grounds argued in support of the motion was public official immunity. At the conclusion of a hearing on 17 March 2004, the Circuit Court effectively granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees on that ground,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>judgment was entered the following day. Appellant noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Before the intermediate appellate court could consider the appeal, however, this Court, on its initiative, issued a writ of certiorari to consider whether Appellees are \u201cpublic officials\u201d entitled to assert the defense of qualified public official immunity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">We shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">There being no argument tendered here that a genuine dispute of material fact was generated in the Circuit Court on the question of public official immunity, we recite the facts as alleged by Appellants, as the non-moving parties below, giving them the benefit of any reasonable inferences. On 16 January 1999, Amelia was sledding with her father at Pinecliff Park in Frederick, Maryland. The sledding/toboggan run (\u201cSlope\u201d) at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Pinecliff Park, including the land and improvements, is owned by Frederick County, Maryland, and maintained by the Frederick County Department of Parks and Recreation for public recreational use. Amelia\u2019s toboggan veered off the Slope and collided with a tree, resulting in significant physical injuries to her. She was flown by helicopter to the Shock Trauma Unit at the University of Maryland School of Medicine where she underwent two major operations, followed by months of physical therapy and rehabilitation. She continues to have permanent physical disabilities as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">In their complaint, Appellants alleged, in separate counts as to each Appellee, respectively, that he or she was negligent in maintaining an inherently dangerous facility, failing to prevent use of the slope, failing to warn the public that the slope was inherently dangerous due to icy conditions, failing to hire competent people to maintain the slope, and failing to assure that the slope was safe for public use, all of which were alleged to be the proximate cause of Amelia\u2019s injuries. As noted earlier, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees on the sole ground of public official immunity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellants contended that Appellees were mere government employees and, therefore, not entitled to assert this defense. The trial judge, however, stated that \u201c... the Court does find that the [Appellees] ... by their conduct the [Appellants] are alleging that [Appellees] are exercising some portion of the sovereign power of the state. And furthermore, clearly alleges to me that [Appellees] were performing discretionary as opposed to ministerial acts\u201d entitling them to assert public official immunity, as permitted by the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">A motion for summary judgment may be granted where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [the moving] party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501. \u201cAn appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo.\u201d Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 579, 831 A.2d 18, 24 (2003) (citations omitted). \u201cThe trial court will not determine any disputed facts, but rather makes a ruling as a matter of law. The standard of appellate review is whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, this Court first determines whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists. <em>Id. </em>If no such dispute exists, we proceed to review determinations of law. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe facts properly before the court, and any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them will be construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579-80, 831 A.2d at 24. The only issue presented in this case is whether Appellees are public officials, a question of law, which we review <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> See Muthukumarana v. Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 447, 478-80, 805 A.2d 372, 390-91 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Appellants maintain that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that Appellees were public officials entitled to the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>of public official immunity for merely negligent performance (or non-performance) of their duties. For the following reasons, we agree with Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In <em>Muthukumarana, </em>we outlined the doctrine of common law public official immunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">At common law, a government actor will enjoy qualified immunity from liability for his or her non-malicious acts where: (1) he is a public official rather than a mere government employee or agent; and (2) his tortious conduct occurred while he was performing discretionary, as opposed to ministerial, acts in furtherance of his official duties. <em>Ashbum v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 622, 510 A.2d 1078, 1080 (1986) (quoting <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 323, 418 A.2d 1173, 1178 (1980)) (emphasis omitted). <em>See also Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 704-05, 785 A.2d 726, 734 (2001) (quoting James). Once it is established that the individual is a public official and the tort was committed while performing a duty which involves the exercise of discretion, a qualified immunity attaches; namely, in the absence of malice, the individual involved is free from liability. <em>Lovelace, </em>366 Md. at 705, 785 A.2d at 734 (quoting James).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\"><em>Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 479, 805 A.2d at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In <em>James, </em>this Court established four guidelines to aid in the analysis of whether a particular individual is a public official for purposes of common law immunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">(i) whether the position was created by law and involves continuing and not occasional duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">(ii) whether the holder performs an important public duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">(iii) whether the position calls for the exercise of some portion of the sovereign power of the State; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\">(iv) whether the position has a definite term for which a commission is issued and a bond or oath are required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-12\"><em>James, </em>288 Md. at 324, 418 A.2d at 1178 (citing <em>Duncan v. Koustenis, </em>260 Md. 98, 105, 271 A.2d 547, 550 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>These four guidelines are not exclusive, nor do they carry equal weight in the analysis; rather, they are employed using the specific facts and circumstances of each individual\u2019s position. James, 288 Md. at 324, 418 A.2d at 1178. Moreover, even if an individual\u2019s position does not satisfy the guidelines, that individual may be \u201cnevertheless considered a public official\u201d if he or she meets one of the two additional scenarios provided in <em>Duncan. Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 479-80, 805 A.2d at 391 (quoting <em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 106, 271 A.2d at 551, (citation omitted)). Those scenarios are an individual who exercises \u201ca large portion of the sovereign power of government\u201d or \u201ccan be called on to exercise police powers as a conservator of the peace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 106, 271 A.2d at 551) (citation omitted) (emphasis omitted). <em>See also James, </em>288 Md. at 324-25, 418 A.2d at 1178-79 (quoting <em>Duncan).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"> Applying the guidelines to the analysis of the record, such as it is, in the present case, we conclude that Appellees are not public officials. A position \u201ccreated by law\u201d means that: (a) the office was created by Constitutional or legislative enactment, such as a statute or local ordinance; (b) an oath is generally prescribed; and (c) a commission is issued. <em>See Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 108, 271 A.2d at 552. <em>See also Gary v. Bd. of Trustees of Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>223 Md. 446, 451, 165 A.2d 475, 478 (1960). There is nothing in this present record to indicate that the positions of Director of Parks, Capital Improvement Administrator, Recreation Superintendent, Park Superintendent and Safety Inspector, respectively, were positions \u201ccreated by law,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201chave a definite term for which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>commission is issued,\u201d or \u201crequire a bond or an oath.\u201d <em>James, </em>288 Md. at 324, 418 A.2d at 1178. The parties concede that the Appellees perform important public duties within the meaning of Duncan.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 105, 271 A.2d at 550. There is some dispute, however, as to whether the Appellees \u201cexercise some portion of the sovereign power of the State.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 105, 271 A.2d at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Appellants contend that Appellees are \u201cmere\u201d local government employees. Appellees, however, argue that Appellees have \u201ceach been sued because their job titles reflect policy-making duties (exercising a portion of the State\u2019s sovereignty).\u201d Appellees also argue that Appellants sued Appellees \u201cbecause of their ability to make important policy.\u201d As stated by this Court in <em>Carder v. Steiner, </em>225 Md. 271, 276, 170 A.2d 220, 222 (1961), \u201c[ijmmunity from liability rests not on the dignity of the office but rather upon the nature of the function exercised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The Circuit Court\u2019s express rationale for granting summary judgment in favor of Appellees was its perception that they \u201cexercise some portion of the sovereign power of the State.\u201d Appellees, however, on this record, do not appear to be vested with any sovereign power. Sovereign power, in its simplest terms, means \u201cthe power to make and enforce laws.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1430 (8th ed.2004). As stated in <em>Duncan, </em>sovereign power generally contemplates someone serving \u201cin a legislative or policymaking capacity.\u201d 260 Md. at 106, 271 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>A.2d at 551. In <em>Duncan, </em>a public school teacher was not considered to possess sovereign power because he \u201cd[id] not make rules and regulations or determine county education policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Using a similar touchstone here, Appellees do not satisfy this requirement because, by the nature of their duties, they do not make park rules, regulations, or policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, they execute the policies determined and adopted by the Frederick County Parks and Recreation Commission, the body to which these powers are committed. <em>See supra </em>n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Because Appellees\u2019 positions do not satisfy a majority of the analytical guidelines found in <em>Duncan, </em>we look next to the additional scenarios where an individual may be \u201cnevertheless considered to be a public official.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 106, 271 A.2d at 551. The first requires that the individual exercise \u201ca large portion of the sovereign power of government.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 106, 271 A.2d at 551. As noted earlier, Appellees cannot satisfy this exception because they do not exercise any sovereign power of the State or Frederick County-</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Appellees do not qualify as public officials under the second scenario because they are not \u201ccalled on to exercise police powers as a conservator of the peace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, Appellees do not serve in the capacity of any position the same as or similar to any previously held by us to come within this description. <em>See Livesay v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 1, 862 A.2d 33 (2004) (corrections officer); <em>Williams v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 753 A.2d 41 (2000) (police officer); <em>Carder v. Steiner, </em>225 Md. 271, 170 A.2d 220 (1961) (prison guard); <em>Clark v. Ferling, </em>220 Md. 109, 151 A.2d 137 (1959) (prison superintendent); <em>Harris v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>151 Md. 11, 133 A. 888 (1926) (park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>policeman); and <em>Cocking v. Wade, </em>87 Md. 529, 40 A. 104 (1898) (sheriff). Furthermore, to the extent that Appellees exercise any authority, such has not been shown on this record to be characterized fairly as in the nature of \u201cpolice power or conservator of the peace.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>260 Md. at 106, 271 A.2d at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Accordingly, we conclude, on the state of this record, that Appellees are not \u201cpublic officials\u201d and may not assert as a defense common law public official immunity. We therefore need not address whether the conduct attributed to Appellees involved discretionary (and performed within the scope of their official duties) or ministerial acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; APPELLEES TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\">. Additional defendants were named, but they were dismissed by consent prior to the ruling on the motion affecting Appellees. The dismissal of the other defendants is not challenged in the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\">. The trial judge stated, \"I have listened carefully to the arguments of both counsel and I have reviewed the documents, the motions as well as the memoranda.\u201d The record also reflects that a supporting affidavit was filed by Appellees with their motion, that its contents were raised in argument by counsel at the motions hearing, and that those contents were relied on by the trial judge in ruling. Therefore, although the trial judge said \"... and therefore I will grant the motion to dismiss,\u201d her action was in fact the grant of a motion for summaty judgment. When a trial judge considers matters presented outside the four corners of the complaint, a motion to dismiss is converted to a motion for summary judgment, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-322(b, c), 2-501. <em>See Converge Servs. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>Group, LLC v.

On 29 March 2004, however, within 10 days of entry of the trial court\u2019s judgment (see Md. Rule l-203(a) for computation of time in such a circumstance), Appellants filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Md. Rule 2-534 and a motion for a new trial pursuant to Md. Rule 2-533; both were denied on 11 May 2004. Md. Rule 8-202(c) extends the time for filing an appeal to 30 days after entry of the order disposing of the post-judgment motion.
