D.D. was found to be in possession of a concealed loaded handgun and charged by petition with violation of Penal Code sections 25400, subdivision (a)(2), and 25850, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> D.D.\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence was denied, and the petition\u2019s allegations were found true. The juvenile court also found the offenses to be mandatory felonies pursuant to subdivision (c)(4) of sections 25400 and 25850. In the published portion of this opinion we conclude that D.D.\u2019s offenses were not automatically felonies by virtue of his status as a minor, and therefore we reverse and remand for the juvenile court to determine the applicable subdivisions of sections 25400 and 25850 and designate the offenses as either misdemeanors or felonies accordingly. In the nonpublished portion of the opinion, we affirm the denial of D.D.\u2019s motion to suppress and strike the designation of a maximum term of confinement from the disposition order.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">On November 5, 2013, the San Francisco District Attorney filed a Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, subdivision (a) juvenile wardship petition on behalf of D.D., alleging he violated sections 25850, subdivision (a) (carrying a loaded firearm in public) and 25400, subdivision (a)(2) (carrying a concealed firearm). Both offenses were identified as felonies on the petition. D.D.\u2019s motion to suppress evidence was heard in conjunction with the jurisdictional hearing (Hon. Susan M. Breall), and the following evidence was adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">On November 1, 2013, San Francisco Police Officer Duncan Duffin and his partner, Officer Francisco Chicas, were working as a robbery abatement team. A series of armed and unarmed robberies had been committed within two blocks of the Glen Park and Balboa Park BART stations, mostly by young males (teenage or in their early 20\u2019s) who were wearing loose-fitting, dark-colored hooded sweatshirts or pullovers and pants. About 4:00 p.m., the uniformed officers were patrolling the area around the Balboa Park station in an unmarked vehicle. They saw two teenage males wearing hooded sweatshirts and blue jeans standing in front of a parked Pontiac Grand Prix in a San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) employee parking lot near a Muni maintenance yard. The lot had signs indicating it was for Muni employees only and prohibiting trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">The officers pulled over, and Duffin noticed smoke in the vicinity of the young men (D.D. &amp; K.H.). He also saw D.D. look directly at the officers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>then turn and enter the front passenger\u2019s side of the Grand Prix. As the officers exited their car and approached the young men, Duffin smelled a strong odor of marijuana. He asked K.H., \u201cWho has got the weed?\u201d K.H. admitted having marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Puffin motioned with his hand for D.D. to exit the Grand Prix. When D.D. got out, Duffin asked for his name and identification. D.D. provided a false name<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and said he did not have identification. Dispatch had no record for the name given by D.D. D.D. was advised that Duffin and Chicas were investigating a series of robberies in the area. D.D. denied having any weapons on his person and did not tell Duffin who owned the Grand Prix. When asked why he was on Muni property, D.D. answered hesitantly and avoided the question. D.D. appeared apprehensive and nervous, and he kept looking left and right, up and down the street without making eye contact with Duffin. As D.D. moved around, he kept repositioning his right hip away from Duffin: D.D. stood in a \u201cbladed\u201d stance, with one foot forward and one foot in the back at about a 45 degree angle and, as Duffin moved, he would pivot so his right hip was always pointed away from the officer. Duffin testified that, based on his experience and training, he believed D.D. was carrying a weapon on his right hip.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Duffin decided to search D.D. for weapons out of concern for the officers\u2019 safety. D.D. placed his hands on the back of his head, and Duffin used his left hand to secure D.D.\u2019s hands. Using his right hand, Duffin lifted the right side of D.D.\u2019s sweatshirt and saw a semiautomatic black handgun on D.D.\u2019s right hip, tucked into his waistband. Duffin removed the gun, placed it on the ground, and arrested D.D. Chicas examined the gun, a semiautomatic nine-millimeter Glock pistol, and determined that it was loaded with a live round in the chamber. It was stipulated that D.D. was 15 years old at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Judge Breall expressly found Duffin credible, denied D.D.\u2019s motion to suppress, and found the petition\u2019s allegations true. The court then found that the crimes were mandatory felonies pursuant to subdivision (c)(4) of sections 25400 and 25850. The case was transferred to the Alameda County Superior Court for disposition, where Judge Armando G. Cuellar, Jr., placed D.D. on probation and released him to live with his mother on electronic monitoring. Judge Cuellar also declared an eight-year maximum term of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">A. <em>Motion to Suppress</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">B. <em>Designation of D.D. \u2019s Offenses as Felonies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">D.D. argues that the San Francisco juvenile court erred in designating his offenses as felonies. He argues the court misinterpreted the statutory scheme and erroneously concluded that the offenses were mandatory felonies. He further argues the case must be remanded to redesignate the offenses as either felonies or misdemeanors. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">We decide issues of statutory interpretation de nova. <em>(In re M.W. </em>(2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 1, 4 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 545].)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">1. <em>Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Section 25400 provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of carrying a concealed firearm when the person does any of the following; [\u00b6]... [(f] (2) Carries concealed upon the person any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person. [\u00b6]... [1] (c) Carrying a concealed firearm in violation of this section is punishable as follows: [\u00b6] . . . [][] (4) <em>If the person is not in lawful possession of the firearm or the person is within a class of persons prohibited from possessing or acquiring a firearm pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 29800) or Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 29900) of Division 9 of this title, or Section 8100 or 8103 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, as a felony. </em>[\u00b6]... [][] (6) If both of the following conditions are met, by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170, or by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment: [\u00b6] (A) The pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person is loaded, or both it and the unexpended ammunition capable of being discharged from it are in the immediate possession of the person or readily accessible to that person. [|] (B) The person is not listed with the Department of Justice pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 11106 as the registered owner of that pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person. [fJ[] (7) In all cases other than those specified in paragraphs (1) to (6), inclusive, by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year, by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>In other words, a violation of section 25400 is a felony offense under subdivision (c)(4), a misdemeanor offense under subdivision (c)(7), and an alternate felony/misdemeanor, commonly known as a \u201cwobbler\u201d offense,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under subdivision (c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Section 25850, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of carrying a loaded firearm when the person carries a loaded firearm on the person or in a vehicle while in any public place or on any public street in an incorporated city or in any public place or on any public street in a prohibited area of unincorporated territory.\u201d Subdivision (c) of section 25850 is substantively identical to subdivision (c) of section 25400 except the phrase \u201cconcealed firearm\u201d is replaced with \u201cloaded firearm\u201d and section 25850, subdivision (c) does not include the language in section 25400\u2019s subdivision (c)(6)(A). As with section 25400, section 25850 may be a felony, a misdemeanor, or a wobbler depending on the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\u201cAs used in Section 25400, \u2018lawful possession of the firearm\u2019 means that the person who has possession or custody of the firearm either lawfully owns the firearm or has the permission of the lawful owner or a person who otherwise has apparent authority to possess or have custody of the firearm.\u201d (\u00a7 16750, subd. (a).) As used in section 25850, \u201c \u2018lawful possession of the firearm\u2019 means that the person who has possession or custody of the firearm either lawfully acquired and lawfully owns the firearm or has the permission of the lawful owner or person who otherwise has apparent authority to possess or have custody of the firearm.\u201d (\u00a7 16750, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Additional statutes govern possession of firearms and ammunition by minors. Section 29610 provides that \u201c[a] minor shall not possess a pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and violation of this statute is a wobbler, punishable \u201c[b]y imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 or in a county jail.\u201d (\u00a7 29700, subd. (a).) Section 29650 prohibits minors from possessing live ammunition, and section 29655 establishes exceptions similar to those in section 29615. A violation of section 29650 is a misdemeanor or, if certain prior offenses are proved, a wobbler. (\u00a7 29700, subds. (a)(1) \u2014 (2), (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">2. <em>Juvenile Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">The prosecutor argued that D.D.\u2019s violations of sections 25400, subdivision (a)(2) and 25850, subdivision (a) were mandatory felonies under subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>(c)(4) of each section. He argued D.D. was \u201cnot in lawful possession of [the] firearm or . . . [wa]s within a class of persons prohibited from possessing or acquiring a firearm\u201d because, as a minor, D.D. was prohibited from possessing the gun pursuant to section 29610 and none of the exceptions of section 29615 were applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">D.D. argued section 29610 could not support application of subdivision (c)(4) of either section 25400 or 25850, because section 29610 has its own punishment provision (\u00a7 29700 [designating it a wobbler offense]). Instead, the violations of sections 25400 and 25850 were punishable either as wobblers or as mandatory misdemeanors under subdivision (c)(6) or (7) of the respective statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Judge Breall found, \u201cCount one, [D.D.] did commit a felony, a violation of section 25850(a) ... in that the minor did unlawfully carry a loaded firearm ... on his person while in a public place, . . . <em>[which] is punishable under . . . section 25850(c)(4). </em>[\u00b6] ... I am not exercising any punishment here. . . . But I am making that finding, and I believe I have to do that as I am reading the case law. [(J[] I also find the offense is a felony, <em>it is a non-wobbler. </em>I also find that the allegation ... in count 2 has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and it is a felony. And I understand these cases can be charged as felonies or misdemeanors. And I should state that I know that and I understand that, for the record, and <em>I understand my discretion for the record. </em>[(j[] But I am finding that this is a felony, a violation of section 25400(a)(2) . . . and that the minor did unlawfully carry[,] concealed upon his person, a firearm . . . , which is <em>punishable under. . . section 25400(c)(4). </em>[\u00b6] <em>I do find that he is in a class of people prohibited from owning or possessing such a firearm </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">These statements are far from clear. While the juvenile court seemed to indicate that it was exercising discretion in finding the offenses to be felonies, it then explicitly applied subdivision (c)(4) of both sections 25400 and 25850, which mandate felony treatment, apparently relying on section 29610\u2019s prohibition of possession of a concealable firearm by a minor. We conclude that the court erred in doing so. We find on the factual basis of this record that the court was instead required to determine if the requirements of subdivision (c)(6) of sections 25400 and 25850 were met, and if so, whether to declare the offenses felonies or misdemeanors, in its discretion. If those requirements were not met, the offenses would be mandatory misdemeanors under subdivision (c)(7) of sections 25400 and 25850.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>3. <em>Applicability of Subdivision </em>(c)(4) <em>of Sections 25400 and 25850 to Minors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Recently Division One of this court ruled that a defendant is not a \u201c \u2018person ... not in lawful possession of the firearm or . . . within a class of persons prohibited from possessing or acquiring a firearm\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of section 25400, subdivision (c)(4) simply because he or she is a minor prohibited from possessing a concealable firearm pursuant to section 29610. <em>(In re M.G. </em>(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1275 [176 Cal.Rptr.3d 459]; see <em>id., </em>at pp. 1274-1278 <em>(M.G.).)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We find the rationale of <em>M.G. </em>persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In <em>M.G., </em>the minor admitted possessing a concealed firearm, a violation of section 25400, subdivision (a)(2), and the juvenile court found the offense to be punishable as a felony under subdivision (c)(4) of the statute. <em>(M.G., supra, </em>228 Cal.App.4th at p. 1274.) In its examination of section 25400, subdivision (c)(4), the Court of Appeal explained; \u201cFirst, it is significant the Legislature included no express language subjecting minors to automatic felony punishment for carrying concealable firearms even though it could easily have done so either in . . . section 16750 or section 25400. Section 16750, which expressly defines the term \u2018lawful possession\u2019 for purposes of section 25400, subdivision (c)(4) makes no reference to minors. Even assuming a minor cannot himself be a lawful owner of a firearm, section 16750 by its own express terms creates no exception to lawful possession when the minor has possession or custody of a firearm with the lawful owner\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">\u201cIt is even more significant in divining legislative intent that . . . section 25400, subdivision (c)(4) expressly declares it a felony for persons subject to either chapter 2 or chapter 3 of division 9, title 4, part 6 of the Penal Code to carry concealable weapons, but omits any mention of persons subject to chapter 1 of division 9. Chapters 2 and 3 describe persons who have been convicted of certain offenses. Chapter 1 is entitled \u2018Juvenile\u2019 and happens to contain . . . section 29610. It is the only chapter in division 9 describing a particular class of persons that is omitted from subdivision (c)(4) of. . . section 25400. Moreover, if the term \u2018lawful possession\u2019 automatically excludes minors by virtue of section 29610, there is no reason it would not also automatically exclude <em>all </em>persons whose possession of a firearm is made unlawful by statute. If so, section 25400, subdivision (c)(4)\u2019s specific references to chapters 2 and 3 (as well as to sections 8100 and 8103 of the Welfare and Institutions Code) would be entirely superfluous. Interpretations that render statutory terms meaningless as surplusage are to be avoided. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>\u201cThe Legislative Counsel\u2019s description of the operative amendments also guides our analysis. The language now found in ... section 25400, subdivision (c)(4) and the definition of lawful possession in section 16750 were originally added to . . . former section 12025 in 1996, as part of Assembly Bill No. 632 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.). (Historical and Statutory Notes, 51D West\u2019s Ann. Pen.Code (2000 ed.) foil. \u00a7 12025, p. 219; Stats. 1996, ch. 787, \u00a7 2, pp. 4152-4153.) The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest of the bill explained the amendments made the \u2018offense [(possession of a concealable firearm)] punishable only as a felony in the circumstance where ... the person is not in lawful possession of the firearm, <em>as defined, </em>or is within a class of persons prohibited by <em>specified </em>provisions from possessing or acquiring a firearm.\u2019 (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 632 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) 6 Stats. 1996, Summary Dig., p. 312, italics added.) The view that section 25400, subdivision (c)(4) automatically applies to any minor violating the concealed firearms statute is thus not supported by the bill digest.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\u201cSecond, when the Legislature <em>did </em>address the punishment of minors found to be in possession of a concealable weapon \u2014 in chapter 1, division 9 of title 4, part 6 the Penal Code \u2014 it did so in a manner inconsistent with the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of . . . section 25400. (See . . . \u00a7\u00a7 29610-29750.) Section 29700, subdivision (a) declares, \u2018Every minor who violates [section 29610 of] this chapter shall be punished . . .\u2019 <em>either </em>by imprisonment as a felon <em>or </em>in a county jail. As appellant points out, holding that minors are automatically subject to section 25400, subdivision (c)(4) would completely undercut what the Legislature was trying to do in section 29700. Instead of having to consider whether the minor\u2019s possession of a concealable firearm should be charged as a felony or a misdemeanor, as section 29700 seems to require, prosecutors could simply bypass that requirement by charging and prosecuting minors as felons under section 25400, subdivision (c)(4). By doing so, the prosecutor would also deprive the juvenile court of the discretion and duty it would otherwise have under Welfare and Institutions Code section 702 to determine whether a violation of . . . section 25400, subdivision (a)(2) is a felony or a misdemeanor in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">\u201cWe see no indication the Legislature intended to reserve all discretion over the classification of concealed firearms violations by minors to the prosecution, or to override or impliedly repeal the specific provisions of law found in chapter 1 of division 9, title 4, part 6. It is . . . settled law that when a special and a general statute are in conflict, the former controls. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1859.) The special act will be considered as an exception to the general statute whether it was passed before or after such general enactment. [Citations.] Here the special act pertaining to minors in possession of a concealable weapon controls over the general statute pertaining to possession. <em>(M.G., supra, </em>228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1276-1278, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>We agree with <em>M.G.\u2019s </em>analysis of section 25400, subdivision (c)(4) and hold that it applies to section 25850, subdivision (c)(4) as well. Similar to section 25400, the Legislature included no express language in section 25850 subjecting minors to automatic felony punishment for carrying loaded firearms even though it could easily have done so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subdivision (c)(4) of both sections expressly declares it a felony for persons with certain mental disorders or prior convictions to carry concealed or loaded firearms, but makes no mention of minors who are generally prohibited from possessing concealable firearms (\u00a7 29610) or live ammunition (\u00a7 29650). When the Legislature addressed punishment of minors found to be in possession of a concealable firearm or live ammunition, it declared those violations to be punishable as wobblers or misdemeanors. (\u00a7 29700.) Thus, in the words of <em>M.G., </em>\u201cholding that minors are automatically subject to section [25850], subdivision (c)(4) would completely undercut what the Legislature was trying to do in section 29700. Instead of having to consider whether the minor\u2019s possession of a [loaded] firearm should be charged as a felony or a misdemeanor, as section 29700 seems to require, prosecutors could simply bypass that requirement by charging and prosecuting minors as felons under section [25850], subdivision (c)(4). By doing so, the prosecutor would also deprive the juvenile court of the discretion and duty it would otherwise have under Welfare and Institutions Code section 702 to determine whether a violation of [section 25850, subdivision (a)] is a felony or a misdemeanor in a particular case.\u201d <em>(M.G., supra, </em>228 Cal.App.4th at p. 1277, fn. omitted.) In sum, we see no indication that the Legislature intended subdivision (c)(4) of section 25850 to automatically apply to minors who violate the loaded weapons statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The People argue <em>M.G. </em>is factually distinguishable because \u201cthe minor in <em>M.G.. </em>argued the record did not support the felony determination. [Citation.] Division One found that the juvenile court \u2018erred by deeming the offense to be a felony without any proof of or stipulation to facts showing he did not have [\u201cjlawful possession of the firearm. [\u201d]\u2019 . . . [Citation.] [][] In the present case, by contrast, the predicate facts found missing in <em>M.G. </em>were provided by the evidence .... Officer Duffin testified that after the gun was removed from appellant\u2019s waistband, [D.D.] never said that he owned the gun, that he had his parent\u2019s permission to have the gun, or that he was on his way to participate in a sport that required use of a gun. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">This argument is unpersuasive. First, the <em>M.G. </em>court held that the juvenile court \u201cerred by deeming [M.G.\u2019s] offense to be a felony without any proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>or stipulation to facts showing he did not have \u2018 \u201clawful possession of the firearm\u201d \u2019 <em>as specifically defined in </em>. . . <em>section 16750 </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(M.G., supra, </em>288 Cal.App.4th at p. 1278, italics added.) The <em>M.G. </em>court further held that section 16750\u2019s definition did not categorically exclude minors from lawful possession of a firearm. <em>(M.G., </em>at pp. 1276-1278.) Second, the People point to an <em>absence </em>of evidence as support for the prosecution\u2019s case, even though the prosecution bore the burden of proving the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. They cite to affirmative evidence that only would establish D.D., as a minor, possessed a firearm or ammunition in violation of sections 29610 and 29650 \u2014 which under the authority of <em>M.G. </em>is insufficient to qualify the offense as a mandatory felony under subdivision (c)(4) of either section 25400 or 25850. Third, although the People indicate on appeal that D.D. had prior juvenile adjudications for burglary and possession of a concealable firearm\u2014 facts that might require felony sentencing under subdivision (c)(4) of sections 25400 and 25850 \u2014 the juvenile court pointedly noted after the close of evidence at the jurisdictional hearing that the prosecution had not presented evidence of prior offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We conclude that the juvenile court erred to the extent it declared D.D.\u2019s offenses to be felonies pursuant to subdivision (c)(4) of either section 25400 or section 25850.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">4. <em>D.D. \u2019s Offenses as Wobblers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Under subdivision (c)(6) of sections 25400 and 25850, the fact the weapon found concealed on D.D.\u2019s person was loaded would make his offenses wobblers if he was not the registered owner. D.D. argued below that subdivision (c)(6) of sections 25400 and 25850 did not apply because the prosecution failed to establish that the gun was not registered to D.D. That issue, however, has not been briefed on appeal and we do not decide it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As noted <em>ante, </em>D.D. may have had prior juvenile adjudications requiring felony sentencing under subdivision (c)(1), (4) or (5) of sections 25400 and 25850, but that evidence was not before Judge Breall at the jurisdictional hearing. The People also suggest that we should affirm on the ground the juvenile court has already exercised its discretion to designate the offenses as felonies. As discussed <em>ante, </em>we are not convinced that the court did so. On this record, the offenses may, or may not, be wobblers.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">On appeal, D.D. seems to concede that remand is required to allow the juvenile court to determine whether the violations should be penalized as misdemeanor or felony offenses, although he confusingly suggests that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>court should make that determination \u201cpursuant to section 29700.\u201d We agree that remand is required for the juvenile court to determine the applicable subdivisions of sections 25400 and 25850 and designate each offense as a misdemeanor or felony accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">C. <em>Maximum Term of Confinement</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The order denying D.D.\u2019s motion to suppress and the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdictional findings are affirmed. The order declaring the offenses felonies pursuant to subdivision (c)(4) of sections 25400 and 25850 is reversed. The matter is remanded to the juvenile court to designate the offenses as felonies or misdemeanors pursuant to what the court determines to be the applicable subdivisions of sections 25400 and 25850. The maximum term of confinement shall be stricken from the disposition order.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Jones, R J., and Needham, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-10\"> Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\"> D.D. apparently was wanted at the time on an outstanding no bail warrant from Alameda County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 824.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b751-10\"> See <em>People </em>v. <em>Statum </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 682, 685 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 572, 50 P.3d 355] (wobbler offenses are deemed felonies unless charged as misdemeanors or reduced to misdemeanors in the court\u2019s sentencing discretion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b751-11\"> Exceptions to section 29610 include recreational activities when accompanied by a parent or by a responsible adult with prior written consent of the parent.
