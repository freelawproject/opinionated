The statute, 1 Rev. Code, p. 475-6, \u00a7 4, which provides that a decree made against an absent defendant shall, after seven years, stand absolutely confirmed against him, does not protect a decree procured by fraud, after the death of the absent defendant, without suggesting his death or reviving it against his representative or heirs.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-9\">These cases arose out of the case of <em>Evans &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Spurgin, </em>reported 6 Gratt. 107. That case came up to this court from the Circuit court of Preston county: And after the cause went back, Jesse Spurgin and the heirs of Daniel Lantz filed a bill in that court to enjoin the enforcement of that judgment until the hearing of another suit which the plaintiffs had instituted in the Circuit court of Monongalia county in December 1849, against the heirs of Gilly C. Evans, wife of John Evans, and the administrator\" of Staley, for the purpose of setting aside the decree of the 21st of April 1S36, made in the case of <em>Staley </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>the proceedings in which case are stated in the report of the case in 6 Grattan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-10\">In their bill filed in the case in Monongalia, after setting out the purchase of the land by Daniel Lantz from Staley, and the proceedings in the chancery cause of <em>Staley </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>they alleged that Daniel Lantz lived in the county of Alleghany in the state of Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>until his death, which occurred in 1816. That the place of his residence and his death were facts well to Nimrod Evans, John Evans and his wife, l\u00b0ng before the death of Nimrod Evans, which occurrece 1828: And they charged that John Evans and his wife, with a view to prevent the correction of errorg an\u00bf irregularities in the case of <em>Staley </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>and with a view to defraud the heirs of Lantz, under whom Spurgin claimed, had procured the removal of the cause in 1833 from Staunton to Monongalia county, after the death of Lantz and without notice to his heirs, some of whom were infants and others <em>femes covert; </em>and that all the subsequent proceedings and decrees were fraudulent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-7\">They further alleged that on the 26th of November 1807 Lantz and Staley entered into a contract with the privity and knowledge of Nimrod Evans, by which the sale by the commissioners to Evans was canceled, and his money probably returned to him, or he had purchased for Staley, and everything pertaining to the chancery suit aforesaid was adjusted and satisfied as it related to both Staley and Evans; and Staley bound himself to convey to Lantz three tracts of land supposed to contain twelve hundred and fifty-nine acres, of which the land in controversy was one, when Lantz should pay to Henry Schroeder of Baltimore one thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars for Staley, and when Sehroeder\u2019s receipts were produced to him Staley bound himself to convey the land. That Lantz did pay the money to Schroeder, and Staley, by deed dated the 16th of August 1809, conveyed the land to Lantz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-8\">The plaintiffs further alleged that Lantz was in possession of the land purchased of Staley in 1805, from that time until his death in 1816. That his widow and children continued in possession until 1834, when a decree was made in the Circuit court of Hampshire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>in a cause instituted by William F. Taylor, a creditor of Daniel Lantz, against his widow and heirs, to subject the lands of Lantz to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s debt, by which decree a sale of the land by a commissioner of the court to George W. Devicman was confirmed : And that in 1839 Devicman sold the land in controversy to the plaintiff Spurgin; and that the possession had been continued by Devicman and Spurgin down to the time of filing the bill. The prayer of the bill was that the decree of 1836 in the suit of <em>Staley </em>v. <em>Lantz </em>might be set aside; that the defendants might be enjoined from enforcing their judgment at law for the recovery of the land; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-4\">The heirs of Gilley C. Evans answered the bill. They said they knew nothing of the facts of the case except what appears from the records of the causes in relation to the land in controversy, and they called for proof. They relied on the fact that Devicman was a purchaser whilst the suit of <em>Staley </em>v. <em>Lantz </em>was pending ; and therefore, that he had legal notice of Staley\u2019s <em>suit; </em>and in fact that Spurgin purchased in 1839 with full knowledge of the decree in that suit of the 21st of April 1836. They say that they had no knowledge of the death of Daniel Lantz at any time previous to the suing out of the writ of right; nor had they any knowledge that John or Gilley C. Evans was informed of that fact at any time before the decree of 1836; and they deny all fraud on the part of said John and Gilley C. Evans, or that they or either of them purposely concealed the death of Lantz; or that they delayed bringing their suit for the purpose of suffering the time to elapse in which the supposed errors in the decree of 1836 might be corrected. They deny that there had been any new discovery of facts or evidence affecting this controversy by the plaintiffs since 1836. And they relied upon the decree of 1836 as a bar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the relief sought by the bill; and also upon the statute limitations, and the delay of the plaintiffs for fourteen years to institute proceedings to impeach the decree \u00b0f April 1836.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMq\">It aPPears from the evidence that Nimrod Evans, the purchaser of the land in controversy from the commjgsjonerg jn ^]ie case 0f <em>Staleij </em>v. Lantz, was in 1807, and continued to be until his death in 1828, clerk of the County court of Preston. And a paper purporting to be a copy of an agreement between Staley and Lantz, though not signed, was produced in evidence, which was proved to be in the handwriting of Evans. By this paper which bore date the 26th day of November 1807, Staley agreed to sell to Lantz certain lands supposed to contain twelve hundred and fifty-nine acres; a part of which was the land previously sold to Nimrod Evans : For which lands Lantz bound himself to pay to Henry Schroeder of Baltimore one thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars, and to procure from Schroeder a receipt in favor of Staley for that sum; when Staley was to convey the lands to Lantz. On the back of this paper was an endorsement also in the handwriting of Nimrod Evans: \u201c <em>J. Staley and D. Lantz. Agreement. Copy. N. E.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-6\">It was also proved by a son of John Schroeder, that there was on his father\u2019s books, in the handwriting of a partner in the concern who had since died, an entry under the date of February 19th, 1808, by which John Staley was credited by three notes of Daniel Lantz, amounting to one thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars, with a memorandum at the foot of the entry, \u201c To be considered a cash payment from the 26th November 1807.\u201d And it was proved that Lantz was a man in good circumstances from 1807 up to the time of his death, which occurred in July 1818, fully able to meet all his engagements. It appeared further that Nimrod Evans never had the land entered on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>commissioner\u2019s books as Ms, or paid the taxes; but that it stood on these books as the land of Lantz, and the taxes were paid by him and those claiming him. Devicman was informed of the decree of April 1836 in the same year; and Spurgin knew it in 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7e\">When the causes came on to be heard, the court below set aside the decree of April 1836, and tually enjoined the defendants from proceeding to enforce their judgment recovered in the writ of right case. And from these decrees the defendants obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-7\"><em>N. Harrison </em>and <em>Stanard, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-8\"><em>Fry, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b643-9\">Samuels, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_n\">These two cases being, substantially, between the same parties, in regard to the same property, and depending upon the same facts, were heard together in this court. Many of the facts are set forth in the case of <em>Evans </em>&amp; <em>wife </em>v. <em>Spurgin, </em>6 Gratt. 107. The judgment in that case determined that the better right at law was in the demandants. After the judgment the tenant Spurgin and others, the heirs at law of Lantz, filed a bill in equity in the Circuit court of Preston county, in which county the land lies, against the heirs at law of Gilley C. Evans, (she and her husband John Evans being then dead,) to whom the legal title had descended. The sole purpose of this bill was to enjoin the judgment at law until the equity alleged in the other bill could be decided on. Spur-gin also filed a bill in the Circuit court of Monongalia county, impeaching the decree of April 1836, as being obtained by fraud on the part of Evans and wife. This fraud is alleged to have been perpetrated by removing the cause from the District court of chancery at Staunton to the Circuit court of Monongalia, and proceeding therein, as reported in 6 Grattan above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>referred to, without revivor against Lantz\u2019s heirs. The bill alleges that if the heirs had thus been made parties it would have been shown that Staley\u2019s decree 18^7 had been fully satisfied; that Nimrod Evans, \u2122 mak\u2122\u00a7 Hie purchase, was either acting as the agent of Staley, or that any interest he might have had uncier purchase was passed to Staley. That the claim, asserted by Staley in the chancery cause, and the claim of Nimrod Evans, whatever it was, were fully adjusted by Staley and Lantz with the privity of Evans. That an agreement in writing was entered into between Lantz and Staley on the 26th of November 1807, with the privity of Evans, by which Staley again sold to Lantz the land in controversy with other land, for one thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars, to be paid by Lantz to the credit of Staley with Henry Schroeder of Baltimore; that the price was paid accordingly, and that Staley on the 16th of August 1809, conveyed the land to Lantz as the contract required.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The facts alleged are established by satisfactory proof. The original agreement in writing is not produced; but a paper in the handwriting of Evans is exhibited purporting to be a copy of that agreement. The signatures of Staley and Lantz are not affixed to this copy: but that it truly sets forth the terms of the agreement is manifest from the facts that Lantz procured credit for Staley with Schroeder for the price of the land named in the copy, that is one thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars; and that this credit was as of the date of November 26th, 1807, the date of the alleged contract; and that Staley afterwards, on the 15th of August 1809, executed a deed to Lantz for the land described in the copy filed, which includes the land in controversy. The acts performed by Staley and Lantz, respectively, distinctly show what the contract was; and their long acquiescence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>in the state of things resulting from those acts stamps the contract with absolute verity. So far as the claim of Evans\u2019 heirs depends upon the decree in favor Staley, it is wholly without foundation in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">That Nimrod Evans was privy and consenting to the arrangement between Lantz and Staley, is as fully i <em>i jy </em>i ti i i pi shown as any such iact can usually be shown alter such a lapse of time. A paper is produced in the handwriting of Evans, setting forth the terms of the contract precisely as they were afterwards performed by Lantz and Staley respectively; this paper is endorsed in Evans\u2019 handwriting, <em>\u201cJ. Staley &amp; D. Lantz. Agreement. Copy. N. E.\u201d </em>Evans never in anywise whatsoever exercised any act of ownership over the property, but left it in possession of Lantz and those claiming under him.- He was clerk of the County court of Monongalia county, and although the deed to himself from the commissioners in the chancery suit, had been admitted to record in his court, yet he never caused the alienation to be noticed on the land books of the commissioner of the revenue by withdrawing the taxes from Lantz and placing them to his own account. If the land was really his, his official duty required him to make the change; and his duty as a private citizen required him to cause the change to be made. The deed from Staley to Lantz was recorded in the office of which Evans was clerk; and under that deed the vendor and those claiming under him have held quiet possession until disturbed by Evans\u2019 residuary devisee asserting a title which Evans himself never set up.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Upon all this I hold that Nimrod Evans had no title, good in equity, against Lantz and those claiming under them. It only remains to consider whether the appellees can set up their equitable title against the legal title held by the appellants. Several reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>are alleged by tbe appellants why the equitable title shall not be now set up :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">1. Laches.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">2. The statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">3. That the appellee Spurgin purchased the land with knowledge of the legal title held by Evans and wife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">In regard to the first: Lapse of time is justly allowed great weight in controversies about transactions long since passed. This weight, however, is thrown in favor of the party who insists that the state of things existing during that lapse shall not be disturbed. This is especially the case where the immediate parties to any given transaction are dead. It is presumed that any person having the right of property will ever use that right, such being the ordinary course of things. If no such right be exercised, the presumption is obvious that the right does not exist. In the cases before us, however, the appellees seek only to preserve the existing state of things; they and those under whom they claim have been in possession of the subject in controversy, and have held it since August 1809 at least. They are demanding nothing at the hands of the appellants; they seek only to defend their long continued actual possession, by means of their superior equitable title; a title fully proved by the direct testimony, and confirmed by the lapse of time. There is nothing in the record on which to found the allegation that the appellees or those under whom they claim have abandoned or waived their rights; on the contrary, from 1S05 or from 1809, they have in the most emphatic manner asserted those rights by holding and enjoying their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">Second. As to the statute of limitations: To sustain this branch of the defense, the appellants rely upon 1 Rev. Code, p. 47-5-6, \u00a7 4. In considering this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>objection it must be recollected that the bills before us are filed for the purpose of avoiding transactions occurring after the decree of 1807; and to prevent the fraudulent use of that decree. The nature of those transactions I have already considered. If we could even hold that the party was guilty of no actual fraud in removing the case from the court at Staunton to Monongalia, and proceeding therein without reviving against Lantz\u2019s heirs and administrator, yet the gross disregard of the rights of others manifested in that proceeding is equivalent to fraud; it does all the mischief of fraud. The attempt of the appellants to enforce a mere legal title against a clear equitable title accompanied by long possession, is in itself a fraud; if innocent in acquiring the legal title, they are guilty of fraud in the attempt to use it. If we put ourselves in the place of the legislature, with the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the statute, we cannot suppose for a moment that it was intended to apply to such a case as this. The language of all public statutes is necessarily general; it is the duty of courts to determine their applicability to the circumstances of each particular case coming before them. The statute in question intends to quiet the possession of property acquired under decrees fairly obtained against absent parties, to bar any further litigation in the matter of the suit so decided, after seven years from the date of the decree. It does not intend to quiet parties in the enjoyment of property acquired under a decree fraudulently obtained; and this to the prejudice of parties fraudulently omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Third. The third objection is without force: The vendors of the appellee Spurgin were in actual possession claiming title, and supposing that title to be good at law. In this they were mistaken; for the title, although clearly good in equity, was not good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>at law. No reason can be assigned why a vendor in actual possession holding a good equitable title may not sell his title and deliver possession to another; the circumstance that another holds a legal title which may be called in at any time and conveyed to the real owner, cannot prevent the real owner from selling.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">I am of opinion to affirm the decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Decrees affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
