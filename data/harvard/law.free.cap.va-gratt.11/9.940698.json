By his will which was duly admitted to prohat, after a legacy of two hundred and fifty dollars to Amy Featherston, he gave to his son Herbert Reese all his land, and one-half of the balance of his estate: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>But if he should die without heirs, then at his death the land, with all the other property, should go to his grand son Frederick A. Frazer and his heirs. The testator gave to his daughter Martha Frazer the remaining half of his personal estate. Herbert Beese and Martha Frazer qualified as administrator and administratrix, with the will annexed, and gave separate bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-9\">In 1830 a judgment was recovered against the personal representatives of Frederick Beese, which, principal, interest and costs, amounted to one hundred and thirty-six dollars and sixty-six cents; one-half of which was paid by Martha Frazer. Upon the execution which issued upon this judgment Herbert Beese gave a forthcoming bond with Price Pollan as his surety; which bond having been forfeited, an execution was awarded thereon, and was levied on a slave named Eliza found in the possession of Herbert Beese, and which had been a part of the estate of Frederick Beese. This slave was sold by the sheriff under the execution, and was purchased by Archer J. Bevill. At the time of this sale, as appeared by the accounts of the administrators settled by the court of probat, Herbert Beese was a debtor to the estate, after crediting him with the payment of one-half of this judgment, in the sum of two hundred and twenty-eight dollars and forty-two cents, and Martha Bevill was debtor in the sum of sixty-five dollars and eighty-five cents. These accounts showed that the testator was very little indebted at his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-10\">In 1845 Frederick A. Frazer filed his bill in the Circuit court of Dinwiddie, in which he set out the will of Frederick Beese; \u2022 and stated that the administrators sold the personal estate except the slaves, which proved more than sufficient to pay the debts ; that the slaves were divided, as directed by the will, between Herbert Beese and Martha Frazer, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the slave Eliza fell to the share of Herbert Reese; that she had been sold to Bevill and had since had several children. That Bevill claimed a fee simple in said slave and her <em>increase; </em>and had avowed his purpose to use and control, sell and dispose of the said slaves as he thought proper; and claimed an absolute right to them. That plaintiff was apprehensive, and with good reason, that Bevill would send the slaves out of the state, or sell them to a trader to be taken away, so that the plaintiff would be entirely without remedy upon the happening of the contingency upon which his interest depended; a contingency very likely to occur, as Herbert Reese was then, and had ever been, childless. And making Bevill, Herbert Reese and Martha T. Frazer parties defendants, he prayed that Bevill might be restrained from sending the slaves out of the state; that he might be required to give bond and security to have the slaves forthcoming at the death of Herbert Reese ; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-4\">The bill having been sworn to by the plaintiff, the court made an order restraining Bevill from removing the slaves beyond the jurisdiction of the court, or from anywise disposing of them until the further order of the court: And directed that unless Bevill should enter into bond with good security in the penalty of eight hundred dollars, payable to the plaintiff, and with condition to comply with and perform the decree which the court might make in the cause, the sheriff should take the slaves into his possession, and put or hire them out to the best advantage till the further order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">The bond was given by <em>Bevill; </em>and he then answered the bill. He said that at a sheriff'\u2019s sale made about the year 1830, he purchased the slave Eliza, then a small girl j that she had since had three children ; and that they were all in his possession. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the slave was sold for the purpose of satisfying debts due from the estate of Frederick Reese; that judgments had been recovered against his personal representatives, executions issued thereon, and the said slave was levied on and publicly sold to satisfy them. That it was most remarkable that the plaintiff had delayed so long to assert his right, if any he ever had; that he had no new cause, for that he must still be postponed, if he could succeed, until the life estate was extinguished. That he was advised and confidently believed, that the plaintiff had no shadow of title to the slaves mentioned in his bill, and then in possession of the defendant; and he considered himself most unnecessarily harassed' by this suit. The other defendants did not answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-11\">The execution under which the slave Eliza was sold, was filed, and the sheriff\u2019s return was, \u201c Levied on one negro girl, held as the property of Herbert Reese.\u201d The deposition of the deputy sheriff who levied the execution was taken. He says he levied the execution on a negro girl named Eliza, who he was told by Herbert Reese at the time, was the property of Frederick Reese\u2019s estate. He took her from the house and possession of Herbert Reese. That he offered the slave for sale at the June court, but that some of the legatees of Frederick Reese contended that Herbert Reese was bound for the debt himself; and that the negro ought not to be sold, as they would be scattered about at the death of Herbert Reese. That in consequence \u2022of these remarks no persons would bid, and he therefore kept her until July court, when she was again put up, and was sold. That Bevill was present at the June court when the objections were made : No objections were made at the July court, and Bevill purchased the slave at one hundred and seventy dollars. That .at the sale it was publicly announced that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>was sold to satisfy an execution in favor of Martin Blake against Herbert Reese, administrator of Frederick Reese deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-4\">The deposition of Martha T. Frazer, the administratrix, was also taken and filed. She said, that in February .1829 a division of the slaves of Frederick Reese took place; and in that division six slaves, one of which was this slave Eliza, were allotted to Herbert Reese. That this division was made by consent of parties; and each took possession of the slaves allotted to him and her; and that she still had hers. This deposition was objected to by the defendant Bevill, on the ground that the witness was one of the personal representatives of Frederick Reese deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-5\">The cause came on to be heard on the 31st of March 1847, when the court, without passing upon the objection to the competency of Mrs. Frazer as a witness for the plaintiff, dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill. And the plaintiff having died after the decree, his administrator applied to this court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-6\"><em>Macfarland </em>and <em>Rhodes, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-7\"><em>J.

Frazer was well taken. The fact that she was one of the administrators of her father\u2019s estate did not, of itself, render her incompetent to testify to the assent of herself and of her coadministrator to the legacy in respect to a portion of which the suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">In the case of <em>Smith &amp; wife </em>v. Townes\u2019 <em>adm\u2019r, </em>4 Munf. 191, which was an action of detinue brought by a legatee against a stranger, for the purpose of recovering a slave bequeathed to the legatee, this court held that it was competent for the plaintiff to prove by the <em>executor, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>(if he had no objection to being examined,) his assent to the legacy. I see nothing in the case under consideration to justify us in refusing to apply the same principle to the testimony of Mrs. Frazer. It is true that the recovery of the slaves in controversy from Bevill would be a satisfaction <em>fro tanto </em>of the claims of the appellant against the administrators, for Frederick R. Frazer\u2019s share of the estate under his grand father\u2019s will; and Mrs. Frazer\u2019s testimony proves one of the important facts upon which the right to recover from Bevill must rest. Still, I do not perceive that Mrs. Frazer has any such interest in the event of the suit as can affect her competency as a witness. For even if the appellant, in the event of his failure to recover the slaves of Bevill, could be permitted to turn round and repudiate the grounds on which he sought that recovery, deny his own allegation of the assent of the administrators to the legacy, and seek to recover of the administrators on the ground of a <em>devastavit </em>or wrong, in improperly permitting a sale of the female slave Eliza, I do not see how Mrs. Frazer (from any fact disclosed in the record,) could be subjected to any liability. Apart from her own evidence there is nothing to show that the slave Eliza had ever been in her possession. The other evidence in the cause shows that the debt, in satisfaction of which the slave was sold, was originally a debt due by the estate. That upon the suing out of the original execution she paid one-half of the amount, and charged it to the estate in her administration account. That for the remaining half her brother Herbert Reese gave a delivery bond with Price Pollan as security, and made a like charge in his account. And that the sale was made under an execution which issued on a judgment on the delivery bond. The sheriff\u2019s return states that this execution was levied \u201c on one negro girl held as the property of Herbert Reese;\u201d and in his deposition the sheriff' states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>that the girl \u201c was taken from the house and possession of Herbert Reese, and that he (Reese) stated at the time, that she belonged to his father\u2019s estate.\u201d And it appears from the separate administration accounts, that there was, at the time of the sale of the slave, a small balance (some sixty-five dollars) in the hands of Mrs. Frazer, and a much larger balance (some two hundred and twenty-eight dollars, after taking credit for the half of the original execution,) in the hands of Herbert Reese, arising from sales of the personal estate of the testator. In this state of facts, if there was any <em>devastavit, </em>or wrong, or illegal conduct, in allowing the sale of the slave for which a representative of this estate might be called to account, the liability therefor rested with Herbert Reese alone. He held the possession of the slave, and his office of administrator gave him a right to that possession ; and if he permitted it to pass from him, so as illegally and injuriously to affect others, without the knowledge or assent of Mrs. Frazer, no damage or loss arising therefrom can be visited upon her, it being well settled that one administrator cannot be charged with the wrong of his companion, or be made further liable than for the assets which came to his hands. <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Beverley, </em>10 Peters\u2019 R. 532; <em>Morrow\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Peyton\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>8 Leigh 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">The decision of the suit could therefore neither increase nor diminish her liabilities, let it eventuate as it might, and she stood indifferent between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">She states that in 1829 the slaves belonging to her father\u2019s estate were divided between her and her brother; and that, in the division, the slave Eliza was (with others) allotted to her brother Herbert Reese. That the division was made by consent of parties, and that she and her brother each took possession of the slaves allotted to them respectively. In <em>Drayton </em>v. <em>Drayton, </em>1 Desau. R. 557, executors who were residuary legatees divided the estate of their testator be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>tween them. It was held that this was equivalent to payment of the legacies, and that the executors severally held their shares as legatees simply. This is precisely the case here; and the division in 1829 is, I think, equivalent to the most formal assent to the bequests to Herbert Reese and Mrs. Frazer. And it is well settled that an assent to a particular interest is an assent to the bequest over. 2 Lomax on Ex\u2019ors <em>130; Lynch </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>3 Leigh 682. And in the case of <em>Acheson </em>v. <em>McCombs, </em>3 Ired. Ch. R. 554, it was decided that when by a will personalty is given to one, with remainder to another upon the happening of a certain event, and without any trust in the executor, the assent of the executor to the immediate legacy is an assent to the bequest in remainder; and such bequest becomes a legal estate upon the happening of the contingency.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">The division of the slaves in 1829 operated then, as I conceive, as an assent by the administrators to the executory limitation in favor of Frederick R. Frazer; and I do not see how his title could be divested by sale under an execution issued, whether against the goods and chattels of Herbert Reese, or against the goods and chattels of the testator Frederick Reese.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">It is argued that it is competent for an executor under certain circumstances to retract his assent to a legacy: And that Herbert Reese, by representing to the sheriff when he made the levy, that the slave belonged to his father\u2019s estate, and by suffering her to be sold as such, must be taken to have retracted his assent, so far as this slave is concerned, and to have consented that she should be sold as the property of the estate. In a suit brought by Herbert Reese to recover this slave, such an argument would be entitled to much consideration, if indeed it would not be conclusive against his right to recover. To- permit <em>him </em>to recover from a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser under such circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>stances, would be to allow Mm to derive benefit from Ms own fraud. But the argument, as applied to tbe rights of Frederick B. Frazer is, I think, without force. It seems to be true, that whilst as a general proposition an assent once given to a legacy can never after-wards be retracted, there are exceptions to the rule: As when the assent has not been completed by payment, in the case of a general legacy, or possession, in that of a specific one, and its recall is not attended with injury to a third person, as to a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser from the legatee on the faith of such assent, it is said, that it is only reasonable, that the executor, under particular circumstances, should have the power of retracting it; as when he assents upon a reasonable ground for considering that the assets are sufficient to meet all demands, but unknown debts are unexpectedly claimed, which occasions a deficiency. <em>2 </em>Williams on Ex\u2019ors 849. It is obvious, however, that not one of the reasons on which the exception is based exists for applying the exception here, so as to affect the rights of the legatee in remainder. The division of the slaves in 1829, as before stated, was accompanied by immediate possession on the part of Herbert Beese ; and that possession enured at once to the benefit of the legatee in remainder.. And Herbert Beese, so far from being met by an expected deficiency of assets, in fact held in his own hands a large balance, more than ample to satisfy the execution. Ho retraxit of his assent to the legacy could, therefore, have divested the title of Frederick B. Frazer. It is to be observed also that whilst from the deposition of the sheriff it would seem that he, at the sale, regarded the execution under , which he sold as one against the estate of the testator, and treated the girl as the property of the estate, the execution was, as before stated, in fact against the goods and chattels of Herbert Beese and his surety in the delivery bond, Price Pollan, and the return states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>a levy on the girl as the property of Herbert Reese. Whatever may have been the impressions of the sheriff, at the time of the sale, as to the legal effect of the process under which he was acting, or as to the title of the property sold to satisfy it, I think it clear that under the circumstances the purchaser could acquire nothing but the interest of Herbert Reese in the slave: And consequently, that Frederick R. Frazer had such an interest in the slave Eliza and her increase, as to entitle him, upon alleging and showing just cause to apprehend danger of their being eloigned, so as to jeopard his recovery of them when the time for the enjoyment of his legacy should arrive, to ask and have such orders in chancery as would be likely to insure the forthcoming of the property, on the happening of the contingency provided for in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">The counsel for the appellees, whilst he objected here to the jurisdiction, did not seem to lay much stress on the objection, his main argument being directed to the question of title ; and all objection to the want of power in the chancellor to act on the case made, is, I think, met and answered \u2022 by the decision of this court in the case of <em>Chisholm </em>v. <em>Starke, </em>3 Call <em>25. </em>In that case, the testator bequeathed his slaves to his wife, remainder to her children. The wife married again, and the second husband sold one of the slaves to a <em>Iona fide </em>purchaser, who had no notice of the right of those in remainder; and he, before receiving such notice, sold the slave to another person. The bill filed by the remaindermen in that case did not allege any purpose on the part of Chisholm to remove the slaves out of the state. It simply alleged that Richardson the second husband had frequently endeavored to sell the slaves as his absolute property; that he had sold one of them to Chisholm, who lived at a distance in the state; that he had 'attempted to sell others; and pretended that the, increase of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>slaves was his. The chancellor decreed that Richardson should give bond, conditioned for delivering to the plaintiffs the slaves in his possession and their increase, living at the death of his wife, and that Richardson and Chisholm should give bond for delivering the slave which had been purchased by Chisholm. Upon an appeal by Chisholm, this court reversed so much of the decree as required the bond of <em>him, </em>on the ground of his having stated in his answer, which was not disproved, that he was a fair purchaser for valuable consideration, without notice of the title of the appellees, and had sold the slave before suit brought, and before any notice of the appellee\u2019s claim to or interest in the said slave; and ordered that the bill should be dismissed as to him, but decreed that Richardson should give bond for the forthcoming of all the slaves. The court evidently regarded the conduct of Richardson, in setting up an absolute title to the slaves, in selling one of them, and threatening and endeavoring to sell others, as ground sufficient to justify the requiring of a bond from him for the delivery of the property on the termination of the life estate ; and exonerated Chisholm, on the ground only of his being a purchaser without notice, and of his having sold again\u00bb before suit or notice of the title of those in remainder. The conduct of Herbert Reese, in permitting the slave to be sold under the circumstances shown in the case, was such, I think, as to have justified the court in requiring a bond from him; and with respect to Bevill, there is an absence of all the circumstances which induced the court, in the case of <em>Chisholm, </em>v. <em>Starke, </em>to excuse the purchaser: He does not in his answer deny notice of the division of the slaves, and of the claim of the appellant\u2019s intestate : He does not deny having avowed the purpose (as charged in the bill) to use, control and sell and dispose of the slaves as his own absolute property: He does not deny that the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>lant had good ground for believing that he would send the slaves out of the state. In his answer he simply states that the slave Eliza was levied on and sold to satisfy executions against the estate of Frederick Reese, and that he purchased her at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and denies that \"the plaintiff has any title whatever to the slaves; refers to the delay of the plaintiff in asserting his right, and says that he has no new cause, as he must, in any event, still be postponed until the life estate is extinguished. Independent of his failure to deny notice of the claim of the appellant, in his answer, the testimony in the cause renders it highly probable that he did have knowledge of the claim, and he is still in possession asserting right to treat the property as his own, free from all limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">I think that the Circuit court erred in dismissing the bill; and that it ought, instead thereof, to have made a decree defining the rights of the appellant in accordance with the foregoing views <em>; </em>and' to have made such orders as were necessary to insure the forthcoming of the property on the happening of the contingency provided for in the bilk</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">The other judges\u2019 concurred in the opinion of Daniel, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">The decree was as follows .-</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">It appears-to the court that in February 1829 the slaves of the testator Frederick Reese were, by consent of the parties, divided between the appellees Herbert Reese and Martha T. Frazer; and that in the division the female slave Eliza was allotted to the said Herbert Reese. And the court is of opinion that said division operated as an assent by the administrators to the bequests in the will, as well in favor of Frederick R. Frazer as of the said Herbert Reese and Martha T. Frazer; and that the facts alleged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>bill and proved by the evidence, were such as to entitle the said Frederick R. Frazer to ask and have from the appellee the said Herbert Reese, and the appellee Bevill, bond with sufficient security and in a proper penalty, conditioned for the forthcoming of the said slave Eliza and her descendants, on the happening of the contingency in the will of the testator mentioned : And that the Circuit court consequently erred in dismissing the bill. So much of the decree of the 31st day of March 1847, therefore, as dismisses the bill, is reversed with costs, &amp;c. And the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with the principles above declared-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
