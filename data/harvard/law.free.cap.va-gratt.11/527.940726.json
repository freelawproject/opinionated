Middleton against Josiah Harrison, to recover possession of a tract of seven thousand nine hundred and twenty-three acres of land. The case was docketed in the County court of Jackson in June 1847, and was continued on the docket of that court without a trial until August 1848, when the court being about to adjourn, on the motion of the plaintiff, it was ordered that the case be removed to the Circuit court of Jackson county. And in September of the same year, the plaintiff produced in that court the original papers, and the orders made in the cause, and on his motion it was docketed, and was placed at the head of the civil causes on the docket.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-6\">At the August term 1850 of the Circuit court, when the cause was called, the defendant by his counsel, moved the court to strike it from the docket, on the ground that it was not one of the cases contemplated by the act of March 28th, 1843. Sess. Acts 1842-43, ch. 9. But the motion was overruled by the court: And he excepted. The defendant then moved the court to place the cause on what he insisted was its proper place on the docket, viz: only before such cases as had been brought in that court after the cause had been docketed there. But the court overruled the motion, because the case occupied the place on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>docket which it had occupied ever since it had come into the court; and had priority over all civil causes in the County court, and was entitled to the same ority in the Circuit court that it had in that court. And the defendant again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-6\">On the trial of the cause the plaintiff introduced in evidence an agreement between himself and the defendant, bearing date the 22nd of February 1847, in relation to the land in controversy. This agreement recited that Harrison lived on a tract of land of seven thousand nine hundred and twenty-three acres, patented to Thomas A. Taylor, under Taylor\u2019s representatives, as tenant; that Middleton had become the owner of the tract, and had sold it, and wished immediate possession: And then Harrison agreed to surrender the plantation and houses by the 10th of April 1847, and to surrender the farm at any time that William Fisher (the purchaser from the said Middleton) may think proper to take possession. And in consideration of Harrison\u2019s agreeing to give up as aforesaid, Middleton agreed to refer it to arbitrators to say what Harrison should be allowed for his improvements beyond the use of the plantation for the time he had enjoyed it. And it was agreed that on signing that agreement, all controversy between the parties was to be at an end; and that Harrison was to give up to Middleton all claims and leases theretofore set up by him. The agreement was under seal and attested by three witnesses, of whom Alexander Harrison was one. The plaintiff also introduced the patent under which he claimed, which was a grant in 1786 to Thomas A. Taylor. He then called a witness, who stated that some years previous to the trial he surveyed two or three of the lines of the survey on which the defendant Harrison lived. That when he ran these lines he had no authentic document to run them by; and only had a paper with a diagram of the seven thousand nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>hundred and twenty-three acre tract, which paper had an endorsement on it in the handwriting of the plain-stating that it was the tract on which defendant pveq. anc( which diagram was made by the plaintiff. T0 this diagram the witness referred for courses and distances, and admitted that he did not remember how far he had run or what courses he had run, without-reference to said paper, and did not remember either course or distance independent of the paper. To the witness refreshing his memory from said paper, the defendant objected, which objection was overruled by the court; and'the witness often referred to the paper to refresh his memory; the court directing the witness not to state anything set out in the paper; but only to state what acts he did in running, the lines aforesaid, and what he found on the ground. To this the defendant again, excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-6\">The same witness, in order to answer other questions propounded to him by the plaintiff, referred to a memorandum.-made by himself but two days before the trial, copied by him from his field notes of the survey before spoken of; the said field notes being then at his home; but he did not pretend to say that he recollected the courses or distances deposed to from said memorandum independent thereof. This evidence was also objected to by the- defendant, because the original field notes from which-the copy was taken, were not produced:- But-.this objectionwas also overruled; and the witness was permitted to refer to said paper to refresh his recollection of the running of the lines done by Mm. Andito this the defendant again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-7\">In the further, progress-of the trial William Fisher was offered as a witness, and was objected to by the defendant; who offered the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, before mentioned, to prove his interest. This agreement stated that the land in controversy had been sold by the plaintiff to Fisher. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The plaintiff then proposed to examine Fisher on his <em>voir dire, </em>to show that the agreement for the sale to him had been rescinded; and that he had no in the controversy. To this the defendant objected, because he had shown the interest of the witness otherwise than by his own oath. But the objection was overruled; and the witness was sworn on his <em>voir dire, </em>and stated that he had no interest, because he and the plaintiff had, by a contract made on the 5th of August 1847, rescinded the previous contract between them: And this contract of the 5th of August was produced, and provided especially for the rescission of the previous contract for the sale of the land in the possession of the defendant. To this the defendant again excepted. This witness being sworn in chief, stated that previous to his purchase from the plaintiff he had heard the defendant\u2019say that he had no title to the soil on which he lived, and did not claim the land. And that in the spring of 1847 he was with the defendant, but not on or near the land, and asked him if he would give up its possession, to which the defendant replied that he would not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-7\">In the further progress of the trial the defendant offered Alexander Harrison as a witness. He was a subscribing witness to the agreement aforesaid of the 22d of February 1847, between the plaintiff and defendant, and had been previously sworn and examined as to that fact by the plaintiff. This witness was offered by the defendant to prove that at the time of the execution of that agreement, both the witness and the defendant, who was the father of the witness, understood said paper, which is in the handwriting of the plaintiff, as referring the title to the land to the arbitrators therein named; and that the witness was present when it was read to the defendant; and that both the witness and the defendant did not understand or believe that the said paper made the defendant the te<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>nant of the plaintiff, nor did they know that such a thing was in the paper. And further that both the and the defendant understood said paper as it was rea\u00bf them, as simply referring to the arbitrators the question of right to the land; and not that the de~fendant had thereby given up his right to it, and referred to the arbitrators the defendant\u2019s title to compensation for his improvements to be set off against the rents of the land. To the admission of this evidence the plaintiff objected, and the court sustained the objection : And the defendant again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-6\">After the evidence in the cause had been introduced, the plaintiff moved for an instruction to the jury, \u201c that if they believed\" all the evidence before them, the plaintiff had a right to maintain his suit at the time of its institution, and was entitled to recover in this action.\u201d The court thereupon enquired whether the defendant intended to ask for any instructions; when he by his counsel objected to the instruction asked for by the plaintiff as being too broad and general, and asked the court to instruct the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-7\">1. That if they believed, from the evidence before them, that the defendant was, at the time of the institution of this suit, a tenant of the plaintiff, he was entitled to six months\u2019 notice to quit before he could be turned out as unlawfully detaining the land under the contract of February 1847 ; and that the language of said contract, \u201c to surrender the farm at any time that William Fisher the purchaser of Middleton might 'think proper to take possession,\u201d was not a certain time either in contemplation of law, or by the true interpretation of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-9\">2. If the jury were satisfied from the evidence before them, that before the institution of this suit, William Fisher had purchased the land in controversy of the plaintiff, and that such purchase, at the time this suit was instituted, was in force and not rescinded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the plaintiff had no right to the possession of said land, and could not maintain this suit against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A93\">There was a third instruction asked by the defendant substantially the same as the second.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Anp6\">The court refused to give the instruction asked for by the plaintiff, because it was too general, and because it called on the eourt to decide upon the sufficiency \u00a9f the evidence before the jury; and declining to give the instructions asked for by the defendant in the form in which they were asked, proceeded to instruct the jury, <em>u </em>that if they believed from the evidence, that the defendant was at the time of the institution of this suit, a tenant from year to year of the plaintiff, he was entitled to six months\u2019 notice to quit; and he would not be liable to be turned out of possession of the land in controversy without such notice: But if they should believe from the evidence, that the tenant was a tenant to the plaintiff, and that Ms time was to end at a certain time, that then no notice to quit would be neeessary. The court further instructed the jury, that that part of the contract of the <em>22d of </em>February 184?, whieh provides for the surrender of the farm at any time that William Fisher might think proper to take possession, would not necessarily create a tenancy from year to year, and entitle the defendant to six months\u2019 notice; and that if the evidence satisfied the jury that a demand of the possession had been made of the defendant by the said Fisher, and the defendant had refused to surrender such possession, it was not necessary to give the defendant six months\u2019 notice before the institution of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-8\">The court further instructed the jury, that they must be satisfied from the evidence, before they could render a verdict for the plaintiff, that at the time of the institution of this suit the plaintiff had \u2019the right of possession to the premises in controversy in this suit, and that the contract of the <em>22d </em>of February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>1S47, between tbe plaintiff and tbe defendant, did not ^Ie opinion of the court, of itself furnish such eviof a transfer of the right of possession from the p]ajntiff Middleton to Fisher, as to disable the plaintiff from maintaining this action in his own name, provided he has shown himself otherwise entitled to maintain it; or that the said contract so transferred to or vested in the said Fisher such right of possession as would have enabled him to maintain this action against the defendant. To the refusal .of the court to give the instructions asked by him, and to the giving the instructions given by the court, the defendant excepted. There was then a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff; and on the application of the defendant, a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded by this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-7\"><em>Fisher, </em>for the appellant, insisted:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-8\">1. That this was not a case which could be removed from the County to the Circuit court. That the case having arisen before the 1st of July 1850, the question was to be determined under the act of March 28th, 1843, Sess. Acts of 1842-43, ch. 9, <em>% </em>4, p. 17. That from the time when the constitution of 1829 went into operation, the County and Circuit courts had concurrent jurisdiction in chancery causes; and in 1838 the act was passed authorizing the removal of such causes from the County to the Circuit courts; but that this act only applied where the Circuit court had original jurisdiction of the subject matter involved in the cause. In March 1843 the act was passed allowing the removal of common law causes \u201cupon the same terms and- in the same manner in all respects as if it were a suit in equity;\u201d and therefore this act must be construed to apply to the same class of cases as the act of February 1838; which were cases in which the Circuit court might have taken original jurisdiction. This construction was confirmed by the act of February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>7th, 1849, Sess. Acts 1848-49, ch. 75, \u00a7 1, p. 42, in relation to the removal of causes where the amount in controversy was under fifty dollars. And he that this being indisputably a cause of which the Circuit court could not. have taken original jurisdiction, it was therefore illegally removedlo the Circuit court, and was therefore coram&lt; <em>non judice, </em>and all the proceedings were null and of no effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-6\">2. That although a. case of unlawful detainer has priority in some eases, yet that there is-no law which gives it this priority where the-special court fails to meet, and the cause-goes regularly on the docket of the County court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-7\">3. That the court erred in permitting the witness to refer to the diagram and a copy of his field notes, and to state facts from! them* of which he could not speak of his ow-n recollection. 1 Greenl. Evi. \u00a7 436; 1 Stark. Evi. 128; <em>Doe ex dem. Church </em>v. <em>Perhins, 3 </em>T. R. 749.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-10\">4. That, the \u25a0 court erred in swearing the witness Fisher to ascertain his want of interest, after:' the defendant had proved his interest. <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Huff's lessee, </em>4 Serg. &amp; Rawle 298; 2 Stark. Evi. 756; <em>Offutt </em>v. <em>Twyman, </em>9 Dana\u2019s R. 43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-11\">5. That the court erred in excluding, the evidence to prove that the agreement of the 27th February 1847 had been misread to the defendant. If the paper had been the foundation of an action.of covenant, the evidence \u25a0 would have been admissible : And it was <em>a fortiori </em>admissible when the paper was offered collaterally. 1 Chitty\u2019s Plead. 479;. <em>Van Valkenburgh </em>v. <em>Rouk, </em>12 John. R. 337; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>King, </em>6 Munf. 358. This last case is conclusive of the question. It decides that if a paper is misread to a party, he may plead <em>non est factum.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-14\">6. That the court erred in refusing to give the instructions asked for by the defendant. The contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>under which the plaintiff claims bears date in February 1847; and that shows he had sold the land to The proceeding was commenced in June of year. anc] the contract with Fisher for the rescisgjon 0f the sale bears date in August. Not the plaintiff but Fisher was entitled to the possession at the time this proceeding was commenced. Or if Fisher was not the party to bring this action, neither can the plaintiff do it. Fisher had purchased from him, and he claimed as purchaser from Taylor\u2019s heirs under whom Harrison had been in possession for years. If Fisher\u2019s purchase from the plaintiff did not authorize him to sue, neither could the plaintiff\u2019s purchase from Taylor\u2019s heirs, it not appearing that he had received a conveyance, entitle the plaintiff to sue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-6\">But further: A tenant is entitled to six months\u2019 notice to quit. It is true this law does not apply to a tenancy which is to determine at a fixed period, nor where there is an express agreement to dispense with -notice. But the only time fixed, .and the only agreement, is when Fisher shall think proper to take possession ; which is neither certain as to time, nor does it dispense with notice: Nor indeed is there satisfactory proof of any demand of possession by Fisher.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-7\">7. That the instructions given by the court wrere Improper and erroneous: Improper, because the instructions were not asked for by either party; and .\u25a0because it referred the construction of the written .agreement to the jury, when it should have been construed by the court: And it was erroneous, in so far .as it varied from the instruction asked for by the \u00abdefendant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-8\"><em>Price, </em>for the appellee :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-9\">The first point made by the appellant\u2019s counsel must depend upon the construction of the act of March <em>28th, </em>1843. That act says, \u201cWhenever any civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>action in a court of law shall have been, or shall hereafter be, pending in a county court for the space of one year without a final decision thereof been made, it shall be lawful,\u201d -&amp;c. Is this a civil action ? If it is, and who doubts it, it is embraced within the terms of the law. It is equally embraced within the spirit and object of the act. The object is to obviate the delays of the county court. It is true the act refers to the act of 1838, but that relates to the time and manner of removing the cause. The object of the statute and its language apply to all cases in which the Circuit court has either original or appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-6\">Upon the second point made by the appellant\u2019s counsel, the court allowed the witness to refer to the papers to refresh his memory, but he was only to state what he then remembered. And this seems to be the settled rule on the subject. 1 Cfreenl. Evi. \u00a7 436. This author says, it is not necessary that the paper referred to should have been written by the witness, or should be an original paper. It matters little how the memory is refreshed; but the witness is to speak from his then recollection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-8\">As to the competency of the witness Fisher: It was a question before the court; and, not only his competency was shown by the evidence, but by the contract for the rescission of his purchase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-9\">Upon the fifth point made by the counsel for the appellant, it is- to be observed that the evidence was not offered to prove that the agreement was not correctly read, but that it was not correctly understood. The design of this evidence was to invalidate the deed; and if it was not sufficient for that purpose, it was not admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-10\">But further: The evidence, if competent, was not admissible without the affidavit of the defendant that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the paper was <em>not his deed. The </em>court is referred to \u00ae Bac. Abr. title Fraud, letter A, p. 294-95.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUG\">Upon the instructions given or refused, <em>it is </em>enough <em>j.Q </em>gay ^ie objection that the court should have construed the agreement is not well'taken,' as the court does in fact construe it in the instruction given. That this was not a tenancy from year to year, so that the law in \u25a0 relation to notice does not apply; and \u25a0 there was in fact a positive agreement to give1 up the premises whenever required by Fisher, which of course dispensed with notice. As to Fisher\u2019s light, his was a mere executory contract, giving him neither title or right of possession, which still remained in Middleton; and it was for him to enforce it, that he might execute his contract with Fisher. \u25a0</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b562-6\">Moncure, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATH\">I am of opinion that the Circuit court did not err in overruling the motion of the- defendant to strike this case from the docket; I think the case was properly removed from the County'court to the Circuit court, under the fourth section of the act of March-28,' <em>1843; Sess. </em>Acts, p. 18; which declares \u201cthat whenever amy civil action in a court, of law shall have been, or shall hereafter be, pending in a county or corporation court for the space of one year, without a final decision thereof having been made, it shall be lawful for any party, in any suc.h civil action, or- his or her legal representatives, to obtain, by motion, without notice, an order of such court for the removal'of such cause to the Circuit superior court of law and chancery of. the same county or corporation, upon the same-terms, and in the same manner in all respects; as- if it-were a suit in equity, and the same proceedings shall be had in reference to the removal and trial of such causes as are directed by the act passed the--18th (12th) of February. 1838, (Sess. Acts, p. 61,) entitled \u201c An act <em>to </em>authorize the removal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>causes in equity from the inferior to the 'Superior courts.\u201d The case at the time of its removal was a civil action in a court of law, and had been pending in the County court, for the space of one year, without a final decision thereof having been made. Tt was, therefore, within the literal terms of the statute. Was it not within its spirit and meaning also ? I think it was. The manifest object-of the'statute was to avoid the great evil of delay in The trial of causes in the County courts. This evil existed in regard both to chancery suits and civil actions; but ;in a greater degree, to the former. The act of 1838 was intended to remedy the evil in regard to chancery causes,, and the act of .184/3 in regard to civil \u25a0- actions. The action of unlawful detainer is peculiarly and especially within \u25a0the scope of the policy of the legislature, as indicated by these acts. It is a remedy for a wrong which requires immediate redress. The law has, therefore, provided that it shall be prosecuted in a most summary way, and have precedence for. trial .over .all other civil causes. Tt was probably not contemplated by the legislature that such a proceeding for the redress of suchia wrong would ever \u201cbe pending.in-.a County-court for the space of one yeaiy without . a final decision thereof having been made.\u201d .But if it would, surely the legislature intended that it might be removed to the \u00abCircuit court, in the same manner-in which any other civil action, under. similar-. circumstances, might be so removed under the act. of 1843.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The ground on which the counsel of the plaintiff.in error contended that the action of unlawful detainer is not a civil action within the meaning of the act of 1843, is that that act applies only to civil = actions of which the Circuit court has original jurisdiction-; and the Circuit court has not original jurisdiction of an action of unlawful detainer. It is true that the Cir.cuit. court has not original jurisdiction of an action.of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>unlawful detainer; The only reason for not giving suc^ jurisdiction is, that the nature of the wrong for the remedy lies, requires a more speedy redress ^an could well be afforded by that court, sitting as it \u00bfoes but twice in a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Formerly the County court, though holding a session every month, was not considered by the legislature as affording the means of a sufficiently speedy redress of the' wrong; and, therefore, a tribunal composed of at least two justices, and meeting not less than ten nor more than twenty days after the date of the warrant, was provided for the trial of actions off unlawful detainer. They are now triable by the* County court; but at any term whether monthly or quarterly :: and are still tried .in a summary way, and have precedence over all other civil causes on the docket. But while the Circuit court has never had original, it has always had appellate jurisdiction in actions of unlawful detainer ;\u2022 and I think the act off 1843 was not intended to be confined to civil actions of which the Circuit court has original jurisdiction,, but was intended, to embrace all civil aetions of which: that court has jurisdiction, whether original or appellate. I can. see no good, reason for the restrictive meaning \u00a9entended for, contrary to the literal terms and obvious policy of the act. It was contended that as the act of 1843 declares that the same proceedings shall be- had in reference to the removal and trial off causes under that act, as are directed by the act of 1838 in regard to causes in equity; and. as the act of 1838 declares that the Circuit court shall have the same jurisdiction of a cause in equity removed under that act, and shall proceed therein in all respects as iff the- cause had been originally instituted in that court therefore, no civil action of which the Circuit court has not original jurisdiction can be removed under the-act of 1843, because no case in- equity of which the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Circuit court has not original jurisdiction can be removed under the act of 1838. In other words, it was contended, if I rightly understood the argument, the act of 1843, in consequence of its reference to the act of 1838, is to be read as if the words, \u201cand the Circuit superior court shall have the same jurisdiction thereof, and shall proceed therein in all respects as if the cause had been originally instituted in the Circuit superior court,\u201d which are contained in the act of 1838, had been repeated in the act of 1843. And that as an action of unlawful detainer could not be originally instituted in the Circuit court, therefore that court could have no jurisdiction thereof, if removed from the County to the Circuit court. This argument, though plausible, is, I think, unsound. The words referred to were not used in the act of 1838 for the purpose of excluding from its operation any causes in equity of which the County court had jurisdiction and the Circuit court not; for there were no such causes. If the jurisdiction of the two courts in such causes was not entirely concurrent, certainly the Circuit court had jurisdiction of every cause in equity of which the County court had. The words \u2018could only have been used for the purpose of giving to the Circuit court the same jurisdiction of a cause in equity removed to it as of a cause instituted therein. Different words might and probably would have been used if there had been any causes in equity cognizable in the County, and not in the' Circuit, court: but as there were not, the words used conveyed the idea intended as well as any that could have been selected. The act of 1843 refers to the act, of 1838 merely to avoid repetition;; and the legislature could not have intended, by the implied adoption of ambiguous words, to exclude from the operation of the former, the action of unlawful detainer, which, as I have already said, is- embraced both by the letter and the spirit of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The act of February 7th, 1849, Sess. Acts, p. 42, though passed after the removal of this case, was re-to in the argument as serving to show that prior acj. a c[yp action, in which the Circuit court had not original jurisdiction,-could not have been'removed from the County to :the-Circuit court under the act of 1843. The act of ,1849 is somewhat of the nature of a declaratory law. At all events, while it adopts a rule for the future, it does not even express the opinion of-thedegislature as to what had been the true rule before. It recites that different constructions had been put upon the 30th section of the act of April 16th, 1831, Sup. Rev. Code, p. .146, and -dhe 4th .section of the ,aet of March 28th, ,1843, and that it was desirable to have uniformity in the construction of the said sections. It then declares .that the Circuit courts shall have power to award a writ of error and <em>supersedeas </em>to any judgment, &amp;c. of. the County courts in which the latter have original jurisdiction; and to order the removal of any civil action pending in such courts in the manner provided in the fourth section of the last recited act, notwithstanding that the amount in controversy in such judgment <em>&amp;c. </em>may be,less than fifty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">When the .act of 18.49 was passed, the Circuit.court had no original jurisdiction in pecuniary .actions, in which the amount .in controversy was less .than fifty dollars;; and it seems to have been supposed .by some that the Circuit court had no appellate jurisdiction in such cases. Those who entertained that supposition, as a\u2019natural consequence, also .-supposed that as the Circuit court had neither original nor appellate jurisdiction in such cases, they could not therefore be removed from the County to the Circuit court under the act of 1843. And hence the act of 1849 was passed to remove all doubt on the subject, by declaring that the Circuit court\u201d should have .jurisdiction of such cases, whether removed to it by writ of error ,&amp;c. un-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>der the act of 1831, or an order of removal under the act of 1843.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The act of 1849 indicates the sense of the ture that the jurisdiction of the Circuit court under the act of 1843 should be-coextensive with its appellate jurisdiction-. The words \u201c notwithstanding that the amount in ^controversy in such judgment &amp;c. may be less -than fifty dollars,\u201d were certainly not designed to exclude the jurisdiction of the'Circuit court in an action of unlawful' detainer removed to it under the act of 1843. It would be strange indeed, if the legislature intended by the act of 1849 to confer jurisdiction on the Circuit- court under the act of 1843, in cases in which it had not original, and was \u2022 supposed by some not before to have had appellate jurisdiction, and at the same time to exclude its jurisdiction under that act in a case in which it always\u00bb had appellate jurisdiction.'</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">I am further of opinion that the\u00bb- Circuit court? did not err in overruling', the motion of the defendant to1 change the place of the case upon the docket; and\u00bb that the reason assigned by the court, to wit, \u201cbecause this case occupied the place on the docket which it has occupied ever since it came into this court, and had priority over all civil causes in the County court, and was entitled to the\u00bb same priority: here that it - had in that court,\u201d was-well founded,! and a good reason for overruling the motion. If, however, there had been any error in this-respect, I -do not see how it could have prejudiced the parties, or been any ground for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In regard to the exceptions of the defendant to opinions of the court permitting a witness who had surveyed, or partially surveyed, the land in controversy for the plaintiff, to refresh his memory by referring to certain papers which he had in his hand: The law on this subject is thus laid down' in Greenl. on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Evidence, \u00a7 436 : \u201c Though a witness can testify only suc^ ^ac^s as are within his own knowledge and re-yet he is permitted to refresh and assist his mem01y) by f,}ie use 0f a written instrument, memorandum or entry in a book, and may be compelled to do so if the writing is present in court. It does not \u25a0seem to be necessary that the writing should have been made by the witness himself, nor that it should be an original writing, provided, after inspecting it, he can speak to the facts from his own recollection.\u201d \u201cAnd it is -not necessary that the writing thus used to refresh the memory, should itself be admissible in evidence.\u201d Numerous authorities are cited by the author, which, I think, fully sustain his view of the law; though there is certainly some conflict, at least in the <em>dicta </em>of some of the judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The doctrine established by the authorities seems to be that if a witness, after looking at the paper to recall the facts, can speak from his own recollection of them, and not merely because they are stated or referred to in the paper, his evidence will be admissible, notwithstanding the manner in whieh his recollection was revived, and no matter when or by whom the paper was made, nor whether it be original, a copy, or an extract, nor whether referred to by the witness in court or elsewhere. 4 Philips\u2019 Evi.; Cowen &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes, part 2, p. 734. This kind of testimony is liable to abuse; the chief objection to it being that the paper referred to operates on the mind of the witness like a leading question: but it is rendered necessary by the frailty of the human memory; and the abuse to which it is liable must be guarded against by the vigilance of the court. If after looking at the paper the witness cannot speak from his recollection merely, his testimony, so far as he cannot speak from his recollection, is inadmissible; and the paper itself, if admissible evidence, either alone, or so far as it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>be supported by the recollection of the witness or other testimony, must be produced. In <em>Jacob </em>v. <em>Lindsay, </em>1 East\u2019s R. 460, the witness was permitted to to a paper which itself was not admissible evidence. In <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Lee, 2 </em>Chitty\u2019s R. 124, 18 Eng. C. L. R. 273, a witness was allowed to refresh his memory from a document though not written by himself. \u201cIt .is sufficient,\u201d said Lord Ellenborough, C. J. in that case, \u201cIf a man can positively swear that he recollected the fact, though he had totally forgotten the circumstance before he came into court; and if upon looking at any document, he can so far refresh his memory -as to recollect a circumstance, it is sufficient^ and it makes no difference that the memorandum was written by himself, for it is not the memorandum that is the evidence, but the .recollection of the witness.'\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">I see nothing in Starkie on Evidence, nor in the case of <em>Doe ex dem. Church </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>3 T. R. 749, so much relied on by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, which is in conflict with the doctrine as laid down by Q-reenleaf. On the contrary, the case of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Perkins </em>is one of the cases cited by that author, and tends to support the doctrine. The point decided .therein, as stated in the marginal abstract, was that a- witness may refresh Ms memory by any book or paper, if he can afterwards swear to the fact from his own recollection. But if he cannot .swear to the .fact -from recollection, .any further than as finding it entered in a book or paper, the original book or paper must be produced. Mr. Justice Buller in <em>Doe ex dem. Church </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>referred to a case of <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>in which, being an action for goods sold, \u201cthe witness who proved the delivery, took it from an account which he had in his hand, being a copy, as he said, of the day book, which he had left at home : and it being objected that the original ought to have been produced, Mr. Baron Legge said that if he would swear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>positively to the delivery from recollection, and the Paper was only to refresh his memory, he might make of it. But if he could not, from recollection, gwear \u00bfepVery, any further than as finding entered in his book, then the.original should have been produced; and the witness saying he could not swear from recollection, the plaintiff was non-suited.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">This doctrine is of easy application to the case under consideration. The witness was permitted to refer to two papers to refresh his memory. The first was an original paper; being a diagram made by the plaintiff of the tract of land claimed by Mm, which paper had an endorsement thereon in the handwriting of the plaintiff, stating that it was the tract on which the defendant lived. The witness stated that some years before, he surveyed two or three lines of the survey on which the defendant lived, and when he run the lines he had no authentic document to run them by, and only had the paper with the diagram and endorsement aforesaid. To this diagram the witness referred for courses and distances, and admitted that he did not remember how far he had run or what courses he had run, without reference to said paper; and did not recollect either course or distance independent of said paper. To the witness refreshing his memory from said paper, the defendant objected; but the court overruled the objection, directing the witnes? not to state anything set out in the paper, but only to state what acts he did in running the lines aforesaid, and what he found on the ground. I think there is no error in this ruling and direction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The witness had run certain lines, at the request of the plaintiff, and according to a paper containing a diagram, which the plaintiff placed in his hands. The' fact that such lines were run, was a link in the chain of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. Whether they&gt; were lines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>of the patent under which he claimed, depended upon a comparison with the patent which was before the jury, and the evidence of the surveyor as to the appearances upon the ground, &amp;c. There was no objection to the fact as irrelevant evidence, but only to the use made of the paper, on the ground that not having been written by the witness, and he not recollecting what course or distance he had run independently of the said paper, it could not be referred to by him to refresh his memory. It was an original paper; was in court ; was identified by the witness; and, in connection with his testimony, was the very best evidence of the lines he had been requested by the plaintiff to run. The witness might have recollected the courses and distances of these lines; and if so, might have given evidence of them, without reference to the paper. But it could hardly be expected, after the lapse of several years, that he could remember them without such reference, or even with it. All that he could reasonably be expected to be able to say, was, that, at the plaintiff\u2019s request, he ran certain courses and distances set forth in the paper which he had in court, and held in his hand. This he did say, and it was admissible evidence to prove the fact accordingly. In this and the like cases, the paper itself, being a part of the evidence, must be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The other paper, to which the witness was permitted to refer, was an extract or copy from his field notes of the survey before mentioned, which notes were at his home. He said that the copy was accurately made by him, but did not pretend to say that he recollected the courses or distances deposed to from said copy, independently thereof. The defendant objected to the evidence, because the original field notes were not produced. The oourt overruled the objection, and permitted the witness to refer to the copy <em>to refresh, his recollection </em>of the running done by him. If the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ness, after referring to the copy, had said that he had no recollection of the facts therein contained, and could only say they were true, because they were therein contained, I think, according to the authorities before cited, it would have been necessary to have produced the original. There may be some ambiguity on this subject in the bill of exceptions, which might produce some difficulty, if the question were material; but in this case it is not. Understanding the court as permitting the witness- to refer to the paper merely to refresh his recollection of the running done by him, or of the facts therein set forth, I think there was no error in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In regard to the objection that the court permitted the witness Fisher to be sworn on the <em>voir dire </em>after his interest had been shown by evidence <em>aliundej </em>It is sufficient to say that the error of the court, if any, was cured by the fact, that before the- witness was sworn- in chief a deed was produced and proved, which terminated his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In regard to the instructions : I think the court did not err in refusing to give those which were asked for by the parties, or in giving those which were given by the court. The agreement of the parties, which was by deed exhibited and proved to the jury, if it did not terminate the defendant\u2019s right to hold the land in controversy on the 10th of April 1847, at least made him a tenant at will or at sufferance after that <em>day; </em>and such a tenant is not entitled to six months\u2019 notice, to which a tenant from year to year is entitled. The most that he- can require is reasonable notice, and he is entitled to no notice if he claims- to hold adversely, or attorns to some other person, or does some other act disclaiming to hold as tenant. 1 Lorn. Dig. 165. In this- case there was evidence that the defendant refused to surrender possession of the land to Fisher according to the agreement. I think that the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>being invested with the legal title, had a right to maintain the action at the time it was instituted, notwithstanding his executory contract with Fisher.</p>\n<p id=\"A7q\">In regard to the only remaining question: I think the court erred in excluding the evidence of the witness Alexander Harrison, offered by the defendant. In a suit brought upon a deed, the plaintiff is not required to prove it without a plea of <em>non est factum, </em>verified by oath. But when, as in this case, a deed is introduced collaterally as evidence, it must be proved by the party introducing it, according to the rules of law; and the other party, without any denial of the deed on oath, may assail it by any evidence which shows, or tends to show, that it is not his deed; indeed, by any evidence which would be admissible on the' plea of <em>non est factum. </em>He may, therefore, introduce evidence tending to show that there was fraud in the execution of the instrument, as that it was misread to him, or Ms signature obtained to a different instrument from the one he intended to sign. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>King, </em>6 Munf. 358; <em>Dorr </em>v. <em>Munsel, </em>13 John. R. 430; <em>Van Valkenburgh v. Rouk, </em>12 Id. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In the last case, the court said, \u201c If a deed be misread or misexpounded to an unlettered man, this may <em>be </em>shown on <em>non est factum, </em>because he has never assented to the contract. So, if a man be imposed upon, and signs one paper while he believes he is signing another, he eannot be said to have assented, and may show this on <em>non est factum.\u201d </em>It does not certainly appear whether the defendant in this case was unlettered or not. His signature to the deed purports to have been made by himself, and the presumption therefore is, that he was not. But the admissibility of evidence tending to prove fraud in the execution of an instrument does not depend upon the fact that the party whose deed it'purports to be, was unlettered; though the weight of the evidence is materially increased thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>In this case, the defendant offered to prove by one the subscribing witnesses to the bond, that he and defendant both understood the agreement (which -g jn yie handwriting of the plaintiff) as referring the to the land to the arbitrators named in said paper y that said witness was present when it was read to the defendant, and neither the witness nor the defendant understood or believed that said paper made the defendant the tenant of the plaintiff; nor did they know that any such thing was in said paper y and further, that both the witness and the defendant understood said paper as read to them, as simply referring to the arbitrators the right to said land, and not that the defendant had by that paper given up his right to the land, and referred to arbitrators his right to pay for improvements, to be set off against the annual rents of said land. If the paper was correctly read to the defendant at the time of its execution, his misunderstanding of it eould not affect its validity as a deed: And so far as the evidence offered tends to show a mere misunderstanding of the paper, it is wholly immaterial and irrelevant to the issue. But if it tends, in any degree, however slightly, to show that the paper was materially misread to the defendant at the time of its execution, and that he was thus induced to execute it, the evidence is admissible. I think it has such tendency, and ought to have gone to the jury, to he weighed by them with the other evidence in the case. It may be of little weight in itself to prove fraud in the execution of the paper, and of less or none when taken in connection with the other evidence. But of that the jury are the exclusive judges. The witness was selected by the parties to attest the instrument; and it was his duty to notice the circumstances attending its execution. He did not say that the paper was misread, nor how it was read to the defendant at the time of its execution. He may not have remembered particulars, or been able to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>more than his understanding of the substance of the paper as read to the defendant. That understanding was materially different from the plain meaning of the paper itself; and it is difficult to conceive that he could have so understood it, if he is a man of ordinary intelligence, and heard the paper correctly read. But these are matters for the consideration of the jury, and are adverted to here only to show that at least the evidence is relevant and admissible; which is the only question the court has to decide in regard to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">I am of opinion that the judgment should-be reversed, the verdict set aside, and the cause remanded for a new trial to be had therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Lee and Samuels, Js. concurred- in&gt;the opinion of Moncure, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Daniel, J. dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Judgment reversed.1</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
