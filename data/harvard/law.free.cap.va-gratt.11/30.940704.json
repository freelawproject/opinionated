Grymes, Robert West, the administrator of Grymes, paid the debt by an assignment of bonds taken at the sale of the personal estate ; and in the settlement of the administration account the estate was credited with the amount of the bonds, and debited with the amount of the debt. Among the bonds- assigned was one of Morgan Tomkies. In due time after this bond became due in October 1810, Harrison\u2019s executors brought suit upon it, and obtained judgment in October 1812. A forthcoming bond was given, on which judgment was obtained in May 1813. In October following, Tomkies enjoined the judgment in the Superior court of chancery at Williamsburg; stating in his bill, that as administrator of Catharine Wyatt and guardian of her only child, he had become entitled to a legacy of three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>hundred pounds, given to her by her father John Rohinson, of whom Grymes was executor; that no part the legacy had been paid, though considerable esta,te of Robinson had come to the hands of Grymes. That he, Tomkies, had instituted a suit which was then pending in said court, for the recovery of the legacy. That he had been induced to become a purchaser at the sale of Grymes\u2019 estate, and to become bound for the purchases of his ward at the sale, by the promise of West not to transfer the bond until the claim for the legacy should be <em>ascertained; </em>and by an understanding with him that the amount of the bond, or so much of it as might be necessary, should be set off against the legacy, or the balance which might be' ascertained in the said suit to be due thereon; and that West, in violation of his said promise and agreement, had assigned the bond to Harrison\u2019s executors, who had recovered judgment and sued out execution thereon: and praying for an injunction of the judgment until the report of the commissioner in the suit brought for the recovery of the legacy as aforesaid, and for general relief. Harrison\u2019s executors, and West, administrator of Grymes, were made defendants. In April 1814, Harrison\u2019s executors filed their answer, stating that their testator was a creditor by bond of Grymes for a considerable amount; that one of them attended the sale for the purpose of obtaining payment j that the negroes were sold on credit, and nothing better could be done than to receive bonds executed by purchasers at the sale to the amount of the debt; and that he accordingly received by assign.ment from West, administrator as aforesaid, several bonds, among which was that of Tomkies. \u2022 They profess ignorance of the facts stated in the bill on which the complainant\u2019s claim to relief was founded. In June following, West, administrator ol Grymes, filed his answer, positively denying all the grounds of equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>contained in the bill, and expressing a belief that nothing was due on account of the l\u00e9gacy. In October following, a motion was made to dissolve the junction. But the court overruled the motion, and ordered that' unless the parties were satisfied with a 1 certain report mentioned m the order, and would consent to a copy of that report being evidence in the case subject to exceptions, a commissioner should take an account of Grymes\u2019 administration of Robinson\u2019s-estate, and ascertain the balance due on the said legacy, and make report to the court. In September 1815, the death of the plaintiff Tomkies was suggested, and a <em>scire facias </em>awarded to revive the suit in the name of his executor. In June 1818, the suit was revived by consent in the name of Robins, administrator of the plaintiff', against George West, executor of Robert West, who was administrator of Grymes, who was executor of Robinson, and George Ilealy, administrator of Grymes; and thereupon the cause coming on by consent to be heard on the bill, answers, exhibits and depositions, the defendants consenting that a copy of the accounts filed in the case of <em>Chowning &amp; wife </em>v. <em>West, adm'r of Grymes, </em>settling the transactions of Grymes on the estate of Robinson, might be taken as the account in the casethe court, on consideration thereof, and with the consent of the parties, perpetuated the injunction <em>; </em>and, with the like consent, decreed that the defendant George West should settle the administration account of his intestate on the estate of Grymes, and the defendant Healy should settle his administration account on the same-estate, before a commissioner of the court, who was directed to state, settle and report the same. Sundry proceedings were afterwards had without effect, to compel George West to settle the account directed to be settled by him as aforesaid. From a report filed in the case it appears that his reason for failing to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>was, that the vouchers relative to Robert West\u2019s administration of Grymes\u2019 estate were in the hands of Commissioner Ladd for a settlement of the account in another case, and could not be given up until he had reported on them. In July 1823, the suit was trans- <em>\" </em>ferred to the Superior court of chancery for the Richmond district. In April 1827, George West being dead, and Healy no longer administrator of Grymes, a <em>scire facias </em>v^as awarded to revive the suit against Price Perkins, administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Robert West, and Carter Braxton, administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Grymes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-8\">In this state of the case of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West, </em>an agreement of compromise was entered into between John F. May, acting for the surviving executor of Harrison, and Braxton. Mr. May, it seems, had been retained by Harrison\u2019s executor to prosecute the suit after its removal to Richmond; and in December 1826 wrote a letter to Braxton, stating his views of the case, and of the liability both of West\u2019s and Grymes\u2019 estates to Harrison, and proposing, as Harrison\u2019s executor was old and averse to trouble and.litigation, that bond with security should be given for the payment of the debt at some future time, when it might be expected that it could in a legal course be recovered. This letter commenced a negotiation which terminated in the agreement aforesaid, bearing date the 31st of January 1828. That agreement, which is under the hands and seals of the parties, states that they had compromised the matters in difference between Grymes\u2019 administrator and Harrison\u2019s executor in the suit of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West, </em>in which they were both parties; by which compromise it was agreed that Braxton, or his successor, should pay to Harrison\u2019s executor the amount of the original judgment against Tomkies on his bond assigned to Harrison\u2019s executors as aforesaid, out of the assets of Grymes, so soon as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Braxton should have a sufficiency to pay the same in his hands. That he should have twelve months in which to make such payment; that, upon its made, George E. and William B. Harrison, legatees of Beniamin Harrison, would execute a bond with good security, to refund to Braxton the amount so paid, provided any debt of superior dignity should be legally established against Grymes\u2019 estate, and there should not be assets sufficient for the payment thereof; that after such payment Harrison\u2019s executor would renounce all costs of the suit of <em>Tomlties </em>v. <em>West, </em>and give a discharge for the same, and, as far as he was concerned in the suit, enter a dismissal thereof; that if the said debt should not be fully paid at the termination of the stipulated period, Harrison\u2019s executor should be at liberty to resort to any legal means for the recovery thereof; and that nothing contained in the agreement should be construed to bind Braxton in any other capacity than that of representative of Grymes. At the foot of the agreement is a memorandum signed by Braxton, by which it was further agreed that if Harrison\u2019s executor should at the end of six months see fit to cancel the agreement, he might do so upon requiring Braxton to cancel the duplicate thereof in his possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">In November 1828, Braxton wrote a letter to George E. Harrison, in answer to one received from him, in which letter this language is used: <em>\u201c </em>In answer, I have to remark that the arrangement made between Mr. May and myself,, relative to the debt due from Mr. Grymes\u2019 estate to your father, was done with the intent to end a perplexed and disagreeable law suit. On my part, as the present representative of Mr. Grymes, I was fully convinced of the justness of the claim, and wished for no other litigation. At the time this arrangement was entered into, I expected to obtain an immediate decree in favor of Mr. Grymes\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>estate against one of the former administrators for a considerable amount. Under this expectation, I only time to enable me to realize the money arising from that claim.\u201d The writer then states that his exPec^a^on had been disappointed; and after referring to other sources of payment, including Mr. Grymes\u2019 land, which h\u00e9 says he would sell and pay the debt if he could, he uses this language: \u201c Had the decree been obtained in January last, you should have had the money before this. Whenever the money is made, the debt to your father\u2019s estate shall be forthwith settled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">In October 1829, Braxton wrote another letter to Harrison, in which' this language is used: \u201cI expect a decree at the next chancery term for the Richmond district, against the preceding administrator on Mr. Grymes\u2019 estate, and his securities, who are very ample, for a very large amount, between sixteen and seventeen thousand dollars. There are other very large claims due the estate of Mr. Grymes; but these are the first that I expect will be tangible. How, out of the first money collected you will be wholly, or for the greater part of your claim, satisfied.\u201d\u2014\u201c The compromise between Judge May and myself terminated a source of litigation that would' have consumed as much time and expense as any one with which I have become acquainted, considering the number and distance of the various parties. That compromise bound the parties to settle on specified terms, and if they did not do so in twelve months, then the representatives of your father\u2019s estate were to be at .liberty to pursue their original remedy. How, I hardly imagine that it would possibly be expected a suit of the complex nature of the one that the compromise ended could be matured, sooner than the expectations I have mentioned will be realized. I hope, however, your necessities may not press you before payment can be made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The personal estate of Mr. G-. in my hands is very inconsiderable. If a judgment was now had, before satisfaction of it could be obtained it would be necessary to bring a suit to subject the lands of Mr. G.\u201d \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-4\">Braxton having failed to pay the debt to Harrison\u2019s executor, the latter, in April 1833, in conjunction with George E. and William B. Harrison, sons and distributees of Benjamin Harrison, filed their bill in the Circuit court of Middlesex, for the purpose of enforcing the execution of the agreement aforesaid; setting out the material facts in relation to the agreement, and the debt for the payment of which it was entered into; charging that personal estate of Grymes to a considerable amount had come to the hands 'of Braxton as his administrator; that a large amount of real estate was then held by Braxton and wife in her right as sole heir and devisee of Grymes; that the estate of Grymes, both real and personal, was bound for the payment of 'the said debt, of which no part had been paid, and that the said George and William B. Harrison were then entitled to the whole of the said debt by the consent of Harrison\u2019s executor; making Braxton, administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed of Grymes, and Braxton and wife defendants to the bill; and praying for suitable relief. The agreement and said two letters of Braxton -were filed as exhibits. And a bond was executed by the said George E. and William B. Harrison and a surety, in the terms prescribed by the agreement, and filed with the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">In July 1833, Braxton as administrator, and also for himself and wife, filed an answer. He sets out the substance of the letter received by him from Mr. May in December 1826; says that at no time prior to the agreement had he ever examined the suit of <em>Tomlcies </em>v. <em>West, </em>nor did he at the time of the agreement have any knowledge of that suit derived from any other source than the letter; and that, entertaining no doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>that the facts of the case were truly stated by Mr. May, and that his opinion as to the law arising on the was sound and correct, he consented to execute, and did execute\", the agreement. He says that accord-^o his understanding of the agreement, if the debt should not be paid in twelve months from its date, Harrison\u2019s executor was to be at liberty to resort to any legal means for the recovery of the debt which he might have used if the agreement had never been made: in other words, might go on with the suit of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West. </em>And he insists, that.without anyn further enquiry this suit ought to be dismissed, and the plaintiffs turned over to that suit for any relief to which they might be entitled. But if that course should not be taken, he says the court will have to determine how far he was bound, anterior to the agreement, as the representative of Grrymes\u2019 estate : in other words, whether the plaintiffs have any equitable claim against that estate. He then sets out the facts in regard to the assignment of Tomkies\u2019 bond, the proceedings'at law upon it, and the proceedings in the injunction suit; and insists that when Harrison\u2019s executors delivered up to West, as administrator 'of Grrymes, the evidence of debt which they held, and gave a receipt in full for the debt, the estate of Grrymes became entirely exonerated. The claim henceforth was a claim on the bond against the obligors; or, if it could not be collected of them by due diligence, on the contract of assignment against West individually, and not as administrator of Grrymes; as no administrator can make any new contract binding upon his decedent\u2019s estate. He further insists that it is manifest from the record in the suit of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West, </em>that the injunction never would have been perpetuated, if the executors of Harrison had not consented to it. He then says that since March 1830 he has discovered most material testimony in the record of a suit in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>County court of Middlesex, in which Wyatt and wife were plaintiffs, and Grymes, executor of Robinson, defendant, commenced in 1797, and abated by the of Grymes in 1805; which suit was brought for the recovery of the same legacy claimed by Tomkies in the injunction suit. The tendency of that testimony is to show that Wyatt had given Philip Samson an order on Grymes for the legacy, and that Samson had received the amount of it, in whole or in part. Other matters are stated in the answer, but need not be here further referred to. The letter of May to Braxton was filed as an exhibit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">In July 1846, the deposition of May was returned and filed bythe plaintiffs. He makes the following, among other statements: \u201cThere had been some communications, perhaps verbal as well as written, between Mr. Braxton and myself; and some time after them Mr. B. met me in this city, and we examined together the chancery papers in the old suit of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West, </em>and finally entered into the agreement manifested by that paper. I recollect the circumstances of our having the papers before us, because at that time I discovered, first, according to my present recollection, that the decree perpetuating the injunction purported to have been made by the consent of Harrison\u2019s executors as well as Grymes\u2019 executor, which Mr. Braxton and myself both concluded to have been a mistake in the draft of the note for a decree.\u201d\u2014\u25a0\u201c The papers in that suit were certainly before us at the time that agreement was entered into, and the subject of the consent order was then mentioned in our conversation ; and my recollection is that Mr. Braxton and myself examined the papers, on at least two different days during his then visit to Richmond before we entered into the agreement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-8\">In June 1847, the cause coming on to be heard in the Superior court of chancery for the Richmond cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>cuit, (to which it had been transferred,) on the bill, &amp;c., and upon the original record of the case of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West, </em>pending in the same court, including the recor(l of the case of <em>Wyatt &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Robinson's ex'or, </em>filed therein as an exhibit on the 28th of January 3831, \u25a0 . <em>J </em>the court was of opinion, and decided, that the estate of Grymes was justly indebted to the estate of Harrison in the sum of one thousand and seventy-seven dollars and twenty cents, with interest from the 11th of October 1810 till paid, and nine dollars and fifty-one cents costs, according to the stipulations of the agreement aforesaid. But as no decree could be rendered for the payment of the money without a settlement of the accounts of Braxton as administrator of Grymes, the court decreed, that unless the defendant Braxton should admit assets in his hands of the estate of Grymes sufficient to satisfy the said claim, then the said defendant should render, before one of the commissioners of the court, an account of his administration of the said estate. And the said commissioner was directed to ascertain and report to the court what real estate and its value was left by Grymes at his death and passed to his heirs or devisees.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-10\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-11\">It is probable that Harrison was a creditor of Philip L. Grymes. This debt West the administrator of Grymes paid, took a receipt for the payment, and has received a credit for it in his administration of Grymes\u2019 estate. The debt was then discharged ; and if any liability exists on that account, it must arise out of a new contract. This debt of Harrison was paid in part by the assignment by West to Harrison\u2019s executors of the bond of Tomkies; and any existing liability to Harrison\u2019s executors must arise out of that assignment. If Harrison\u2019s executors used due diligence to recover the money from Tomkies and failed, then West was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>liable on his assignment. Harrison\u2019s executors did sue Tomldes, and obtain a judgment against him, which he then enjoined on the ground that as of Wyatt he held a claim against Grymes\u2019 estate. To this suit Harrison\u2019s executors and West were parties ; <em>L </em>and the injunction was perpetuated by their consent, This result, it is most obvious from an inspection of the record, could not have occurred but by the consent of Harrison\u2019s executors; and therefore they might have obtained their money from Tomldes. And if West\u2019s consent bound him, still Gfymes\u2019 estate should not have been subjected ; and as West was only liable as assignor, the action against him was barred in five years, and in fact no action was ever instituted against him. Nor could the decree for an account in that cause have the effect to prevent the bar of the statute; because there could be no decree upon that bill between codefendants. 2 Rob. Pr. <em>397-8; Yerby </em>v. <em>Grigsby, </em>9 Leigh <em>387; Crawford </em>v. <em>McDaniel, 1 </em>Rob. R. 448; <em>Eccleston </em>v. <em>Lord Skelmersdale, </em>1 Beav. R. 396, 17 Eng. Ch. R. 396; <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Clewley, 2 </em>Beav. R. 30, 17 Eng. Ch. R. 30.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-12\">When the decree perpetuating the injunction was made, Harrison\u2019s executors should have been left to their action on the assignment. This right of action arose in 1818, more than nine years before the suit was revived against Braxton as representative of Grymes ; and it was then irregularly revived, because in fact there was no case to revive. Tomldes had obtained all he asked, and he could not amend a bill to set up a claim of Harrison\u2019s executors against Grymes\u2019 estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-13\">Such was the condition of things as to Braxton and Grymes\u2019 estate when May wrote his letter to Braxton; a letter which, whatever was the purpose of the writer, did mislead Braxton ; and he was misled when he executed the agreement, as is plainly shown both on the face of the agreement and the letters filed. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>do not insist that the action of May was fraudulent; ^ut parties coming into equity for relief, the court apply to them the principles applicable to other of the specific execution of contract. For these principles the court is referred to 2 Rob. Pr. 169, 170 : 1 Story\u2019s Equ. Jur. \u00a7 750. Certainly equity will not execute an agreement where there is neither a meritorious or valuable consideration ; nor will it even aid a defective conveyance. <em>Darlington </em>v. <em>McCoole, 1 </em>Leigh 36. Here, though this agreement is called a compromise, yet it \"is all on one side, and is'without consideration. The whole amount of the claim of Harrison\u2019s executors is their judgment against Tomkies, and that is to be paid in full. As to\u2019the costs, they were not coming to Harrison\u2019s executors, but to Tomkies, and the executors had no control over them. But moreover, the agreement expresses on its face, that Braxton did not bind himself further than he was bound before. Is this then a contract which a court of equity will enforce ? There must be mutuality in the contract, and for that reason the contracts of infants will not be enforced even at their suit. <em>Flight </em>v. <em>Bolland, </em>3 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 675. Does anybody imagine that an action at law could be maintained against Braxton upon this agreement, in his individual character ? And if not, certainly an action could not be maintained upon it against him as administrator. If an action against him as administrator could be maintained, then probably there might be a bill to enforce it, and for an account of assets. But if such an action cannot be maintained upon it, then there cannot be a bill in equity founded upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-6\">In fact, the bill in this ease is not based upon the agreement, but upon the case as it existed before the agreement was made. The plaintiffs claim as assignees and upon the doctrine of subrogation. The first ground cannot be good against Grymes\u2019 estate if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>good against the assignor West: And we have already shown that the statute bars the claim against him. Then as to the right of subrogation. The bond to Harrison has been paid, and paid out of Grymes\u2019 estate. Whatever right exists must arise as before \u00b0 said, out of the assignment. When that right is barred, any right arising out of it must be at an end. But if. Harrison\u2019s executors are entitled to be subrogated to West, they can only have the same rights which West has against Grymes\u2019 estate. .But West has no such right, because he assented to the decree perpetuating the injunction; or if he had any, certainly he was only entitled to a credit in his account of administration for the amount.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-8\"><em>Irving, </em>for the appellees:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-9\">I take it to be clear law, that where a bond is assigned as the bond in this case was, and it is not a valid bond, it is no payment, but there is a failure of consideration, and the assignee has a right to come back upon his debtor upon the foot of his original debt. In such a case the assignment of the bond is not a payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-10\">There is nothing in the record of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>Haxall </em>which shows negligence in the prosecution of the claim by Harrison\u2019s executors against Tomkies. The counsel for the appellant has argued the cause without reference to the fact that Grymes\u2019 administrator was a party in that cause, and a party consenting to the perpetuation of the injunction in that cause. And it cannot be successfully maintained, that when the assignor and assignee are united in the defence, and the assignor assents to the defeat of the claim, the assignee shall be precluded from his remedy against him. But in fact, there was no proof in the cause which would have authorized the dissolution of the injunction. There was proof that Wyatt\u2019s legacy due from Grymes had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>been assigned to Tomkies, and there was no proof that ^ kad been paid. The old case of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>Grymes </em>not discovered for twelve years after the consent decree- There is no proof that its existence was known to Harrison\u2019s executors; and it was not even known to Braxton when he filed his first answer in the case of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>Haxall.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-8\">But it is insisted that the statute of limitations bars the claim of Harrison\u2019s executors; and this because there could be no decree between codefendants in Tomkies against Haxall. The authorities cited by the counsel on the other side are against him. The whole question in controversy in that case was, whether the bond of Tomkies assigned by West to Harrison\u2019s executors was due. In this question the interest of Harrison\u2019s executors and Grymes\u2019 administrator was the same; and when it was held that the bond was not due, everything was ascertained which was necessary to entitle Harrison\u2019s executors to a decree over against Grymes\u2019 administrator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-9\">But the present suit is upon the agreement between May on behalf of Harrison\u2019s executors and Braxton. This agreement is under seal, and relates to a matter of which Braxton was fully informed. If, therefore, the case of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>Haxall </em>is at an end, and the claim arising out of it is barred by the statute, Grymes\u2019 estate is bound by this new agreement, because it admits the debt as still due. But it is said there is no mutuality in the contract. Braxton only bound himself to pay what he admitted to be due out of the assets of the estate. He obtained a delay of twelve months, which he deemed of material advantage to him, and was discharged from the costs of the suit; and he settled a protracted controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-10\">It is argued that we claim through West, and that .he is not entitled to recover against Grymes\u2019 estate: And this is the vice of the argument on the other side. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>We do not claim through West. We say that the bond of Tomkies not being a valid debt, the assignment of that bond to Harrison\u2019s executors was not payment; but that so much of our original debt due bv bond, is a still subsisting debt, which we are \u25a0 enti- ' \u00b0 tied to have paid out of the estate of Grymes the debtor.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-9\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellant, in reply:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-10\">It is argued by the counsel for the appellees, that the debt due from Grymes to Harrison had never been paid. It has been taken in receipted as paid, and the administrator of Grymes has been allowed a credit for its payment. It was paid in part by Morgan Tompkies\u2019 bond; and whatever rights the plaintiffs have in this case must arise out of that contract of assignment. They may have taken it without recourse, and in that case they must certainly lose it. It is, therefore, this contract which is the origin of their rights. It may be that in the case of a forged bond the payment might be treated as a nullity; but here was a valid bond, proved to be so by the judgment upon it. When then West passed this bond to Harrison\u2019s executors, he passed to them value. But if it is said it was a forged bond, or that it was subject to setoff, then this is to be proved. Here West in his answer says a part of this setoff, and he believes all of it, had been paid. Then is it enough for Harrison\u2019s executors to consent to the decree, and to use it to prove their claim against Grymes\u2019 estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag1\">If any question of law is settled, it is settled law that Harrison\u2019s executors have no claim upon the foundation of the original debt. <em>Thacher </em>v. <em>Dinsmore, </em>5 Mass. R. 299; <em>Bank of St. Albans </em>v. <em>Gilliland, </em>23 Wend. R. 311; <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Shore, </em>22 Eng. Ch. R. 378. If there had been a surety in the original bond, could his liability be revived ? This subject is well treated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>7 Mass. R. 286. Then when West transferred Tomkies\u2019 bond in discharge of Grymes\u2019 debt, the remedy of Harrison\u2019s executors is upon his undertaking whether express or. implied upon the transfer. In a transfer of a forged note there is an .... implied warranty of its genuineness; but there is no such warranty that the parties are solvent. <em>Edmunds </em>v. <em>Digges, </em>1 Gratt. 359. If, therefore, West had paid the amount in bank notes, Harrison\u2019s executors would have had no remedy either upon the original bond or the notes. And in <em>Mays </em>v. <em>Callison, </em>6 Leigh 230, it is said that it might be submitted to the jury whether upon all the facts there was a warranty that the bond had not been paid: That was an action by an assignee against his assignor. The liabilities of an assignor are stated in <em>Turneys </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>8 B. Monr. 401. In all such cases, where the bond assigned is a valid instrument, as was the bond in this case, the question of the assignor\u2019s liability resolves itself into a question of due diligence; and mpon that question there can be no doubt in this case, unless the injunction concludes it; which it does not. <em>McClung </em>v. <em>Arbuckle, </em>6 Munf. 315. It is clear that if due diligence had been used the injunction would not have been perpetuated: For certainly West had a right to enforce the payment by Tomkies of his bond. <em>White </em>v. <em>Banister, </em>1 Wash. 166; <em>Pulliam </em>v. <em>Winston, </em>5 Leigh 324. This would have been the case if West had sued Tomkies; and the case is still stronger when the suit is by an assignee; as no equity could be set up against the bond unless there had been notice of it before the assignment. Here there was no such equity; for West denies expressly the equity set up in the bill; and there was no proof of it in the cause. Then it was the fault of Harrison\u2019s executors that the injunction was perpetuated ; and they therefore can have no equity to compel Grymes\u2019 estate to pay the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>There is but one answer to this argument: That is, that Grymes owed Tomkies. This is necessary to their recovery, and they must prove it. The we think ought to satisfy the court that Tomkies had no valid claim against Grymes\u2019 estate: but whether \u00b0 <em>J </em>or not this be so, Harrison\u2019s executors do not prove that he had. They attempt to obviate this objection by the concurrent consent of West\u2019s and Grymes\u2019 administrators. But this does not excuse Harrison\u2019s executors, unless they show that Grymes\u2019 estate has not been injured by the perpetuation of the injunction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-11\">But if Harrison\u2019s executors had a right to recover from Grymes\u2019 estate the amount of Tomkies\u2019 bond, that recovery was to be had either in the suit of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>Haxall, </em>or by a new action. If they could not recover in that suit, then their claim was barred after five years from the perpetuation of the injunction. If they could have recovered in that suit, then this suit was improperly instituted: And this objection is distinctly taken in the answer of Braxton. This conclusion is inevitable if the case of <em>Heywood </em>v. <em>Covington, </em>4 Leigh 373, is to be respected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-13\">But the agreement between May acting for Harrison\u2019s executors and Braxton is relied on to sustain this claim. If this new agreement is to alter the rights and liabilities of the parties, then Braxton was misled. The letters show that he derived his information from May. There was, moreover, no consideration for the agreement. It is said Braxton obtained a year\u2019s indulgence. But this is no consideration. Forbearance to an executor is only a consideration where he binds himself; and this he expressly declined to do. There were in fact no assets in his hands at the time; and if there were assets, it was not the interest of the estate that indulgence should be given. As to the dismissal of the suit, that was not within the control of Hand-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>son\u2019s executors; and in fact it is not yet dismissed: And the same may be said of the costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-10\">It is argued that the agreement and letters dispense with the proof of due diligence, and that the debt was just. It would be most unjust that these papers should have' this effect. Braxton knew the facts or he did not. If he did not, then he could not be bound. If he did know, a court of equity will not permit an executor to injure the estate by his admissions. Since the statute, Code, p. 548, \u00a7 6, his admissions could not affect Grymes\u2019 estate. According to the weight of authority, no executor can preclude the estate from setting up any defence by his admissions. <em>Thompson </em>v. Peter, 12 Wheat. R. 565; <em>Tullock </em>v. <em>Dunn, 21 </em>Eng. C. L. 478; <em>Scholey </em>v. <em>Walton, 12 </em>Mees. &amp; Welsb. 510; <em>Fritz </em>v. Thomas, 1 Whart. R. 66; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>7 Watts\u2019 R. 420. If the claim was not just without the agreement and letters, it is not just with them. This agreement then gives no strength to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim either to the right or to the remedy; and therefore the bill should be dismissed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-11\">Moncure, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVM\">after stating the case, proceeded :</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">It was contended by the counsel for the appellants in this case, that conceding that the bond of Tomkies was assigned by West to Harrison\u2019s executors in payment of a debt due by Grymes to them, and that they used due diligence to recover the amount of the bond, but failed to do so by reason of its being satisfied by a debt due by Grymes to Tomkies; still they would have no claim to relief, even in equity, against Grymes\u2019 estate ; and would have to rely alone on the recourse which his contract of assignment might give them against West individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">It will be a sufficient answer to the above proposition to say, that if the bond of Tomkies was satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>by a debt due by Grymes to Tomkies, it was a debt of the highest dignity; being due by Grymes, who was executor of John Robinson, to Tomkies, as assignee a legacy given by said Robinson to his daughter Mrs. Wyatt. This debt was not charged to the estate of <em>J </em># \u00b0 Grymes in the administration account of <em>West; </em>and having, in effect, been paid by Harrison\u2019s executors, they are entitled to be substituted in equity to the place of the creditor, and to have the debt, to the extent to which they are entitled to it, paid out of the estate of Grymes.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">It was further contended, that if Harrison\u2019s executors could have had any recourse against the estate of Grymes for the amount of Tomkies\u2019 bond, it could only have been on the terms of using due diligence to collect the bond ;' and that they did not use due diligence, in as much as they consented to the decree perpetuating the injunction of the judgment on the bond, without which consent the injunction would not have been perpetuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">It is not pretended that there was any want of diligence on the part of Harrison\u2019s executors, except in giving their consent to the decree of perpetuation. They seem to have been prompt, not only in asserting their claim against Grymes\u2019 estate on the day of sale, but in suing on the bond of Tomkies shortly after it became due, and obtaining a judgment at law, and then a judgment on a forthcoming bond, when they were enjoined from further proceedings. They promptly filed their answer to the bill of injunction, and moved to dissolve it; but their motion was overruled, and an account was ordered. Afterwards, by consent of parties, the cause came on to be heard, the same account settled in another case was taken as the account in the injunction suit, and the injunction was dissolved. Whether it would have been dissolved but for such consent, it is impossible to say, and unnecessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>decide. There was filed with the bill an affidavit of Wyatt, the only child and distributee at law of the Mrs. Wyatt, sustaining its allegation; to the reading of which affidavit as evidence no exception was taken. The record of the suit of <em>Wyatt &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Grymes, </em>in the County court of Middlesex, was not an exhibit in the injunction suit, and had not then been discovered. It is true the answer of West denied the equity of the bill, and was sustained in part by a deposition. In the condition in which the case was, the injunction should, I think, have been dissolved. But.the court did not think so, and overruled the motion for that ^purpose, and ordered the account. This was an indication of the opinion of the court, that if upon taking the account, Grymes should be found to owe as much on account of the legacy as the amount of the judgment, the injunction should be perpetuated. And when afterwards the same account was taken in another suit of another legatee of Robinson, and it was thereby ascertained that Grymes had received ample estate of Robinson to pay all his legacies, the representatives of West and of Grymes, who were defendants in the injunction suit, doubtless wishing to save the trouble and expense of retaking the same account, and believing that there was at least as much due on the legacy to Mrs. Wyatt as was equal to the amount of the judgment against Tomkies, consented to the perpetuation of the injunction. There was nothing then in the case to show that any part of the legacy had been paid. West had said in his answer that he had a voucher for the payment of one hundred pounds, and that it was probable nothing was due on account of the legacy; but there was no proof to sustain these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">And when the cause came on to be heard, it presented but one difficulty; and that was in regal\u2019d to the right of Tomkies to have his bond set off against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the legacy. So far as Grymes\u2019 estate was concerned, it was simply a question whether so much of the legacy as was equal to the amount of the bond be paid to Harrison\u2019s executors or some other person, If the injunction should be perpetuated, it would be due to Harrison\u2019s executors s If dissolved, to Tomkies, or some other person. It was, therefore, of no consequence to Grymes\u2019 estate whether it was perpetuated or dissolved. It was desirable of course to end the litigation; and it could best be ended by a consent decree; to which, it seems from the record, the consent of Harrison\u2019s executors was obtained. The representatives of West and of Grymes seem, therefore, to have acted in good faith in consenting to the decree. Certainly there is nothing to impugn the good faith of Harrison\u2019s executors in giving their consent, if in fact they did give it; as must be taken to be the fact, since it so appears by the record. They might lose, but could not gain, by giving their consent. By doing so, they gave up all claim against Tomkies, and consented to retain only their recourse against Grymes\u2019 estate. They could safely do this if they chose, with the consent of the representatives of West and of Grymes. An assignee may safely be governed by the instructions of the assignor in the management of the assigned claim: and ordinarily he could not disregard them without endangering his recourse against the assignor. When an obligor in an assigned bond enjoins a 'judgment on the bond on the ground of some equity existing between himself and the assignor, the assignee is generally ignorant of the facts, and leaves them to be litigated between the obligor and assignor. He has a right to require strict proof of the facts, because he has a right to enforce the bond if due, as well as to have his recourse against the assignor. But he may, if he choose, waive the former right and retain the latter, if the assignor admit the ground of equity and consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>to a decree of perpetuation. The consent of the assignee to the decree has no other effect than as a waiver of his right to proceed further on the bond, and cannot aifect his recourse against the assignor, who also conseil^ec^ Nothing would be plainer than this in a case jn which an assignor is acting in his own right, and there can be no difference in a case in which he is acting as administrator; supposing him to act in good faith, or that the assignee has no notice or reason to believe that he is acting otherwise. An administrator has an lindoubted right to confess a judgment, or consent to a decree, if he believes that the interest of the estate he represents requires it. Whether, therefore, the injunction would have been perpetuated or not without the consent of Harrison\u2019s executors, yet as West\u2019s and Grymes\u2019 representatives also consented, and as all parties seem to have acted in good faith in the matter, Harrison\u2019s executors did not thereby forfeit their recourse against the estate of Grymes, but became entitled, by the perpetuation of the injunction, to demand of that estate the amount of the judgment against Tomkies.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">It was further contended, that the right of Harrison\u2019s executors, if any, to have recourse against Grymes\u2019 estate, accrued at the time of the perpetuation of the injunction in 1818, and could not be enforced in the injunction suit, but only by a new and independent suit; so that when the agreement of compromise was made in 1828, on which this suit was brought, the claim of Harrison\u2019s executors was barred by the act of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">It is true that the right of Harrison\u2019s executors to have recourse against Grymes\u2019 estate accrued at the time of the perpetuation of the injunction; but it is not, I think, true that such right could not be enforced in the injunction suit. I think the case came within the reason .and operation of the rule, .that \u201c where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>case is made out between defendants by evidence arising from pleadings and proofs between plaintiffs and defendants, a court of equity has a right and is bound to make a decree between the defendants.\u201d See <em>2 </em>Rob. Pr. 397, and the cases cited; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Taliaferro, </em>4 Munf. 243; <em>Dades\u2019 adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 Leigh 401. Though a suit be disposed of as to the plaintiff, it may be retained until proper accounts can be taken, in order to render to one of the defendants the relief to which he may be entitled against the other. <em>Morris &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Terrell, 2 </em>Rand. 6. A defendant may in some cases object to a decree against him in favor of his co-defendant, on the ground that there is no issue made up between them, and their peculiar matters of difference have not been ascertained and settled. But the party entitled to make such objection may certainly waive it, and consent to a decree against him; and it may often be his interest to do so. In this case both West\u2019s administrator and Grymes\u2019 administrator (Healy) consented, not only to the perpetuation of the injunction, but to a decreel \u201cthat the defendant George West settle the transactions of his intestate on the estate of Philip L. Grymes, and that the defendant George Healy also settle his transactions on the estate of the said Philip L. Grymes, before one of the commissioners\u201d of the court, who was directed to settle, state and report the same. This decree could only have been made on the admission of the administrators of West and Grymes, that the estate of Grymes was liable to Harrison\u2019s executors for the amount of the enjoined judgment, and by a decree in that suit, so soon as it could be ascertained, by a settlement of the accounts, that there were sufficient assets to meet the liability. It is a mistake to suppose that the injunction suit was brought, not only to enjoin the judgment, bnt also to recover the balance of the legacy claimed by Tomkies. A suit had been brought by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Tomkies for that legacy, and was pending when the injunction suit was brought. And the only object of latter suit was to enjoin the judgment on the assigned bond until a decree could be obtained in the other suit, and to obtain relief to the extent of that judgment. When the injunction was perpetuated, Tomkies obtained all the relief which he sought, or to which he was entitled, in the injunction suit. Its further prosecution, therefore, could only have been for the benefit of Harrison\u2019s executors. This suit was pending for the benefit of Harrison\u2019s executors when the agreement of compromise was made in 1828, and their claim was not then barred by the act of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">It was further contended, that the agreement of 1828 is of no effect: 1. Because an administrator can create no new cause of action, nor revive an old one, against his decedent\u2019s estate. 2. Because the agreement was made on the mere representation of the counsel of Hamson\u2019s executors, which, though not fraudulent, yet tended to mislead and did mislead the administrator of G-rymes; and in ignorance of the fact that the decree of perpetuation was by their consent, and of the existence of the record of the suit of <em>Wyatt &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Grymes </em>in Middlesex county court. 3. Because it was founded on no consideration, and was intended to give no new remedy to Harrison\u2019s executors, in case it should not be performed by Braxton, but leave them to resort to such remedies as they had, if any, when the agreement was entered into.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">As to the first objection, it is certainly true, as a general rule, that an administrator can create no new cause of action against his decedent\u2019s estate. But he has all the powers which are necessary to a proper discharge of the duties of his office. He may make settlements and compromises with creditors of the estate, and give them confessions of judgment; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>though he may thereby render himself liable for a <em>devastavit, </em>yet they will be entitled to the benefit of his acts, if they deal with him in good faith. He submit to arbitration matters in dispute in respect of the personal estate, and render it liable for the per- \u201e \u201e <em>L </em>formance of the award. 1 Lomax on Ex\u2019ors 356. As was said by Judge Cabell in <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Martin's adm'r, </em>6 Leigh 62, 71, \u201cIt is competent to an executor or administrator to submit to arbitration any controversy concerning the estate, whether the estate claims to be a debtor or creditor. This results, necessarily, from the full dominion which the law gives him over the assets, and the full discretion which it vests in him for the settlement and liquidation of all claims due to or from the estate. And although a mere submission to arbitration will not bind the executor or administrator personally, to pay the sum awarded out of his own estate, yet the award is binding on him in his fiduciary character, and consequently on the assets of the estate which he represents. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>5 T. R. 6; <em>Lyle </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>5 Wheat. R. 394.\u201d An executor or administrator may be sued as such, on promises to pay a debt of the estate. A count, on an account stated by a defendant as executor respecting moneys due from the testator, or from the defendant as executor, maybe supported, and joined with counts on promises by the testator. Chitty on Contr. 275; 1 Chitty\u2019s Plead. 275; <em>Secar </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>1 H. Bl. 102; 2 Saund. 117 e, note 2; <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>6 John. R. 112; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Phelps' adm'r, </em>8 Id. 343. This doctrine has been fully recognized in Virginia. <em>Epes' adm'r </em>v. <em>Dudley, adm'r, </em>5 Rand. 437; <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Harrison's adm'r, </em>2 Leigh 532. In the latter case Judge Cabell said, \u201cIt is perfectly clear that in an action against an executor or administrator, such counts,\u201d that is, counts on promises by the executor as such, and counts on promises by the testator, \u201cmay be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>joined; and that that is the proper mode of declaring* against executors or administrators to save the statute limitations.\u201d See also <em>2 </em>Lomax on Ex\u2019ors 419. Whether before the Code took effect, an executor or administrator might have revived a debt barred by the \u00b0 <em>J </em>act of limitations, is -a question which may admit of controversy, and about which there is some conflict of authority. The cases of <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Botsford, </em>7 Conn. R. 172; <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>1 Whart. R. 66; and possibly <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Peter, 12 </em>Wheat. R. 565, decide or assume- that he could not. In all these cases the debt had been long barred when the promise was made; and vague and loose admissions were relied on as evidence of a promise, which might not have been sufficient even if made by the party who owed the debt. The observations of the court should be taken in reference to the cases in which they were made. Chief Justice Marshall, in saying, in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Peter, </em>that \u201cdeclarations against him,\u201d the .executor or administrator, \u201c have never been held to take the promise of a testator or intestate out of the act; indeed the contrary has been held;\u201d surely did not mean to say that an executor or administrator could not be sued on his promise to pay a debt of his testator or intestate not barred at the time of making the promise, and that such promise would not prevent the operation of the act; for he knew that the law was well settled otherwise. He probably only intended to say that mere <em>declarations, </em>such as were proved in that case, and as contradistinguished from a <em>promise </em>of an executor, had never been held to take the promise of the testator out of the act. Chief Justice Gribson did not mean to say so in <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>for he had expressly said otherwise in <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Weiser, 12 </em>Serg. <em>&amp; </em>Raw. 97, in which he held that an administratrix was liable as such on an implied promise for money paid', laid out and expended. His remarks in <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>in regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the danger of making an estate liable on vague and indefinite admissions and promises of the executor or administrator, who is often ignorant of the transaction, are certainly very just; and courts and juries should be cautious in weighing the evidence of such admis- \u25a0 it-. t-t sions and promises. Admissions which would have been held sufficient to take a debt due by the person making them out of the statute, have been held insufficient for that purpose when made by an executor or administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">In <em>Tullock </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>21 Eng. C. L. R. 478, Chief Justice Abbott said, \u201c As against an executor, an acknowledgment merely is not sufficient to take a case out of the statute, there must be an express promise.\u201d 2 Lomax on Ex\u2019ors 418. But that an executor or administrator might be sued as such on his promise to pay a debt of his testator or intestate not barred at the time of making the promise, is too well settled to admit of controversy. In this case, when the agreement was made there was, as I have attempted to show, a debt due by Chymes\u2019 estate to Harrison\u2019s executors, not barred by the act of limitations, but in a course of continued prosecution from the instant of the accrual of the cause of action. By the decree perpetuating the injunction and directing a settlement of the administration of Cry mes\u2019 estate, that estate was rendered liable, in whosesoever hands it might come, for the claim of Harrison\u2019s executors. A judgment against an administrator, even though it be confessed by him, may be revived against an administrator <em>de bonis non. </em>A suit may be brought against the latter on a promise made by the former to pay a debt of his intestate. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Harrison's adm'r, </em>2 Leigh 532. \u201c It is clearly competent to an executor,\u201d says Judge Cabell in that case, \u201c by his promise to pay a debt of the testator, to exempt the case from the operation of the statute of limitations ; and it is no <em>devas</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>tavit </em>in Mm to do so. If the executor die or he remove^ before he has paid the debt, it still remains a debt due from the testator; and the obligation to pay it devolves on the administrator <em>de bonis </em>non, who comes in the place of the executor, and is the representative of the testator.\u201d When, therefore, Healy, by whose consent the decree had been rendered, was removed from the administration, and Braxton was appointed administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>Harrison\u2019s executors had a right to have the suit revived against the latter, and accordingly sued out a <em>scire facias </em>for the purpose. In this state of things Braxton, who was suing Healy and his securities for the assets in his hands, and was expecting soon to recover them, and who also, in right of his wife, was sole residuary devisee and legatee of Grymes, agreed, on certain terms, to pay the debt to Harrison\u2019s executors out of the assets when recovered. I think the agreement is clearly binding upon him as administrator of Grymes, unless it is invalid on the second and third objections made to it, or either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">As to the second objection, that the agreement was made on the mere representation of the counsel of Harrison\u2019s executors, and in ignorance of the fact that the decree of perpetuation was made by their consent, and of the existence of the record of the suit of <em>Wyatt &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Grymes. </em>May, the counsel of Harrison\u2019s executors, was guilty of no fraud or misrepresentation, and Braxton was not taken by surprise, in making the agreement. After the suit of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West </em>had been removed from Williamsburg to Richmond, May was retained to prosecute it as counsel for Harrison\u2019s executors. He examined the case, and wrote to Braxton in December 1826, stating his views of it, and proposing an agreement, saying that his client was \u201c old and averse to trouble and litigation.\u201d The agreement was accordingly made about a year there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>after. In the letter, nothing was said about the consent of Harrison\u2019s executors to the decree of perpetuation. I have attempted to show that such consent, given without fraud, which is not imputed to them, did not affect their right to recourse against Gfrymes\u2019 estate. It is probable that May had not adverted to the fact, or did not deem it material, when he wrote the letter. But the fact was known to Braxton before he entered into the agreement, as is proved in May\u2019s deposition. Braxton had ample time and opportunity to make himself acquainted with all the facts. He appears to have done so, at least so far as to examine the record in <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West, </em>which was the only source from which May professed to derive his information. May proves that Braxton and himself examined the papers, on at least two different days, before they entered into the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In Braxton\u2019s letters to Harrison, written in November 1838 and October 1829, nearly one and two years after the date of the agreement, the former expresses his satisfaction therewith, and his desire and intention to perform it on his part. It is needless to enquire how far the record of the suit of <em>Wyatt &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Grymes </em>tends to show that the legacy or any part of it had been paid by Gfrymes in his life time, _or what would have been its effect, had a copy of it been filed as evidence in the suit of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West </em>when the consent decree was rendered. When that record was discovered by Braxton, more than ten years had elapsed since the decree of perpetuation, and several years since the date of the agreement; and it was then too late to give it any effect on either. It would have been too late to affect the agreement, even if it had been a compromise of a doubtful claim. The compromise of a doubtful title, when procured without such deceit as would vitiate any other contract, concludes the parties, though ignorant of the extent of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>rights. Per Gibson, chief justice, in <em>Hoge </em>v. Hoge, 1 Watts\u2019 R. 163, 216. As was said by the master of the rolls in <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>2 Beav. R. 31, 17 Eng. Ch. R. 31, \u201c When parties whose rights are &lt;tues^ona^)^e have equal knowledge of facts, and equal means of ascertaining what their rights-really are, and they fairly endeavor to settle their respective claims among themselves, every court feels disposed to support the conclusions or agreements to which they may fairly come at the time, and that, notwithstanding the subsequent discovery of common error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">As to the third and last objection, that the agreement was founded on no consideration, and was intended to give no new remedy to Harrison\u2019s executors in case it should not be performed by Braxton, but leave them to resort to such remedies as they had, if any, when the agreement was entered into. If, at the date of the agreement, Grymes\u2019 estate was already liable to Harrison\u2019s executors for the amount of the judgment against Tomkies, as I have before endeavored to show, then the existence of that liability was of itself a sufficient consideration for the agreement; it being in effect an account stated by an administrator of a debt due by his testator, and a promise to pay the amount out of the assets; which, we have seen, is a good cause of action against an administrator in his representative character. But even if that liability had been doubtful, it was at least a subject of controversy in a pending suit at the time the agreement was entered into, and was a good consideration for a compromise. \u201c There can be no doubt that the resignation of a colorable claim, conflicting with that of another person, and the settlement of the dispute between the parties without suit, constitute a good consideration;\u201d and \u201cin these cases, inequality of consideration does not, of itself, form any objection.\u201d Chitty on Contr. 26. But it is said there was in effect no consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>in this case, the promise being to pay the entire debt claimed by Harrison\u2019s executors. The promise, it will be observed, was not to pay the debt out of the estate of Braxton, but out of the assets of his testator when enough for the purpose should come to his hands. And, out of abundant caution, it was further expressly declared in the agreement that nothing therein contained should be construed to bind the administrator of Grymes in any other than his representative capacity. What would be a reasonable compromise for the administrator to make on account of his testator\u2019s estate, was a question which depended upon all the circumstances. If Harrison\u2019s executors had confidence in their claim, they could not be expected to give much, if any of it, up; or to do more for the sake of ending litigation than give a little more time for payment; especially as the security of the debt was not to be increased. And if Grymes\u2019 administrator had good reason to apprehend that the whole debt would be recovered of his testator\u2019s estate, (and he says in one of his letters that when he entered into the agreement he was fully convinced of the justness of the claim,) he might well be willing to end the litigation by agreeing to pay the debt in a limited time, and out of the assets when in hand. Such a compromise, under such circumstances, could not be said to be without a sufficient consideration to sustain it. If, under such circumstances, Grymes\u2019 administrator had confessed a decree when assets for the whole amount of the debt, the decree would have bound the estate; and there is at least as much reason in its being bound by his agreement to pay the debt when assets and after a limited period. Harrison\u2019s executors had obtained a decree in the suit of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West </em>for the settlement of Healy\u2019s administration account on Grymes\u2019 estate. Healy had been removed and Braxton appointed administrator in his place; and the suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>had been revived against the latter. Braxton was prosecuting a suit, and expecting very soon to obtain a decree, against Healy and his sureties, for a large amount of the assets of Grymes. He was fully convinced of the justness of the claim of Harrison\u2019s ex- .... ecutors, and wished to end the litigation in <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West, </em>and to have sufficient time to obtain his expected decree, and realize the amount, or at least enough to pay the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">In this state of things, the agreement was made, and the objects which Braxton seems to have had in view were thereby secured. It stipulated that Braxton should have at least twelve months for the payment of the debt, and then should only be bound to pay it as administrator, and out of the assets when received; that upon the.payment of the money a bond of indemnity should be executed by Harrison\u2019s legatees to Braxton; and Harrison\u2019s executors would dismiss the suit of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West, </em>as far as they were concerned, and relinquish the costs. That suit was, in effect, their suit after the decree of 1818, and the further prosecution of it was at their costs. <em>Morris, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Terrell, 2 </em>Rand. 6. They had a right, therefore, to stipulate for its dismission, even absolutely; and for the relinquishment of the costs. I think these stipulations constituted a sufficient legal consideration for the agreement on'the part of Grymes\u2019 administrator. The memorandum annexed to the agreement giving Harrison\u2019s executors the right to cancel the agreement at the end of six months, upon requiring Braxton to cancel the duplicate thereof in his possession, does not alter the case. It is not pretended that the agreement was ever in fact canceled. On the contrary, it appears that it was not, and that for nearly two years thereafter, Harrison\u2019s executors were urging, and Braxton was promising, a compliance therewith on his part. I also think that the agreement gives, and was intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>to give, a new remedy thereon to Harrison\u2019s executors for the nonperformance thereof by Grymes\u2019 administrator, and does not leave them to resort to their as their only, remedy. Being a valid agreement, remedy thereon for a breach of it would seem to follow as a necessary consequence. An intention to preelude such a remedy, if it would not be wholly repugnant and void, ought at least to be plainly indicated, to have any legal effect. There is nothing in the agreement in question to indicate such an intention: though in reserving liberty to Harrison\u2019s executors, in case of nonpayment of the debt at the. termination of the period stipulated, to resort to any legal means for the recovery thereof, it was doubtless intended not to extinguish the old remedy, but to give them a right to resort to the old or new at their election. The stipulation that nothing contained in the agreement should be construed to bind the administrator in any other than his representative capacity, plainly assumes that it was intended to bind him in that.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">It was further contended, that no action at law could be sustained upon the agreement; that in coming into a court of equity for relief, the plaintiffs must be subjected to those principles which are applicable to a suit for specific performance; and that according to them Harrison\u2019s executors were not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">It is unnecessary to decide in this case, whether an action at law could have been sustained upon the agreement. If it could, the counsel for the appellant seemed to admit that a suit in equity might have been proper to obtain an account of the assets, and have them marshaled, if necessary. But conceding that it could not, that fact would seem to strengthen, rather than weaken, the right of Harrison\u2019s executors to come into equity for relief. It was expressly declared by the agreement that the estate of Grymes should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>bound for the debt, and not the administrator persona'Hy : And if) by reason of the seals annexed to the the debt could not be recovered of the <em>es^e ^ </em>law&gt; surely a court of equity, which looks to substance and not form, ought, for that very cause if no other, to aiford relief; unless there be something to prevent it, in the latter part of the proposition above stated. I do not think that there is. Whatever equity Grymes\u2019 administrator may have against Tomkies, or even against West or Healy, he can have none against Harrison\u2019s executors. They have acted in good faith, and ask for nothing.to which they are not in conscience entitled. They are <em>bona fide </em>creditors of Grymes, whose estate is ample for the payment of the debt ; and yet they have been endeavoring in vain to obtain payment, for nearly fifty years since the death of Grymes, and nearly twenty-five since the date of the agreement. They have performed their part of the agreement, so far as it was to be performed before the payment of the debt; and are ready to perform the residue upon such payment. And they now ask that it may be performed on the other side. I know of no principle of equity on which relief can be denied them.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Lastly, it was contended that if Harrison\u2019s executors were entitled to obtain relief, for the breach of the agreement, by a further prosecution of the suit of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West, </em>they could obtain it only in that way, and not by a new suit on the agreement; on the principle of the case of <em>Heywood </em>v. <em>Covingtons heirs, </em>4 Leigh 373. I do not think that principle applies to this case. There, a suit was brought in the County court for a sale and partition of real estate of an intestate among his heirs. A sale was accordingly made under a decree in the suit; and the purchaser refused to complete his purchase. Pending the suit in the County court, the heirs brought a suit against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>purchaser in the Superior court for specific execution. This court decided that the Superior court could not entertain the bill pending the suit in the County There the sale was made, not by the heirs by an agreement <em>in pais ; </em>but by a commissioner of the court; in x <em>J </em>. effect by the court; m a pending cause. The purchaser, by buying under a decree, had subjected himself to the orders of the court in that cause : and the appropriate and only remedy against him, at least during the pendency of the cause, was by some proceeding therein. But here, the parties to a pending cause, or some of them, enter into an agreement out of court; the main object of which is, not to prosecute the suit further, but to put an end to it. And though liberty is reserved'to Harrison\u2019s executors, in a certain event, to resort to their original remedy, yet that was intended as a benefit to them, and not to deprive them of the right, at their election, to sue upon the agreement. I think they had not only a right to bring such a suit, but that it was a more suitable remedy, under all the circumstances, than a further prosecution of the old suit of <em>Tomkies </em>v. <em>West. </em>By the terms of the agreement that suit is to be dismissed, and the costs of Harrison\u2019s executors therein relinquished, when the debt is paid. The court below can provide for the performance of this part of the agreement, if necessary, in the final decree which may be made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">Upon the whole, I think the decree is right, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b89-12\">Samuels, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5l\">was of opinion that the decree should be reversed, and the bill dismissed without prejudice to the appellee\u2019s remedy in the case of <em>Tomkies\u2019 adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>West\u2019s adm\u2019r &amp; others.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b89-13\">Lee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsE\">was of opinion that Harrison\u2019s executors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>were bound to show that it was proper to perpetuate the injunction in the case of <em>Tomkies\u2019 adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>West\u2019s adm\u2019r &amp; others. </em>That their remedy was in that suit. That the statute of limitations applied to this case. That moreover the agreement between Braxton and May as the agent of Harrison\u2019s executors, afforded no foundation for a <em>suit; </em>and if it did, the circumstances under which it was made forbade a court of equity to be active in its execution: There was no consideration for the agreement, as all the debt was to be paid, and Harrison\u2019s executors could not release the costs of the plaintiff in <em>Tomkies\u2019 adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>West\u2019s adm\u2019r &amp; others.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Allen and Daniel, <em>Js. </em>concurred in the opinion of Moncure, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
