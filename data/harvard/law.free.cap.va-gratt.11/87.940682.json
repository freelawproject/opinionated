A deed of trust given to secure a debt provides that the grantor shall hold possession of the property until a certain day. Before that day the grantor makes an agreement under seal with a third person, by which he agrees to take a certain price for the property ; and if the money with its interest was not returned within twelve months, the agreement was to stand as a bill of sale; and he delivers possession of the property. The trustee who has had no notice of this agreement, takes possession of the property and sells it, within five years from the time to which the grantor was entitled to hold it, and within five years of the time which the agreement gave the grantor to return the purchase money; but not within five years of the time of the sale and delivery of the property to the party under the agreement. Held : The title of the purchaser of the grantor was not protected by the lapse of time, and the trustee was entitled to take possession and sell under the trust deed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-15\">This was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>in the Circuit court of the county of Rappahannock, brought by James M. Colvin against Alexander F. Menefee. The object of the suit was to recover the price of a slave named Milley, which had been sold by Menefee as trustee in a deed, and which Colvin claimed to have been his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-16\">On the trial of the cause the defendant asked for an instruction, which was given by the court; and the plaintiff excepted. The bill of exceptions showed, that by a deed bearing date the 5th of August 1837, William Harmons conveyed to Menefee certain real and personal property, of which the slave Milley was a part, in trust to secure certain debts therein speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>fied ; and the deed provided that Harmons should be permitted to retain possession of the property until the 1st of August 1839. This deed was duly recorded in the clerk\u2019s office of the County court of Madison, where Harmons then lived and held the said slave in his possession. On the 16th of October 1838 Harmons entered into a written agreement under seal with Colvin, by which he agreed to take two hundred and fifty dollars for the slave Milley: And if the money with its interest was not returned to Colvin within twelve months, the agreement was to stand as a bill of sale, clear of all incumbrance. This agreement was made at the house of Colvin in the county of Culpeper, at which time the slave was in the county of Madison in the possession of Harmons or Milton Hartley, under . a temporary pledge for the loan of money from Kirtley to Harmons. Within three or four days thereafter, Harmons sent the slave Milley to Colvin, to be held by him under the contract aforesaid of the 16th of October 1838; and Colvin held possession of her in the county of Culpeper until the end of the year 1842, when he removed from Culpeper to Madison county, and carried the slave with him, and retained possession of her until the end of the year 1843, holding and claiming title to her under the said contract. Some time in the year 1843 Harmons removed from Madison to Culpeper county; and some time in the year 1844, before the 13th of March of that year, the slave Milley was found in the possession of Harmons in Culpeper, and was taken possession of by the defendant, who sold her under the deed of trust aforesaid, on that day, for the price of four hundred and eighty-one dollars; for the recovery of which this suit was brought. Upon this state of facts the court on the motion of the defendant instructed the jury, that if they believed these facts, the said Colvin was to be regarded as having constructive notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>deed to Menefee, of the 5th of August 1837; and that it was not necessary for the protection of Menefee\u2019s title to have the said deed recorded in Culpeper at And if the jury should believe that the plaintiff held possession of the slave Milley under the said contract, his possession, so far as Menefee was concerned, was the same as the possession of Harmons up to the 16th of October 1839 ; and that the statute of limitations did not commence to run against the said Menefee until the 16th of October 1839: The statute runs only in cases where the possession is adverse. In this case the possession was not adverse until the expiration of one year from the date of said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\">Under this instruction the jury found a verdict for the defendant, upon' which the court rendered a judgment. And thereupon Colvin applied to this court for a supersedeas, which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-7\">Morson, for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-8\">This case comes up upon an instruction given by the court below, that in as much as the conditional sale allowed one year for the repayment of the purchase money of the slave, that this time is not to be taken into account in considering the bar of the statute of limitations. It cannot be said that there was not a conflict between the sale and the trust deed. The grantor assumed a power not given him by the <em>deed; </em>and the purchaser took in conflict with it: And if this be so, the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action. The adverse holding which is contemplated is a holding with a claim of right, and with a different title from the other side; and where there is such an adverse holding the statute runs. <em>Bradstreet </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>5 Peters\u2019 R. 401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-10\">Under the decisions of our courts it is not necessary to plead the statute of limitations in an action of detinue, and five years\u2019 peaceable possession of slaves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>gives title. <em>Newby\u2019s adm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Blakey, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 57; <em>Brent </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>5 Cranch\u2019s R. 358; <em>Shelby </em>v. <em>Guy, </em>11 Wheat. R. 361; <em>Elam </em>v. <em>Bass\u2019 ex\u2019ors, </em>4 Munf. 301; <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Enos, </em>4 Munf. 504. The court is also referred to the case of <em>Sheppards </em>v. <em>Turpin, </em>3 Gratt. 373, the facts of which resemble in a considerable degree the facts of this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-5\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">Here was a deed of trust duly recorded, which was a lien upon the property against all persons claiming under the grantor; and of which they were bound to take notice. Colvin then took no title -at the time of his purchase ; and he relies upon his length of possession as giving it. \u2018</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-7\">The possession of the grantor in the deed was consistent with it; and so was the possession of a purchaser from him. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>10 Leigh 186. That was a stronger case than the present, because in this by the deed the grantor was allowed to remain in possession. The trustee was not authorized to sell until August 1839; and he did take possession and sell within five years from that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-8\">The possession of Harmons the grantor was in trust for us; and no act of limitations could run in his favor against us. The possession of his assignee must be viewed in the same light, as he was bound to know the existence of the trust. And as Harmons had the right of possession to August 1839 and until the trustee should take possession and sell, it must be presumed that the assignee holds in the same way until by some public notorious act he sets up some other title. If a grantor in a deed may make a private sale so as to bar the trustee, then is it a very ready means to destroy trusts. But the law proceeds on the ground that a person claiming under the grantor stands in his position until he publicly disavows such possession. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>When he does this, and is allowed to remain in possession for five years, then he may protect himself by the statute. He is like one coming in place of a tenant; for a grantor or mortgagor, after the time for taking possesion under the deed, is a tenant at will. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Pleak, </em>6 Dana\u2019s R. 430. And like principles are announced in the case of a trustee in <em>Hendrick </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>7 Dana\u2019s R. 165.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">The doctrine above stated is conclusive of the case, without reference to the terms of the contract. But under the contract the time did not run until the end of twelve months. The purchaser could not <em>bona fide </em>claim title until that period; and without this the possession did not vest title. <em>Kitty </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh, </em>4 Rand. 600. The instruction given was in fact too favorable to the plaintiff. He proved no adverse possession either before or after October 1839 ; and therefore he was not entitled to the instruction that there was adverse possession at that time. It is said there was a conflict between the trust deed and the purchaser. But he must bring home knowledge of the contract to the trustee; and there is no pretence of such knowledge. The law presumes that the grantor was acting as he was authorized to do, and not as he was not authorized to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-7\">The case of <em>Sheppards </em>v. <em>Turpin, </em>3 Gratt. 373, is in strict conformity to the principles' which have been stated. There the property was not sold by the grantor in the deed, but by a public officer, who had taken it under an execution, and sold it at public auction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-8\"><em>Morson, </em>for the appellant, in reply:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-9\">The authorities cited by the counsel for the appellee belong to a class of cases essentially different from that before the court. They relate to the relation of landlord and tenant or trustees. This is of a wholly dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ferent character. Here there is no privity between Colvin and the trustee. The title he takes is an adverse title in its inception. This was not an agreement to vest the title at the end of the year if the money was not repaid; but it vested the title at once, and only vested in Harmons the right to repurchase within a year. Harmons alone had the right to do this: Colvin could not compel him to do it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-10\">It is true that the claim of title must be open and proved: And the bill of exceptions states that the possession was <em>held </em>from within three days of the day of sale under a claim of title. One of the canons of the law as to personal property is, that possession is indicative of title; and here there was this possession with a conveyance of the property by deed. To constitute an adversary possession, it is only necessary that it shall be with claim of title; not that the title claimed shall be good. <em>Shanks </em>v. <em>Lancaster, 5 </em>Graft. 110. And with reference to the statute of limitations, courts do not enquire when the rights of the plaintiff were acquired, but when the defendant\u2019s possession accrued. If the party in possession has held five years, that protects him; for if his possession is tortious, there must be some party entitled to seek redress for it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b116-11\">Daniel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abn\">The counsel for the defendant insists, that though the instructions of the Circuit court may have been erroneous, yet this court ought not therefore to reverse; in as much as the supposed error could not have been prejudicial to the plaintiff. He refers to that provision of the deed by which Harmons is permitted to retain possession of the slave till the 1st day of August 1839 ; and says that the trustee had no right to sell under the deed, and was not bound to institute any action to recover the possession of the slave, until the day last mentioned; and that as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>obtained the possession and made the sale within five years thereafter, the possession of the plaintiff had not, at the date of the sale, matured into a title to the slave, or the proceeds of her sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">I do not think that this, view of the case has been successfully met.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">It is true that the bill of exceptions does not purport to set out all the evidence in the cause; and it is also true, that it is not necessary for a party excepting to instructions to state any facts except such as are necessary to present the precise point ruled against him and excepted to; and that it thence follows that the action of the appellate court is properly restricted, (as a general proposition,) to the consideration of the question of law so raised by the facts, and alleged by the party excepting, to have been erroneously decided against him in the court below. Yet I apprehend it is equally true that the facts thus exhibited must disclose an error material to the issue, and operating to the prejudice of the party excepting; that the party asking the reversal of a judgment on the score of an erroneous instruction on the trial, must at least, show that he had probably sustained injury thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Now, I do not perceive in what regard the plaintiff could have been injured by the instructions. The injury, which he imputes to them, is, that they cut him off from making a case on his five years\u2019 possession. But the facts which he sets out for the purpose of exhibiting the supposed error of the court, show at the same time, that the fate of his case, as resting on that foundation, must have been the same, though the \u00bfinstructions had not been given. For there is no proof that the trustee had any notice of the transaction between Harmons and the plaintiff, or of the removal of the slave from the county of Madison; and Harmons having, by the express terms of the deed, a right to retain the possession till the 1st of August 1839, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>hold it to be clear that the statute of limitations could not begin to run against the trustee till that period. <em>Joyner </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>4 Dev. &amp; Bat. 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The plaintiff consequently could not have been prejudiced by the decision of the point ruled against him: For whether we refer the commencement of the running of the limitation to the period fixed by the instructions, on the 16th of October 1839, one year after the date of the agreement between Harmons and Colvin, or to the 1st of August 1839, the result is the same. The sale by the trustee in the spring of 1844 was, in either aspect, before he had lost his right to maintain an action for the recovery of the possession of the slave. The plaintiff\u2019s own statement of his case thus showing that his possession and claim of title had not, by lapse of time, ripened into a perfect right to the property, as against the trustee, at the time of the sale, his claim, to recover the proceeds of her sale, as founded on his adversary possession, must consequently have failed, though the instructions had not been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">As this view of the c\u00e1se disposes of it, it becomes unnecessary to consider other questions discussed at the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of Daniel, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
