In this out-of-time direct appeal, Haynes claims that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the presentence report and to challenge his base offense level, his criminal history, and the amount of drugs for which he was held responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">Although not addressed by either party, we note that Haynes\u2019s notice of appeal was \u201cboth late and premature\u201d because the district court did not reenter his judgment of conviction. <em>See United States v. West, </em>240 F.3d 456, 457-59 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also In re Bradford, </em>660 F.3d 226, 228 (5th Cir.2011). The time limit for filing a criminal appeal, however, is not jurisdictional and can be waived. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388-89 (5th Cir.2007). As the government does not raise this issue, it is waived, and we will address the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">Haynes has not shown that he is entitled to relief. The government invokes the waiver of his appellate rights in Haynes\u2019s plea agreement and contends that this waiver precludes consideration of his claims concerning counsel\u2019s alleged deficiencies at sentencing. The government is correct. Our review of the record confirms that Haynes\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). This review likewise establishes that the plain language of the plea agreement applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the claims he raises. Id.; <em>see also United States v. White, </em>307 F.3d 336, 343 (5th Cir.2002). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
