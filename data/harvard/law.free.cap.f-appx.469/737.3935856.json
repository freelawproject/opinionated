After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-16\">As an initial matter, Ramsey\u2019s brief makes no argument and cites no authority relevant to the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 59 motion. Accordingly, this issue is deemed abandoned. <em>Carmichael v. Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root Servs., Inc., </em>572 F.3d 1271, 1293 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe law is by now well settled in this Circuit that a legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In any event, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the Rule 59(e) motion because the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Ramsey sought to introduce was available months before the district court granted summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Drago v. Jenne, </em>453 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2006). (\u201c[T]his court reviews the denial of a Rule 59 motion for an abuse of discretion.\u201d). Thus, we discuss only the factual background and law relevant to Gamber\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Akqg\">A. Ramsey\u2019s Injury</p>\n<p id=\"ApGY\">Plaintiff Austin Ramsey was a scholarship football player for Auburn University. In December 2007, Ramsey injured his spine while lifting weights. Dr. Michael Goodlett was responsible for the health of all Auburn athletes. After physical therapy failed to relieve Ramsey\u2019s injury, Dr. Goodlett referred Ramsey to an orthopedic surgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In April 2008, Ramsey underwent spinal surgery. The surgery was successful, and in May 2008 the surgeon cleared Ramsey for a return to regular training.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Defendant Arnold Gamber was Auburn\u2019s head football trainer. In May 2008, Dr. Goodlett met with Defendant Gamber and Kevin Yoxall, Auburn\u2019s strength coach, to develop a six-week rehabilitation schedule for Plaintiff Ramsey. That rehabilitation schedule permitted Ramsey (1) to run and jog only for two to three days, initially, then (2) to run and complete exercises using only Ramsey\u2019s own body weight, and (3) finally, to perform seated upper-body weight-lifting and leg-presses. Yoxall was responsible for designing athletes\u2019 daily weight-room regimens. Defendant Gam-ber was not responsible for supervising Yoxall or the weight-room assistants.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Dr. Goodlett approved Plaintiff Ramsey\u2019s rehabilitation plan. When he was leaving the May 2008 meeting, Dr. Good-lett observed that Defendant Gamber and Yoxall \u201cwere putting together a written plan.\u201d Defendant Gamber testified that Dr. Goodlett verbally approved this plan. Dr. Goodlett later saw a copy of Ramsey\u2019s rehabilitation plan. However, no copy of the plan was introduced into evidence and none was found in Ramsey\u2019s medical chart.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Beginning in late May 2008, Plaintiff Ramsey began his rehabilitation with running and stretching for two days. Ramsey reported no pain from these exercises. On June 2, 2008, Ramsey went to the weight room to begin the second part of his rehabilitation, which permitted Ramsey to exercise using only his own body weight. At the weight room, Paul Creighton, an assistant to Yoxall, instructed Ramsey to perform squats and \u201cbox step ups\u201d while wearing a 50-pound weighted vest and holding two 35-pound dumbbells. In his deposition, Ramsey testified that in the weight room on June 2, he asked Creighton whether he was \u201csupposed to be doing those.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to Ramsey, Creighton replied, \u201cthey\u2019re on the list. I don\u2019t know who made it up.\u201d Ramsey performed two sets of these exercises on June 2. During the second set, he immediately felt the same pain and tingling in his leg that he experienced before his surgery. Ramsey immediately stopped exercising.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">After Plaintiff Ramsey\u2019s June 2, 2008 weight training, Dr. Goodlett examined Ramsey and found that Ramsey had re-injured his back. In January 2009, Ramsey had surgery again. Following this second surgery, Ramsey decided not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>play football, and he was medically disqualified from football due to the risk of further injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">B. Ramsey\u2019s Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In July 2009, Plaintiff Ramsey filed a six-count complaint against Defendant Gamber, who later moved for summary judgment on all claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ramsey opposed Gamber\u2019s summary judgment motion, but only as to Ramsey\u2019s state-law claims that: Gamber negligently caused or allowed Ramsey to be exposed to increased risk of injury by requiring him to lift weights against his physician\u2019s instructions (Count 1); Gamber wantonly caused or allowed Ramsey to be exposed to increased risk of injury by requiring him to lift weights against his physician\u2019s instructions (Count 2); and Gamber \u201cnegligently and/or wantonly interfered with the physician/patient relationship\u201d between Ramsey and his orthopedic surgeon (Count 3). In a February 7, 2011 order, the district court granted summary judgment for Defendant Gamber on all of Ramsey\u2019s claims. Ramsey appealed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">II. DISCUSSION<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">A. Gamber\u2019s Liability on Counts 1 (Negligence) and 2 (Wantonness)</p>\n<p id=\"AFi\">Under Alabama law, liability for negligence requires that (1) the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, (2) the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach proximately caused the plaintiffs injury. <em>Albert v. Hsu, </em>602 So.2d 895, 897 (Ala.1992). A claim of wantonness also requires proof of a breached duty. <em>Ala. Power Co. v. Laney, </em>428 So.2d 21, 22 (1983). Here, Plaintiff Ramsey has introduced no evidence showing that Defendant Gamber breached a duty he owed to Ramsey. The weight-room assistant, not Gam-ber, instructed Ramsey to perform the June 2, 2008 exercises that preceded his re-injury. Though Gamber had some responsibility for implementing Ramsey\u2019s rehabilitation plan, Ramsey has produced no evidence that Gamber included the injury-causing exercises in Ramsey\u2019s exercise regimen for June 2, 2008. Rather, Gamber testified that he had not authorized Ramsey to exercise with weights on the day he was re-injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">We recognize that Ramsey claims that the missing rehabilitation plan entitles him to an adverse inference of Gamber\u2019s negligence and at least creates a material issue of fact for a jury because Gamber must have destroyed the plan in anticipation of litigation. However, Ramsey has produced no evidence that anyone destroyed the written plan, let alone that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Gamber destroyed the plan in bad faith. <em>See Bashir v. Amtrak, </em>119 F.3d 929, 931 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c[A]n adverse inference is drawn from a party\u2019s failure to preserve evidence only when the absence of that evidence is predicated on bad faith. Mere negligence in losing or destroying the records is not enough for an adverse inference, as it does not sustain an inference of consciousness of a weak case.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Indeed, evidence in the record suggests that Gamber could not have destroyed the relevant evidence, much less destroyed it in bad faith. Yoxall, not Gamber, was responsible for writing and recording athletes\u2019 daily weight-room regimens. In addition, Gamber\u2019s employment at Auburn ended in January 2009, months before this litigation commenced, and Gamber testified that he left behind any documents related to his work at Auburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Plaintiff Ramsey stresses his testimony that Creighton, the weight-room assistant, told Ramsey that the weight-lifting exercises were \u201con the list.\u201d Ramsey argues that this statement shows Defendant Gamber negligently authorized the exercises. But as the district court correctly noted, Ramsey\u2019s testimony about what the weight-room assistant told Ramsey is inadmissible hearsay and thus cannot be considered on Gamber\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Reese v. Herbert, </em>527 F.3d 1253, 1271 n. 29 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In any event, Ramsey stated that Creighton also said, \u201cI don\u2019t know who made [the list] up.\u201d Accordingly, Creighton\u2019s testimony, even if credited, does not show that the list was the written rehabilitation plan Gamber and Yoxall developed or that Gamber had any connection whatsoever to the alleged erroneous list.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">B. Gamber\u2019s Vicarious Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Defendant Gamber is also entitled to summary judgment on Ramsey\u2019s theory of Gamber\u2019s vicarious liability for Yoxall and Creighton. Ramsey argues that Gam-ber \u201cfailed to ensure\u201d that Yoxall and Creighton, who were \u201cunder [Gamber\u2019s] control,\u201d did not permit Ramsey to perform weight-lifting exercises proscribed by the rehabilitation plan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the doctrine of respondeat superior,' a principal is vicariously liable for his agent\u2019s negligent acts done in the scope of the agent\u2019s employment so long as the principal controls the means and method by which the agent performs his work. <em>Martin v. Goodies Distribution, </em>695 So.2d 1175, 1177 (Ala.1997); <em>see also Ware v. Timmons, </em>954 So.2d 545, 549-50 (Ala.2006). The party relying on the doctrine of respondeat superior has the burden of proving such a relationship between principal and agent. <em>Ware, </em>954 So.2d at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">Here, the evidence in the record shows that neither Yoxall nor weight-room assistants were Gamber\u2019s agents. Both Gam-ber and Dr. Goodlett testified that Gamber did not supervise Yoxall and that Yoxall independently managed the weight-room. Though Gamber testified that his recommendations for an athlete\u2019s rehabilitation regimen would control over Yoxall\u2019s, Gam-ber also testified that he \u201ccan\u2019t speak to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>how Coach Yoxall runs his weight room.\u201d Further, as noted above, Yoxall drafted athletes\u2019 daily weight-room regimens, and no evidence suggests that Gamber controlled, supervised, or directed Yoxall in this capacity. Nor does the record show that Gamber had the power to select or choose Yoxall or Yoxall\u2019s staff as his agents. <em>See Ware, </em>954 So.2d at 552 (\u201c[F]or the purpose of ... respondeat superior, it is indispensable that the right to select the person claimed to be a servant should exist.\u201d (internal quotation mark omitted)). In sum, Ramsey failed to demonstrate that Gamber exercised the requisite control over the means and methods of Yoxall and his weight-room assistants to sustain liability on a theory of respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">C. Paul Creighton\u2019s Deposition Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In his brief, Ramsey cites the testimony of Paul Creighton, the weight-room assistant to Yoxall present on June 2, 2008, when Ramsey was re-injured. Creighton\u2019s deposition testimony was not part of the record at the time the district court considered Defendant Gamber\u2019s summary judgment motion. Rather, Defendant Gamber took Creighton\u2019s deposition on December 30, 2010, after discovery had concluded and after Gamber\u2019s summary judgment motion was submitted but before the district court had ruled on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">After the district court granted summary judgment for Gamber on February 7, 2011, Ramsey filed a Rule 59(e) motion to alter, amend or vacate the district court\u2019s summary judgment order on grounds that Creighton\u2019s testimony showed that the written rehabilitation plan erroneously permitted Ramsey to perform the exercises that led to his re-injury. The district court denied Ramsey\u2019s motion for three reasons: (1) Ramsey failed to ask the district court to consider Creighton\u2019s testimony after it became available and before the district court had ruled on Gam-ber\u2019s summary judgment motion; (2) Creighton\u2019s testimony contradicted Ramsey\u2019s own account of his re-injury; and (3) Creighton\u2019s testimony did not show that Gamber was liable for Creighton\u2019s re-injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The district court did not consider the Creighton testimony on summary judgment. As noted above, we deem abandoned Ramsey\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 59(e) motion to alter, amend or vacate the summary judgment order. Accordingly, we will not consider the Creighton testimony in our <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s summary judgment order. <em>See Welch v. Celotex Corp., </em>951 F.2d 1235, 1237 n. 3 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cUpon review of a grant by a district court of a motion for summary judgment, a federal appellate court may examine only the evidence which was before the district court when the latter decided the motion for summary judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">Upon review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendant Gamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\">. The district court's jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\">. Ramsey\u2019s appellate brief also does not address the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Defendant Gamber on Ramsey's claim of \"interference with the physician/patient relationship.\u201d This issue is also deemed abandoned. <em>See Carmichael, </em>572 F.3d at 1293.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b765-14\">. In his deposition, Ramsey did not identify the weight-room assistant as Paul Creighton.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b766-10\">. Ramsey's complaint also named as a code-fendant Hugh Nall, Auburn's assistant football coach. However, Ramsey voluntarily dismissed his claims against Nall before summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b766-11\">. In the district court, Ramsey did not oppose Gamber\u2019s summary judgment motion with respect to Ramsey\u2019s claims against Gamber for outrageous conduct (Count 4), civil conspiracy (Count 5), and violation of his civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Count 6). Ramsey does not appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summaiy judgment on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"A4X\">In addition, on appeal Ramsey does not brief the issue of Gamber\u2019s interference with the physician/patient relationship. Accordingly, we do not consider these issues. <em>Carmichael, </em>572 F.3d at 1293 (explaining that issues not briefed on appeal are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b766-16\">.A district court\u2019s grant of summaiy judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir.2006). Summaiy judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>Holloman, </em>443 F.3d at 836.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">. For reasons explained below, this hearsay statement is also not admissible against Gam-ber as a statement by \u201ca party's agent or servant\u201d because the evidence shows that weight-room assistants were not under Gam-ber\u2019s control and direction and thus were not Gamber\u2019s agents or servants. Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b767-12\">. The district court construed this theory of vicarious liability as a claim of respondeat superior. In his brief on appeal, Ramsey confirms that this theory is based on that doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
