The district court sentenced him to 240 months in prison, and Velez-Santos timely filed a notice of appeal. His lawyer later filed a motion to dismiss the appeal with prejudice, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">Velez-Santos then filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his prison sentence, contending that his lawyer was unconstitutionally ineffective because he filed a motion to dismiss the appeal without authorization from Velez-Santos. The district court held an evi-dentiary hearing, at which Velez-Santos and his lawyer testified. The court found that the lawyer \u201ctestified quite clearly that ... he did have [Velez-Santos\u2019] authority to dismiss the appeal prior to filing of the motion with the Eleventh Circuit.\u201d Crediting the lawyer\u2019s testimony, the court found that Velez-Santos was \u201cin agreement to dismiss his appeal,\u201d and it denied the \u00a7 2255 motion. The court, however, granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue: \u201c[W]hether appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by moving to dismiss [Velez-Santos\u2019] direct criminal appeal without the authorization of [Velez-Santos].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">We review as a mixed question of law and fact the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion. So we review only for clear error the court\u2019s factfindings, but we review <em>de novo </em>the court\u2019s application of the law to those facts. <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2011). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>A district court\u2019s factfindings are \u201cclearly erroneous only if the record lacks substantial evidence to support [them].\u201d <em>Johnson v. Hamrick, </em>296 F.3d 1065, 1074 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Substantial evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that Velez-Santos\u2019 lawyer had authorization from Velez-Santos to file the motion to dismiss the appeal. The lawyer testified that he had that authorization, and the court credited the lawyer\u2019s testimony. We give substantial deference to that credibility determination. <em>See Crystal Entm\u2019t &amp; Filmworks, Inc. v. Jurado, </em>643 F.3d 1313, 1322 (11th Cir.2011). Also, Velez-Santos did not respond to a letter from this Court asking him if he had any objections to the motion to dismiss the appeal, even though he testified that he had received that letter. Because Velez-Santos\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion is based on his lawyer not having authorization to file the motion to dismiss the appeal, and because the district court found that the lawyer did have that authorization, the court did not err in dismissing the \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
