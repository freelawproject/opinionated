After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-19\">Cainion was charged with (1) possession with the intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count 1); (2) possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count 2); and (3) possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), (Count 3). During jury selection, Cainion objected to three potential jurors. First, Cainion moved to strike juror Linda Richards for cause after Richards stated that she thought it would be hard for her to sit through a trial if the defendant did not testify. Second, Cainion moved to strike juror Patrick Ricketts for cause after Ricketts stated that he assumed the defendant had done something wrong and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>guilty until proven innocent. After the court denied the motions to strike, Cainion used his peremptory strikes to remove Richards and Ricketts. The third juror, Joe Forker, worked as a laboratory technician and had testified in other cases about drug-screening results. Cainion\u2019s motion to strike Forker was denied, and Cainion had no more peremptory challenges. Forker was placed on the jury as an alternate, but later replaced another juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The evidence at trial established that Cainion was driving at speeds reaching 100 miles-per-hour through Tampa when he struck multiple vehicles, including a police car. Although the officer attempted to move out of Cainion\u2019s way, Cainion tracked the police car and struck it. Police eventually stopped Cainion and, during a search of the ear police found cocaine. They also discovered a firearm and ammunition under a bag on the floor. Cainion waived his rights and admitted to police the drugs were his. The government submitted videos of the chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Cainion testified in his own defense, stating that he had been drinking and did not know the gun and ammunition were in the car. He denied telling police that the cocaine was his, and he denied striking any cars while driving at high speed. He asserted that the video tape was doctored. The jury convicted Cainion of all three charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Before sentencing, Cainion moved for a competency hearing, which the court granted. The psychologist testified that Cainion experienced depression, hallucinations, and paranoia, and, although he appeared to understand the adversarial nature of the legal system, his paranoia probably limited his ability to assist in his defense. At the hearing, Cainion argued that he was not incompetent but that he had a problem with his attorney. The psychologist stated that Cainion believed that the government and his attorney were conspiring against him and that appointing new counsel might alleviate concerns about his ability to assist in his defense. The magistrate judge concluded that Cainion understood the legal system and the charges against him, found Cainion competent, and appointed new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">The probation officer calculated the advisory guidelines range based on 886.7 grams of cocaine, which resulted in a base offense level of 26 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7). The probation officer added a 6-level enhancement under \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) because Cainion\u2019s conduct created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to law enforcement, a 2-level enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.2 because he recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury when he fled and struck a civilian\u2019s car, and a 2-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1. Cainion\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment for Counts 1 and 3, and there was a mandatory consecutive 60-month sentence for Count 2, the \u00a7 924(c) offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Cainion objected to the enhancements under \u00a7 3A1.2 and 3C1.2 as double-counting and he argued that neither enhancement applied to his conduct. The district court overruled the objections, finding that the evidence showed that Cainion knew he struck a marked police car and did so intentionally. The court further found that Cainion\u2019s high speed chase was reckless endangerment during flight, and, because it put both law enforcement and civilians at risk, both enhancements were proper. The court sentenced Cainion to 260 months for possession of the drugs and firearm, and a consecutive 60 months for the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime, for a total of 320 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Cainion now appeals, raising three issues: (1) the district court erred when it denied his motion to strike two jurors for cause; (2) the magistrate judge erred when it found him competent; and (3) the court erroneously calculated his sentencing range. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The United States Constitution protects the right of a criminal defendant to be tried \u201cby an impartial jury....\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. VI. A district court has great discretion to determine whether to excuse a prospective juror for cause. <em>United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1261 (11th Cir.2009). We review the district court\u2019s decision on such a question deferentially, determining whether the record contains \u201cfair support\u201d for the district court\u2019s conclusion that the juror would be impartial. <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d 1036, 1045 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that a defendant in a non-capital felony case is entitled to ten peremptory challenges. Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(b)(2). When a defendant uses a peremptory challenge to remove a juror who should have been excused for cause, his right to exercise peremptory challenges under Rule 24(b) is not denied or impaired. <em>United States v. Martinez-Salazar, </em>528 U.S. 304, 317, 120 S.Ct. 774, 145 L.Ed.2d 792 (2000). Indeed, if a defendant cures a court\u2019s error in this way, he has not been deprived of any rule-based or constitutional right. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 120 S.Ct. 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Here, even if the court erred by denying Cainion\u2019s motion to strike Richards and Ricketts for cause, his use of two peremptory challenges to remove these two jurors cured the error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">Cainion next challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that he was competent to proceed to sentencing. The government argues that Cainion waived his argument because he failed to object below. In response, Cainion argues that, under <em>Nettles v. Wainwright, </em>677 F.2d 404 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he may raise this issue because the magistrate judge did not notify him that his failure to file objections would result in a waiver of his right to further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">A magistrate judge has the authority to \u201chear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court,\u201d with a limited number of exceptions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A). In criminal proceedings, if the magistrate judge issues an order on a non-dispositive matter, a \u201cparty may serve and file objections to the order within 14 days after being served with a copy of a written order\u201d so that the district court can review and modify it if necessary. Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(a). \u201cFailure to object in accordance with this rule <em>waives a party\u2019s right </em>to review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">More recently, we reiterated that the \u201claw is settled that appellate courts are without jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from federal \u2022 magistrates.\u201d <em>United States v. Schultz, </em>565 F.3d 1353, 1359 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). Addressing a challenge to a magistrate judge\u2019s order that was not first appealed to the district court, we held that we were without jurisdiction to review the order. <em>See id. </em>at 1359-62. Because Cainion failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s order, we will not consider his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Cainion challenges the calculation of his sentencing range on two grounds. First, he argues that the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) was not warranted. Second, he contends that the application of both \u00a7 3A1.2 and \u00a7 3C1.2 constitutes impermissible double-counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">We review a district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. Lamons, </em>532 F.3d 1251, 1268 (11th Cir.2008). We also review allegations of impermissible double-counting <em>de novo. United States v. </em>Ramirez, 426 F.3d 1344, 1355 (11th Cir.2005). We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l), a district court should enhance a defendant\u2019s offense level by six levels \u201c[i]f, in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, the defendant ... knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement officer, assaulted such officer during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l). This section applies only to \u201cassaultive conduct against such official victims that is sufficiently serious to create at least a \u2018substantial risk of serious bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3A1.2, comment. (n.4). When we have considered the applicability of \u00a7 3A1.2, we have focused on whether the defendant knew the victim was a law enforcement officer. <em>United States v. Park, </em>988 F.2d 107, 110 (11th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>961 F.2d 180, 182-83 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, a two-level increase is appropriate if the defendant \u201crecklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.2. This section does not apply \u201cwhere the offense guideline in Chapter Two, or another adjustment in Chapter Three, results in an equivalent or greater increase in offense level <em>solely on the basis of the same conduct.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.2, comment, (n.l) (emphasis added). Double-counting occurs when a district court applies one part of the guidelines to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that was already fully accounted for by the application of another part of the guidelines. <em>United States v. White, </em>663 F.3d 1207, 1217 (11th Cir.2011). Cainion does not challenge the application of \u00a7 3C1.2 except insofar as he contends that, coupled with \u00a7 3A1.2, it constitutes impermissible double-counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">We have stated that a defendant\u2019s challenge to the application of both U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3A1.2 and 3C1.2 was meritless when, while speeding away from law enforcement officers, the defendant struck a law enforcement officer with a vehicle, then continued to recklessly operate that vehicle while fleeing. <em>United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir.1999). We reasoned that the defendant\u2019s assault of the law enforcement officer was temporally and spatially distinct from his reckless conduct in leading law enforcement officers on a high-speed chase. <em>Id. </em>at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">Neither of Cainion\u2019s contentions on appeal have merit. First, undisputed portions of the PSI and information at sentencing showed that Cainion (1) drove his vehicle at excessive speeds, hitting a marked law enforcement vehicle while an officer was still inside, and (2) knew or had reason to know that the victim was a law enforcement officer. Thus, the central question is whether this constituted an \u201cassault,\u201d i.e., whether Cainion intentionally struck the law enforcement vehicle. The officer testified that he had attempted to avoid Cainion, who continued to track the car before striking it. Although Cain-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>ion contends that the video shows that he lost control of his vehicle before hitting the marked law enforcement vehicle, the video does not conclusively do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Cainion\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>346 F.3d 813, 815 (8th Cir.2003), is misplaced. In <em>Hampton, </em>the Eighth Circuit concluded that \u00a7 3A1.2 did not apply when the defendant lost control of his vehicle after running over \u201cstop sticks\u201d placed in the road by police. In Cainion\u2019s case, however, Cainion intentionally struck the officer\u2019s vehicle and continued to drive at high speeds until stopped by police. Thus, the record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Cainion acted intentionally, which in turn shows that the court properly applied \u00a7 3A1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Second, the district court did not engage in impermissible double-counting here. In addition to striking the law enforcement officer\u2019s vehicle, Cainion drove recklessly for several miles at high speeds, endangered others, and striking a civilian vehicle. Thus, the district court appropriately applied both enhancements. Although both were imposed as a result of his reckless driving, Cainion\u2019s assault of the police vehicle and his reckless driving generally were temporally and spatially distinct from each other. His conduct \u201cdid not occur in a small area of only \u2018two or three car lengths,\u2019 or in a brief expanse of time.\u201d <em>Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d at 1312. Thus, the \u00a7\u00a7 3A1.2 and 3C1.2 enhancements were not based solely on the same conduct, and there was no improper double-counting. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Because Cainion has failed to demonstrate any error, we affirm his convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\">. Cainion has abandoned any argument that the court erred by denying his motion with respect to juror Forker. <em>United States v. Pilati, </em>627 F.3d 1360, 1364 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-14\">. In <em>Stein v.
