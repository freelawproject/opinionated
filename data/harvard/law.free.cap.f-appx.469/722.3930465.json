The district court ruled that the health services and professional services policy issued by Maryland Casualty to Florida Atlantic excluded coverage for injuries arising out of the provision of professional medical services and Dixon\u2019s injuries arose out of medical services provided by physicians of Florida Atlantic. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-14\">The Mahbears argue that Florida Atlantic breached its duty to its patient, Dixon, to ensure that its ambulatory surgical center was free from dangerous conditions and that their complaint about this breach of duty was covered under the policy issued by Maryland Casualty. The Mah-bears complained in a state lawsuit that Florida Atlantic failed to provide a safe method to transport patients to another facility in the event of an emergency. The Mahbears alleged that Dixon died as a result of complications from an elective surgery when emergency personnel were unable to transport Dixon effectively to an emergency facility because of an elevator at Florida Atlantic that was too small. The Mahbears contend that their complaint of premises liability is different from a claim of wrongful death arising out of medical malpractice and is, therefore, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>excluded from coverage under the policy-issued by Maryland Casualty.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">We agree with the district court that the exclusions in the policy relieved Maryland Casualty of a duty to defend or indemnify Florida Atlantic against the Mahbears\u2019 complaint of premises liability. The policy unambiguously excluded coverage for injuries arising out of the medical services provided by Florida Atlantic. Transporting Dixon safely to an emergency facility because of a botched surgery was an integral part of providing her medical services. We affirm the summary judgment in favor of Maryland Casualty.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
