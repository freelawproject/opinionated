Although the government invokes the provision in Siros\u2019s written plea agreement that waived his right to appeal the sentence, we need not decide whether to enforce the appeal waiver in this case because Siros\u2019s claims are meritless. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u201c[Qjuantities of drugs not specified in the count of conviction may be considered in determining the offense level.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 12. Siros argues that the district court should not have included a separate four-kilogram cocaine transaction in the calculation of his drug quantity because the presentence report (PSR) lacked sufficient indicia of reliability. We review for clear error. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). Here, the PSR\u2019s description of the events came from drug seizures, wiretaps, and the debriefings of a confidential source. The information in the PSR was consistent with the written factual basis for Siros\u2019s guilty plea, his admissions at the rearraignment, and statements by his co-defendant. \u201cBecause no testimony or other evidence was submitted to rebut the information in the PSR, the district court was free to adopt the PSR\u2019s findings without further inquiry or explanation.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 363 (5th Cir.2010). There was no clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u201cIf the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense,\u201d the district court may reduce his offense level. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Siros argues that the district court erred in denying him such a reduction. However, \u201ca defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 1(a). Siros contested the district court\u2019s findings that he was an organizer or leader of criminal activity, that he possessed firearms, and that he was involved in other relevant conduct. Some of his denials were inconsistent with his own admissions to the court. He cannot show that the district court\u2019s finding that he did not clearly demonstrate acceptance of responsibility for his offense was \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Rudzavice, </em>586 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and footnote citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
