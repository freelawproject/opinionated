She also alleged a state law claim of intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>infliction of emotional distress. According to her complaint, she was hired by Singing River on February 22, 2009, as a nursing assistant; was criticized and harassed by coworkers regarding her use of her lunch breaks to pray; informed her floor manager on March 29, 2009, of that criticism and harassment; requested and was denied additional training shortly after making the informal complaint to her manager; and was suspended with a recommendation for discharge on May 1, 2009, on the ground that she was not the \u201cright candidate\u201d for the position and for insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Singing River moved for summary judgment, asserting, among other things, that Stallworth was terminated on May 6, 2009, for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons: her failure to follow nurses\u2019 instructions regarding patient care and insubordination based on her attempt to circumvent her floor manager\u2019s denial of additional training by contacting another individual to obtain the training. The district court granted Singing River\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Stallworth\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Proceeding pro se, Stallworth appeals the district court\u2019s decision and moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP). She qualifies economically to proceed IFP in this appeal, and her motion is granted. However, we dispense with further briefing and, for the reasons below, affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010). \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(a). The moving party must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, but it does not need to negate the elements of the nonmovant\u2019s case. <em>Duffie v. United States, </em>600 F.3d 362, 371 (5th Cir.2010). If the moving party meets this initial burden, then the burden shifts to the nonmovant to set forth specific evidence to support her claims. <em>Id. </em>The non-movant\u2019s burden is not satisfied through a mere showing of \u201csome metaphysical doubt as to the material facts\u201d or by \u201ccon-elusory allegations,\u201d \u201cunsubstantiated assertions,\u201d or \u201conly a scintilla of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). All facts and inferences are construed in the light most favorable to non-moving party. <em>Dillon, </em>596 F.3d at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Because Stallworth has not briefed any argument concerning the district court\u2019s denial of her claims based on a theory of failure to accommodate or hostile work environment, she has waived any challenge to the denial of such claims. <em>See Longoria v. Dretke, </em>507 F.3d 898, 901 (5th Cir.2007). Stallworth also does not contend that her case involved a mixed-motive theory of discrimination or otherwise challenge whether the district court applied the correct framework when it analyzed her claims of disparate treatment and retaliation under the burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under that framework, (1) the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination; (2) if such a showing is made, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment action; and (3) if the defendant satisfies that requirement, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the articulated reason was merely a pretext for discrimination. <em>Jackson v. Watkins, </em>619 F.3d 463, 466 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Rubinstein v. Adm\u2019rs of Tulane Educ. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>Fund, </em>218 F.3d 392, 399, 401-02 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Regarding her claim of disparate treatment, the district court determined that Stallworth failed to make a prima facie showing of discrimination. Stallworth urges us to follow <em>Brady v. Office of the Sergeant at Arms, </em>520 F.3d 490, 493-94 (D.C.Cir.2008), and pretermit the issue whether she has made the requisite prima facie showing given that Singing River has offered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the challenged employment actions. She cites no precedent in this circuit for following <em>Brady, </em>and we decline to do so. <em>See Atterberry v. City of Laurel, </em>401 Fed.Appx. 869, 871 n. 1 (5th Cir.2010). Furthermore, her conclusory assertion that the \u201c[district court erred in not requiring [her] vital witnesses to counterattack Defendant\u2019s arguments\u201d is unavailing as a challenge to the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Her challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that she failed to establish pretext as to both her claims of disparate treatment and retaliation is also unavailing. To establish pretext, Stallworth was required to show that Singing River\u2019s proffered reasons were \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cunworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Vaughn v. Woodforest Bank, </em>665 F.3d 632, 637 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Her subjective belief that her actions did not constitute insubordination is insufficient to create an inference of discriminatory intent by Singing River, and she has failed to rebut Singing River\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for its challenged employment decisions. <em>See Jackson, </em>619 F.3d at 467-68; <em>Roberson v. Alltel Info. Servs., </em>373 F.3d 647, 654 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Rubinstein, </em>218 F.3d at 400-01. Thus, she has not shown error in the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of Singing River regarding her claims under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Our analysis of Stallworth\u2019s claims regarding disparate treatment and retaliation under Title VII applies with equal force to her claims of employment discrimination under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Lauderdale v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, Institutional Div., </em>512 F.3d 157, 166 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Bunch v. Bullard, </em>795 F.2d 384, 387 n. 1 (5th Cir.1986). Thus, based on our foregoing discussion of Stallworth\u2019s Title VII claims, we also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Stallworth\u2019s claims under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 820 (5th Cir.1993) (recognizing that we may affirm on any ground supported by the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Regardingo her state law claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, Stallworth asserts that she satisfied the requisite state law standards because Singing River\u2019s actions were \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d in that they amounted to \u201ca termination based on religious practices and retaliation for complaints regarding those practices.\u201d This bare assertion is conclusory and fails to establish error in the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment as to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">MOTION GRANTED; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
