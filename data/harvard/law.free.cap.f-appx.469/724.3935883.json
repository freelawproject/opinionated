The IJ\u2019s decision denied asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision in this case because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that we review the BIA\u2019s decision; but \u201c[i]nsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well\u201d). We review <em>de novo </em>legal determinations of the BIA. <em>Id. </em>Factual determinations are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test; and we must \u201caffirm the ... decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record- considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). To reverse a fact determination, we must conclude \u201cthat the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-18\">An alien may obtain asylum if he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d that is, a person unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground, including political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status with specific and credible evidence. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-19\">Sokol sought relief based on his political opinion and membership in a particular social group. Sokol joined the Democratic Party in 1992 and became an organizer in 2000, when the country was under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>control of the Socialist Party. In 2002, Sokol was arrested by members of the Albania State Intelligence Service \u2014 also known as the SHISH \u2014 for his leadership role in the Democratic Party. He was held for two days, during which he was beaten and threatened. After his release, he sought medical attention. His medical records indicated that he had been hit in the head with a hard object, but that his overall condition was \u201cgenerally good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">In 2003, SHISH members kidnapped and raped one of Sokol\u2019s sisters and attempted to kidnap his other sister. A couple of weeks later, someone poisoned the family dog, set fire to Sokol\u2019s car, and wrote \u201cwe\u2019re going to hang the democrats\u201d on his family\u2019s home. After these incidents, Sokol and his family went into hiding, obtained false passports, and left for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s assessment that \u2014 even if Sokol\u2019s testimony was credible and he established past persecution on account of his political opinion \u2014 the government had met its burden of rebutting the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution by demonstrating a fundamental change in country conditions. The BIA also agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Sokol was ineligible for humanitarian asylum because the harm he suffered was not severe enough to compel relief. Because Sokol failed to satisfy the lower burden of proof required for asylum, the BIA also denied withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">On appeal, Sokol argues that the BIA erred when it concluded that the government presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that he had a well-founded fear of persecution. An asylum applicant who has established past persecution on a protected ground is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). The government may rebut this presumption by showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, either (1) a fundamental change in the country\u2019s conditions such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution, or (2) that relocation within the country would avoid future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">We conclude that substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s finding that there had been a \u201cfundamental change\u201d in Albania that negated Sokol\u2019s well-founded fear of future persecution. In making that determination, the BIA relied heavily on various State Department reports about Albania.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These reports indicated \u2014 and Sokol conceded \u2014 that the Democratic Party had taken control of the country in 2005. The reports also made these conclusions: (1) Albania had experienced an overall improvement in political freedom since the early 2000s, such that the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>generally could criticize the government without fear of reprisals; (2) the SHISH forces had been reduced and were no longer involved in political activity; and (3) nothing evidenced that the Socialist Party was engaged in a pattern of repression or violent behavior toward members of the Democratic Party. No bright line rule dictates what constitutes a \u201cfundamental change.\u201d <em>See Imelda, </em>611 F.3d at 729. But because both a change in governmental regime and a substantial decline in violence against a persecuted group \u2014 as seen here \u2014 may signify that a country has undergone a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d we are not compelled to reverse the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>at 729-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Although the Department of State reports also contained negative information about the conditions in Albania, we are not permitted \u2014 under the substantial evidence test \u2014 to reweigh the importance attributed to the evidence in the record. <em>See Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1175 (11th Cir.2008). In addition, \u201cthe mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1029 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s decision to deny Sokol humanitarian asylum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even in the absence of a well-founded fear of future persecution, an applicant may be eligible for humanitarian asylum if he demonstrates \u201ccompelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return\u201d to his home country. <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir.2009). Such relief is available only in the \u201cmost extraordinary cases,\u201d in which an applicant shows \u201csevere harm\u201d and \u201clong-lasting effects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1200-01 (listing as examples \u201cthe German Jews, victims of the Chinese \u2018Cultural Revolution,\u2019 and survivors of the Cambodian genocide\u201d). We review denials of humanitarian asylum under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Id. </em>Sokol was mistreated during his 2002 detention. Still, he was held for only two days and his overall condition immediately following his release was \u201cgenerally good.\u201d He also failed to offer evidence that he suffered long-lasting effects as a result of that detention or the 2003 attacks against his family and home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision that Sokol was unentitled to asylum; and we are not compelled to reverse the BIA\u2019s decision. Sokol\u2019s failure to establish eligibility for asylum forecloses his eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-15\">. The IJ also denied relief under the Convention Against Torture. Because Sokol did not challenge meaningfully this denial in his appeal to the BIA, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies; and we lack jurisdiction to consider this issue. See <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-6\">. Sokol argues that the BIA\u2019s reliance on the State Department reports was improper. We disagree. The BIA is permitted to rely on such reports as long as it also conducts an individualized analysis of the relationship between the specific harm suffered and the information contained in the reports. <em>Imelda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 724, 728-29 (11th Cir.2010) (concluding that the BIA erred in relying solely on the State Department's country report for Indonesia because it did not engage in the required individualized analysis of applying country conditions reported by the State Department to the particular circumstances of the petitioner when the State Department report indicated only that conditions for Christians had improved in two regions of the country but failed to address whether conditions had improved in the petitioner's home region or in the country in general). Because State Department reports on Albania country conditions directly rebut the presumption that Sokol has a well-founded fear of future persecution by the SHISH or by the Socialist Party, the BIA did not err in relying on the reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\">. Sokol argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to remand to the IJ for consideration of new evidence. Because the evidence he sought to introduce \u2014 his sister\u2019s asylum application \u2014 was available before his removal hearing, it was within the BIA\u2019s discretion to deny his motion. <em>See Chacku </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\">. The record demonstrates that Sokol had been arrested three other times. In 1989, he was arrested after trying to flee Albania and detained for one year, during which he was beaten daily and starved. He was also arrested twice \u2014 once in 1991 and once in 1998 \u2014 for participating in political demonstrations: detained for eight hours and two days, respectively. Although he alleges that he was mistreated during each of these detentions, he explained in his appeal to the BIA that these detentions were for background information only and were not connected to his claims for relief. Thus, he affirmatively abandoned a claim for relief based on these earlier arrests.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
