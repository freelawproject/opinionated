He contends that he was a minor participant in the criminal activity and that the district court clearly erred in refusing to grant a two-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">The burden is on the defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to a mitigating role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 880 (5th Cir.1998). \u201c[Section] 3B1.2 only applies when a defendant is \u2018substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A))). \u201cIt is not enough that a defendant does less than other participants; in order to qualify as a minor participant, a defendant must have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court\u2019s denial of an adjustment under \u00a7 3B 1.2(b) is a factual determination that is reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 203. \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">The fact that Casta\u00f1eda-Castillo served only as a courier does not itself entitle him to an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2(b) as a minor participant. <em>See United States v. Franklin, </em>561 F.3d 398, 407 (5th Cir.2009). Castaneda-Castillo was aware that his role in the cash smuggling activity was to elude authorities and transport the illicit cash from the United States into Mexico. Given that the operation relied on him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>overcome security at the border checkpoint, it was plausible for the district court to find that his role was not merely peripheral to the advancement of the smuggling activity. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 346 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Franklin, </em>561 F.3d at 407. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in refusing to grant an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
