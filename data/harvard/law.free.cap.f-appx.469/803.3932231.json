Baxter, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 471 (11th Cir.2005), this court affirmed Victor Garry Baxter\u2019s convictions for distribution of crack cocaine and for possession with intent to distribute cocaine powder, and his total sentence of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment as a career offender, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. In October 2011, Baxter moved the district court to reduce his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The court denied his motion on the ground that the amendment did not affect his sentence as a career offender. He now appeals the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Part A of Amendment 750 amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 by revising the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), and reducing offense levels associated with various amounts of crack cocaine. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750, Pt. A, <em>cross referencing </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 748 (2011). Amendment 750 became effective on November 1, 2011. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment that has been imposed unless the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered, the district court considers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). It may reduce a defendant\u2019s previously imposed imprisonment sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the relevant amendment is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) and the reduction is consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>policy statement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). Parts A and C of Amendment 750 to the Guidelines may serve as the basis for sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c). A reduction, however, is not consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement if it does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable Guideline range. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">When determining whether a reduction is warranted, a court should determine the Guidelines range that would have been applicable had the relevant amendment been in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s sentencing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). In doing so, a court must only substitute the relevant amendment into the district court\u2019s original Guideline calculations, and leave all other Guideline-application decisions unaffected. <em>Id.; United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Where a retroactively applicable Guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based, the district court is not authorized to grant a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. This includes the situation in which a retroactive amendment of \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) would result in a lower base offense level, but where the defendant was sentenced as a career offender. <em>Id. </em>at 1326-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The district court did not have authority to reduce Baxter\u2019s sentence based upon Amendment 750 because he was sentenced as a career offender, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. The court\u2019s ruling is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
