In his petition, Lawrence argued that his pension and social security benefits for those years did not constitute taxable income because they were paid directly to the IRS pursuant to an IRS levy imposed in 1999 to recover his outstanding income taxes. Lawrence also alleged that, because his pension and social security benefits were exempted from creditors during his later bankruptcy proceedings, the IRS levy was invalid and violated his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-18\">After a bench trial, the tax court rejected Lawrence\u2019s claimed errors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The tax court noted that Lawrence bore the burden of proof, pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 7491(a), because the issues before the court were not factual in nature and because Lawrence failed to establish that he cooperated with the IRS during his audit. The court also determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the validity of the IRS levy on Lawrence\u2019s pension and social security benefits. The tax court then concluded that Lawrence\u2019s disputed pension. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>and social security benefits constituted taxable income and upheld the Commissioner\u2019s deficiency determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">As an initial matter, the tax court\u2019s decision not to shift the burden of proof to the Commissioner was proper. Pursuant to section 7491(a), if \u201ca taxpayer introduces credible evidence with respect to any. factual issue relevant to ascertaining the liability of the taxpayer for any tax imposed ..., the [government] shall have the burden of proof with respect to such issue.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7491(a). Lawrence argues that the IRS account transcripts\u2014 which indicated that Lawrence had no adjusted gross income for the 2003, 2004, and 2005 tax years \u2014 constituted credible evidence sufficient to shift the burden of proof to the IRS. As the tax court noted, however, the Commissioner was prohibited legally from assessing a deficiency against Lawrence until after the tax court issued a final decision. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6213(a). Thus, that the disputed deficiencies were omitted from the account transcripts is not pertinent to the issue of Lawrence\u2019s tax liability. Because Lawrence failed to introduce credible evidence about his tax liability, he retained the burden of proof under section 7491(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">On appeal, Lawrence reasserts that, based on the IRS levy, his 2003, 2004, and 2005 pension and social security benefits did not constitute taxable income because he lacked \u201ccomplete dominion\u201d over those payments. We disagree. Pension and social security benefits are generally considered \u201cgross income\u201d for purposes of federal income tax. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 61(a)(ll) (defining \u201cgross income\u201d to include \u201call income from whatever source derived, including ... pensions\u201d); I.R.C. \u00a7 86(a) (describing the portion of social security benefits that may be considered \u201cgross income\u201d). It is also well-established that when an employer makes direct payments to the IRS on behalf of an employee \u2014 either voluntarily or involuntarily \u2014 such payments constitute taxable income to the employee. <em>See Old Colony Trust Co. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>279 U.S. 716, 49 S.Ct. 499, 504, 73 L.Ed. 918 (1929) (concluding that the employer\u2019s direct payment to the IRS of the income tax due on an employee\u2019s salary constituted taxable income and that it was \u201cimmaterial that the taxes were directly paid over to the [g]overnment\u201d); <em>Doose v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>99 T.C.M. (CCH) 1088 (T.C.2010) (concluding that the portion of a taxpayer\u2019s wages paid directly to the IRS as a result of a tax levy constituted taxable income to the taxpayer).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Lawrence was entitled to retirement benefits under his former employer\u2019s pension plan and under social security during the 2003, 2004, and 2005 tax years. That those payments were made directly to the IRS as a result of Lawrence\u2019s IRS levy is \u201cimmaterial\u201d to the issue of whether they constituted taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-14\">. We review the tax court's legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Creel v. Comm</em>'r <em>of Internal Revenue, </em>419 F.3d 1135, 1139 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-15\">. The tax court denied properly Lawrence's pre-trial motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for default. Because Lawrence filed a petition for a redetermination of his tax deficiencies in tax court and nothing evidenced that the Commissioner had changed his position about Lawrence\u2019s tax liability, the tax court had jurisdiction to redetermine the amount of the alleged deficiencies. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6214(a). Moreover, nothing evidences that the Commissioner agreed to attend a settlement conference on Lawrence\u2019s suggested date or that the Commissioner otherwise failed to engage in settlement discussions required by Tax Court R. 70(a)(1). Thus, the tax court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lawrence's motion for default.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
