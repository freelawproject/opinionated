Before addressing the merits of Nash\u2019s claims, we must first determine the scope of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">We conclude that Nash abandoned his First Amendment, hostile work environment, and gender discrimination arguments because he fails to argue that the district court erred in denying his claims. <em>See N. Am. Med. Corp. v. Axiom Worldwide, Inc., 522 </em>F.3d 1211, 1217 n. 4 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that \u201cissues not raised on appeal are abandoned\u201d); <em>Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (stating that passing references to issues in an appellate brief are insufficient to raise a claim on appeal). To the extent that Nash attempts to raise a First Amendment freedom of association claim, he did not present such a claim below; and we will not review it. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that we will not consider arguments on appeal that were not fairly presented below). Nash also expressly abandons his argument that the defendants \u201cexcessed\u201d'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> him in retaliation for his filing an EEOC complaint. And\u2014 because Nash failed to raise properly the argument in district court \u2014 we cannot review his argument that defendants retaliated against him by giving him a negative evaluation. <em>See Access Now, Inc., </em>385 F.3d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">Thus, the only issue truly appealed is Nash\u2019s disparate treatment claim based on race. Nash alleged that the defendants discriminated against him because of his race when they \u201cexcessed\u201d him from his position as a high school physical education <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>(\u201cP.E.\u201d) teacher, which he alleges was equivalent to firing him. The district court concluded that Nash failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment because he failed to establish that he suffered an adverse employment action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">An adverse employment action is one that involves \u201ca <em>serious and material </em>change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u201d <em>Davis v. Town of Lake Park, </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis in original). \u201c[T]he employee\u2019s subjective view of the significance and adversity of the employer\u2019s action is not controlling; the employment action must be materially adverse as viewed by a reasonable person in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A transfer can be an adverse employment action \u201cif it involves a reduction in pay, prestige or responsibility.\u201d <em>Hinson v. Clinch Cnty. Bd. of Educ., </em>231 F.3d 821, 829 (11th Cir.2000). In the vast majority of cases, however, a temporary change in work assignment that creates no tangible harm and does not alter the employee\u2019s permanent job title, is not legally adverse. <em>Davis, </em>245 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">As an initial matter, nothing evidences that Nash was terminated or that being \u201cexcessed\u201d was tantamount to being fired. That Nash was employed by the Board\u2014 not a particular school \u2014 and that his employment with the Board ended only when Nash resigned is undisputed. It is also undisputed that the term \u201cexcessed\u201d refers to a process whereby teachers \u2014 identified based on subject area and seniority \u2014 may be transferred to another school based on fluctuations in student population. Nash concedes that he was the least senior P.E. teacher at the pertinent high school and that, after he was \u201cexcessed,\u201d he was reassigned to teach middle school science.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Nash contends that his transfer constituted an adverse employment action because it meant that he would no longer be \u201cdoing what [he] loved,\u201d which was teach P.E. and coach athletics. This argument is contradicted by the record, which establishes that even after his transfer, Nash would retain his position coaching high school basketball. Moreover, Nash\u2019s subjective viewpoint is not controlling. <em>See Davis, </em>245 F.3d at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Nash, he failed to show that a reasonable person would consider his transfer materially adverse. Nash concedes that he would retain the same salary, benefits, job responsibilities, and work days after the transfer. He was also certified to teach middle school science. In fact, Nash first started his employment with the Board as a middle school science teacher and, thus, was merely being reassigned to his original school and subject area. Because Nash failed to demonstrate that his transfer resulted in any tangible harm, he failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of employment discrimination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-10\">. Although Nash named the Palm Beach County School District as a defendant in his initial complaint, he later amended his complaint to name the Board as the proper defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-11\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir.2007).
