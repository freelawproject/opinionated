In the factual statement provided in support of his plea, Crudgington admitted that he was advertising firearms for sale in local papers; that the government had seized 147 firearms from his residence, nearly all of which were located in gun racks with price tags attached to them; that he was obtaining firearms from licensed dealers in other states and having them shipped to a local dealer, who then transferred them to him; that there were twenty-two firearms which he .was still supposed to pick up from one local dealer; that he had sold seven firearms to undercover government agents, including to agents he believed to be convicted felons; and that these transactions had occurred at his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">On appeal, Crudgington claims that the district court contravened Application Note 5 to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines when the court calculated his offense level by counting the 100-plus firearms seized from his residence. This Note states that when \u201ccalculating the number of firearms under [\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l) ], count only those firearms that were unlawfully sought to be obtained, unlawfully possessed, or unlawfully distributed, including any firearm that a defendant obtained or. attempted to obtain by making a false statement to a licensed dealer.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 5 Crudgington argues that because he did not \u201cunlawfully\u201d possess the 100-plus firearms and because it was never alleged that he either unlawfully sought to obtain them or unlawfully distributed those particular firearms, the district court could not properly count them for sentencing purposes. Crudgington further notes that had the 100-plus firearms not been counted, his offense level would have dropped six levels.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">We accept the district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing unless clearly erroneous, and we review the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1230 (11th Cir.2010). We also review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Fulford, </em>662 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2011). To properly interpret the Guidelines, the language of the Guidelines must be given its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>In addition, the Guidelines commentary \u201cis authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute; or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">As an initial matter, we dismiss the government\u2019s suggestion that Crudgington failed to preserve the argument he advances on appeal. We hold that the objection was preserved as a part of Crudging-ton\u2019s claim that the additional firearms should not have been counted based on the plain language of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">However, Crudgington\u2019s argument fails on the merits. We do not dispute Crudg-ington\u2019s contention that the plain language of Application Note 5 exhaustively specifies the firearms that may be counted for purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l). But his argument for relief hinges further on the premise that, while he may have been actively trying to resell the 100-plus firearms as an unlawful firearms dealer, he did not \u201cunlawfully\u201d possess them. We cannot accept this premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Crudgington pleaded guilty to \u201cknowingly engaging] in business as a dealer in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>firearms without being licensed to do so,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(1)(A). In effect, Crudgington admitted he was not simply selling an occasional firearm \u201cfor the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby,\u201d but rather that he was unlawfully \u201cdealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(21)(C) (defining what it means for a firearms dealer to be \u201cengaged in the business\u201d). Here, Crudgington makes no claim that the 100-plus firearms were separate from the illegal firearms business he was operating. Indeed, nearly all of the firearms in question were directly linked to this illegal business, as evidenced by the fact that they had price tags and some had already been advertised for sale in local papers. Thus, unlike the federally-licensed firearms dealer in <em>United States v. Brickner, </em>No. 96-8783, 1997 WL 159331 (6th Cir. April 3, 1997), Crudgington cannot plausibly assert that the firearms yet to be sold illegally were being used in a purely lawful manner. Rather, as <em>the </em>essential component of his illicit firearms business, it is clear that the firearms in question were being used by Crudgington unlawfully under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1)(A). For this reason, we hold that the district court acted consistently with the commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l) when it counted the firearms seized from Crudgington\u2019s residence in calculating his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-5\">.
