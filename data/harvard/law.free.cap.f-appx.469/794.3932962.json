We affirm both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-17\">Defendants Compass Group USA and its wholly owned subsidiary Levy Premium Foodservice (together, Levy) have an exclusive contract to provide concessions and food service in luxury suites at Philips Arena, the Georgia Dome, and Atlanta Motor Speedway. The plaintiffs are current and former Levy employees who worked as suite attendants, providing food services to patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-18\">Levy imposed a 20% service charge on all food and beverages the suite patrons purchased. In its suite menus, Levy notified patrons that \u201ca 20% service charge ... will be added to all orders.\u201d Levy also disseminated to patrons a document entitled \u201cService Charge/Tipping Policy,\u201d which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-19\">As a convenience to our guests, we have included this policy to clarify any confusion regarding the service charge and tipping policy in The Suites at Philips Arena:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-20\">The service charge, which is on your bill, is shared in the form of higher wages for all Suite employees. It helps our company attract a high quality employee from the set up crew to the clean up crew and everyone in between. All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>these employees are critical to making your experience memorable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-4\">If you feel that you [sic] Suite Attendant has provided a service that is of the highest quality then please feel free to extend a personal gratuity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Tip solicitation is a violation of our policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The plaintiffs were aware of this policy. According to the complaint, Levy retained the service charge and paid \u201cnone or virtually none\u201d of it to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The plaintiffs sued Levy, alleging \u201cwrongful failure to pay Plaintiffs ... the 20% service charge.\u201d In an amended complaint, they alleged four causes of action: breach of unilateral contract, breach of contract as a third-party beneficiary, unjust enrichment/quantum meruit, and conversion. Levy moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and the district court granted the motion. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration on their third-party beneficiary breach-of-contract claim. In the motion, the plaintiffs requested leave to file a second amended complaint for breach of contract only, which they attached. The district court denied the motion for reconsideration and the request to amend, finding that amendment would prove futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The plaintiffs now appeal both of the district court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 705 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cWe therefore accept as true the facts as set forth in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Corwin v. Walt Disney Co., </em>475 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2007). And we review the district court\u2019s conclusion that leave to amend would be futile <em>de novo. Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1012 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">A. Breach of Unilateral Contract<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-15\">In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that they and Levy entered into a unilateral contract, the Service Charge/Tipping Policy, and that Levy breached this contract by retaining the service charge. The district court found that the Policy, to the extent it constituted an agreement, was between Levy and its patrons only.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-16\">We agree. The plaintiffs have not, and cannot, provide any factual allegations to support their assertion that the Policy, which was between Levy and its patrons, somehow became a contract between themselves and Levy. The Policy\u2019s plain language shows that it was directed towards Levy\u2019s patrons alone. <em>See Casper v. Harrison Hatchery, Inc., </em>172 Ga.App. 35, 321 S.E.2d 785, 786 (1984) (\u201cThe first requirement of the law relative to contracts is that there must be a meeting of the minds of the parties, and mutuality....\u201d); <em>Myers v. Texaco Refining &amp; Mktg., Inc., </em>205 Ga.App. 292, 422 S.E.2d 216, 219 (1992) (\u201cGeorgia law does not permit us to ignore plain language in a contract....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-17\">The plaintiffs have no legal support for their proposition that their awareness of an agreement to which they are not parties allows recovery on any breach of that agreement. And the cases the plaintiffs cite in support of their argument all con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>cern employees\u2019 awareness of an employer-employee contract or policy. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the breach-of-unilateral-contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">B.Breach of Contract as a Third-Party Beneficiary</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 third-party beneficiary contract claim also fails. The mere fact that a third party would benefit from performance of an agreement is insufficient to permit that party to enforce the agreement. <em>Haldi v. Piedmont Nephrology Assocs., </em>283 Ga.App. 321, 641 S.E.2d 298, 300 (2007). A third party only has standing to maintain a breach-of-contract action if it \u201cclearly appear[s] from the contract that it was intended for [the third party\u2019s] benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The Policy here, even assuming it is enforceable between Levy and its patrons, does not evidence Levy\u2019s and the patrons\u2019 intent to benefit the plaintiffs. Instead, the Policy\u2019s stated intent is to benefit patrons. The Policy permits Levy to \u201cattract a high quality employee,\u201d which is \u201ccritical to making [the patrons\u2019] experience memorable.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 focus on the Policy\u2019s statement that the service charge \u201cis shared in the form of higher wages for all Suite employees\u201d is unavailing: the express purpose of higher wages is ultimately to benefit patrons, not employees. Thus, the plaintiffs lack standing as third-party beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Because the plaintiffs lack standing, the district court properly dismissed the claim and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent motion for reconsideration. And the district court properly denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for leave to amend their breach-of-contract claim because an amended complaint could not change the Policy\u2019s clear intent to benefit patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">C. Unjust Enrichment/Quantum Meruit</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 alternative argument that Levy was unjustly enriched also fails as a matter of law. Recovery under a theory of unjust enrichment or quantum meruit requires a showing that: (1) the plaintiffs performed valuable services for Levy; (2) Levy either requested or knowingly accepted the services; (3) Levy\u2019s receipt of the services without compensating the plaintiffs would be unjust; and (4) the plaintiffs expected compensation at the time they rendered the services. <em>Artrac Corp. v. Austin Kelley Adver., Inc., </em>197 Ga.App. 772, 399 S.E.2d 529, 533-34 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">The plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Levy\u2019s retention of the service charge is unjust\u2014a legal conclusion, rather than an allegation of fact\u2014is insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (emphasizing that a complaint that provides only \u201cnaked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement\u201d is insufficient as a matter of law (internal quotation marks omitted). And the plaintiffs failed to set forth any facts showing that they were not justly compensated by the wages Levy supplied. <em>See id. </em>(requiring a plaintiff to plead facts that state a plausible claim for relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">D. Conversion</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">Because the plaintiffs have failed, for the reasons above, to allege sufficient facts to show they have a right to the service charge, they cannot state a claim for conversion. <em>See City of College Park v. Sheraton Savannah Corp., </em>235 Ga.App. 561, 509 S.E.2d 371, 374 (1998) (\u201cIn an action for conversion, proof of title to the property in the plaintiff, right of possession in the plaintiff, possession in the defendant, demand for possession, refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>surrender, and value of the property, make a prima facie case.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the orders of the district court dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, denying their motion for reconsideration, and denying their request for leave to amend are</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-12\">. The complaint does not specifically allege that this policy was adapted to the other locations in which Levy operated, including the Georgia Dome and the Atlanta Motor Speedway.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-11\">. The parties agree that Georgia substantive law governs this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
