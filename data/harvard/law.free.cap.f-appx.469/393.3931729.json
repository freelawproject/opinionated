He argues that his consecutive sentences are procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">First, Fajardo contends that his sentences are procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to articulate any reasons in open court for its sentencing decision. Fajardo\u2019s general objection to the procedural reasonableness of his sentences was insufficient to preserve this claim of error. <em>See United, States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 506 (5th Cir.2009). Fa-jardo \u201ccould have asked the district court for further explanation during the sentencing hearing, but did not.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, as to this claim of error, plain error review applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">To prevail under plain error review, Fa-jardo must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). When these elements are shown, this court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Reviewing the adequacy of the district court\u2019s reasons in the context of the full sentencing hearing, we find no reversible plain error. <em>See United States v. Gore, </em>298 F.3d 322, 324-26 (5th Cir.2002). Prior to imposing Fajardo\u2019s sentences, the court adopted the presentence report, which included a summary of Fajardo\u2019s instant offense and his criminal history. <em>See id. </em>at 325-26 &amp; n. 3. The court then engaged both the Federal Public Defender and the Government in a colloquy that implicitly indicated the reasons for its sentencing decision, including its concerns about the nature and circumstances of Fa-jardo\u2019s instant offense, the dangers of identity theft, and the underrepresentation of Fajardo\u2019s criminal history. <em>See id. </em>at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Additionally, the court\u2019s statement of reasons clarified both the nature of Fajar-do\u2019s sentences, as imposed outside of the Sentencing Guidelines system, and the grounds for the court\u2019s sentencing decision, thus permitting effective appellate review. <em>See United States v. Allison, </em>447 F.3d 402, 407 n. 12 (5th Cir.2006). There is nothing in the record to suggest that Fajardo\u2019s sentence would have been any different if the court had provided additional reasons for its choice of sentence. <em>Cf. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 364-65 (reviewing within-guidelines sentence). Moreover, the court\u2019s explanation in its written statement of reasons \u201cwould render remand a meaningless formality.\u201d <em>See Gore, </em>298 F.3d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Fajardo next argues that the district court committed procedural error by relying on unsupported assumptions that he used the identity of a United States citizen to open a line of credit and obtain employment. The district court included these findings in its written statement of reasons, which was issued four days after the sentencing hearing. Because Fajardo had no opportunity to object to these findings, the plain error standard does not apply to our review of this claim of error. <em>See United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The presentence report reflects that Fa-jardo used a citizen\u2019s identity to obtain a credit card and secure a Texas driver\u2019s license to drive his employer\u2019s truck. Fajardo offered no evidence to rebut these findings. <em>See United States v. Nava, </em>624 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2945, 180 L.Ed.2d 235 (2011). In light of this evidence, Fajardo has not shown that the district court\u2019s factual finding that he used a citizen\u2019s identity to open a line of credit is clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Fajardo has likewise failed to show the district court committed procedural error by selecting a sentence based, in part, on a finding that he used a citizen\u2019s identity to obtain employment. A \u201csentencing court is permitted to make common-sense inferences from the circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 292 (5th Cir.2006). Fajardo sought a job or position with his employer that he could not otherwise obtain without using a citizen\u2019s identity. Accordingly, he has not shown, in light of the record as a whole, that the district court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. <em>See Nava, </em>624 F.3d at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Finally, Fajardo argues that his sentences are substantively unreasonable because they are greater than necessary to effectuate the purposes of sentencing and because the court made a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) by giving additional weight to factors already included in his offense level calculations. Fajardo\u2019s objection to the court\u2019s sentences as \u201cgreater than necessary to comply with [\u00a7 ] 3553(a)\u201d was sufficient to preserve a claim of error as to the substantive reasonableness of his sentences. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 360-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>When imposing a non-guidelines sentence, district courts may give additional weight \u201cto factors included in calculating the applicable advisory Guidelines range, since to do otherwise would essentially render the Guidelines mandatory.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809 (5th Cir.2008). In addition, district courts are \u201cfree to conclude that the applicable Guidelines range gives too much or too little weight to one or more factors,\u201d and may adjust the sentence accordingly under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court thus did not abuse its discretion in giving more weight to factors already included in the calculation of Fajardo\u2019s advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In support of its sentencing decision, the district court provided detailed reasons based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Moreover, the court was \u201cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>See Gall v. U.S., </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Given the deference owed to a district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and reasons for its sentencing decision, Fajardo has not shown that his sentences were greater than necessary to effectuate the purposes of sentencing or represented an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 51-53, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708-10 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
