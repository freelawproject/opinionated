He argues that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he violated the conditions of his supervised release. After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-25\">In 1992, Furino was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and sentenced to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years of supervised release. While serving his sentence, Furino was charged with and pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute marijuana and possession of marijuana while an inmate. He was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment to run consecutively to the prior sentence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>three years of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furino completed his prison terms in 2009 and his period of supervised release commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">On July 27, 2010, Furino tested positive for cocaine use. He later signed an admission-of-drug-use form, admitting that he smoked incense through a crack pipe. In December 2010, Furino was arrested for violating the terms of his supervised release. The probation officer identified seven violations, including the use of cocaine (violation 1) and possession with intent to sell prescription pills (violation 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Furino admitted all but violations 1 and 2. At the revocation hearing, the district court heard evidence that Furino had tested positive for cocaine. Probation Officer Peggy Bates testified that Furino had tested positive for marijuana on two previous occasions but that the probation office treated these violations with drug counseling. Bates explained that after the positive drug test on July 27, Furino told her that he had smoked an herbal blend called \u201cMr. Nice Guy\u201d using someone else\u2019s pipe. He described the pipe as a glass pipe with a bowl in it. Furino denied using cocaine and stated that \u201cunbeknown to me the person used crack a few days earlier and the residue caused me to show positive for cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Martin Bigenho, the probation officer assistant who conducted Furino\u2019s drug screening, testified that Furino tested positive for cocaine. He admitted that it was possible for a person to test positive by smoking incense through someone else\u2019s crack pipe. He explained that the screening test could not distinguish between someone who smoked a little cocaine the night before and someone who had smoked a lot of cocaine a week earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">The government then presented evidence of violation 2, specifically that police conducting a traffic stop found numerous pill bottles in the car. The bottles were in Furino\u2019s and other peoples\u2019 names. Police also found a notebook with names and amounts listed, along with the words \u201cmeth\u201d and \u201cblue,\u201d which an officer testified was a nickname for oxycodone.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Furino did not testify at the revocation hearing. Counsel argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish the violations of supervised release. The district court found that Furino violated the terms of his release, as evidenced by the positive drug test. The court then stated that the more serious violation was violation 2, the sale of prescription pills, and the evidence was sufficient to establish that violation as well. The court then sentenced Furino to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment. This is Furi-no\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">We review the district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). Even if the district court commits an error, the sentence should be affirmed if the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cA non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292 (quotations and alteration omitted). We may affirm on any adequate ground, regardless of whether it is one on which the district court relied. <em>United States v. Samaniego, </em>345 F.3d 1280, 1283 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">A district court may revoke a term of supervised if it \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>a condition of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). A district court\u2019s findings made at a revocation proceeding are binding unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993). \u201cThe credibility of a witness is in the province of the factfinder and we will not ordinarily review its determination of credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>415 F.3d 1257, 1267 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Furino violated the terms of his release. The urinalysis test unequivocally demonstrated that Furino ingested cocaine, thus establishing violation 1. The court rejected Furino\u2019s assertion that he did not know about the cocaine, finding that it was unlikely that he ingested cocaine by<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> smoking incense through a pipe that, unbeknownst to him, had cocaine residue inside. We generally will not review the district court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See Brown, </em>415 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Even if the district court erred with regard to violation 1, the court properly revoked Furino\u2019s supervised release based on his other violations. The court noted that violation 2 was the more serious offense, and the court based the 36-month sentence on its finding that Furino had possessed with intent to sell prescription pills and on his long history of drug convictions. Although Furino challenged the allegations of violation 2 during the revocation proceedings, he does not do so now. Thus, he has abandoned this issue. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003). Nevertheless, the court\u2019s comments regarding violation 2 indicated that this violation was the basis for the court\u2019s belief that 36 months was an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release and the sentence imposed upon revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\">. The judgment and conviction did not specify whether the supervised release term was to run concurrently with, or consecutive to, the five-year term Furino already faced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
