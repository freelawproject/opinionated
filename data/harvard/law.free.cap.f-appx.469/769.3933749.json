On appeal, Young argues that: (1) his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to take into account his long-term mental-health issues; and (2) the district court impermis-sibly double counted sentencing enhancements for the use of a short-barreled shotgun in two of the counts of conviction. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). We generally review double-counting arguments <em>de novo. United States v. Suarez, </em>601 F.3d 1202, 1220 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 393, 178 L.Ed.2d 157 (2010). However, we are limited to review for plain error when, as here, an appellant did not clearly state the grounds for an objection in district court. <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006). A plain error is: (1) an error; (2) that is plain; and (3) affects substantial rights; but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Unless the explicit language of a statute or rule specifically resolves an issue, \u201cthere can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">For starters, we reject Young\u2019s claim that his sentence is unreasonable. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1189. First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district eourt committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c\u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc) </em>(quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). The party challenging the sentence carries the burden of establishing unreasonableness. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Here, Young has failed to demonstrate the district court made a clear error of judgment in imposing its sentence. As the record shows, the extent of the downward variance appropriately took into account Young\u2019s mental-health issues, and the fact that his criminal record contained several juvenile adjudications. The court was not required to give any additional weight to these factors at the expense of others. In light of his criminal history, the sentence promotes deterrence, while adequately taking into account the particulars of his personal history. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Therefore, Young\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">Nor are we persuaded that the district court plainly erred in double-counting his sentencing enhancement. A two-part test determines when the double counting of an offense characteristic is permissible. The Sentencing Commission must have intended the characteristic be counted twice, and the two provisions must deal with conceptually separate sentencing notions. <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1333 (11th Cir.2003). We presume the Commission intended the characteristic be counted twice unless otherwise specified. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">Here, the separate provisions concerning the use of a short barreled shotgun meet the test outlined in <em>Rendon. </em>There is no apparent evidence that the sentencing commission did not intend to have the nature of the weapon taken into account twice, nor does Young suggest any. Further, the enhancements punish two distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>acts. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 punishes the possession of the particular type of weapon. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)(B)(i) punishes its use to further a drug trafficking offense or crime of violence. Therefore, the district court\u2019s separate application of the two provisions did not amount to error, much less \u2022 plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-9\">. Young does not argue that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable, and therefore, has waived that issue on appeal. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that issues not raised in an initial brief on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
