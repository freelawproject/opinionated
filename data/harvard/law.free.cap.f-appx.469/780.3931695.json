' \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we hold that the district court properly denied Garringer\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">On July 12, 2010, Garringer was stopped by law enforcement shortly after exiting the interstate in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. After he was stopped, law enforcement conducted a search of Garringer\u2019s car. They discovered 750 grams of cocaine and an unloaded nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol in the car\u2019s locked glove box, as well as an ammunition magazine for the pistol in the car\u2019s center console. On appeal, Garringer argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to prove his knowledge of the firearm\u2019s presence in his car, and was also insufficient to prove the reason the firearm was present in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, upholding the denial \u201cif a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the evidence establishes the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>412 F.3d 1240, 1244 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences and credibility determinations in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Lanzon, </em>639 F.3d 1293, 1298 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-17\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), \u201cany person who, during and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm\u201d is sentenced to an additional five year term of imprisonment. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>sustain a conviction under this statute, the government must present sufficient proof that (1) the defendant \u201cused or carried\u201d a firearm (2) \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d a drug trafficking crime. <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1250-52 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Since the parties agree that Garringer did not use the firearm during this offense, we consider whether he carried a firearm within the meaning of the statute. Typically, under the \u201ccarry\u201d prong, a defendant need only be aware that a firearm is present with him in the vehicle, during the course of a drug trafficking crime, is. <em>See Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 139, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 1919, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998); <em>see also United States v. Quinn, </em>123 F.3d 1415, 1427-28 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that the defendant, in driving to a drug deal with a gun beside him for protection, satisfied the \u201ccarry\u201d prong, despite having left the gun in his car fifty to sixty feet away during the actual transaction); <em>United States v. Range, </em>94 F.3d 614, 616-17 (11th Cir.1996) (concluding that defendant \u201ccarried\u201d a gun when he knowingly had the gun under the floormat of the car he was driving).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In this case, the evidence shows that Garringer was aware of the cocaine in his glove box; and the pistol rested on top of that cocaine. Further, the pistol in the glovebox and the ammunition magazine in the center console were within Garringer\u2019s reach as he sat in the vehicle, even if accessing the gun would have required stopping the car. A reasonable factfinder could infer from this evidence that Gar-ringer knew the pistol was in his car as he ferried the drugs from Texas to Florida, and could thus conclude that he carried the firearm under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Next, we consider the statute\u2019s second requirement, asking whether Garringer carried the firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d a drug trafficking crime. <em>Timmons, </em>283 F.3d at 1251-52. Garringer does not dispute that he possessed the firearm \u201cduring\u201d the alleged drug trafficking offense, but argues that there was no evidence showing his possession occurred \u201cin relation to\u201d the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">To prove the \u201cin relation to\u201d requirement, the government must demonstrate that the firearm had \u201csome purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime; its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 238, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2059, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993). \u201cThe gun at least must facilitate, or have the potential of facilitating, the drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 113 S.Ct. at 2059 (citations and internal punctuation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">In this case, Garringer admitted he had purchased the cocaine in Texas and planned to sell it in Florida. The pistol was found resting on top of that cocaine in Garringer\u2019s glove box. These facts, viewed in a light most favorable to the government, are sufficient to allow a reasonable factfinder to infer that the gun was not entirely unrelated to the drug crime, or in the glove box with the drugs coincidentally. <em>See id. </em>at 238, 113 S.Ct. at 2059 (observing that \u201cin the ordinary\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(1) case the gun \u201cfacilitates the offense by providing a means of protection or intimidation\u201d (citation and alterations omitted)). Thus, the evidence can support the conclusion that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the pistol held the \u201cpotential of facilitating\u201d the drug offense. <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">For these reasons, we conclude that a reasonable factfinder could determine that the evidence establishes, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Garringer carried a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. We therefore affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>district court\u2019s denial of Garringer\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
