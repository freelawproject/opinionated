The order or regulation in its entirety is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Although the United States was not made a defendant in the action, the United States Attorney filed a motion to dismiss which recited: \u201cThe defendant, United States of America, by and through the undersigned, moves the court to dismiss the within action,\u201d etc. The ground for the motion was that the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter and that the complaint failed to state a claim. The district court, treating the motion as a \u201cmotion of defendants to dismiss the complaint\u201d granted dismissal reciting that \u201cthis action is in effect one brought against the United States without its consent, and this court lacks jurisdiction thereof.\u201d The plaintiffs, as appellants here, then brought this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\"> We are of the opinion that the reasons given by the trial court for lack of jurisdiction are not sound. Title 5 U.S.C. Sec. 1009 expressly provides for review of administrative or agency action at the instance of \u201cany person suffering legal wrong\u201d because of such action \u201cor adversely affected or aggrieved by such action\u201d subject to certain exceptions stated in that section. Instead of reaching a conclusion that the action was \u201cin effect one brought against the United States without its consent\u201d, the court should have made inquiry whether the action was one authorized by the section referred to above. If so, the necessary consent of the United States will be found to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seeks to bring them within the purview of Sec. 1009 of the Administrative Procedure Act, supra. It alleges that plaintiffs have been adversely affected or aggrieved by the action of the Veterans Administration in adopting and undertaking to enforce the regulation above mentioned; that as licensed physicians they have the right to practice medicine outside and independent of the Veterans Administration Hospital during their spare time and with non-veteran patients, and that to deny them this right would constitute a deprivation of their liberty and property without due process of law; that the regulation in question deprives them of the equal protection of the law by imposing on them unreasonable and arbitrary restrictions, and that the regulation is arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">The complaint further alleges that the regulation here sought to be enforced against the plaintiffs adversely affects them and aggrieves them in that their salaries, which they allege were fixed by the administrator pursuant to authority granted by Title 38 Sec. 4108 U.S.C., are so low that the plaintiffs, many of whom are married and have families, are unable to support themselves and their families under minimum standards of living and therefore, in order to supplement their salaries, they are compelled to engage in medical practice outside of the hospital, a practice which is referred to as \u201cmoonlighting\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>In order to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the administrative regulation here under attack is subject to court review under the Administrative Procedure Act, or otherwise, or whether, in case it is so reviewable, the regulation is of such nature and substance as to permit a court to set it aside or modify it, it is necessary to examine the various statutes relating to powers of the administrator and the rights of the persons employed in the capacity in which these appellants claim to operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The applicable statutes to which we must now refer are a veritable patchwork of enactments. Sec. 4104 Title 38 U.S.C., dealing with the Veterans Administration and its department of medicine and surgery, provides for appointment by the administrator of physicians, dentists and nurses in such number as he may find necessary for the medical care of veterans. Section 4105 describes the qualifications of such appointees in the language previously mentioned. (See footnote 2, supra.) Section 4106 provides that initial appointments after the establishment of necessary qualifications shall be for a probationary period of three years. Section 4106 also provides for subsequent promotions of such physicians. Section 4107 provides for various grades and pay scales for each. (The physicians\u2019 schedule, as amended in 1965, provides for pay ranging from a minimum of $8,961 to a maximum of $25,043 per year.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Subchapter I of Chapter 18 Title 5 U.S.C., relating to employees of the executive branch of the government, provides that subject to certain exceptions specified in Sec. 902 Title 5, all civil officers and employees under the executive branch of the government shall be governed by the provisions of subchapter II and III (Secs. 911 to 922 Title 5). That provides that all such officers and employees shall be compensated for all hours of employment in excess of 40 hours in any administrative work week. It specifies the rates of overtime pay. Sec. 944 of Title 5, which applies also to such employees, provides that they shall have a basic administrative work week of 40 hours. Section 902 Title 5 lists the types of employees who are not covered by those provisions of the sections last mentioned and listed among those persons are \u201cstudent nurses medical or dental interns, residents-in-training, student dieticians, student physical therapists, and student occupational therapists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Section 902 indicates that those exempted from coverage are in student or training status. So far as the complaint here shows none of the appellants has that status. In fact, the listing of persons in student or training status as exempt from the coverage previously mentioned, would indicate that an employed physician no longer in training or student status would, so far as these sections are concerned, come within the coverage of subchapters II and III mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">The important statute here is Section 4108 Title 38 U.S.C., which provides as follows: \u201cNotwithstanding any law, Executive order, or regulation, the Administrator shall prescribe by regulation the hours and conditions of employment and leaves of absence of physicians, dentists, and nurses.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>It is obvious that the question here is whether in view of the provisions of this section, the contested administrative regulation is subject to judicial review. When we turn to the provisions of Sec. 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (Title 5 U.S.C. Sec. 1009), we find language not easy to apply in a case of this character. Thus in subdivision (c) of that section, it is provided that \u201cEvery agency action made reviewable by statute and every final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in any court shall be subject to judicial review.\u201d Subdivision (e) of that section provides that the reviewing court in addition to deciding relevant questions of law, interpreting statutory provisions, and determining the meaning of agency action, may hold unlawful and set aside agency action found to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">A reading of the whole section in the light of its legislative history,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would indicate that the section contemplated that generally speaking agency action would be subject to judicial review. It has been said that the more recent decisions of the Supreme Court are consistent with the idea that there is \u201ca presumption of reviewability that may be rebutted by affirmative indication of legislative intent in favor of unreviewability, or by some special reason for unreviewability growing out of the subject matter or the circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">On the other hand, it is important to note that the section of the Administrative Procedure Act, here referred to, begins with an exception listing circumstances which prevent judicial review. This language is as follows: \u201cExcept so far as (1) statutes preclude judicial review or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion * * * \u201d, meaning that in such cases judicial review may not be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">We have concluded that it is unnecessary for the purposes of our decision in this case to determine whether the regulation here involved and the action of the Administrator with respect thereto is subject to judicial review or whether it is action \u201ccommitted to agency discretion\u201d within the meaning of the excepting language just quoted. Assuming for the purposes of this case that the action of the Administrator in adopting the regulation is subject to judicial review, we must note that in such cases of judicial review there are strict limitations upon the power of the reviewing court to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. Of course in such a review it is a proper function of the reviewing court to ascertain whether the agency has exceeded its statutory powers or has complied with certain legal requirements. But where the agency has acted within the scope of its delegated authority, the power of a court to upset the decision of the administrative body is very limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">This is true whether the court be reviewing what may be called an administrative adjudication or whether it is reviewing the action of the agency in adopting rules or regulations. The leading case in point is Gray v. Powell, 314 U.S. 402, 411, 62 S.Ct. 326, 332, 86 L.Ed. 301, where the Court said: \u201cIn a matter left specifically by Congress to the determination of an administrative body * * * the function of review placed upon the courts * * * is fully performed when they determine that there has been a fair hearing, with notice and an opportunity to present the circumstances and arguments to the decisive body, and an application of the statute in a just and reasoned manner.\u201d This and other cases to the same effect are cited with quotations in Southwestern Electric Power Co. v. Federal Power Com\u2019n, 5 Cir., 304 F.2d 29, (cert. denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Alabama Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 371 U.S. 924, 83 S.Ct. 292, 9 L.Ed.2d 232, particularly in the text and footnotes at page 42. In that case, as here, the administrative agency was adopting a rule representing a certain administrative policy. The court quoting from American Power &amp; Light Co. v. S.E.C., 329 U.S. 90, 112, 67 S.Ct. 133, 91 L.Ed. 103, held that \u201cthe relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence.\u201d When the review relates to the action of the agency in making a rule or regulation Professor Davis has noted that \u201cThe Supreme Court has consistently held that judicial judgment should not be substituted for administrative judgment on questions within the agency\u2019s statutory power of rule making.\u201d Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, Vol. 4 \u00a7 3010.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">It is plain in this case that \u00a7 4108, supra, granted to the Administrator the general power to prescribe by regulation the hours and conditions of employment and leaves of absence of physicians. The policy inherent in this authorization is of course to secure the greatest possible efficiency and care in looking after the inmates of veterans hospitals. It is unnecessary to adduce any evidence to disclose what are necessarily the facts in respect to the operation of such hospitals. These facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">(1) The hospitals necessarily contain a great number of patients, veterans who are entitled by law to hospital care and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">(2) Those patients necessarily require care around the clock and, as in all hospitals, emergencies are likely to arise at midnight as well as at noon.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">(3) If a doctor resident is away at some other hospital in the midst of performing an appendectomy upon a private patient, he is not available for immediate attention to a critical case in the veterans hospital. Whether these doctors, performing their residencies\u2019 services in the veterans hospitals, ought to be subject to instant call and immediate service, is a question of policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">Now, if we were to remand this case with directions to entertain the application for review of the Administrator\u2019s action in adopting this regulation, there is only one thing which the district court could decide and that would be that in adopting this regulation there was a rational basis for the conclusions of the Administrator and warrant in the record for his judgment. Under no conceivable circumstance could the district court on such a remand be justified, no matter how much the court disagreed with the Administrator, in setting aside or nullifying the Administrator\u2019s policy decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">Accordingly we find no occasion for remanding the cause with directions to review the Administrator\u2019s action in prescribing this regulation. For this reason, though it differs from that assigned by the district court, the action must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-25\">. The complaint asserts that this is a class action on behalf of the named plaintiffs and all resident physicians at the Long Beach Veterans Hospital, Long Beach, California,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-4\">.

The complaint also attacked a regulation of the Administrator, described as Sec. 204.06, reading as follows : \u201cAll testimony given during an investigation conducted by the Investigation Service is for the use of the Administrator and his staff, except as provided in paragraphs 205.02f and 205.04 and will not be disclosed to unauthorized persons within or without the Veterans Administration. All employees will refrain from discussing matters under investigation during the investigation or after its completion.\u201d There is no allegation that this regulation has been, or is about to be enforced against these plaintiffs. Therefore they are not shown to have standing to attack it, and we therefore do not discuss it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b595-13\">. The salary scales set forth in the complaint, the truth of which we are obliged to accept for purposes of this appeal, would appear to be low for a graduate physician, ranging from $4325 to $7715 per annum. We have some difficulty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>however, in reconciling the compensation which appellants allege they are receiving with the statutory provisions which fix the salary for physicians employed by the Veterans Administration. Section 4107 Title 38 U.S.C. lists much higher grades and rates of compensation. An amendment of that section, approved July 18, 1966, provides for even higher pay schedules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">. Were the matter presented here it might be a nice question whether that section authorized the administrator to fix the salary scales of physicians employed as resident physicians such as these appellants. The question is: does \u201cconditions of employment\u201d include \u201csalary scale\u201d? That question is not presented here as the complaint alleges that the defendant Administrator fixed the alleged salary scale \u201cpursuant to authority granted by Sec. 4108 of Title 38 U.S.C.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b597-11\">.
